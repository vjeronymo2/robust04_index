			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Markets: Roll over Tiny, sell-offs and superstores - London Suddenly, things change. Several eras that had helped define British business life over many years came to an end this week: government enthusiasm for privatisation, the growth of out-of-town supermarkets and Tiny Rowland's reign at Lonrho. Selling off the Post Office always threatened to be a privatisation too far for the Conservatives. So it proved for a handful of their backbench MPs, who forced the government to abandon what would have been the centrepiece of its forthcoming legislative programme. One reason for the recent backlash against privatisation has been the behaviour of the water companies since they were sold off. The government was anxious to ensure that the industry would have funds to make long overdue investment in infrastructure, so the companies were offered a generous regulatory regime. The water companies have responded by pushing up charges and raising - at an even faster rate - the level of boardroom remuneration. Thames Water kicked off the sector's interim reporting season with an 11 per cent dividend increase - above market expectations. This boosted the share prices of most of the water companies, but the National Consumer Council said the dividend increase just confirmed its view that the original price controls had allowed companies and shareholders to benefit more than consumers. Sir Robert Clarke, chairman of Thames, warned investors not to expect such a generous dividend under the new pricing regime, which starts in April. MPs were also to the fore in warning that further construction of out-of-town shopping centres and superstores should be restricted. Next day J Sainsbury, the UK's largest grocery retailer, confirmed that tougher government planning restrictions were starting to bite, and said it expected to open only 12 new supermarkets next year compared with plans for 20. The group won only one out of nine planning appeals this year, and did not foresee a reversal of this in the near future. Sainsbury increased its interim pre-tax profits by 6.5 per cent. However, it said like-for-like sales, excluding new space, increased only 1 per cent, with price deflation of 0.6 per cent. The fall in prices was partly a result of Sainsbury's 'Essentials' price-cutting campaign, which started a year ago. David Sainsbury, chairman, said he believed the campaign had neutralised the threat from low-priced discount competitors, and profit margins could now be held. The big retailers have certainly fought back hard against their discount rivals. Kwik Save consolidated its position as Britain's leading discount grocer through buying 117 Shoprite stores in Scotland and northern England for Pounds 45m. This is the first significant withdrawal among the discount chains that expanded rapidly in the UK during in the early 1990s. Shoprite's shares were the best performers in the food retailing sector last year, but plunged after the group expanded too quickly paying too much for sometimes substandard sites. The departure of Rowland after 33 years at the head of the international trading conglomerate Lonrho had been often predicted. So often, in fact, that the initial reaction in the City was to doubt whether the German pretender Dieter Bock really had ousted his fellow joint executive. It does appear that the 76-year-old swashbuckler is on the way out, but no-one who has followed his extraordinary career would assume we have have heard the last from Tiny. Such fin de siecle musings proved diverting in an equity market which continues to suffer low turnover, high volatility and sporadic alarms from currency and bond markets. The week's main event was the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report which said the UK's inflation outlook had improved. Its forecast of underlying inflation (which excludes mortgage interest payments) in mid-1996 has been reduced to 2.5 per cent, from around 3 per cent in its last forecast. However, the bank also implied that interest rates would probably need to rise over the coming months to keep inflation on target. Relief on Tuesday that an immediate interest rate rise did not appear to be on the cards helped turn around an early 20-point fall in the FT-SE 100, which had been provoked by the adverse reaction of the dollar and global bond markets to figures showing the highest level of US business activity for seven years. The fall of the dollar to a postwar low against the yen on Wednesday provoked strong intervention by the US Federal Reserve. British bonds responded favourably to the better performance by US bonds and the dollar, and this bolstered London equities. Traders finished the week in uncertain mood. There is some concern that the next rise in interest rates will be dictated not by domestic inflation concerns, but in response to an increase in US rates to support the dollar. That will not happen before Tuesday's US mid-term elections, but the City spots a window of opportunity for the chancellor to push up rates between then and his November 29 Budget. The Treasury's six-man panel of independent economic forecasters advised the chancellor against an immediate rise in interest rates. Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University said no one should be misled by the large rises in commodity prices over the past year. He said most of the increase was a necessary correction to their huge past relative price declines. A milestone week ended with news that two investment banks are planning on moving staff into Canary Wharf, which would reduce the Pounds 1.5bn Dockland complex's unoccupied space to less than 1m sq ft out of a total of 4.5m sq ft. Canary Wharf no longer a white elephant? Can one rely on nothing these days?</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Pictures from the past - Clive Fewins meets a man who has made a careful living from restoring people's memories THE TROUBLE with photographs is that they do not last. Pull out your glossy wedding portfolio 50 years on and you might well find faded and discoloured sheets to dampen your golden wedding. This is one of the reasons for the trend back to black and white photography. 'Because they are composed of minute fragments of silver you can expect black and white photographs to last much longer than colour prints, which are based on impermanent dyes,' said Gerry Clarke. Clarke restores black-and-white photographs - dating back as far as the 1850s. At his workshop overlooking open fields near the Oxfordshire village of Kingham, Clarke is hard-pressed to cope with the flood of pictures that arrive from all over Britain, the US and Australia. 'For some reason a chap who runs a fish and chip shop in San Francisco keeps sending me work, and the other day I even had a visitor from Trinidad who had heard of me and managed to penetrate my rural isolation,' he said. 'It always amazes me the distances people travel to bring their old photographs to me.' Many British customers, reluctant to commit their valued family archives to the post, visit and inspect Clarke and his enterprise before becoming customers. Others - including several elderly ladies in Devon and north Wales - are happy to keep posting their family archival shots, half a dozen at a time. A woman from Dawlish, who always adds her age ('ninety-three-and-a-half') to her signature, has spent several hundred pounds over the past two years. 'With photographs anything up to 140 years old I am often dealing with items of great sentimental value that people only grudgingly leave in my care,' Clarke said. 'I get an inevitable finger-wagging lecture from virtually everyone that comes in here to see me. But I am always conscious that we are reckoned to have only 10 per cent of the photographs taken in Victoria's reign left in this country and I realise how valuable as historical documents the majority of the prints I handle will be in 100 years.' Clarke works by the meticulous use of a De Vere 504 enlarger with a copy back as a rostrum camera. Using optical filters and a variety of techniques he has perfected over nearly 40 years he is able to restore faded images, eliminate stains and discolouration and remove evidence of creasing and tearing so that the restored prints are generally of a much higher quality than the originals he works from. He is reluctant to replace missing images in sections of a print. 'Where there is a detail missing I leave it to the imagination. If it is a group I could always fill in a face, but I won't,' he said. Clarke is a one-man band. When he started Photocare at 52, five-and-a-half years ago, one of his aims was to keep turnover below the minimum VAT level to avoid additional administration. He is finding that increasingly difficult. 'My attitude was that I wasn't necessarily chasing the last buck all the time, and I certainly wasn't into the horrors of VAT returns,' he said. Having enjoyed 20 comfortable years in the building trade and with his three children now grown up, Clarke decided to concentrate on what he really enjoyed doing and to turn his hobby into a living. He invested Pounds 10,000 of his savings, did a little of advertising in consumer magazines, and waited for customers. 'I was not desperately worried if the business started slowly. My wife was working and I knew I could count on some orders from people I had done work for when I restored photographs as a hobby,' he said. 'But nevertheless I had locked up a lot of my savings, so it was important that the venture was a success.' He need not have worried. The word spread quickly and Clarke soon found he had a healthy portfolio of large customers such as military units and local authority and company archivists. Although the basic price is low - Pounds 4.85 to photograph an original print and supply a 5in x 4in negative - many of the customers' orders are large. This and repeat orders means that the average price of a job is a healthy Pounds 100 or so. This pleases Clarke, as Photocare is very much a value-added business. He estimates that materials comprise just under 10 per cent of turnover. As his only large overhead is his rent of Pounds 600 a quarter he can justifiably claim that his profitability as a percentage of turnover is probably as high as in any business. 'As it is a craft trade, in which I use my hands I am unlikely to make vast profits. However, it is a very satisfying means of making a living.' If there are dark clouds they concern the problems of success. There really is too much work for one. 'I know that if I was actively considering growth I would easily be able to build up the institutional side of the business. They say nostalgia is the thing of the future, and Photocare has now grown to a point where it has a value, and so I must push forward. 'Employing someone else will inevitably take me over the VAT limit and we shall really be in business. It must happen - especially as there seems to be a dearth of people offering this kind of service. 'One possibility is for my teacher brother, who is a little younger, to join me. We could then possibly add a library of old photographs to our services. I already have a collection of nearly 5,000 and people keep offering them to me. Whatever happens I must do something - even if only to make sure I get back to the golf course when I reach 65]' Photocare. The Langston Priory Workshops, Kingham, Oxfordshire OX7 6UP.</p>

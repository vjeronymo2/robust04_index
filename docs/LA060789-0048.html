			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Senate put itself on a collision course with the House as it neared  completion of a $3.3-billion emergency spending bill that leaves out $822  million in anti-drug money the House had earlier approved. The Senate failed to  finish work on the spending measure but was expected to pass the "dire  emergency" fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill today. The bill would then go  to a House-Senate conference committee, where lawmakers from both chambers  would try to work out differences with the $3.7-billion version passed by the  House late last month. The House plan includes money for increased drug  enforcement, hiring more prosecutors, building more prisons and adding more  education programs. Inclusion of the anti-drug funds is opposed by the White  House.  </P></p>

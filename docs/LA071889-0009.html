			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Senate Ethics Committee was formally asked to investigate Sen. Alfonse M.  D'Amato (R-N.Y.) for a "pattern of exploiting" his office to benefit campaign  contributors and friends. The request for an investigation was made by Mark  Green, a Democrat, who was decisively beaten by D'Amato in the 1986 senatorial  election. Green said his complaint is based on news stories. In a statement,  D'Amato said the request is "a blatant campaign document." Under Senate  regulations, anyone can file a complaint with the ethics panel, which then  decides whether it warrants investigation.  </P></p>

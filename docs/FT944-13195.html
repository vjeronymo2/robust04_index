			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Price Waterhouse settles over Carrian Price Waterhouse Hong Kong announced yesterday it had reached an out-of-court settlement with the liquidator of Carrian Investment, the conglomerate placed in liquidation in October 1983 with debts of HKDollars 10bn (Pounds 792.7m). The accountancy firm was accused of professional negligence in failing to expose fraud within the group and was being sued for an estimated HKDollars 2bn. The case, brought by liquidator Ernst &amp; Young Hong Kong, had been expected to last for at least nine months. Both sides have agreed that financial details of the out-of-court settlement should remain confidential. In a joint statement the two sides said: 'In agreeing the settlement Price Waterhouse denies any liability. However, in cases of this complexity it is often in the interests of both parties to avoid the costs of protracted litigation.' The collapse of Carrian, one of Hong Kong's most prominent companies, was the subject of a HKDollars 100m investigation by the Hong Kong government.</p>

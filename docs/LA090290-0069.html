			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADBURY MIFFED, PLANS OWN TALLY  </P> <P> Officials in this tiny upscale city are furious with the results of the 1990  U.S. Census, and plan to do their own nose-counting to prove that they have at  least 100 more residents than the 816 logged by census takers.  </P> <P> "Trust me, I've been here 18 years and I know everyone who's died and who's  been born, and our population has not gone down," said an irate City Manager  Dolly Vollaire.  </P> <P> Vollaire said she will send her staff of three on a counting mission this week  to disprove the census results, which show Bradbury slipping from 846 to 816  residents over the last 10 years.  </P> <P> A discrepancy of 30 residents may not seem like much to most folks, but to  Bradbury, an upscale residential enclave without the sales-tax generating  commercial developments of most cities, each additional resident translates  into extra federal and state money.  </P> <P> "Obviously they did not go up the driveways of some of those estates," she  huffed. "When they're building 14,000-square-foot homes, someone's got to be  living in them." DENISE HAMILTON  </P></p>

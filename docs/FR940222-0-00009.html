This action requires inspecting the wing front spar lower cap (spar cap) for interference, fretting, or corrosion between the firewall flange and spar cap flange at Wing Station (WS) 96, and clearing any interference, repairing any fretting or corrosion damage, and replacing any cracked spar cap. Reports of two of the affected airplanes have cracked spar caps at WS 96 prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the wing structure caused by a cracked spar cap at WS 96. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Effective April 12, 1994.

The action proposed to require inspecting the spar cap for interference, fretting, or corrosion between the firewall flange and spar cap flange at WS 96, and clearing any interference, repairing any fretting or corrosion damage, and replacing any cracked spar cap. The proposed inspection and repair, if applicable, would be accomplished in accordance with Twin Commander SB No. 212, dated November 3, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the nine comments received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seven commenters concur with the proposal as written. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter, the Civil Aviation Authority of Australia (CAA), states that the proposal should require an eddy current inspection of the spar cap. The CAA questions whether fretting and corrosion are the sole contributors to fatigue damage to WS 96, or if these merely aggravate what is already a fatigue-sensitive location. The CAA goes on to state that, if a crack can start from a corrosion pit as small as 0.006 inches (as happened on a Swedish airplane), then there is a good chance that even a clean airplane will crack over time. Also, the CAA states that, if a fatigue crack has started at the base of a corrosion pit, the blending of the corrosion will smear over the crack and conceal it from the dye penetrant inspection (which is called for in the SB), and that an eddy current inspection is the only method for detection of this crack. The FAA does not concur. The proposal relates to fretting that may occur because interference between a firewall stiffener and the forward flange of the lower spar cap. It would require action for fatigue cracks found as a result of this interference and fretting. Fretting does have a synergistic relationship with corrosion and fatigue, and its existence greatly accelerates fatigue crack growth. The FAA has received no reports of fatigue cracks in the affected area that were not a direct result of fretting. Also, the spar cap at WS 96 is extremely difficult to inspect using eddy current methods because of other structures in the area interfering with placement of the eddy current probe. Dye penetrant inspections are used extensively in the aviation industry and have proved very reliable in detecting cracks. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

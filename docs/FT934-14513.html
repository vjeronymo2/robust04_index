			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Pirate BSkyB cards get all-clear for radio adverts SATELLITE Decoder Systems, the company selling unauthorised decoders for Sky Television subscription channels has booked a month-long advertising campaign on commercial radio. The campaign follows advice from Mr Geoff Holland, Cheshire's principal trading standards officer, that it does not appear to be illegal to advertise unauthorised decoders in the UK. Broadcasting legislation makes it a criminal offence to manufacture, hire, distribute or use the pirate decoders - but not apparently to advertise. Mr David Lyons of Satellite Decoder Systems said yesterday he intended to advertise his card, which unlocks all the Sky subscription channels, and continue to send out information sheets. All mail received would be sent unopened to his office in the Irish hamlet of Ballyegan in Co Offaly, and cards would be posted from Ireland. There is no specific law in Ireland, or in most European Community countries, outlawing pirate television decoders. Mr Lyons has paid for four 30-second advertising slots a day for a month on Marcher Coast FM and Marcher Gold - commercial radio services covering the North Wales coast and Wrexham and Deeside. Ms Sue Whittle, head of sales at the broadcaster, said yesterday the stations had been assured by trading standards authorities that it would not be illegal to advertise such a product. But she emphasised that she would not clear the advertisements until she had heard what they said. If the Marcher stations do broadcast the advertisements it could open the way for more extensive advertising of the unauthorised cards which seem to be coming to Ireland from Germany. Pearson, owner of the FT, has a significant stake in British Sky Broadcasting, the company that operates Sky.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 GROUPS AID PUSH FOR MALIBU INCORPORATION  </P> <P> In its battle to become a city, Malibu found new allies this week.  </P> <P> Two municipal government organizations -- the Los Angeles Division of the  League of California Cities and the Contract Cities Assn. -- started lobbying  to speed up cityhood for the famed beach community.  </P> <P> The league sent a letter to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors urging  immediate incorporation of Malibu, and League President Hal Croyts urged the 84  member cities to pass their own council resolutions supporting Malibu.  </P> <P> Malibu residents voted overwhelmingly in June to incorporate, but the Board of  Supervisors, which has resisted the cityhood effort for years, invoked a novel  legal interpretation to postpone the date of incorporation until next March.  Last month, an appellate judge ruled that the county had sufficient legal  grounds for the delay.  </P> <P> "It is unfair to the residents and their newly elected representatives to delay  implementation (of cityhood)," said the league's letter, which was signed by  Croyts, a Lomita city councilman. "What's at stake here is the right of the  people to govern themselves. The people of Malibu made a decision to  incorporate and the county of Los Angeles shouldn't interfere with it."  </P> <P> The 70-member Contract Cities Assn. was also preparing a letter to the board  this week, according to Sam Olivito Jr., executive director of the statewide  group. "We're firmly in support of a community's effort to self-governing," he  said. "We've been watching this situation all along, and we decided to take  action after the July 18 court ruling delaying cityhood until next year."  </P> <P> The two letters coincide with a mail campaign launched Tuesday in Malibu to get  a state law passed to let the area incorporate now. The council-elect urged  residents to flood Sacramento legislators with letters in support of a bill by  state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) that could go to the Assembly floor as  early as today and to the Senate next week.  </P> <P> The bill would allow Malibu to incorporate next January instead of in March. An  emergency clause approved by the Senate Rules Committee Tuesday would let the  community incorporate immediately, but that provision needs a two-thirds vote  from both houses for passage.  </P> <P> The legislative session ends Aug. 30, "so we haven't much time," said Malibu  lobbyist Anthony Gonsalves. "But we've got equity on our side."  </P></p>

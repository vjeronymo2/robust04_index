			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / People: Anderson. Bank of England to Bank of Egypt One of the perks of working for The Bank of England is that its former executives tend to get snapped up by foreign banks keen to make the right impression on the authorities. In the 1970s, before foreign exchange controls were abolished, there was a heavy trade in retired Bank of England officials who knew their way around the forex markets. Nowadays, former members of the Bank's supervisory staff seem most in demand. The latest ex-Bank of England official to resurface in the Square Mile is John Anderson, 56, a former deputy head of banking supervision. He has joined the board of the newly formed National Bank of Egypt International and has been given the job of chairing its audit committee whose job is to make sure that the bank's executives don't go off the rails. The National Bank of Egypt is the biggest of Egypt's state-owned banks and has operated in London for more than a decade. However, it has set up National Bank of Egypt International to take advantage of the European Commission's second banking directive which allows UK-authorised banks to do business in an EC country without the need to get the permission of the supervisor in that other country. Nabil Ibrahim, a former National Bank of Egypt chairman, has been appointed chairman of the new London bank, and other board members include Mahmoud Abdel Aziz, chairman of the National Bank of Egypt, Kazem Barakat, the Egyptian bank's senior man in London, and John Harding, the general manager who joined from Turkey's Akbank last July.</p>

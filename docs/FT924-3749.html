			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Markets: Watching the Weinstock indicator - London Markets THREE THINGS became clear this week. The US economy is now clearly recovering. The German economy is unambiguously in recession. And the UK economy is - finally - off the bottom. Each of these developments has important implications for the London markets. The recovery in the US, indicated by a steady flow of economic statistics over the past week, tells us that fears of a world depression are misplaced, since you can't have such a party if the Americans wwill not come. Just as important, fears that the huge mountain of US debt would indefinitely muffle the impact of lower interest rates can now be seen as over-pessimistic - a conclusion that can probably be applied to the UK as well. If you cut interest rates enough, for long enough, the economy will eventually recover. But have Britain's interest rate cuts gone far enough? Real interest rates in the UK, after all, are still positive. Base rates are three percentage points higher than the inflation rate; in the US, it took real interest rates of below 1 per cent for the best part of 1992 to produce these latest signs of economic health. That is where Germany comes in. Thursday's economic statistics - a 1 1/2 per cent fall in west German gnp in the third quarter, and the forecast of a 3 per cent drop in industrial output next year - make it clear that the Bundesbank will soon have no choice but to cut short-term interest rates. A three per cent pay deal for the next 18 months, agreed by the steel workers' union late on Wednesday, will speed the decision, allowing British interest rates to fall further. The debate inside the UK government was summed up by one fund manager this week: 'The Treasury experts think there is going to be a sufficiently large boost to the economy from devaluation and the cuts in interest rates we've seen already. But the man in the street does not see it yet, and the politicians are listening to the man in the street - especially if he's a back-bencher.' That means, he thinks, that the one-point cut in interest rates that might be prudent could well turn into a two-point cut before the man in the street has been fully assuaged. Cheaper money in the UK will nourish the hesitant upturn now just getting under way. Green shoots of recovery are examined elsewhere in this issue of the FT; the chart shows one snapshot, the trend of car sales. Just as significant an indicator, said one FT-SE company chairman this week, was the tone of the statement that accompanied GEC's interim results on Wednesday: if Arnold Weinstock, GEC's deeply cautious boss, is talking so positively of growth and stimulus, perhaps the worst is really over. This is the background against which the FT-SE 100 index rose to within six points of the 2,800 level on Tuesday, closing the day at a new high of 2,792.0. By Friday, there had been some weakening, and the FT-SE 100 closed at 2,759.4, down 0.7 points on the week. The performance of these big, internationally-oriented blue-chip stocks is not necessarily representative of the market as a whole, however: the FT-Actuaries All-Share index, which contains 651 stocks, is still 1 per cent or so below its high of 1326.36, reached in May this year. You can see the pattern clearly in the daily movements of the FT-SE Mid 250, the 250 shares that lie just below the FT-SE 100 index in size. Between Monday's open and Tuesday's close, the FT-SE 100 rose by just over 30 points; but the Mid 250 rose only half as much. That leaves the optimists to think that, although the UK market is no longer looking particularly cheap on most measures of value, there is still scope for more unwinding of the pessimism that dominated much of the year. That sentiment may already have vanished as far as blue-chip companies are concerned; but firm confirmation of economic growth may breathe a little more life into the second-tier stocks. After all, even among big companies there is still plenty of bad news around. This week saw discouraging results from Hanson, Grand Metropolitan and Bass, and receivership for Rosehaugh, the property developer. There is scope, in the optimists' view, for a further run-up in share prices as company chairmen finally start to become more cheerful. As long as the market doesn't come a cropper on next year's government deficit, say the pessimists. The need for the government to borrow Pounds 50bn or so in the next financial year will test the limits of the institutions' cashflow; gilt yields will consequently stay high even if short-term interest rates stay low. That will hold down the equity market, since it will make gilt yields more attractive than those on shares. Heavy government borrowing, and perhaps a new spate of rights issues, will soak up cash that might otherwise have gone into equities. Fund managers have little money in reserve: institutional liquidity in the third quarter was down to 3 per cent, compared with a long-term average of 5 per cent and a figure of 9 per cent a few years ago. This debate is leading to estimates for the FT-SE in the early part of next year that range from 2,700 - implying that the market is now heading down - to 3,250, a rise of nearly a fifth. The merits of individual shares play little part in this elaborate calculus, something that must be giving Alan Sugar, the chief executive of Amstrad, food for thought this weekend. Since September 23, when Sugar first mentioned the price he would be prepared to pay for the shares in Amstrad that he did not already own - 30p - the FT-SE has risen 7 per cent. Perhaps not surprisingly, the early results of the shareholders' ballot indicate that Sugar is having difficulty in getting the votes he needs to achieve the deal. He is hoping for a late flood of support.</p>

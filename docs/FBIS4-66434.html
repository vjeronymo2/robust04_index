			<p>Engine    [.sub]x[/]  <F P=102> 94FE0326A Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 26 Nov 93 p  8 - - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0326A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article with no byline] </F>   [Text] The Mechanical Engineering Laboratory (MEL;  director: Mr. Kenichi Matsuno) of the Agency of Industrial  Science and Technology, has devised a new diesel engine capable  of simultaneously reducing the emissions of pollution-causing  NO[.sub]x[/] (nitrogen oxides) and particulate (black smoke).  The engine, called a ``pre-combustion-chamber bottom-removable  diesel engine,'' is an improved version of the pre-combustion-  chamber injection engine that is mounted on diesel passenger  cars. Most studies concerning minimum-pollution engines have  attempted to decrease only one of the two pollutants mentioned  above. In contrast, MEL's new engine is said to be able to  reduce the emission of both pollutants.    Combustion in a diesel engine takes place in two different  ways: one involves direct injection, which is used for larger  vehicles, and the other involves pre-combustion-chamber  injection, which is used for passenger cars. With the former,  fuel (light oil) is directly injected into the combustion  chambers from the connecting ports located at the cylinder  heads; the combustion moves the pistons.    On the other hand, in the pre-combustion-chamber mode, a  small chamber, called the pre-combustion chamber, is created  outside the cylinder head, and fuel is first injected into this  chamber to undergo ``partial combustion'' before being ejected  into the main combustion chamber. Regardless of the combustion  mode, black smoke is generated, although a smaller amount of  NO[.sub]x[/] is generated by the pre-combustion-chamber mode  than by the direct injection mode, because the mixing of fuel  and air is more uniform.    The new combustion method uses the pre-combustion-chamber  mode, except that a protrusion of about the same size as the  connecting port between the main and pre-combustion chambers is  installed on the top of the piston. When the piston is raised,  the connecting port is closed, and vice versa. Thus, fuel  injection can be controlled both over and below the piston.    Actually, when the piston is raised, there is a small gap  left between the piston's protrusion and the connecting port; a  small amount of the partially burnt fuel can be ejected into the  main combustion chamber through the gap.    This ``leakage'' alleviates the sudden heat generation  caused  by the combustion in the pre-combustion chamber (when the piston  is raised), suppressing the formation of NO[.sub]x[/]. On the  other hand, the combustion in the main combustion chamber (when  the piston is lowered) becomes more efficient to re-burn the  black smoke formed in the pre-combustion chamber to depletion.    As the development project is still under way at MEL, Chief  Researcher Akira Murakami, of MEL's Energy Department, says  this: ``Our targets are the reduction of NO[.sub]x[/] to  one-third, and black smoke to approximately one-half that of the  direct-injection mode.''</p>

He was speaking at a press conference held shortly after the  government decided to abolish the 3 percent consumption tax and  adopt a 7 percent "national welfare tax" on goods and services  in April 1997 that will effectively raise the rate of the  current consumption tax.    Fujii said increased revenues from the new tax rate of over  8  trillion yen annually will be necessary from now on, citing 800  billion yen in spending on social welfare, 1.3 trillion yen in  government goods purchases and 1.4 trillion yen in repayment of  debt principle.    Under a simple calculation, revenues from the new tax will  exceed the reduced revenues from the tax cuts by some 2 trillion  yen.    Noting that 10 years will be needed to repay bonds worth 18  trillion yen to be issued to cover the tax cuts over three  years, Fujii said the decision was a "tough choice" for the  ministry but that the government's financial position would  continue to be "tough."    On income tax cuts worth 5.3 trillion yen, Fujii said the  proportion of national income tax and local residential tax cuts  would be "roughly 7 to 3."    Concerning the three-year period before implementation, he  said the government wants its stimulus package to be announced  Thursday evening to help the economy on a "full-fledge recovery  track in fiscal 1994 and a stable growth phase in fiscal 1995,"  and said the third year would be to monitor growth.    Asked about the use of revenues from the new tax, Fujii said  the specifics have yet to be decided but would include pensions  and improvement of the social infrastructure linked to welfare.    He vowed to do his utmost to win public support for the tax  reform plan but declined to comment on the possibility of  further tax hikes.    Given the decision, the tax commission, an advisory panel to  the prime minister, is expected to compile its fiscal 1994 tax  reform report next Tuesday, calling for widening the  middle-income bracket to ease its tax burdens.</p>

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Cleaning up in business services: The challenges facing John Clark at BET MR John Clark has achieved a great deal in the 16 months since taking over as chief executive of BET, the UK's most diversified business services company. In spite of having to halve the dividend after a profits collapse last year, he has led the company from the emergency room where it was confined after a Pounds 1bn jaunt down the acquisition trail in the late 1980s. Crucially, last week he went a long way towards completing the rehabilitation of the balance sheet by redeeming Pounds 200m of auction market preferred stocks through a rights issue. But Mr Clark may have only completed the easy part. In one of the toughest recessions the UK has seen, BET faces the challenge of sorting out its five divisions and 110 operating companies. Even if this rehabilitation is successful - and Mr Clark must have been hoping for more help for his cyclical businesses from a little economic recovery - BET is in danger of being left behind by competitors like Hays Group, Christian Salvesen and Rentokil. While these more focused companies are pushing into higher growth areas for the future, Mr Clark's time will be consumed in a struggle to sort out the the legacy he inherited from his predecessor, Mr Nicholas Wills. 'I think the management is doing the right things to get improved returns from existing businesses but has BET got the kind of businesses to deliver long-term growth?' asks Mr Bob Carpenter, analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson. 'Every company is a prisoner of its circumstances and history.' According to Mr Ronnie Frost, chief executive of rival Hays, the City did not fully realise how deeply BET was in trouble when Mr Clark took over. 'He is doing a hell of a job in incredibly difficult circumstances,' he says. 'But he now has to put the businesses into controllable cores so he can tell a story that makes sense rather than just say: 'have business services group, will do anything'.' Up for grabs, Mr Clark says, is a business services market that should grow as recession forces more companies to contract out and is worth Pounds 40bn in the UK and Dollars 800bn (Pounds 420bn) in the US. But before BET can properly reposition itself for this market it has two problems to address. First of all there is the clutch of companies losing money and deeply exposed to the construction industry. Boulton &amp; Paul, the joinery business, lost money last year and the contract plant business has little to differentiate it from a multitude of other companies not able to rent out scaffold planks and poles. More fundamentally, many of BET's businesses, though cash generative, show little growth potential and are in mature markets with few barriers to entry. In distribution, for example, BET is mainly involved in transporting bulk chemicals and foodstuffs. Hays, on the other hand, has almost entirely moved beyond the simple movement of bulk products, winning dedicated delivery contracts for Waitrose, Tesco and Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries. Likewise with document handling, Hays has built up an extremely cash generative document storage, data delivery and overnight mail service in a growing market. By way of contrast, two of BET's strongest cash generators - its washroom towel business and textile rentals - are both under strong margin pressure from a plethora of 'me-too' competitors. BET's dire financial condition also forced it to dispose of promising businesses. Biffa, the waste management company, may have been sold for a high price to Severn Trent in 1991 and may have helped stave off insolvency. But it deprived BET of one of the few companies with exciting potential, according to Mr Paul Beaufrere, business services analyst at stockbrokers James Capel. In spite of the once widely-aired belief that business service companies were recession-proof, few companies have escaped. But a look at the better long-term prospects for BET's competitors in the sector provides a pointer to the troubles Mr Clark faces. Personnel services, for instance, has performed badly for Hays and is now the weakest of its three business legs. But when recovery arrives Hays' focus on recruiting accountants and other professionals, arguably gives it a more interesting long-term future. BET, on the other hand, is far more dependent on the placing of temporary and relatively unskilled staff which, however profitable when in rude health, is a far more competitive business. When looked at as a whole, both Hays and Salvesen are also better placed to handle the vagaries of business cycles; both have three core businesses groupings, one each in what can broadly be seen as growth, maturing and recovery phases. BET's near-halving of operating profits last year to Pounds 146.1m - before Pounds 90m of exceptional reorganisation costs - clearly shows that BET has none of this balance. Mr Clark recognises that refocusing BET must to a large extent follow the house-keeping in the group's existing businesses. With the balance sheet in better shape, there may be opportunities to make small bolt-on acquisitions, but only after the disposal programme is further advanced, he says. At its simplest, turning the group around in the short-term will involve even more cash generation than last year when debt was cut from Pounds 425m to Pounds 107m; Mr Clark hopes this will cut gearing to zero by year-end. And there will be even tighter cost controls and greater emphasis on enhancing financial returns. But cleaning up is going to be a painful process. What is more, the longer the recession continues, the slower the process will be, allowing BET's more balanced and better managed rivals to continue to wipe the floor.</p>

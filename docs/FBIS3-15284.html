			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 2 March 1994 broadcasts a report from the  "Details" program presented by Nikolay Svanidze, which deals  with the economy. He says the miners stopped their strike  yesterday. Tomorrow, at the Presidium of the Council of  Ministers, the Russian State Budget for the current year is to  be approved. Then it will be sent for ratification by the State  Duma. These two events are linked together. The miners are  waiting to see what the budget will do for them.    State Duma Deputy Yegor Gaydar is interviewed by Svanidze.  He speaks of the problem of non-payment of wages. He says that  the higher the non-payments, the greater the expectation that  the government will pay.    Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin says one should not make  promises one cannot keep, but promises that are now on a par  with obligations should be kept.    Gaydar says the workers are, after all, also suppliers --  suppliers of labor. They have fulfilled their obligations and  they should be paid. The management of the enterprises have not  fulfilled theirs. The miners are not people who are holding a  knife at the throat of the government to press for an increase  in pay. They are asking reasonable questions -- about the need  to investigate the effectiveness of the use of funds for  subsidizing the coal industry, they are asking to what extent  these funds are going to maintain the commercial structures  being set up in the corporations.    "Are they sitting in high-interest accounts and the deposits  of joint enterprises?" they are asking, Gaydar says. Svanidze  asks how much is being stolen, and Gaydar says much is being  stolen.    Shokhin says the government should explain what policy it is  pursuing and the limited resources of the budget should be  targetted very accurately. He says that if we provide enough  funds for the coal industry we should ensure continued work  without the stoppages we have had of late.    Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin, interviewed in an office,  says, leafing through a book: "Our proposals are very tough.  This document is the draft budget, which is to be examined by  the Government presidium tomorrow."    "We must finance ourselves from a relatively safe point of  view as regards inflation," Dubinin says. "We are convinced  that the pursuance of such a budget will enable us to lower the  inflation index to the level of, at any rate less that 10  percent a month at the end of the year."    Asked whether 3 or 5 is out of the question, Dubinin says  why  not, if we can collect more taxes than we have been counting on  -- we do not collect anything like 100 percent and America  collects 80 percent -- then we will be able to lower the budget  deficit and count on lowering inflation.    If we were using shock therapy we could reduce inflation in  two or three months, but it is a question of socioeconomic  choice. We are not prepared to try the shock option. Finally,  Dubinin says he can recommend the budget to the government.    In this "Details" program dealing with the economy, the  announcer Nikolay Svanidze, says: "Incidentally, about the  budget -- `Details' has information that the military budget,  which is being proposed, has been received at the Ministry of  Defense as being below par. Grachev has stated that in order to  stick to it he will have to dismiss about 400,000 servicemen.  He, Grachev, can take that step but does not vouch for the  consequences."</p>

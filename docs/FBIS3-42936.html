Zapevalov, correspondent  of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA in Bonn; place and date not given: "I  Believe in the Strength of Russian Democracy"]    [Text] Bonn--Hans-Dietrich Genscher (b. 1927) is the  "world champion" foreign minister. He spent 18 years in this  difficult office. The cardinal changes in East Europe over the  past five years are linked with his name. He retired voluntarily  on 17 May 1992 at the height of his political fame. He is  honorary chairman of the Free Democratic Party of the FRG. As  before, he is among the most, if not the most, popular  politician in Germany. He rarely gives interviews, but he  responded to LITERATURNAYA GAZETA's request immediately. We met  with Genscher in his relatively modest member's office in the  Bundestag. Let us say plainly that in conversation "off the  record," he spouted jokes, made decisive statements, and was  candid. When, however, the conversation was being "taped" for  the press, we were faced with a "crafty fox," as journalists  rightly call him. But with a close reading of the answers to  LITERATURNAYA GAZETA's questions, the reader will, it seems to  us, find much material for the most diverse reflection,  assessments, and conclusions.    [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Herr Genscher, we know you as a most  prominent politician of Germany and top foreign policy  specialist. We know how much you have dealt with problems of the  USSR and Russia. We would like today, therefore, to concentrate  on one topic: "Russia from April 1985 through the present  through the eyes of Herr Genscher."    Let us start at the very beginning: Under what circumstances  did you get to know Mikhail Gorbachev, what impression did he  make on you at that time, and what, afterward, and how might you  evaluate him today?    [Genscher] I made the acquaintance of Mr. Gorbachev in 1986,  during a visit to Moscow. He made an unforgettable impression on  me. I was taken primarily with his call for new thinking. He  seemed a self-assured and quite complex conversational partner.  But he was prepared to hear another opinion also and to seek  mutual understanding on contentious issues. His policy led to  the surmounting of East-West contradictions and afforded an  opportunity for the unity of all of Europe. For us Germans this  meant unity for our people also. His policy of elimination of  the East-West confrontation and the fundamental changes in the  former Soviet Union are of historic dimensions.    [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] The same question concerns Boris  Yeltsin. Could you venture a comparison of these two politicians?    [Genscher] Comparing these two outstanding personalities  would be unfair to both of them. Boris Yeltsin supports a  continuation of East-West cooperation, as was emphasized anew  recently during the meeting with President Clinton. Even today  he has done much for the process of democratization and reforms  in Russia.    [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] The first free parliamentary elections  in Russia did not produce the results anticipated by Russia's  democrats or by the democrats of Europe, either. In addition, we  obtained the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon." What, in your opinion,  were the decisive mistakes of the democrats which made possible  such an election outcome?    [Genscher] We had hoped for a more favorable result for the  democrats in Russia, of course. The question arises, however:  Was this possible? After all, in the course of the relatively  short space of time that democratization has had, all the  problems of the past and the transitional period have become  apparent, but there has not as yet been successful reform. I  believe in the strength of democracy in Russia and in the will  of the great Russian people, who by their culture and historic  achievements have made such a great contribution to the  formation of Europe's future. There is nothing surprising in the  fact that at a time of revolutionary changes and ideological  retreat on the question of national self-determination, there  has been a stimulation of the activity of nationalist  politicians. This does not confirm the soundness of their ideas  but, on the contrary, requires even greater explanatory work to  show their danger.    [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Herr Genscher, you contributed to this  extent or the other to the fall of the communist regimes in  Eastern Europe and, subsequently, in the republics of the former  USSR. A multitude of armed conflicts has arisen in the world,  and much blood has been spilled and continues to be spilled in  the wake of this. Have you no regrets? Do you believe it might  have been possible to move toward democracy by other routes, or  are the conflicts and blood inevitable?    [Genscher] A great achievement of the peoples of the former  Soviet Union is the fact that the path from socialism to  democracy, the path from centralism in the USSR to the  independence of the republics, happened [as published] without  war or the use of force. The present military conflicts and  bloodshed are not a consequence of the transition to democracy.  The principle contained in the Helsinki Final Act, namely, that  all contentious issues should be settled by political means, is  being forgotten. This needs to be remembered, remembered by  everyone in Europe, what is more. At the end of the 20th century  no one should any longer be expatiating on the inevitability of  conflicts but speaking of the necessity for the peaceful  settlement and surmounting of conflicts.    [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Western assistance. Much is being said  about this, but the average Russian has not perceived it as yet.  Whence the allergy to these words. And the well-known Czech  politician Mlynar even counseled in our paper against Western  capital being admitted to Russia. What can you say on this score?    [Genscher] As far as Western assistance is concerned,  Germany  has made a substantial contribution, greater, generally, than  all the other Western countries put together. This is in keeping  with our strong friendly relations with the Russian people and  other peoples of the former USSR. That this capital has not had  the consequences for the ordinary citizens that we had imagined  has been the result of the above-mentioned complex problems of  the transitional period. At the same time, on the other hand, no  country can manage without foreign capital, be they the  Americans, the Germans, the French, the British, or the  Russians. The transfer of capital signifies simultaneously  financial and economic cooperation and thus a growing interweave  of interests.    [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] A couple of questions about foreign  policy. Do you also, like certain politicians in the FRG,  observe imperialist ambitions or trends toward them in Russian  foreign policy? How is the concept of a "country's national  interests" defined?    [Genscher] Of course, each people must themselves define the  "national interests" concept. But these interests suffer if they  are detrimental to the interests of other countries. Such is the  philosophy of our cooperation in the European Union. This is the  philosophy of the Helsinki Final Act and the Paris Charter, and  this should be the philosophy of the building of the  architecture for all of Europe, to which for me all the  successors of the former Soviet Union, Russia included,  naturally, pertain.    [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] You were a most impassioned supporter  of a security system that affords equal prospects for all  countries. Do the recent NATO decisions correspond to this? If  so, why are the East European and Baltic countries not entirely  satisfied with the results of the summit in Brussels?    [Genscher] I remain a convinced supporter of a policy that  affords all countries in Europe equal prospects. It was for this  reason that two and a half years ago I supported together with  then Secretary of State Baker the creation of the NATO  Cooperation Council and an area of stabilization from Vancouver  to Vladivostok. For this same reason I have always advocated  increasingly close relations among the European Community, the  countries of Central and Southeast Europe, and the successors of  the former Soviet Union. It is essential to see all the  prospects of cooperation, not just the military prospects. The  results of the NATO summit correspond to these requirements.  This means simultaneously an increase in the role of the  European Union in all-European responsibility also. My  impression is that the Central and East European countries and  the Baltic states are recognizing increasingly what  opportunities this concept affords.    [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Might Russia become a member of NATO  in  the future, what are the conditions for this?    [Genscher] There are for Russia no prerequisites other than  those that face the other members of the NATO Cooperation  Council. But Russia occupies a special place even now,  maintaining a strategic partnership with the United States. I  see this partnership as an expression of the joint  responsibility of the two nuclear powers.    [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Reproaches have been heard in Bonn and  even more loudly in Moscow that Russia and Germany lack a  concept for a joint future and that our relations are in a  stagnation phase.    [Genscher] I cannot share this reproach, inasmuch as there  are between Russia and Germany an important joint statement and  documents that take account of the special relationship between  our countries. This particular feature is based on historical  roots. Even the horrifying World War II could not erase from the  memory the historical, cultural, and human relations between  Germans and Russians. This particular feature is being expressed  today also in the fact that the Germans and Russians want to  achieve mutual understanding not behind the backs and not to the  detriment of other countries. Whoever is in a position correctly  to evaluate German-Polish and German-Czech relations will see  that our immediate neighbors in the East have no grounds for  apprehension. And as for everything else, no one should worry on  account of the German-Russian partnership. At the same time  close German-Russian relations are a contribution to stability  in Europe. The new culture of joint existence demands observance  of equality and an equal degree of security for all countries in  Europe, for small countries to no less an extent than for larger  countries. The relations of these countries imply participation  in the building of the all-European infrastructure, which  includes all Central and Southeast European countries and all  successors of the USSR. A joint system of transport,  telecommunications, energy--these are major investments for the  future which will link in Europe the creative powers of our  peoples and our economic potentials.    [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Germany has embarked on a particularly  active political year. You have declined to be a candidate for  the office of federal president. German astrologers predicted on  the threshold of 1994 that you would retire from active politics  altogether this year. This is hard to believe. What are your  personal plans and goals for the year of 1994?    [Genscher] My goal is to contribute to big successes for my  party in 1994. This implies an active, not passive, approach.</p>

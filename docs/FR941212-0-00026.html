The Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;408) amended and renumbered former section 789(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 295g&hyph;9(b)) to section 777(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed amendments to implement several statutory provisions by: (1) Adding a definition for the term ``Geriatric psychiatry'' to implement the requirement for the expansion of project support to include the training of physicians who plan to teach geriatric psychiatry, and by (2) adding a definition for the term ``Relevant advanced training or experience'' to implement the requirement for dentists who are awarded a 2-year internal medicine or family medicine fellowship. The NPRM also proposed to remove a section in the regulations regarding the period of time for appointment to fellowships to allow for less restrictive requirements for those individuals who may benefit from further fellowship or retraining experience in a lifetime. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public comment period on the proposed regulations closed on April 4, 1994. The Department received 4 public comments. The comments received on the proposed rule to section 777(b) and the Department's responses to the comments are discussed below according to the section numbers and headings of the regulation affected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 57.4102 ``Definitions'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department proposed the following definition for the term ``Geriatric psychiatry'': <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Geriatric psychiatry <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' means the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of mental disorders and disturbances seen in older adults. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This definition was proposed to be added to the section to incorporate the statutory requirement for the expansion of project support to include the training of physicians who plan to teach geriatric psychiatry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department received positive responses to this definition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also proposed the following definition for the term ``Relevant advanced training or experience'': <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Relevant advanced training or experience <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' means at least one of the following: (1) Completion of at least a 12-month graduate training program in a health-related discipline, the basic sciences, or education; or (2) a minimum of 2 years of clinical practice, of which at least 12 months were devoted in part to managing older dental patients in a hospital, long-term care facility, or other setting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This definition was proposed to be added to the section to incorporate the statutory requirement for the expansion of fellowship eligibility of dental fellows in the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent found this definition ``extremely helpful in setting a high standard for the selection of highly motivated and qualified candidates''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also received a request that dentists who have had ``relevant teaching experience in an accredited dental school'' be added to the definition. The Department accepts the general intent of this recommendation while noting that ``relevant'' alone is not explicit and is open to interpretation. In response to this concern, the Department has expanded the definition of ``Relevant advanced training or experience'' in the final regulations to include an additional experience, ``a minimum of 2 years of teaching experience in an accredited dental educational program of which at least 12 months were devoted in part to issues pertaining to the care of older adults.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 57.4111 ``Duration of Fellowships'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department proposed to remove this section from the regulations to allow less restrictive requirements for those individuals who may benefit from further fellowship or retraining experience in a lifetime. The section language read: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ``An appointment to a fellowship may be made for a period not to exceed 12 months.

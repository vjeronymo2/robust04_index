			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): White Paper promises long-overdue reform - Change in Presentation of Tax and Spending Proposals BUDGET DAY may be one of the great theatrical events in the British political calendar, but it has precious little to do with anything that resembles a proper budget. In effect, there are two half-budgets, with public spending decisions being announced in the Autumn Statement, while the means of financing those expenditures remains a carefully kept secret until the Budget in the following year. The chancellor of the day then sows joy and despair in equal measure as he pulls rabbits out of his hat and unveils complex tax measures that have not been subjected to scrutiny in open debate. By deciding to bring together the government's tax and spending proposals on one date in December, Mr Lamont has struck a long overdue blow for more rational economic policy making. It may not set the C1 and C2 socio-economic groups alight in Tory marginal constituencies, but it was certainly theatrical, in the sense that the shadow chancellor has been upstaged. Mr John Smith had been a cogent advocate of budgetary reform. On this, as on income tax, he has seen his clothes deftly purloined by the chancellor. The case for reform has long been accepted. Sir Geoffrey Howe pinned his colours to the mast in opposition in 1977, but then failed to deliver after he became chancellor in 1979. A report in 1980 by Lord Armstrong of Sanderstead for the Institute For Fiscal Studies firmly attacked the separation of tax and spending decisions and was echoed in a further report by the Treasury and Civil Service Committee in 1982. But it probably took Mr Smith's advocacy to bring about this belated enthusiasm for change; and while the initiative may now have been lost to Mr Lamont, the shadow chancellor may yet have the last laugh if the first genuine budget, planned for December 1993, is delivered under Labour. The case against the present budgetary process is that it is confusing and incoherent. When revenue and expenditure statements are finally brought together in the Financial Statement and Budget Report that accompanies the annual budget, attention inevitably fixes on the tax proposals, since the spending decisions have been in the public domain for months. Perceptions are thus distorted; and in the traditional battle on the Finance Bill Standing committee, ministers frequently fail to give a proper account of the proposed legislation. The White Paper that accompanied yesterday's Budget argued that a unified budget would enable ministers to make better judgments about the merits of public spending proposals in the light of the overall fiscal position and the implications for taxation. The components of the government's fiscal policy will be more clearly presented for parliamentary and public debate. Few would disagree with this analysis. But there are snags. These include the delay that will now take place in the publication of departmental spending plans and the fact that taxation decisions will be taken well before the start of the new financial year. There will also be a host of legal and technical obstacles, not least the implication for computer systems at the Inland Revenue and in industry of merging the two separate annual coding exercises that now take place for Pay As You Earn purposes. The government has finally conceded that these problems are outweighed by the advantages. But it remains to be seen just how open a budgetary process will emerge in due course. The White Paper says that income tax rates and allowances will take effect, as they do now, from the start of the tax year. But there will also be surprises, where there is a risk that taxpayers will seek to forestall changes to minimise their liability. That said, the White Paper also emphasises that one of the advantages of earlier publication of the Finance Bill is that taxpayers and their advisers will in most cases be aware of the precise form of tax changes long before the date at which they take effect. That points to good intentions on the government's part; and it is a commitment that will be welcomed by fiscal policy buffs and the professional tax advisory community. The process whereby a appallingly complex measures such as capital gains tax are sprung on the electorate without careful preliminary analysis, and then reformed through an expensive process of trial and error in successive Finance Acts, might just be over. That would complete a process that started after former chancellor Mr Nigel Lawson threatened to scrap tax relief for pension contributions. The resulting howl of anguish from the powerful pensions lobby prompted a rapid retreat by Mr Lawson. The outcome was an assurance in the 1985 budget that complex issues such as the taxation of pensions and the structure of income tax would be set out in green papers before firm proposals were announced by the government of the day. The two stage budgetary process does not have deep historic roots. It dates from the late 1960s, when the Plowden Report's recommendations on a revised system of planning public expenditure argued for making allocations to individual spending authorities well before the start of the financial year. Since governments continued to present their main tax proposals close to the beginning of the tax year, a gap opened up. The Autumn Statement was then introduced in 1982, partly in response to the Armstrong committee's strictures on the schizophrenic nature of the resulting budgetary process. Since then the government has tended to publish earlier and more detailed information on public spending plans. Though widely welcomed, this tended to accentuate the two-stage nature of the budgetary timetable.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Storehouse holders exercise put option Holders of the 4.5 per cent convertible bond issued in 1987 by Storehouse, the retail group, have exercised their put option forcing the company to redeem the bonds. The redemption price is 29.17 per cent above par value. Storehouse had bought in Pounds 41m of the Pounds 69m issue, and holders of Pounds 27.8m nominal of the bonds have exercised their puts. A few of the bonds are still outstanding. The cost of redeeming these bonds is just under Pounds 36m, which the group has financed from existing facilities. The March 1991 balance sheet was ungeared and analysts expect the balance sheet for the year just ended will show single-figure gearing.</p>

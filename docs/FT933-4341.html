			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Science a bleak career prospect Sir, I am able to manage but one wry smile at the pious hope for the future of chemistry expressed by John Cox, director general of the Chemical Industries Association (Letters, August 28/29). Like the rest of us science graduates, one must suspect that most directors of the CIA are there because they, too, were not really wanted by their industrial employers. The fact is that many managers with science degrees from such UK companies as ICI, BP or Shell have had their careers curtailed unexpectedly early over the last 20 years (starting about 1973) and have been encouraged to work overseas for foreign competitors. Perhaps Mr Cox would tell us how many employees with science degrees in the British chemical industry have been retired early or made redundant since 1973. One would wager it to be a significant proportion of total UK private industry science manpower] It is hardly surprising that the children of the scientifically qualified do not see much future in science and seek greener pastures elsewhere, even if we might all agree (but only in theory) that it is impossible to run a country as technically sophisticated as the UK without managers strongly grounded in science. Surely the message of the last 20 years is that jobs in banking, foreign exchange, investment management, property development, restaurants and politics (anything but science-based industry) pay much better than any job in science: Is Mr Cox surprised at our intelligent children noticing?

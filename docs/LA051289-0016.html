			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JURORS HEAR TAPE OF POLICE INTERROGATION;  </P> <P> DEFENDANT SOBS BUT REMAINS IN CONTROL UNDER INTENSE QUESTIONING IN DEATH OF  ACTRESS MOTHER  </P> <P> Detectives shouted "You killed her!" and "You had it all planned!" at Timothy  Scott Roman shortly after the 25-year-old was picked up for questioning in the  brutal slaying of his actress mother, according to a tape recording played in  Van Nuys Superior Court on Thursday.  </P> <P> But in contrast to the depiction of Roman as mentally fragile, the recording of  the 90-minute interrogation indicates that the defendant held his own against  the two interrogators.  </P> <P> Roman, a former art student at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, is accused of  beating to death his mother, 59-year-old Susan Cabot, in December, 1986, at the  Encino home they shared. Cabot was a leading actress in 1950s action movies.  </P> <P> Charged with first-degree murder but without the special conditions that could  lead to the death penalty, Roman faces a possible term of life in prison.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Insanity Plea  </P> <P> He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. If convicted of the slaying,  his insanity claim will then be heard before the same jury.  </P> <P> In pretrial motions and since the trial began three weeks ago, Roman, who  suffers from a growth hormone deficiency and has been described by his attorney  as "an experiment of the human race," has sat with head bowed and eyes  downcast, seemingly oblivious to the proceedings.  </P> <P> But in the taped interrogation, which took place between 1 and 3 the morning  after the slaying, the defendant sobbed repeatedly but never seemed close to  losing his composure.  </P> <P> "I had nothing to do with it. I swear to God!" he shouted back at his  interrogators. "I loved her."  </P> <P> Finally, he declared: "I'd like to speak to an attorney if we're going to have  any more of this stuff."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defense Demand  </P> <P> Ironically, it was defense attorney Chester Leo Smith who demanded that the  tape be played for jurors, although his client's demeanor on tape seemed to  undercut the defense claim that Roman's mental capacity is diminished by  lifelong administration of a growth hormone.  </P> <P> In an interview, Smith would say only that he wanted to show jurors that "they  leaned on him pretty hard."  </P> <P> Before the playing of the tape, Los Angeles Police Detective Patrick Conmay  testified that he decided to charge Roman with murder after Roman gave  detectives "three separate and distinct versions" of what happened the night of  the slaying.  </P> <P> In the taped conversation, Roman told Conmay and Detective Philip Quartararo  that when he went to investigate a pounding sound coming from his mother's  bedroom, he was attacked by a tall Latino man wearing a Ninja mask.  </P> <P> Stabbed in the arm and knocked unconscious, he called police, then waited for  help to arrive before entering his mother's room, Roman said.  </P> <P> Under further questioning, the defendant said that after calling police, he  looked briefly into his mother's room from the entryway and saw her body lying  across her bed.  </P> <P> Finally, with Conmay and Quartararo prodding him repeatedly, Roman said that  before calling police, he entered the bedroom, knelt down and lifted a  blood-soaked cloth covering his mother's head and concluded that she was dead.  </P> <P> Smith sought to get Conmay to admit that Roman could have believed all three  versions were true at the time he related them.  </P> <P> But Judge Darlene S. Schempp upheld Deputy Dist. Atty. Bradford E. Stone's  objection that such speculation was beyond the detective's expertise.  </P> <P> The trial is expected to continue for at least another month.  </P></p>

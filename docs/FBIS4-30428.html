			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 27 (YONHAP) -- The United States is  considering a two-phased diplomatic normalization with North  Korea starting with the opening of liaison offices, the ASAHI  SHIMBUN reported Monday.    Quoting South Korean Government officials, ASAHI said the  Clinton administration has notified Seoul that it plans to  exchange liaison offices with North Korea if Pyongyang  guarantees the transparency of its past, present and future  nuclear activities and allows inspection of two undeclared sites  critical to determining how much plutonium the North Koreans  have stockpiled.    The United States would then be ready to relax trade  restrictions against Pyongyang, change North Korea's status in  the category of the "Trade With the Enemy Act" and promise  financial assistance to change its outdated nuclear reactors to  a much safer system, the paper said. For this transition,  Washington may ask South Korea and Japan to chip in, according  to ASAHI.    But the United States will demand that North Korea halt  missile exports, improve human rights and renounce terrorism  before it will establish ties with the communist state, it  reported.    ASAHI noted that North Korea is likely to strongly oppose  such a phased plan since it would increase barriers to full  diplomatic normalization.    The White House is treading cautiously on normalizing  relations because Congress, and some within the administration,  still mistrusts North Korea. The growing pressure to address  human rights conditions is another reason, ASAHI said.</p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Virgin backs down on Sunday trading THE battle over the sanctity of Sunday in France took a new turn at the weekend when Virgin, the London-based leisure group, succumbed to political pressure by deciding not to open its French stores illegally yesterday, Alice Rawsthorn writes. The decision by Virgin, which was fined FFr500,000 (Pounds 51,300) last week for opening the previous Sunday, is seen as a placatory gesture to the French government, which is preparing for a national debate on Sunday trading restrictions. On Wednesday, government representatives will meet trade unionists to discuss the issue. The liberalisation of Sunday trading has long been controversial in France because of the special role of Sunday in a Roman Catholic culture and opposition by the unions. One of the most powerful opponents of Virgin's Sunday trading campaign is its chief competitor, FNAC.</p>

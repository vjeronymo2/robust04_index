			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 11m at nine months for Wace Shares in Wace Group rose 3p to 168p after the pre-press and specialist printing company unexpectedly reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.4m in the nine months to September 30, writes Andrew Bolger. Mr Frans ten Bos, chairman, said that in view of the continued changes in the group he believed reporting the nine-month result for the first time was the best way of keeping the market informed of the group's development. He said the improved performance at the half year had continued. Sales for the third quarter amounted to Pounds 85.4m, taking the nine-month total above Pounds 250m. Trading profits in the quarter were Pounds 6.2m, representing a margin of 7.3 per cent, against 6.9 per cent for the first six months. During the third quarter progress was made in cutting borrowings, which fell Pounds 8.4m in the quarter and by Pounds 12.8m in the nine months. Net borrowings at the end of September were Pounds 75.9m, down from Pounds 88.7m at beginning of the year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 3 February (DPA) -- Two  medium-intensity bombs exploded today in the Colombian city of  Medellin. No fatalities were reported, but severe damage was  caused, police have stated.    The first bomb exploded in front of a bank office in the  center of the city. After the explosion, a fire broke out but  was rapidly contained.    A second bomb exploded minutes later at the gate of the  English Language Academy, which sustained severe damage.    According to police, these are new extremist actions  perpetrated by movements that oppose the presence of U.S.  soldiers in several parts of Colombia, where they have built  bases for the Colombian Government to combat drug trafficking.    Two weeks ago terrorists detonated bombs against a Mormon  church that was operated by U.S. citizens in the western part of  Medellin. They also attacked other U.S. interests in this city,  which is located in the northwestern part of Colombia.    (Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish at  1200 GMT on 3 February, during its "Caracol's 0600-0900"  newscast, adds: "Authorities have blamed guerrillas for the  explosion of two bombs in the city of Medellin.")</p>

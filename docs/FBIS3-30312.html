Siwiec was speaking to reporters on Thursday following a  meeting with Kolodziejdzyk. The meeting had been arranged after  Siwiec had submitted a formal question in parliament. However,  Siwiec added that he was still waiting for a formal reply from  the minister.    The minister informed Siwiec about the measures to be taken  by the Armed Forces in order to hand over to civilian users a  number of frequencies used by the Air Force telecommunications  services. However, according to Siwiec, Kolodziejdzyk had argued  that the problem could be successfuly overcome only on condition  that the Army received an extra 2 trillion zlotys (ca. 90 m  dollars) to finance necessary technical restructuring.</p>

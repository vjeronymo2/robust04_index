			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> MENTAL PATIENT HELD IN DEATH  </P> <P> A Camarillo State Hospital patient was being held today in connection with the  death of a fellow patient after the two had fought, the Ventura County  Sheriff's Department said.  </P> <P> Mark W. Wagner, 37, was found dead in his bed at 5:15 a.m. Monday by attendants  at the psychiatric hospital who had checked on him periodically after a 4 a.m.  fight with Michael Thomas, 37, a patient in the same unit, Lt. Joe Harwell  said.  </P> <P> "It appears that the two had argued earlier, which resulted in Thomas attacking  the victim and knocking him to the ground," Harwell said.  </P> <P> Another patient called for help and attendants separated the two. Wagner was  examined by the hospital's medical staff, Harwell said. "At that time he was  thought to be all right," he said.  </P> <P> "He was checked out. He seemed OK," said John Fortner, a spokesman for the  hospital.  </P> <P> About an hour after the fight, an attendant noticed that Wagner had stopped  breathing, and efforts to revive him failed. Thomas was arrested and taken to  the county jail in Ventura, where he was being held in lieu of $250,000 bail.  </P> <P> Harwell said an autopsy was scheduled for later today.  </P></p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Book Review: A mid-life makeover REJUVENATING THE MATURE BUSINESS: The Competitive Challenge By Charles Baden-Fuller and John M Stopford Routledge, Pounds 10.95, 232 pages At a time of extreme and exaggerated gloom about British industry, it is refreshing to read a book which shows how, even in the most unpromising circumstances, good management can turn sick companies into world leaders. A pump maker in Scotland, a cutlery business in Sheffield, a steel castings producer in the Midlands - such companies may not catch the popular imagination like an Amstrad or a Sinclair, but they are what most of industry is about. In these and other cases reported by Baden-Fuller and Stopford, the much-maligned British manager has been doing an admirable job, not just in rooting out inefficiency, but in building new sources of competitive advantage over international rivals. Hotpoint was almost broke when Schreiber took command in 1974. 'Ten years of hard work . . . converted one of Europe's worst performing appliance firms with an appalling failure rate into a shining star, envied by all the industry leaders.' When Bryan Upton became managing director of cutlery maker Richardson in 1966, the company was 'small, broke and part of the smoke-stack and rust bowl of Sheffield'. By the late 1970s it was making profits and growing. By 1990 'it was staking its claim as the world's largest, most profitable and most innovative producer of knives'. Leadership is important, but this is not a story of supermen, still less of quick fixes. Rejuvenating a mature business calls for teamwork at all levels. Top management has to instil a shared vision and an atmosphere of trust between previously distant groups - such as the service and production departments at Hotpoint, or the mechanical and electronic engineers at Richardson. Going for a big hit - such as a massive investment in state-of-the-art technology - is almost always wrong. Progress is best made by many small steps, which spread the risks and prevent the organisation from betting everything on one initiative. 'It takes years to build an entrepreneurial organisation and the foundations need to run deep.' One of the merits of this book is its challenge to conventional wisdom - for example, the notion that there are 'good' and 'bad' industries. The authors show by their examples that what determines a company's performance is not its choice of industry, but its choice of strategy. Again, they question the idea that being number one or two in an industry gives a business unique advantages, or that economies of scale are always crucial. Hotpoint, for instance, had no ambitions to be a global player along with Electrolux or Philips-Whirlpool or to cover the full range of household appliances; with plants below the commonly accepted minimum size, it outperformed its larger rivals in flexibility, quality and profits. The authors suggest a four-stage path to rejuvenation: galvanise, simplify, build and then exert leverage. The first step, usually prompted by a financial crisis, is to create a top management team dedicated to renewal. The second is to concentrate scarce resources on a smaller agenda. The third is to set about building new competitive advantages, and the fourth is to keep up the momentum, extending the new-found capabilities into a wider sphere of activity. The transformation often involves what the authors call 'frame-breaking' investments. Edwards, the BOC subsidiary, decided to attack the Japanese market for vacuum pumps - a radical move in an industry which had traditionally been bound within countries or regions; it demonstrated to everyone in the company the standards that had to be met in the world's most demanding market. Richardson defied convention by packaging its Laser knives as gifts. While the trade association thought the industry's future lay in classic silverware, with high margins and low volume, Richardson's focus was on fashionable, mass-market products. At all stages the rejuvenators must be careful not to do too many things at once. 'Problems arise when the sequences are rushed through in ways that lead subordinates to view them as no more than passing fads.' To expect instant results from such over-hyped programmes as total quality management, time-based competition and empowerment leads to disappointment and disillusion. There is no suggestion here that the patient rebuilding of a business is made more difficult by stock market pressures for quick returns. Most of the companies analysed by Baden-Fuller and Stopford were quoted or parts of quoted groups. They delivered excellent value to shareholders. Many of them managed a consistent record of pre-tax profits amounting to 25 per cent of capital employed, well above the level achieved by their competitors. This book is both a description of how mature businesses have become entrepreneurial and a guide for managers who wish to follow their example. The message is optimistic: the survival of struggling companies is in their own hands. Instead of urging the government to 'do something', managers would do well to read this book, and act on it.</p>

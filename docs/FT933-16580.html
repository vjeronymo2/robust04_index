			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ford to acquire Czech parts maker FORD has reached agreement with the Czech government to acquire Autopol, a components manufacturer specialising in automotive lighting and heat exchanger equipment including air conditioning. The producer has annual turnover of Pounds 50m (Dollars 75m). The acquisition, for an undisclosed sum, was decribed by Mr Jacques Nasser, Ford of Europe chairman, as part of Ford's strategy to establish a stronger presence in the emerging economies of central and eastern Europe. The acquisition provides Ford, for the first time, with an in-house capability to produce lighting in Europe. In the long term, this may means reduced business for Hella, Carello, Bosch and Valeo, its European lighting suppliers. It also gives Autopol a significant role in Europe's fast-growing car air-conditioning market. In 1987, only one car in 200 was ordered with air-conditioning. Now the level is 11 per cent and is expected to grow to 25 per cent - representing around 3m units - by 1995. Ford has been among the most cautious of western vehicle producers in exploring manufacturing ventures in the region. However, it has identified Poland, Hungary and the former Czechoslovakia as offering most potential. It is also setting up a greenfield operation in Hungary to manufacture induction coils, and is in the final stages of negotiations with the Polish authorities to establish a soft trim factory. It already has car sales and service networks in the region. The Autopol plant, which employs 2,700, has Lada and Volkswagen-controlled Skoda as its biggest customers. However, Mr Nasser said: 'We believe our investment will enable Autopol to become an internationally competitive supplier throughout Europe.' Ford intends to introduce new equipment, systems and methods at the five plants operated by Autopol. However, it says the company will not need to overhaul and cut jobs as much as in some other Western takeovers of east European motor industry ventures.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY NARROWLY OKS 15-DAY WAIT ON ALL GUN PURCHASES  </P> <P> Legislation supported by Gov. George Deukmejian to extend the 15-day waiting  period for handgun purchases to all firearms -- including hunting rifles and  shotguns -- was narrowly passed by the Assembly on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The bill, aimed at making it tougher for criminals and the mentally disturbed  to legally buy a gun, is widely regarded as at least as significant and perhaps  more so than the ban on military-style assault weapons enacted last month.  </P> <P> For the National Rifle Assn., whose usually influential lobbying operation was  left in disarray by the beating it took over the assault-gun ban, approval of  the waiting-period measure represented a second consecutive thumping.  </P> <P> Backers of the bill by Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly (D-Sacramento) argued that  if the measure had been law it would have stopped Stockton schoolyard murderer  Patrick Purdy from obtaining the many firearms he legally purchased before his  Jan. 17 killing foray. Opponents claimed that it would not have affected Purdy,  a deranged misfit.  </P> <P> Passage of the bill occurred over the opposition of Republicans who  unsuccessfully argued for a telephone hot line and computerized background  check within the state Department of Justice. They contended that this would  eliminate the need for any waiting period and allow immediate sale of guns to  legal purchasers.  </P> <P> But Connelly and his backers argued that the Department of Justice would be  financially and technically unable to hook up such a system within the next 18  months as demanded by Republicans. Even if installed, the high-tech system  would fail to identify thousands of illegal purchasers, he said.  </P> <P> On a 43-21 vote, two more than the simple majority, the bill was sent to the  Senate, where its prospects for approval are considered favorable in a newly  energized anti-gun political climate.  </P> <P> The NRA and other gun-owner organizations staked out the Assembly as the  central battleground over gun-control legislation this year, largely because  its members must run for reelection every two years and are considered more  vulnerable to lobbying on the politically sensitive issue than are senators.  </P> <P> For the last 15 years, purchasers of handguns have had to wait for 15 days  until they take possession of the firearm. This indirect form of gun  registration enables the state Department of Justice to check into the buyer's  background to determine whether he or she is prohibited from purchasing a  pistol or revolver because of a felony record or because the prospective buyer  has been found by a court to be mentally ill.  </P> <P> When he came out for banning assault weapons last winter, Deukmejian also  called for extending the 15-day waiting period to the sale of long guns --  rifles and shotguns -- as a way of helping to keep firearms out of the hands of  criminals and the mentally unbalanced.  </P> <P> However, opponents of the extension maintain that it would merely inconvenience  the law-abiding gun purchaser and would not deter criminals who, they argue,  seldom legally buy firearms anyway.  </P> <P> Connelly, who unsuccessfully carried a similar bill last session, told the  Assembly that in the view of some law enforcement officials "this is the second  most important, if indeed not the most important, weapons-control bill that  will be considered this year."  </P> <P> Citing figures compiled by the Department of Justice, Connelly noted that last  year the agency made almost 300,000 handgun background checks. The department  estimates that extending the wait requirement to long guns would add another 1  million purchasers to be investigated.  </P> <P> Among other things, the bill also would:  </P> <P> * Make ineligible to purchase a gun for five years anyone involuntarily held  for a 72-hour psychiatric evaluation. A record of the detention would be sent  to the Justice Department.  </P> <P> * Prohibit ownership of any firearm by a felon. Under current state law, felons  are prohibited only from possessing handguns. Federal law prohibits them from  possessing any gun.  </P> <P> * Require that private sales of guns be handled through a licensed dealer and  that the sale be subject to the 15-day wait and a background check by the  department. Such a restriction currently applies to private handgun sales, but  critics contend that the law is virtually ignored, especially at gun shows and  swap meets.  </P> <P> * Make it either a misdemeanor or a felony on the first offense to transfer a  firearm to someone not legally qualified to possess it, punishable by a fine of  $1,000 and a year in jail or a $10,000 fine and up to three years in state  prison.  </P></p>

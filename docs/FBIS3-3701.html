Xu Weikai, the member of the Guangdong People's Congress  responsible for handling the motions, spoke highly of the  motion. The illegitimate use of military license plates is a  problem of major concern for interior inhabitants. It shows  that the people at home share the views with those outside the  border.    The motion stated that, not long ago, Hong Kong newspapers  reported an incident which took place in Shenzhen: When a  military vehicle collided with a truck from Hong Kong, the  driver of the military vehicle beat the driver from Hong Kong  instead of giving an apology. Reportedly, the vehicle did not  belong to the police, and it was only a company vehicle which  used a military license plate to do businesses. The incident  created an adverse influence in Hong Kong. The motion  continued: It is said that, besides provincial and city  leaders, the department- and bureau-level cadres also put  military or police license plates on their cars. In order to  make more money, some Army and police units openly sell license  plates or lease military vehicles to businessmen. Such moves  will affect relations between the people and the Army and police  and will hinder the establishment of a modern urban management  system, which will further deteriorate the already crowded  traffic and damage the prestige of the Army and police.    The motion urged provincial-level leading cadres not related  to the Army or police to take the military license plates off  their cars. It also advised the provincial people's congress to  submit a report to the Central Military Commission, Armed Police  Headquarters, and Public Security Bureau calling for a halt to  the practice of selling or contracting military license plates,  which harms the reputation of the state, Army, and police.</p>

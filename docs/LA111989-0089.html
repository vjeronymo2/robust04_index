			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEGATIVE REPORTING  </P> <P> What is it with The Times San Diego Edition's sustained animosity toward our  own city's Soviet arts festival? How come you've had such a nasty attitude  toward this inaugural and triumphantly successful event? I read rave reviews  from Los Angeles reviewers from the Los Angeles Times, yet most local San Diego  reporting has downgraded, belittled and sneered at the festival, from beginning  to end.  </P> <P> The San Diego arts community must be bursting with pride in its many  outstanding achievements. The police must be encouraged having such crowds  using Balboa Park, making for less crime. And all who long for international  understanding and reconciliation are cheered with all this new interaction and  friendliness. The thousands who saw any of the 70-plus free performances of the  Georgian dancers were enthusiastic in their praise, as were other audiences  everywhere.  </P> <P> I cannot understand why local reporting was so negative, not that the people of  San Diego paid any attention to your negatives. Now I'm wondering if I should  comfort myself that fewer and fewer people read newspapers?  </P> <P> GEORGIA TARWATER  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

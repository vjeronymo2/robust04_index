			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / World Trade News: World trade growth falters in second half THE growth of world merchandise trade has slackened in the second half of 1992 after rising by an annual 5 per cent in the first half, according to preliminary estimates by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Giving the figures yesterday to Gatt's annual meeting in Geneva, Mr Lars Anell, the meeting's chairman, said the 'somewhat downbeat assessment' for the past few months reflected weak demand in western Europe and Japan. Mr Anell, formerly Sweden's ambassador to Gatt and now the country's representative in Brussels, said a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round would provide a much-needed boost to the world economy. International trade has been in the doldrums since the boom year of 1988. Last year growth in volume terms, at 3 per cent, was the smallest since 1983 and Gatt predicted last March that growth this year would not exceed 4 per cent. Interest in regional trading arrangements was high, Mr Anell said, with 16 accords notified to Gatt in 1992 against just one in 1991. The EC should stop looking for foreign scapegoats and accept responsibility for the reduction in farm export subsidies which is the key to a much-needed Gatt deal, James Dobbins, US ambassador to the EC, said yesterday, Lionel Barber writes from Brussels. He said it was a myth to suggest the US-EC compromise on farm subsidies imposed greater sacrifices on the Community. He also rejected complaints that Europe was altering its agricultural policies under US pressure, saying change was driven first by the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) agreed last May. Mr Dobbins said: 'European leaders have an obligation to explain these realities to their voters. European leaders have an obligation to accept responsibility for the policies they have set, and the bargains they have struck.' At a conference on business opinion in the EC organised by United Parcels Service, Mr Dobbins said US cuts in subsidised exports would be comparable with 'where not greater' than those of the EC. The US-EC deal calls for a 21 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised exports. This figures derives from the end of the 1986-90 base period, when US subsidy programmes grew faster than the EC's. 'This means that US subsidies will now have to be cut back more sharply than the Community's,' said the US ambassador. Measured against the volume of subsidised exports offered for sale this autumn until October 1993, the US will have to cut its subsidised exports of wheat by 54 per cent, barley by 78 per cent, rice by 95 per cent, vegetable oils by 84 per cent and poultry meat by 52 per cent, according to Mr Dobbins. By comparison, based on European Farmers' Union projections, the EC should have to cut back 39 per cent in wheat, 9 per cent in barley, 49 per cent in rice, and 39 per cent in poultry meat.</p>

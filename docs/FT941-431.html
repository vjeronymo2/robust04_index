			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Management: Just in time now just too much - Japan's plastics suppliers are leading a revolt against the much praised management tool Just in time, the Japanese management tool so widely admired and imitated around the world, appears to be failing in its country of origin. Components suppliers, straining under the worst recession since the second world war, can no longer afford to deliver small regular batches to customers. Just in time, it seems, has become just too much. Complaints from suppliers about just in time have been voiced before in Japan and the US. But for the first time some Japanese groups are beginning to take action to break down the system. The sector where the suppliers' revolt has taken greatest hold is the plastics industry. Hiromasa Yonekura, director of basic chemicals at Sumitomo Chemical, one of Japan's largest plastics manufacturers, explains: 'Japanese customers became almost tyrannical in their demands. We just had to move away from just in time. It was just too expensive.' The theory of just in time, developed during the 1960s by the now legendary Taiichi Ohnowas, was that suppliers would make regular deliveries of small batches so that the required parts were available at the required time in the required amounts. This could cut inventories, reduce the need for storage areas and eliminate double or triple handling. At its best, inventory levels could fall by as much as 80 per cent in four months, according to Kiyoshi Suzaki, author of a best-selling work* on techniques for continuous improvement. An additional benefit of this apparently rational system was that it shifted the cost of work in progress from the manufacturer to the supplier, allowing manufacturers to reduce the amount of cash tied up in inventory and so improve their cash-flow. Conversely, suppliers had to build up stocks to ensure they could provide the flexible deliveries required by customers. During the 1980s, suppliers in the plastics industry tolerated the system because it strengthened the relationship between them and the customer. Once customers became used to a steady, dependable flow of materials from one company they were unlikely to go elsewhere for their components. The costs of additional freight and stock required for frequent small deliveries was bearable because during much of the last decade the Japanese plastics business was highly profitable. Demand outstripped supply, forcing up prices and profits. Those heady days have passed. Demand for ethylene, the basic building block of plastics, has dropped 8 per cent over the past 12 months, while prices have fallen every year for the past four years. Styrene monomer, used to make polystyrene, has plunged from Y120 (76p) a kilo 2 1/2 years ago to only Y60. Although raw material costs have fallen, most plastics manufacturers are losing money. The 12 largest ethylene manufacturers are expected to report combined losses during the financial year to March of Y51.6bn. Given the falling demand in plastics over the past three years, the cost of small, frequent deliveries has become insupportable. However, up until now suppliers have been unable to end the practice. The market clearly became a buyers' one, with supply exceeding demand. Any attempt by one plastics maker to end the just in time deliveries often led to loss of business. The response of the plastics suppliers to this situation was typically Japanese. Orchestrated by the petrochemicals industry association, they recently decided to end just in time deliveries - all members were to stop the practice simultaneously. The first product area to be targeted was acrylics. 'Acrylic sheet was infamous for small deliveries, even within the plastics industry,' says Yonekura. 'We were sometimes having to make deliveries three times a day. The costs were exorbitant. Not only did you have to cover the cost of freight, but you had to carry larger inventory too.' A further problem was ensuring the materials arrived on time, given the traffic congestion in Japan's big cities. Manufacturers using acrylics were told deliveries would be limited to once a day. Additional deliveries were available, but only if paid for by the customer. 'If we're compensated for the additional freight costs, we're prepared to do it. We're also charging extra for small deliveries, as well as supplies on Saturday and Sundays,' explains Yonekura. The acrylics buyers are also being encouraged to take larger quantities at each delivery. 'For specialised materials we now require a minimum quantity,' says Yonekura. The reaction of the acrylics buyers has not been enthusiastic, but they have accepted it, he adds. 'I'm sure the new system will be extended to other plastics products,' says Yonekura. 'The petrochemicals industry association is working out some sort of agreement at the moment.' Meanwhile, the plastics industry is being forced by the recession to compromise another principle embedded during the 1980s - supplying products that exactly meet customers' specifications. Yonekura explains: 'It was ludicrous. We used to offer 400 different grades of low density polyethylene and 400 different kinds of polypropylene. It's all very well matching their customers' specifications, but because we were producing such small batches, it raised our costs horribly. We've cut the number of grades to 300 each and we're looking to reduce even for more.' Similarly Mitsubishi Petrochemical used to make 600 grades of polypropylene and polyethylene, but plans to reduce the number by 30 per cent. Whether other sectors follow the example of the plastics industry remains uncertain. The petrochemicals companies involved are part of extremely powerful organisations - known as keiretsu. These include industrial groups such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo and Kawasaki which have the clout to impose fundamental changes in logistical practices. More traditional suppliers, often small family-owned businesses delivering to large automotive or electronics groups, are less able to impose such changes. *The New Manufacturing Culture, by Kiyoshi Suzaki, Macmillan, 1987.</p>

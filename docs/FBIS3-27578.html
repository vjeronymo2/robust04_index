Some scholars even pointed out that  it was a serious mistake for the government to allow the Armed  Forces to do business, and this might bring certain hidden  dangers for mainland China.    Whether the Armed Forces should be supported by state  finances and whether the Armed Forces should be engaged in  business operations are undisputed questions in modern  countries. However, such questions are controversial in  mainland China.    The scholars held: The Armed Forces can only be "fed" with  the state's military budget and should be supported with the  state's tax revenue, and they must not be allowed to engage in  business. National defense is public property that can neither  be divided nor sold on the market; instead, it must be kept by  the government (mainly by the central government). In a modern  country, the government levies mandatory taxes and provides  public property through arranging public expenses, especially  national defense expenses. "Supporting the armed forces with  tax revenue" is international practice. For example, in the  United States, the armed forces are strictly prohibited from  doing business, still less are they allowed to join hands with  local governments to run all sorts of profit-making industries.  This thus ensures the non- commercialization and  nonlocalitization of the armed forces. At present, only in a  very small number of countries, such as Indonesia and Thailand,  are there business companies run by the armed forces. There,  corruption in the armed forces is notorious. The armed forces  have become special interest groups with their own political,  economic, and military interests independent from the state's  interests. International experience shows that allowing the  armed forces to engage in business operations is to turn on a  green light for corruption in the armed forces.    Since the 1980's, the Armed Forces in mainland China have  been deeply involved in business activities on a large scale.  At present, the three services, the three general headquarters  departments, all the field armies, and all the military regions  and provincial military districts have set up their own business  companies without exception. These companies are making profits  to compensate for serious deficiencies in the military budget.  As a result, the Armed Forces have been rapidly commercialized  and localized, and corruption in the Armed Forces has become  increasingly serious. Military cadres are also unhappy with  such phenomena.    Many investigations show that, in mainland China, the  business operations of the Armed Forces have developed to the  degree of their going beyond the authorities' control. Some  military units use planes with special passes to transport  products which should be brought under the strict control of the  state, naval units have used their ships to engage in smuggling  activities on the high seas, and some units have even been  involved in the international underground arms trade. Such  facts deeply worry mainland leaders, who found it necessary to  ask the scholars to work out some urgent countermeasures.    A national situation analysis report drafted by a group from  the Chinese Academy of Sciences put forth five major proposals:    --Strictly prohibit the Armed Forces from engaging in  business operations, and suspend all sorts of business companies  run by the Armed Forces or with the participation of the Armed  Forces, including military-run farms. Assets may be transferred  or auctioned. The Armed Forces must not be allowed to  participate in various profit-making activities in civilian  communities, and military units must not be allowed to accept  any gifts or allowances given by local governments or civilian  institutions.    --Substantially increase the military budget and support the  Armed Forces with tax revenue. It is necessary to greatly  increase the central government's financial capacity in order to  feed the Armed Forces, the Police Force, officialdom, and  teaching staff. The expenses of the Armed Forces should come  completely from the government's financial appropriations, which  should be sufficient to maintain the normal operations of the  Armed Forces in peacetime. That is, the actual income of troops  should increase at a rate slightly higher than the growth rate  of average income of all people throughout the country so that  the troops have sufficient money to maintain their weapons and  equipment, quicken the depreciation and modernization of their  equipment, and to arrange military training. In wartime, special  appropriations should be made to make up for deficiencies in the  military budget.    --Part of national defense public property should be  produced  through the market. Being the most important part of public  property, national defense should be provided by the central  government. However, some national defense materials may be  produced by civilian manufacturers through the market. For  example, military rations, medicines and medical equipment,  clothing and other supplies, military airports, roads, and some  buildings, instruments can be ordered by the military from  civilian suppliers, and the orders may be placed through the  invitation of tenders. The Armed Forces do not need to effect  "self-sufficiency" in such materials.    --Most military industrial enterprises should be separated  from the regular military establishment so that the Armed Forces  can streamline their non-combat parts. Only a very small number  of highly confidential and key military industrial enterprises  will remain inside the military establishment. Similar  practices should also be adopted among scientific research  institutes serving military purposes. A ministry of military  industry could be set up under the State Council on the basis of  the existing State Commission of Science, Technology, and  Industry for National Defense. It would specialize in arranging  the development and production of weapons and military  equipment, and the Armed Forces would become the buyer of such  products. Under the conditions of a market economy, the new  model should be that the central government spends money to keep  the Armed Forces, the Armed Forces place orders and buy what  they need, and the ministry of military industry arranges  production. As for nonweapons materials and supplies, the Armed  Forces should place orders with civilian manufacturers through  the invitation of tenders.    --Redefine the tasks of the Armed Forces, and reduce  excessive nonmilitary expenditure and burdens borne by the Armed  Forces. The Armed Forces should not take part in various  productive and business activities in the market, still less  should they be engaged in activities of reaping staggering  profits or reaping illicit gains, such as through smuggling  cars, selling arms, running luxurious hotels, and speculating in  real estate. The Armed Forces should not be involved in local  economic construction and turned into a low- cost labor force.  This may also increase extra financial burdens on military  units and affect the military training of troops.    In the eyes of the scholars, the five proposals are  completely correct, but they mean that major changes would have  to be made in the sources of mainland China's military  expenditures. First, it is not known whether the central  government would be able to pay such a huge military bill;  second, it is not known whether some people who are used to  doing business by taking advantage of the Armed Forces'  privileges are willing to give up such enviable benefits. All  this causes people to worry about the fate of the report.</p>

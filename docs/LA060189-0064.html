			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BUCK WORTH A 2-A TITLE TO CARLSBAD;  </P> <P> TAYLOR HELPS SPARK 5-RUN FIFTH IN 7-4 VICTORY OVER GROSSMONT  </P> <P> Before Wednesday's San Diego Section 2-A baseball championship, Carlsbad High  Coach Joe Pimentel said catcher Cord "Buck" Taylor was the team's "unsung  hero."  </P> <P> Pimentel can drop the "unsung."  </P> <P> It was Taylor, one the smallest Lancers at 5-feet-10, 150 pounds, who came  through with the most prominent hit to lead Carlsbad to its first 2-A title  with a 7-4 victory over Grossmont at the University of San Diego's Cunningham  Stadium.  </P> <P> In the fifth inning with the bases loaded and the score 3-3, Taylor hit a  two-run double to right center, the key to a five-run inning that gave Carlsbad  (23-9) the title.  </P> <P> "(Pitchers) Jeff (Myers) and Scotty (Karl) had been getting all the notoriety  and publicity," Pimentel said, "and Buck's been a little overlooked. But when  we got things going, Buck comes up with the big base hit."  </P> <P> Taylor, a senior catcher and captain, also had the big hit -- a three-run  first-inning homer -- in Saturday's 9-0 semifinal victory over Crawford. Taylor  said it was only the second home run of his life, the other coming earlier this  the year.  </P> <P> "I'm not a power hitter, I'm usually a singles hitter," Taylor said.  </P> <P> Tell that to Crawford. Tell that to Grossmont (19-9-1), which was also  appearing in its first 2-A final with first-year Coach Jeff Meredith.  </P> <P> "He's a good catcher, we knew that coming in," Meredith said. "We also knew he  was a good hitter."  </P> <P> Grossmont has good hitters, too. The Foothillers collected 10 hits off Myers  but could not put together for a big inning.  </P> <P> Grossmont had two hits in the first, second, third and fifth innings. Eight of  the nine Grossmont batters had at least one hit -- John Tatum and Danny Lennon  had two each.  </P> <P> In three playoff games, Tatum was 10 for 11 with two triples and two doubles.  Entering the game, he had nine consecutive hits, but he struck out his first  time up.  </P> <P> "We hit the ball well, but we couldn't put the hits together," Meredith said.  "When (Myers) needed to get tough, he did. I'll give him the credit. He did a  real fine job. Kent Smith struck out two times all year, and (Myers) struck him  out twice today."  </P> <P> Smith's second strikeout was Myers' eighth (fourth in the final two innings)  and the final out of the game.  </P> <P> "I just tried to throw as hard as I could," said Myers, a senior who is headed  for Pepperdine. "I went out there with the attitude that I'm not going to let  up unless I drop dead. Ever since I've been at Carlsbad, this is what I've  wanted."  </P> <P> It took Myers (12-3) 107 pitches, 69 strikes, but he did it.  </P> <P> "He wasn't struggling," Taylor said. "He was making good pitches. They were  just hitting them. They were probably the best hitting team we played."  </P> <P> In the bottom of the first, Grossmont loaded the bases with no outs. Greg  Layson and Lenny Van Every singled, and Todd Cady was aboard on Carlsbad's only  error. Taylor then caught Cady wandering too far off first, but Layson scored  while Cady was in a rundown. Myers then struck out Smith and Tatum.  </P> <P> Carlsbad took a 2-1 lead in the third. Leadoff hitter Bryan Black (two for  three, two runs and an RBI) drove home Ron Bynes (two for three) with a triple  that one-hopped against the center-field fence. Black scored on a grounder by  Myers.  </P> <P> Grossmont regained the lead, 3-2, in the bottom of the third. Van Every, who  had walked, scored on Tatum's single to right, and Smith, who had singled,  scored on a wild pitch.  </P> <P> Then came the fifth and Carlsbad's five runs. Black led off with a bunt single.  Larry Griffith grounded to second, but Lennon made a throwing error trying to  get Black at second. Myers was intentionally walked, and pinch-hitter Chris  Greene walked to force home Black and tie the score, 3-3.  </P> <P> Taylor hit the first pitch from starter Mark Gapski (8-3) into the gap in right  center. That was all for Gapski, who had thrown a three-hitter in Saturday's  10-0 semifinal victory over Rancho Buena Vista and 1 1/3 innings in the 19-7  victory over St. Augustine the previous Thursday.  </P> <P> Lennon came on in relief and was greeted with a two-run single by Brian Vasey,  giving the Lancers a 7-3 lead.  </P> <P> Grossmont scored one more in its half of the fifth. Cady tripled to right  center and scored on a sacrifice fly by Smith.  </P> <P> Myers retired the final six batters.  </P></p>

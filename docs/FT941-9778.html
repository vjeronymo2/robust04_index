			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses volatile, reflect US equity sentiment Overnight weakness on Wall Street weighed on bourses for most of the day, and a modest early rally in the Dow yesterday on producer price inflation figures was petering out as late-closing bourses came to the finishing line, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT, waiting for a resolution to the metal wage negotiations, saw the Dax index fall 28.35 to 2,090.61 on the session, 2.2 per cent down on the week, and recover to 2,108.77 in the post bourse. Turnover fell from DM9.9bn to DM9.6bn. The day, like the week, was marked by weakness in banks and strength in the automotive sector, said Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, BMW and Daimler recovering well in the afternoon and Continental, up DM2.80 to DM259.30 against the trend, reflecting a 3-5 per cent price increase by its General Tire subsidiary in the US. VDO Schindling preferred soared DM62, or 23 per cent to DM328.50 on the DM330 bid for outstanding stock from its majority shareholder, Mannesmann. Metallgesellschaft's Buderus subsidiary rose DM32.50 to DM647.50 on a 37 per cent rise in profits in the December quarter. PARIS featured Canal Plus, the pay television group, as the reorganisation of its shareholding structure was put into place. Under the new arrangement the three main shareholders, Havas, Generale des Eaux and Societe Generale will regroup their holdings into one. Havas will have a controlling interest under the new arrangement, and its shares rose FFr4.00 on the day to FFr472.50. Canal Plus lost FFr15 to FFr1,088, Generale FFr11 to FFr2,776 and SocGen FFr8 to FFr700. In the broader market activity was restrained, leaving the CAC-40 off 21.68 at 2,275.09, a week's loss of 2.4 per cent. AMSTERDAM's day fell into two segments: morning weakness in reaction to Wall Street, and a recovery later on the early Wall Street trend. The AEX index ended off 2.95 at 434.37, up from the day's low of 428.89, for a week's fall of 0.6 per cent. Royal Dutch went against the trend on strong US support, said brokers at MeesPierson in Amsterdam, and closed Fl 3.70 higher at Fl 215.40. It was also lifted by good results from BP on Thursday. KNP BT came in with results much in line with expectations, to close off 80 cents at Fl 49.70, while Fokker, one of the week's most active issues, dipped 60 cents to Fl 23.10, a week's rise of 5.5 per cent. ZURICH picked up its lows but the SMI index shed 26.5 to 2,985.7, for a 5.7 per cent fall on the week. Mr Hans Kaufmann at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich noted that the market had made encouraging starts to several recent sessions before sales of derivative instruments linked to blue chip stocks had led the cash market lower. He added that much of the selling came from institutions, while foreign sales had swelled trading volumes as investors took profits and, at the same time, booked currency gains. Ascom bearers plunged SFr60 or 4.7 per cent to SFr1,220: the troubled telecommunications group announced late on Thursday that its chief financial officer was leaving with immediate effect. Motor-Columbus, the energy and telecommunications group, fell SFr30 to SFr1,720 after a UBS board member said that the bank wanted to sell part of its near-40 per cent stake. MILAN finished flat, the Comit index rising 0.88 to 680.71 for a 1.3 per cent gain on the week. Kleinwort Benson, which maintains its overweight recommendation, said that investors were betting on a left wing victory in next month's elections. Banks were mixed after Thursday's warning from Moody's, the US credit ratings agency, that downward pressure on their credit ratings will persist over the next few years. Credito Italiano fell L28 to L2,614. BCI, subject to a stream of bullish analysts' reports ahead of privatisation, added L60 to L5,530. Ferruzzi put on L142 or 7 per cent to L2,184 amid speculation that a public buy offer could be triggered by changes in the holding's share structure following the capital increase which closed on Wednesday. Snia, Fiat's chemicals and synthetic fibres subsidiary, added L55 to L1,990 amid renewed speculation that it may be sold. MADRID ended 3.32 lower at 347.98 after 344.65. The general index was down 2.4 per cent in the week. Turnover was Pta48.4bn. Telefonica fell Pta60 to Pta2,060 on a judgement of Solomon from Goldman Sachs, which said it had removed the company from its European priority and recommended lists, but continued to rate is as a market performer in the US.

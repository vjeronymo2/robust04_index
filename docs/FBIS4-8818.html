			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Note by Marcela Feraru: "Vladimir Zhirinovskiy Announced </F> That He Wants To Come to Romania"]    [Text] Our special correspondent in Strasbourg, during the  proceedings of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of  Europe, obtained an exclusive interview for EVENIMENTUL ZILEI  with Russian ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the  man who troubled the waters of the current parliamentary session  of the European forum.    "It was not I who said that the Romanians are Italian  Gypsies, but a friend of mine in Bulgaria. I do not know what  Romania is, but I intend to go there. There are certain actions  of Romania against Moldova, which is a Russian land. Romania  has to eliminate its territorial problems. You have problems  with Moldova, Bulgaria, and Hungary and you have no army, which  is very bad for you. We want to have our own sphere of influence  in Eastern Europe, that is in the former socialist area,  including Poland and Budapest," Vladimir Zhirinovskiy told us.    "Iliescu was friends with Ceausescu. For you, Nicolae  Ceausescu was very good, people loved him, and you were happy  with the old regime," the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia added, basing his affirmations on movies he has seen.    The Russian leader also said that "Iliescu is exactly like  Gorbachev" and that he is expecting an invitation to visit  Romania.</p>

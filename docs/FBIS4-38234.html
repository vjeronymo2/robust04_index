			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Bari] </F>   [Text] In a new strike reflecting the security authorities'  alert, a sabotage cell of six terrorists coming from Pakistan  was arrested as its members tried to infiltrate the country  through Cairo Airport using forged passports.    A senior security source told AL-AHRAM AL-MASA'I that  preliminary investigations with cell members revealed that  terrorist leaders abroad sought to revive terrorist activity in  Egypt after the security agencies destroyed clandestine  terrorist organizations and eliminated their masterminds,  primarily the al-Jihad Organization.    The source added that the sabotage cell members had arrived  to regroup the terrorists and resume attacks on important  popular sites to cause the greatest possible damage and prove to  people at home and abroad that they still exist.    The source affirmed that $6,000 and sketches of targeted  installations were seized with the group in addition to several  bank account numbers to which the necessary funds are  transferred from abroad.</p>

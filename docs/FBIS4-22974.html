			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in NAUKA I ZHIZN] </F>   [Text] What do we mean by ``good memory''? Usually we mean  reliability, then capacity, and finally the speed at which we  can extract the required information. It's the same for human  and machine memory.    People have long used external information carriers to  expand  their memory. At one time people used a string tied around the  finger, later any type of note book. The same thing has happened  with computers: the volume of their memory has been increased by  using external carriers. First, they were mechanical (punched  cards and paper tape), later, magnetic tapes and disks, and most  recently, optical disks. The latter are favorably distinguished  from the others by their basic parameters. However, they are  produced by only a few Japanese and American firms and are used  on a very limited basis, mainly due to their high cost.    Specialists at the Institute for Problems in Recording  Information of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences have created  their own version of an optical information carrier. It is not a  disk, but a glass cylinder with a recording layer on the  internal surface. A light beam is used to create pits on it,  each of which corresponds to a one in binary code. At the time  of recording, to increase the density, the cylinder is immersed  in a liquid medium. When the beam passes through the liquid it  is not scattered. Normally the beam would be scatt ered due to  the difference in the indices of refraction of the laser and  air. In this case, the beam remains focused. The diameter of the  pit does not exceed 0.6 microns. This new carrier has a record  high recording density. Its other specifications ar e comparable  with those of the optical disk, and it has the same serious  chances for improvement. The cylindrical memory is suitable for  many uses, and the information on it can be rewritten. Another  advantage is its small size: the optical memory cylinder has the  same dimensions as a fountain pen. As for its cost, its creators  hope that it will cost significantly less than foreign optical  disks.</p>

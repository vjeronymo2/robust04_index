			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: E Europe pressed to cut public spending GOVERNMENTS in eastern Europe should sharply reduce public spending and reform their tax systems if they are to improve on the 'dismal and disappointing' performances of their economies since the fall of communism, according to the BIS. The bank says that after a collapse in output last year in several of the nations of the former communist bloc, prospects of a return to growth are poor. The region faces dangers of prolonged high unemployment and 'reform fatigue'. Many of the nations continue to suffer high inflation, delays in privatising state-owned enterprises, large government deficits and poorly developed taxation systems and financial markets. Reforms in much of the region should be aimed at reducing the size of the public sector relative to gross domestic product. Subsidies to inefficient enterprises should be cut, leaving room for an increase in public investment. Failure to reduce state spending in this way could lead to the need to impose punitive tax rates, which would further reduce growth prospects, the BIS says. Weaknesses in the present tax systems include their emphasis on taxing profits of mainly state-owned enterprises, rather than taking a proportion of the incomes of households. Also, the levels at which the tax systems claw revenues from economic activity are mostly established with reference to prices set by the state rather than those determined by the market. Shifting the burden of taxation from the state-owned enterprises requires 'an extension of the tax administration to cover households and private enterprises, including the adoption of an unambiguous definition of profits and accounting rules for depreciation and deduction of interest payments'. It says that of the nations in the region, only Hungary has attempted to introduce a system of value added tax directed at taxing goods with reference to market prices.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Decision time for O&amp;Y in the US  -A row threatens to derail Dollars 5.3bn debt talks Mr Cyrus Vance is due to tell a New York judge today whether he has had more success in brokering a peace agreement among squabbling creditors of Olympia &amp; York than he had among the warring factions of Bosnia. In a business version of shuttle diplomacy, the former US secretary of state has spent the past 10 days meeting the various protagonists separately. He has asked them not to talk to the press or to each other. One of the parties predicts that he is more likely to submit a progress report today than the terms of a full peace settlement. Mr Vance was approached in a last-ditch effort to break a deadlock over the appointment of a new board of directors for Olympia &amp; York Real Estate USA, the crippled Canadian developer's 80 per cent owned US subsidiary. The row over the directors has wider ramifications, however, for the company, one arm of O&amp;Y which has so far managed to avoid the protection of a bankruptcy court. In particular, it threatens to derail painstaking negotiations to restructure USDollars 5.3bn in debt owed by the US subsidiary to about two dozen separate groups of lenders. The US unit's secured creditors are backing demands by its management for greater autonomy from Olympia &amp; York Developments (OYDL), the Toronto-based parent company. OYDL emerged from bankruptcy protection last month, and is now run by a court-appointed administrator. The administrator, Mr Robert Lowe, an insolvency specialist in the Toronto office of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, is assisted by a five-member 'monitoring committee' representing OYDL's unsecured shareholders. The committee is chaired by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, OYDL's biggest creditor. The US subsidiary, led by former New York deputy mayor John Zuccotti, believes that a degree of independence from Toronto would expedite the US restructuring plan, as well as maintain the stability and values of O&amp;Y's US properties, which include the 7.6m sq ft World Financial Centre in lower Manhattan. Central to the demands of the US unit and its creditors is the inclusion of three independent directors, based in New York, on the board of O&amp;Y USA. Mr Zuccotti and the secured lenders have accused the administrator and the monitoring committee in Toronto of stonewalling the appointment of an independent board. According to an affidavit submitted by Mr Zuccotti last week, the committee and the administrator also do not see eye to eye over which of them controls the US subsidiary. Mr Zuccotti said that this situation has made it 'virtually impossible for me to properly perform my duties'. Spokesmen for both the monitoring committee and the administrator have denied Mr Zuccotti's assertion. With no US board in place to take decisions or set policy guidelines, the debt talks have ground to a halt. A lawyer for one group of Japanese creditors says that a successful debt plan is 'almost impossible' without a resolution of the corporate governance issues. The dispute over the independence of the US board also appears to be part of an inevitable jockeying for position among different classes of creditors. An official at one bank involved in the negotiations notes that the present market value of the US properties is not enough to cover even the claims of fully-secured creditors. They will be forced to take 'a pretty sizeable haircut,' he predicts. Matters are complicated however, by the overlapping interests of some creditors. Two secured creditors of the US operations, Sanwa Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, are also members of the Canadian monitoring committee of unsecured creditors. CIBC and Sanwa have opposed moves by the rest of the committee to keep control of the US board in Canada. Citibank, which has spearheaded efforts by the US creditors to obtain greater independence for O&amp;Y USA, was co-chairman of the Canadian unsecured creditors committee which approved the parent company's restructuring plan. One banker accuses Citibank of displaying 'a degree of schizophrenia'. For his part, Mr Lowe noted in a statement last month that he has a fiduciary responsibility to about 100 international creditors of OYDL, many of them in the US. The tangled negotiations raise the prospect that O&amp;Y USA may, in the end, be unable to avoid the same fate as its parent. An official at one secured lender predicts that the wrangling among creditors will eventually force all the group's US properties into the bankruptcy courts. Mr Zuccotti noted in his recent affidavit that 'the expense and complexity is multiplying . . . The process that has emerged has erected barriers to communication, presents a constant threat to credibility, and provides an image of apparent confusion in decision-making.' But O&amp;Y USA also insists that talks with several creditor groups have made substantial progress. A number of properties have already been sold or handed over to creditors. There are plans to sell others, notably a 33-storey building in Portland, Oregon. A spokesman says the company is 'quite confident that it has a very good shot at accomplishing (a debt-restructuring)' if the dispute over the board of directors can be settled.</p>

Kim Yong-sun, who was sacked as a candidate Politburo member  in December, has been placed in charge of affairs with the  United States, the sources said.    Kim met with U.S. Undersecretary of State Arnold Kanter in  New York in January 1992 for the highest level contact ever  between the two nations to discuss concerns arising from North  Korea's suspected program to develop an atomic arsenal.    North Korea and the U.S. held two rounds of talks at the  vice ministerial level last June and July aimed at resolving the  impasse over international inspections of North Korea's  suspected nuclear facilities.    Pyongyang has indicated a desire to upgrade the contacts  after the third round meeting, which has not yet been held.    Kim, who has served in a number of foreign relations  positions in the Workers Party and in the government over the  years, was removed as a candidate Politburo member in a party  reshuffle last month.    Meanwhile, the vice chairman for the party's section on  reunification of the Korean peninsula, Kang Chu-il, was placed  in charge of working-level affairs with South Korea, which had  been directed by Kim, the sources said.    They expected little change in Pyongyang's South Korea  policies in the wake of Kang's appointment.    With the recent political revival of Kim Yong-chu, the  younger brother of North Korean President Kim Il-song, there  have been reports that the younger Kim would have a special hand  in South Korean affairs.</p>

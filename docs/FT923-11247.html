			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Motoring: Let's take a brake, dear - The British fondness for estate cars IN BRITAIN, estate cars always have had overtones of broad acres, labradors and well-cut tweeds. Even today, older motorists still call them shooting brakes. It was not like that on the continent where the estate was reckoned to be a trade vehicle, halfway between a car and a van. (Curiously, the French, who have always made some of the best estate cars, still speak of them as 'breaks.' No, I don't know why they spell it that way, either). The first German maker to acknowledge that up-market buyers might want a nicely-furnished estate car for carrying such things as saddles, not sacks of cement, was Mercedes-Benz. For some years, its 200-300T range of estates has been an industry benchmark. Audi (first with the slant-tailed 100/200 Avant, then the new 100 estate) and BMW (3-series and 5-series Touring) got in on the act. Now comes a new, more compact, dual-purpose Audi developed from the 80 saloon. On mainland Europe, it will be called the 80 Avant; in Britain - where it will not be available until early 1993 - it will simply be the 80 estate. A seven-model range goes on sale in Germany in October. Three have four-cylinder engines (two-litre petrol developing 90 and 115 horsepower plus a 1.9-litre, 90-horsepower, direct-injection turbo-diesel). All are front-wheel driven. There are front-wheel and four-wheel driven quattro versions of 80 Avants with five-cylinder, 133-horsepower or 150-horsepower, 2.6-litre V6 engines. Power steering and a five-speed manual gearbox are standard; automatic transmission will be optional only on two front-wheel driven models, a four-cylinder and a V6. Like all Audis, the new 80 Avants have the Pro-Con Ten system that tightens front-seat belts and retracts the steering wheel in a crash severe enough to shift the engine backwards. ABS brakes are fitted to all 80 Avant quattro models and on the front-wheel driven 2.6E, but are an optional extra on the others. Prices and the UK market specifications are still being discussed. In Britain, though, Audi 100 estates are only Pounds 721 more than the equivalent saloons. If the Audi 80 estates were available now, an educated guess would price them from Pounds 14,500 for the entry two-litre model to more than Pounds 22,000 for the V6-engined quattro. That would make the least expensive 80 estate about Pounds 1,400 cheaper than a BMW 318i Touring, which Audi clearly has in its sights. In Germany earlier this month, I sampled three of the new estates: a V6, the turbo-diesel and a five-cylinder quattro. The V6 was particularly refined and still very quiet at an indicated 130 mph (209 kmh) even though its low overall gearing put the rev. counter needle at close to 6,000. The higher-geared turbo-diesel was almost as tranquil cruising at 100 mph (161 kmh) on the autobahn although, naturally, it felt far less urgent. Buyers may find some compensation in its claimed average 52.3 mpg (5.4 l/100 km) fuel consumption. On dry and generally smooth roads, the advantages of the 2.2-litre, five-cylinder quattro's expensive all-wheel drive transmission were not obvious because the front-wheel driven cars gripped and handled so well. It would, though, have been a different matter on the snowy mountain pass where I so nearly got stuck in a Renault Safrane some weeks ago. The rear seat back-rest and cushion fold to make a flat, fully-carpeted load floor. You have to remove the rear seat head-rests first. But - a thoughtful touch  -Audi provides holes into which the head-rest supports can slot so they will not get lost or dirty on the floor.</p>

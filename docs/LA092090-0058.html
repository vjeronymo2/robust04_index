			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SONY EXPANDS LINE OF DIGITAL AUDIO RECORDERS;  </P> <P> ELECTRONICS: THE FIRM WANTS TO ESTABLISH A MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES BEFORE A  SUIT SEEKING TO BAN THEIR IMPORTATION COMES TO COURT.  </P> <P> Under pressure to establish digital audio tape recorders in the U.S. market  after a recent lawsuit challenging their importation, Sony Corp. on Wednesday  introduced portable and car DAT machines to boost consumer interest in the  costly and controversial products.  </P> <P> Introduction of Sony's $1,100 car DAT player and the $850 Walkman portable DAT  recorder comes two months after Los Angeles songwriter Sammy Cahn and four  others filed a class-action lawsuit seeking to block U.S. sales of Sony's  digital audiotape recorders.  </P> <P> The plaintiffs, who filed the lawsuit July 9 on behalf of 40,000 American  songwriters and music publishers, accused Sony of infringing their music  copyrights because DAT recorders are able to make near-perfect copies of  recorded material.  </P> <P> DAT players, which achieve high-quality sound with digital technology similar  to that of compact discs, have long been available for cars from companies such  as Kenwood and Clarion. But so far only Sony has braved objections from  composers and offered DAT recorders.  </P> <P> Michael S. Oberman, lawyer for the songwriter plaintiffs, said Wednesday that  the lawsuit was not ready for trial. But several experts said Sony's decision  to quickly expand its lineup of digital audiotape machines was made to improve  its chances for fighting the case.  </P> <P> "A judge is more likely to grant an injunction (barring sales of DAT recorders)  before Sony has made a big investment in DAT," said Paul Gluckman, managing  editor of Audioweek, an industry trade publication. "Plus, I think the company  wants to get other suppliers off the fence" regarding the introduction of DAT  machines.  </P> <P> A knowledgeable Sony spokesman could not be reached for comment Wednesday. But  in a prepared statement, the company said brisk sales of its two home DAT  recorders prompted it to accelerate its plans to market car and portable units  in the United States.  </P> <P> Sony's move drew praise from competitor Technics, the Secaucus, N.J.-based  consumer electronics arm of Japan's Matsushita Electric Co.  </P> <P> "I think it's good and healthy for the market; I wish we did it first," said  Paul Foschino, assistant general manager of Technics, which plans to introduce  a $900 home DAT recorder later this month. "But regardless of who introduces  them first, the idea of having more DAT players is increasing enthusiasm."  </P> <P> Ironically, Sony reached agreement with Ford Motor Co. more than 18 months ago  to offer DAT players as an option on selected Ford and Lincoln/Mercury cars.  But the auto maker later dropped plans to offer the players.  </P> <P> "DAT players were virtually useless because there were no (prerecorded) tapes  available," said Rex Greenslade, spokesman for Ford's automotive component  group. "Certainly the technology is very promising, and we remain interested if  and when DAT becomes a viable market."  </P></p>

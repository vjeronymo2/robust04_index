			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: Battle to seize control of Astra Intl stepped up THE BATTLE for control of Astra International, Indonesia's biggest motor group, intensified yesterday with Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusomo, Astra chairman, blocking the proposed sale of 44.6 per cent of the company by the Soeryadjaya family, its majority shareholders. In a related development, government officials yesterday confirmed a liquidation order had been placed on Bank Summa, which is privately-owned by the Soeryadjaya family. The bank has outstanding obligations of Rp1,600bn (Dollars 780m). It owes about Rp890bn to depositors, Rp300bn to the central bank and around Rp400bn to commercial banks. At the weekend, the Soeryadjayas reached agreement for the sale of 108m shares in Astra with a consortium led by Mr Prajogo Pangestu, who controls a substantial timber business. The consortium is acting under the umbrella of Yayasan Pasetya Mulya, a management institute reportedly funded by members of Indonesia's Chinese business community. Brokers say the consortium includes Mr Liem Sioe Liong, who runs the Salim Group, and Mr Eka Wijaya, head of the Sinar Mas Group. In September, the Soeryadjayas agreed not to sell Astra shares without Mr Sumitro's approval. Mr Sumitro said Toyota Motor of Japan, the vehicles of which provided half of Astra's Rp4,933bn turnover in 1991, opposed the sale due to the consortium's composition. 'I am responsible for maintaining the relationship with Toyota Motor management,' he said. Government officials, however, suggested the liquidation of Bank Summa may result in Mr Sumitro losing his right of veto. The Soeryadjaya family, prior to their agreement with Mr Sumitro, had pledged 100m shares in Astra against a loan of Rp500bn from a consortium of three banks.</p>

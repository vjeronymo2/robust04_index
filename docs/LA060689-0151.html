			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 25 LAYERS CHIPPED OFF: 'COCA-COLA' SEES LIGHT  </P> <P> A pharmacist has uncovered what is believed to be the first sign advertising  Coca-Cola, one which set the stage for one of the most successful advertising  efforts in the country, historians said.  </P> <P> Dean Cox, owner of Young Brothers Pharmacy in Cartersville, said the  95-year-old Coca-Cola logo painted on the side of his century-old building was  uncovered by restoration experts who chipped off 25 layers of paint. Old timers  had told him the sign was there and a photo in an old hometown newspaper  confirmed its existence.  </P> <P> Historians hired by the Coca-Cola Co., which is based in Atlanta, said they  believe the Cartersville sign was the first ever to advertise Coke, which was  invented in Atlanta in 1886.  </P> <P> Cox and historians have suggested the sign was created by James Couden, a  traveling Coca-Cola salesman who offered to paint the wall free if he could  also paint on the trademark, a practice that continues today in many countries.  </P> <P> Wall signs were Coke's main form of advertising during its early years. In  1905, the company allocated 10% of its advertising budget for painted signs and  increased that to 25% in 1910. By 1922, there were 16,000 Coca-Cola signs.  </P> <P> Coke historians believe the wall signs have made Coca-Cola one of the world's  best-known trademarks.  </P></p>

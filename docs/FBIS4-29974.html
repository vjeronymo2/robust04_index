			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station editorial: "A Diplomat in Phnom Penh Says Cambodia, </F> Which is Facing All Kinds of National and Social Problems, Is in  Urgent Need of Political Reform"]    [Text] Recently, an Asian diplomat, who asked to remain  anonymous, said that the Cambodian people under the government  of the two prime ministers are suffering in all aspects due to  national and social problems. The situation in Cambodia remains  serious, despite the fact that the UNTAC [UN Transitional  Authority in Cambodia] spent $2 billion to remedy it. War has  continued, and nothing has been resolved. More aggressor  Vietnamese forces have continued to flow into Cambodia.  Meanwhile, the government with two prime ministers has  continued to provoke the war, attacking the people and patriotic  forces. The meager sum of foreign financial aid has been spent  on the military and war operations. Therefore, no efforts for  national reconstruction have been made. Even roads in Phnom  Penh have not been repaired.    The economy does not exist because all the money has been  drained by the war. The people are displaced, thus they have no  chance to be productive. Some areas that could produce a small  amount could hardly meet their own need. This is why there are  no products for export in exchange for foreign currency. The  officials in the government with two prime ministers are very  corrupt.    This diplomat added that there are currently internal rifts  within the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent,  Neutral Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia]. They oppose Prince  Ranariddh, who has pursued a dictatorial policy and associated  himself with the Cambodian People's Party [CPC] and especially  with Hun Sen. Ranariddh does not listen to anyone. He listens  only to the orders of the United States, France, Australia, and  particularly the communist Vietnamese through Hun Sen, Sar  Kheng, and Chea Sim. This is why, although the communist  Vietnamese have moved the border markers 20 to 30 kilometers  inside Cambodia, Ranariddh has said nothing.    Due to these national and social problems, the people of all  circles are very worried about the fate of the nation and  people. Therefore, there have been demands that power be given  to King Norodom Sihanouk for a few years so that he can settle  national problems by forming a national salvation government  with the king as the prime minister and four deputy prime  ministers, namely, Prince Ranariddh, Hun Sen, (?Sam Rangsi), and  Khieu Samphan. Only by so doing can the serious national and  social problems be resolved.</p>

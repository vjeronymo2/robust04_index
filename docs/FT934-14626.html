			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Parkdean shares up 8p on first day Shares in Parkdean Leisure, the holiday park operator, ended their first day of dealings at 128p, compared with the 120p issue price. Mr Graham Wilson, managing director, said he was pleased with the shares' reception on the market and it was 'a solid start' to life as a public company. The group currently owns seven parks but wants to expand by acquisition, using funds made available through the flotation. Parkdean believes it can add new parks without a corresponding rise in overheads. Mr Wilson said he had already had calls from people with parks to sell. The shares had been placed with institutions. Turnover was 1.29m shares. It is thought that one of the venture capital backers took advantage of the price rise to sell some of its shares. Two of its parks in East Anglia have been affected by floods, but its insurance is expected to cover any damage.</p>

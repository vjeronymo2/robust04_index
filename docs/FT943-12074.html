			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Cool reaction to hot problem: David Lascelles examines the costs of making defunct nuclear power stations safe I bet it will read nought when we come out again,' said Peter Webster, picking up a small radiation meter. And through the gates we went. Before us stood two gutted buildings, the remains of Berkeley, the UK's first commercial nuclear power generator, on the banks of the Severn estuary. Shut down in 1989, the station is being decommissioned in the first exercise of its kind in the UK, and one of the few in the world. We clambered over rusting pipework, peered into cooling ponds and ended up standing on top of one of the station's two nuclear reactors. A team of men was washing it down with solvent. They were not clad in thick protective clothing, just overalls and gloves. And they chatted as they worked. All rather ordinary, considering that beneath their feet stood a graphite core which had once contained highly radioactive fuel rods. 'Radioactivity is like powder,' said Webster, the station manager. 'If it is on the surface, you can usually wipe it off.' Later, when we left the site, the dosimeter did indeed read nought. 'It's a fairly mundane activity, decommissioning,' said Webster. 'It's just construction in reverse.' His offhand remarks were meant to sound cool. The nuclear industry is keen to put across the message that defunct nuclear power stations can be made safe. But whether it can do it efficiently and within budget is one of the important tests of the nuclear review which the government is now conducting. According to the National Audit Office, the UK's nuclear clean-up bill amounts to some Pounds 18bn for decommissioning 18 power stations and 17 other radioactive sites, such as British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield. But it does not include the Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn recently added to the Atomic Energy Authority, whose original budget was understated 'because of optimistic assumptions and significant omissions' - a miscalculation which underlined the uncertainty that clouds the decommissioning debate. The cost of this clean-up falls mostly on the electricity consumer, who pays a 10 per cent levy in England and Wales and an artificially high price for electricity in Scotland. But these arrangements are being phased out, and the nuclear industry is supposed to be self-financing by 1998. In Berkeley's case, the clean-up is one of the more difficult that faces Nuclear Electric, its owner. As the first of its generation, the station was clumsily engineered. The two reactors contained 85,000 fuel rods, and were connected to tall heat exchangers by hundreds of yards of large-diameter piping. The heat exchangers were smothered in smaller pipes and coated in asbestos. All this metalwork was contaminated internally by radioactive water. The decommissioning of Berkeley began in 1989, and is proceeding in three stages. In the first, the fuel rods were individually removed, stripped of their cladding and shipped to Sellafield. Over nearly three years, that disposed of more than 99 per cent of the high-level radioactive waste. The work is now in the second stage. This will get Berkeley into a condition where it can be left for many decades while the remaining radioactivity decays. For this, the large pipework has been chopped up and sealed off. The heat exchangers are being cleaned and laid on their sides, and the buildings weather-proofed. Intermediate-level waste, which includes the fuel rod cladding, is also being removed. This will be stored in concrete vaults on the Berkeley site, because the government cannot agree on plans for a national store  - which is another issue for the review. The second stage of Berkeley's decommissioning is due to finish at the end of next year. What happens after that is a matter of some debate. Government policy requires Nuclear Electric to remove the most dangerous waste and leave the station in a safe condition for 100 years, at which point it can be taken to bits. But Nuclear Electric is trying to promote a more extended timetable. At future stations, it wants to postpone the completion of stage two (that is dismantling all but the most contaminated parts) for 100 years. After that, it would dismantle the reactor and either return the site to greenfield condition, or mound the remains over. This longer timetable would benefit Nuclear Electric in two ways: it would reduce costs, because much of the radioactivity would have decayed by the time the company came to deal with the most contaminated sections. It would also enable Nuclear Electric's financial provisions to accumulate interest over a longer period, enabling the company to discount them much more deeply and set less money aside in the first place. The company estimates the total discounted cost of decommissioning all its sites would be Pounds 1.9bn under the longer timetable, compared with Pounds 2.7bn at present. The modified policy would raise the commercial appeal of the nuclear power industry and make it more suitable for privatisation. Another argument in support of a long timetable is that nuclear waste technology is likely to improve over time, which could further simplify decommissioning. As it is, Nuclear Electric claims that the experience gained at Berkeley suggests cost estimates are too high. The first stage - the removal of the fuel rods - cost Pounds 40m compared with an estimate of Pounds 70m. The second stage looks like beating its Pounds 120m budget. The third stage, which would include looking after Berkeley for a century and returning it to a greenfield site, is estimated at Pounds 300m. But the extended timetable has been attacked from a number of quarters. In a report, published this spring, the Science Policy Research Unit of Brighton University, a leading academic centre for energy studies, says that long-term decommissioning runs serious financial risks. If a station had to be shut down early, there would not be sufficient provisions to finance a clean-up. Also, small errors in forecasting interest rates could lead to large shortfalls in provisions. The SPRU study also argues that, while decommissioning technology might improve, environmental standards would probably be raised, so the cost hurdle might not fall. The main focus of environmental concern is the risk of leaving a radioactive site for this long, even in a cocoon. Green groups point out that other countries, such as France and the US, have much shorter timetables for decommissioning. But their stations are based on pressurised water technology, which is simpler than the UK gas-based system. In Wales, environmentalists plan to fight proposals to decommission the next plant on Nuclear Electric's list: Trawsfynydd in Snowdonia. Their opposition is based largely on the danger of mothballing a radioactive site in an earthquake zone, but they also argue that every generation should clean up its own mess. The SPRU report supports this view: 'Even if future generations will have to do the work and bear the health risk, they should not be left a financial burden as well.' One option the government will have to consider is whether the state should underwrite the cost of cleaning up existing nuclear power stations. This would free Nuclear Electric from a heavy financial burden. But it would merely shift the cost of provisions from the electricity consumer to the taxpayer. And anything that reduced the cost to the nuclear industry would strengthen the case for getting decommissioning over as quickly as possible.</p>

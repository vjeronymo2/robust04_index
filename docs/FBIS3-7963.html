			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 1 March (TANJUG) -- Commenting on the  downing of planes near Banja Luka yesterday, FRY [Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia] President Zoran Lilic said today that  "not a single aircraft has flown toward Bosnia-Herzegovina from  FRY territory for two years now, i.e, since the FRY was set up."    In reply to a question about the incident near Banja Luka,  Lilic pointed out that NATO was in the best position to say what  had happened because NATO used AWACS monitoring systems that  should know where the planes took off and where they landed.  Lilic said that the FRY was against the use of force regardless  of who used it.</p>

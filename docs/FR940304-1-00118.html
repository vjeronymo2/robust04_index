Cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data were also provided by these sources. The electronic controls referred to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy and the Rocky Mountain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institute cannot be evaluated by the DOE test procedure.

Therefore, this design option was not analyzed by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Costing Analysis of Design Options for Residential Appliances and Space Conditioning Equipment,'' Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, prepared by ADM Associates, Inc., Purchase No. 4541710, December 1987, ``Energy Efficient Electrical Product Knowledge Base,'' Canadian Electrical Association, prepared by ORTECH International, C.E.A.

The Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers commented that though solid disk elements are inherently less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient than open coil elements, they should be a separate class because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the additional utility in their ease of cleaning. (Association of Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 39, 40). With regard to radiant and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> halogen elements under glass, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commented that not only are these cooktops easy to clean because of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smooth surfaces, but additional work space is gained when the cooktop surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not in use. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers also stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the recommended cookware for halogen elements are metal pots and pans,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since glass and ceramic cookware are not good heat conductors. (Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 40, 41). The Association of Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers stated that since induction elements heat items by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferring electromagnetic energy, the glass or ceramic countertop under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which they lie is unaffected and remains relatively cool. This also means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the cookware used with induction elements must be made from magnetic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers listed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following advantages of induction cooking: fast response and control of heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source, ease of cleaning (since food spills do not burn onto the cooking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface), and the ability to heat utensils that are not flat. The Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Home Appliance Manufacturers pointed out that because the DOE test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure uses non-magnetic aluminum blocks, it is not suitable for testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> induction elements. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No.61A at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 41&hyph;43).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the discussion of product classes, the Department has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established two classes for electric cooktops (open coil and smooth), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that radiant, halogen, and induction elements offer no consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility which prevents them from being analyzed as design options for smooth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooktops. Solid disk elements are treated as the baseline unit for smooth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooktops. Data provided by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooktop manufacturers, suppliers, and a published report <FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>  were used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis of smooth cooktops. Data were provided which evaluated radiant,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> halogen, and induction elements according to the DOE test procedure. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department test results were obtained for induction elements by attaching a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ferro-magnetic material to the aluminum test block. As with open coil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements, different types of tests based on boiling water have been used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate electronic controls for smooth cooktops. But boiling water tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have yet to be standardized by DOE as a method to rate cooktops. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this design option was not analyzed by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> M.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Albanian-Serb Dialogue Through </F> Mediation of a Third Party -- Key Question in the Hogg-Rugova  Talks -- Press Conference of the British Minister of State Hogg  and President of Kosova Rugova"]    [Text] Tirana, May 6 (ATA) -- "There are problems in  bringing about a reconciliation between the points of view of  the Serbs and those of the Albanian community", the British  minister of state Douglas Hogg said yesterday in Pristina. He  said that ``the Serbs have shown readiness to allow local  governing and autonomy, but within the expanded borders of  Serbia.    "I also know that the Albanian community considers this  solution as unjust", Mr. Hogg said.    "The international community holds that a constant control  is  indispensable to make sure that the Albanians attain broader  political rights in Kosova", he said.    Hogg said that the aim of his visit to Kosova was to  negotiate further developments, express his views on Rugova's  moderated policy "which is absolutely right and in the long-term  interest of the Albanian population".    Mr. Rugova assessed this high-ranking visit as "a special  honour" and confirmed that they discussed the possibility of  opening the dialogue through the mediation of a third party.    "As any party, we, too, have our own views on the talks. We  must negotiate without prejudices", said Rugova, who reiterated  the stance of the Kosovar Albanians on an independent and  neutral Kosova.</p>

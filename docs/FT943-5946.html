			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Broadgate suitors agog at Pounds 1.5bn value Potential buyers of Broadgate Properties, the City property investment company owned jointly by Stanhope and Rosehaugh, have been told that the company will be worth Pounds 1.5bn in three years' time, compared with its most recent valuation of Pounds 935m. Jones Lang Wootton, which has been advising Stanhope on Broadgate, has indicated to interested parties that rents, excluding concessions, in Broadgate's core City properties should reach Pounds 50 per sq ft within 18 months. This compares with current estimates of around Pounds 30 per sq ft, which implies an explosion in City property prices back to the peak levels of 1989/1990, which saw average prime rents of Pounds 55 per sq ft. Potential bidders were agog at the price, and dismissed it as an attempt to divert them from Stanhope's weak negotiating position. Stanhope has to restructure its Pounds 160m debt by the end of this year, when its bank lines come under review. Interest has been intensifying in Stanhope, which had a net negative worth of Pounds 15.8m in June 1993, but which still controls a large high quality property portfolio. Mr Stuart Lipton, Stanhope's chief executive, is confident that his portfolio will remain intact. He is keen to arrange a restructuring, enabling Stanhope to buy the Rosehaugh receiver's half of Broadgate, but analysts dismissed this as a pipe dream. It is more likely that Stanhope will have to part with its own stake in the holding company for the Broadgate and Ludgate developments. The front runner for such a purchase is Mr John Ritblat's British Land, which owns 29.9 per cent of Stanhope's shares - sufficient to block any financial reconstruction under Stanhope's quaintly named 'Project Phoenix'. British Land has made no qualms about the fact that its only interest is Broadgate. US securities houses, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, are also known to be interested, and there is a fourth bidder lined up. There has also been renewed interest in Stanhope's debt. Long-Term Credit Bank has found a buyer for Pounds 20m of debt, at a price of around 60p in the pound. It is understood that Bankers Trust is the buyer, but there may be other sub-participants, prepared to gamble on a successful restructuring. Part of the attraction of Stanhope is its pre-emption rights over Rosehaugh's Broadgate stake. Mr Tim Hayward, senior corporate recovery partner of accountants KPMG Peat Marwick and joint receiver of property group Rosehaugh, said there had been serious expressions of interest from a number of investors. 'We have repeatedly said we will not be pushed into a sale and have strong support from the Rosehaugh's bankers.' JLW have argued that activity in the City property market is picking up at a time when the supply of new quality space remains limited, providing the potential for rental increases. Lex, Page 24</p>

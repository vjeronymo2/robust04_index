			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Martre to lose chairman's job at Aerospatiale MR HENRI MARTRE, chairman of Aerospatiale, the French state-owned aerospace group, is to be replaced unexpectedly by Mr Louis Gallois, head of Snecma, the French state aero-engine company. Mr Gallois' appointment is expected to be confirmed by the French cabinet tomorrow. It had been widely thought the government would extend the Aerospatiale chairman's contract until he retires next February. The change at the helm of Aerospatiale, a 37.9 per cent partner in the Airbus airliner consortium, is one of the few surprises in the current round of top appointments at state-owned French companies. Last week, Mr Francis Lorentz was replaced as chairman of the loss-making Bull computer group by Mr Bernard Pache, head of the French coal board and a former chairman of the Pechiney aluminium group. Yesterday Generales de France (AGF) and Groupe Nationale des Assurances (GAN), two of France's largest state-controlled insurance companies, voted to renominate their chairmen, Mr Michel Albert and Mr Francois Heilbronner. These nominations are expected to be endorsed tomorrow by the government. The board of Union des Assurances de Paris, another state-owned insurance company, meets today, and is expected to renominate its chairman, Mr Jean Peyrelevade. Mr Martre has been steering the Aerospatiale through the slump in civil aviation and the fall in military business caused by the end of the Cold War. He has been a leading figure in the fortunes of Airbus and a strong supporter of European aerospace collaboration. Mr Gallois had long been regarded as a pretender for Mr Martre's job. A key adviser to former Socialist prime minister Mr Laurent Fabius, Mr Gallois has headed Snecma for the past three years where he has sought to carve out a more individual identity for the French aero-engine group closely tied to General Electric of the US. Under Mr Gallois, contacts have improved between the French company and Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine company and one of the main rivals of GE.</p>

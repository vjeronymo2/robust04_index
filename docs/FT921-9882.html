			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Krajina holds out against UN peace plan THE LEADERS of Krajina, the Serb enclave in Croatia, yesterday reaffirmed their resistance to the United Nations peace plan for Yugoslavia, in the face of increased pressure from Serbia to accept the proposals. On the eve of a crucial session of its parliament, Mr Milan Babic, the president of the self-proclaimed Serbian Republic of Krajina, yesterday said: 'A step forward has been made in the plan.' But he continued to oppose a key element of the UN initiative to despatch 10,000 peacekeepers. He said Serb reservists could not be disbanded while Croatia maintained its army. Mr Lazar Macura, Krajina's information minister, added: 'The Yugoslav army no longer exists. There are many army officers who are ready to stay in Krajina, about 30,000 reservists are from the region. . . only the generals who are manipulated by Belgrade will leave.' At the same time, in a move directed by Serbia, a rival parliament in Glina, northern Krajina, was yesterday expected to approve the UN plan. Mr Babic dismissed the manoeuvres by Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, to marginalise the leadership in Knin, the capital of Krajina. He said: 'It (Glina) is not a legitimate session. It is simply a continuation of pressure from Belgrade.' The parliament in Knin is expected to approve today the holding of a referendum on the UN plan, which could break the deadlock between Krajina and Serbia. Mr Babic said: 'If the people approve the plan, I will bow to their will.' Despite Mr Babic's defiance, the inhabitants of Knin, tired of the economic deprivation brought on by the civil war, seem likely to approve the UN plan. 'We want peace. Any plan that will bring us peace,' said one worker. Serbia has denounced Mr Babic as the main obstacle to peace. Serbia last month also cut off Krajina from the monetary system, when it issued new bank notes. The Yugoslav dinars currently circulating in Knin are practically worthless, valid only in Krajina.</p>

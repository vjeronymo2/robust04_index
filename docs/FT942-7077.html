			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Gradual freeing of capital by Chile Chile will liberalise capital movements by the end of the decade, allowing much greater flows in and out of the country, according to Mr Eduardo Aninat, the new finance minister. Mr Aninat said in an interview that Chile was not looking for 'hot money' - or short-term money looking for the highest return - to enter the stock exchange. At present, funds coming into Chile cannot be repatriated for a year. 'If you want to see why we don't move more rapidly, look at the Merval (share) index in Argentina. It is incredible - up, down, up, down - triples its value, halves its value. I think that is horrible for domestic personal savings.' The one-year repatriation period has not put off long-term direct investors, inflows from whom last year accounted for 4.5 per cent of Chile's gross domestic product. Many had not repatriated profits after a year but put them back into new investments locally, he said. Mr Aninat was also wary of allowing too many outflows. Private pension funds, which command the equivalent of Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11.2bn) in savings, would only be allowed very gradually to expand their foreign portfolios, he said. But in the long run, Mr Aninat said, 'the only direction is towards liberalisation' because Chile had to continue to integrate with the world economy. The next step would be to reduce distinctions between the formal and informal exchange markets - a process begun tentatively last month - allowing Chilean exporters greater scope to leave earnings abroad. On inflation, which some fear has become stuck at about 12 per cent a year, Mr Aninat said 'harsh medicine', in the form of tight fiscal policy, might be needed. Bringing inflation down to single digits was more important than sustaining the 6 per cent growth rate of last year, he said.</p>

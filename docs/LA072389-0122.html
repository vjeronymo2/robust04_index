			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FRASER PUTS RETIREMENT PLANS ON HOLD  </P> <P> Alan Fraser was ready to call it a career last March after the Cal State  Northridge basketball team concluded its season.  </P> <P> However, thanks to a long-distance call Northridge assistant Rusty Smith  received from West Germany, Fraser, 21, is setting aside his retirement plans.  </P> <P> Fraser leaves next month for Munich where he will play for Sportbund Munich, a  Division 3 professional club that competes against regional opponents  throughout West Germany.  </P> <P> "It's a great opportunity to keep playing and see Europe," said Fraser, a  6-foot-6, 225-pound forward who averaged 8.7 points and 5.3 rebounds a game as  a senior at CSUN. "At the end of the season, I was feeling that my game was  getting better and better. I have more confidence now than I ever have."  </P> <P> Fraser's package with the West German team includes air fare, an apartment, use  of a car and a monthly stipend to cover other expenses.  </P> <P> Smith, who played in West Germany for seven years after completing his  eligibility at Montana State University, was contacted in May by an old friend  who is coaching in West Germany.  </P> <P> "Alan fits the bill of what they were looking for," Smith said. "They wanted a  big kid who can play inside and score.  </P> <P> "He also has the right personality because you have to be flexible."  </P> <P> Fraser said he eventually will complete the four courses he needs to earn a  degree in broadcast communications.  </P> <P> But for now, like his retirement plans, school has been put on hold.  </P> <P> "I'm fired up, ready to go and playing every night," Fraser said. "I'm trying  to get into regular preseason shape.  </P> <P> "I can't wait to get over there and get started."  </P></p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Japan's rural rice lobby clings to power despite deregulation: The old guard is reviving traditional tactics Japanese government officials often refer to the sacred importance of rice and the farmers' role as custodians of rural culture as the main reason against opening the country's rice market. As the only food deemed to have a soul, and with sacred links to Shintoism and Buddhism, rice was more than just a commodity. The reality is, however, that the spiritual importance of rice and the farming culture is fading for most urban Japanese. Sentimental images of the furusato - the old home village - are no longer symbols to which they adhere. The relationship between politicians and the provinces, meanwhile, has traditionally been more of a material kind. Such links will be reconfirmed this week when the country's parliament ratifies the government's Uruguay Round farm package. Parliamentary discussions on the Y6,010bn (Pounds 38bn) package to help Japanese rice farmers face foreign competition when Japan opens its doors to imported rice next year, started last week. The return to power of the Liberal Democratic party with the Social Democrats is behind the package conceived last month. Reformists who were in office at the end of last year forced through an agreement to import 4 to 8 per cent of domestic rice consumption over the next six years. However, the old guard, relying on rural votes, has gone back to traditional politicking, appealing to the electorate by delivering large subsidies and public works allotments. Politicians from rural areas, who threatened to block the parliamentary vote on the Uruguay Round accord unless it stipulated financial aid, are triumphant. Meanwhile the rice lobby is trying to deflect criticism over its arm-twisting for subsidies, claiming the deal has yet to be determined. The Central Union of Agricultural Co-operatives (Zenchu) says the actual net increase in next year's annual budget is still under negotiation between the agricultural and finance ministries. 'The media's criticism is not fair since we don't even know how big the increase really is,' says one Zenchu official. But many agricultural economists are less concerned about the amount of money than how it will be used. Rather than encouraging consolidation of inefficient small part-time farmers and helping expansion by full-time farmers, most of the package is linked to public works spending and will only help to sustain the current inefficiencies. Of the total, Y3,550bn is allotted to infrastructure including roads and draining paddy fields, Y770bn is to be spent on cheap state loans and Y890bn will be used for building facilities in rural areas. Such funds will only support part-time farmers which comprise 80 per cent of the farming population and have become a leading barrier to increasing farm efficiency. They are the main supporters of the co-ops at the centre of the rice lobby and look after every aspect of rural life while acting as huge vote-collecting machines during elections. However, it is already clear that neither farming subsidies nor the co-ops will revitalise Japan's agriculture. The number of Japanese farmworkers last year totalled 3.6m, or 2.9 per cent of the country's population, 42.3 per cent less than 20 years ago. The average age of farmers is 56, much higher than other industries where 45 is the average. There are, however signs of change. In January, political reform will usher in a new electoral system giving urban voters more political clout as a result of redrawing constituency boundaries although the number of politicians supported by the farming lobby are not expected to be cut drastically. It is also unclear how much effect the loosely worded food law, which governs the distribution and retailing of rice, will have on deregulation when implemented next April. The agriculture ministry is said to be under pressure from the co-ops from shifting too much power to rice growers and new distributors and retailers. Professor Yujiro Hayami, who specialises in Japanese farming at Gakushuin University, says the return of the old political guard will delay farm restructuring. 'Reform could eventually happen, but by then the industry could be non-existent,' he warns.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Government to revise its budget forecasts The Italian government is to submit new budgetary forecasts for 1993-95 in the next seven days, afters its original figures were criticised as inadequate in parliament last week, Haig Simonian reports from Milan. The decision yesterday to revise the forecasts, prepared each July, follows the recent turmoil in the currency markets. The predictions, which envisage a fall in the budget deficit to just 4.9 per cent of gross domestic product by 1995, haf already been attacked by economists as too upbeat. The figures, drawn up soon after the new government of Prof Giuliano Amato came to office, showed total public sector debt was expected to fall marginally to 113.5 per cent of GDP in 1985 after reaching a peak of 113.6 per cent in 1994. Even some ministers have admitted the inflation forecasts made in July were optimistic.  Price rises, which declined to annual 5.3 per cent om 1993, 2.5 per cent in 1994 and 2 per cent in 1995.  'That's even more optimistic after the latest devaluations,' said one bank economist yesterday. The economic growth targets of 1.6 per cent next year, 2.4 per cent in 1994 and 2.6 per cent in 1995 are also seen as being on the bright side. Most contentious of all the assumptions was the outlook for interest rates, which underlie all the forecasts.</p>

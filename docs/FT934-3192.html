			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / EU reacts angrily to shipping offer in trade talks Hopes of liberalising international trade in services in the Uruguay Round talks were thrown into disarray yesterday when negotiators reacted angrily to details of the US offer on shipping. Other important services sectors such as banking and securities have been the subject of controversy for several weeks, and the US and European Union remain at loggerheads over access to Europe's film and television market. If shipping drops off the negotiating table, Geneva officials acknowledged the services deal would be in tatters. EU trade negotiators aroused consternation yesterday by saying they would finalise tariff-cutting deals with just 15 to 20 countries before the Uruguay Round deadline next Wednesday. Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, insisted the EU 'must find the time, and the personnel, to bring the Round to a conclusion' on time. The EU thought it had won an important concession from Washington on ocean shipping in talks on Monday in Brussels between Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, his EU counterpart. But angry EU negotiators discovered yesterday the offer amounted to less than they had believed. One US official claimed there had been an 'unintentional misunderstanding'. The US has agreed only to include cargo reservation systems in the services package, about 3 per cent of the ocean shipping sector. Even here, the offer is only a commitment not to tighten restrictions, which reserve 75 per cent of the business for US flagged ships. 'It looks like maritime is going to be out of the Round,' said one gloomy EU negotiator. 'The US position is killing negotiations in this sector.' Liberalisation of shipping services is a key demand for EU members, Denmark and Greece, as well as the Nordic countries. The EU says it will withdraw its own offer on maritime services, which is conditional on a 'critical mass' of other countries also liberalising their shipping sectors, if Washington does not put a better deal on the table. Trade officials fear that if one key services sector is 'carved out' of the Uruguay Round liberalisation package, others will follow. The EU has served notice that, despite partial agreement with the US in Brussels on Monday, it may not be able to resist French pressure to keep the sensitive audio-visual sector out of the Round. One trade official said: 'If the US and the EU really do fall out over maritime and audio-visual services, then this is a very dangerous development indeed. The two need to get back around a table and cobble this together.' Trade diplomats are also critical of Washington's stand on financial services, where the US aims to grant unrestricted access to its banking and securities market only to countries providing full access to the US financial services industry.

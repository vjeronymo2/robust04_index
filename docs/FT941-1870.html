			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Borland shaken by revamp and resignation Borland International, the US personal computer software company which is selling its spreadsheet product Quattro Pro to Novell for Dollars 145m, warned it would report significantly lower revenues and a 'substantial' operating loss in the quarter ending March 31. It also announced the resignation of its finance chief. Borland said it would incur a charge in the next quarter, to cover the corporate restructuring that followed the Quattro Pro sale and its poor recent earnings performance. It said it had not yet determined the extent of the charge. The latest developments follow last week's appointment of Mr Keith Maib as Borland's first chief operating officer. Mr Maib, a former partner at the accountancy firm Price Waterhouse spent the weeks before his appointment examining in detail Borland's business. He is now running the day-to-day management of the company. The arrival of Mr Maib followed a period of turmoil among the company's senior management. The resignation of Mr Alan Henricks, who stepped down as chief financial officer 'to pursue other interests', was only the latest in a line of recent departures by senior executives. Last Wednesday, the head of the company's product division resigned. The sale of Quattro Pro, the arrival of Mr Maib, and the planned restructuring are all part of an attempt by Mr Philip Kahn, Borland's chief executive, to ensure the company survives a price war in the increasingly competitive software market. Borland incurred a loss of Dollars 49m for its 1993 fiscal year, and in the latest quarter reported only modest profits.</p>

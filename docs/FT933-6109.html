			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Ballots cut down on strikes, say unions THE INTRODUCTION of secret strike ballots has been an important cause of the decline in industrial conflict over the past 10 years. This is the main conclusion of a survey of opinions of negotiators from 25 large and medium-sized trade unions representing more than 5m workers carried out by the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. Since 1984 the law has required trade unions to hold pre-strike ballots. This obligation 'stands out as the most important of the changes made by government's labour legislation', say Mr Bob Simpson and Ms Jane Elgar, the survey's authors. Sixty three per cent of the respondents said they thought the law 'had been the most important factor affecting industrial action'. Eighty-four per cent thought their members were 'now more reluctant to take industrial action'. Only 18 per cent agreed that there is now more unofficial industrial action, with a majority believing members were less likely to take unofficial industrial action. The survey found employers remain unwilling to take legal action against unions. 'Legal proceedings - or even a solicitor's letter - are still clearly the exception,' it says. Even so, one in four of the respondents said employers had threatened to use the law over industrial action, although only 25 per cent of them had begun legal proceedings. On the other hand, 93 per cent of the sample said that employers 'had become more hardline in their dealings with unions'. Threats of dismissal against members by employers has become widespread. Where striking was seriously considered, 35 per cent of respondents said dismissal threats had occurred. The survey says the 'weak legal position' of individual workers going on strike and 'fear for job security in an adverse economic climate' have helped to reduce conflict. There was widespread support among union negotiators for pre-strike ballots with 68 per cent of them saying they were 'a good thing for trade unions'. The survey found that where ballots had been held there was 'strong evidence' that they had 'assisted negotiators in bargaining'. Although 75 per cent of ballots were won by the unions, this did not necessarily lead to industrial action but most brought a negotiated settlement.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / MPs slam costs of defence orders Taxpayers have forfeited millions of pounds and important weapon systems have been unnecessarily delayed because of poor management and 'incredible' errors, according to a Commons defence committee report. In a detailed study of four kinds of military equipment, the MPs call for the civil servants responsible for such mistakes to be 'reprimanded or otherwise penalised'. The committee found that the cost of developing an earth station to receive signals from military satellites had ballooned by 62 per cent to Pounds 99m because the project had not been properly defined in advance. The price of a new system to scatter mines from a vehicle had also risen 'significantly' from Pounds 37m. The Ministry of Defence was 'in some confusion' over how to explain this, according to the report. The committee sharply criticises the ministry's rejection of an offer by International Business Machines of a flexible, inflation-linked price in a contract for 44 Merlin helicopters. The ministry's failure to examine IBM's offer fully was described as 'grossly negligent' behaviour which might have cost up to Pounds 95m. However the committee acknowledges that new procedures, introduced at the ministry over the past year, should avoid such mistakes in future. Analysing the multinational project to make Trigat anti-tank missiles, the committee notes that Britain found itself helping to develop a weapon which it might not need. But after negotiations on price the ministry concluded it would be cheaper to stay in. 'The Ministry of Defence has found itself in the highly unusual position of continuing to participate in the development programme for a missile for which it has no specific programme,' the report notes.

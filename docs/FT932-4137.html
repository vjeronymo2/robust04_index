			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Sterling dominates as week's supply breaches Pounds 1bn NEW issues in the sterling market again dominated activity yesterday, with a further Pounds 700m of fixed-rate paper bringing the supply of paper so far this week to Pounds 1.1bn In the developing Eurolira bond market, the European Investment Bank issued a L700bn five-year deal, the largest single lira issue ever launched. The deal benefited from strong overseas demand for the still relatively high coupons available on Eurolira bonds. Of the three fixed-rate issues launched in the sterling market yesterday, the largest, a Pounds 500m issue for Gefco, the UK export financing agency, was the most disappointing. A Pounds 100m 5 1/2 -year issue for Unilever, arranged by SG Warburg and IBJ International, met enthusiastic demand, driven by retail interest in the name. Like Marks and Spencer's Pounds 150m offering yesterday, the deal attracted institutional investors who expected the spread to tighten as retail investors bought paper. After a wave of new issues in March, the sterling market has been relatively quiet until this week, as the over-supply was absorbed. However, the relative under-performance of the gilts market compared with some European markets in the past few months has rekindled interest in sterling bonds, which offer relatively attractive yields. However, continental European investors remain very choosy, preferring high quality and rare names. M&amp;S and Unilever both fit the bill. The fact that the deals both mature in 5 1/2 years, but are priced off a five-year gilt, providing an extra saving for issuers seeking to meet aggressive swap targets, does not appear to have deterred these investors. The Gefco deal suffered by comparison, although the spread of 20 basis points over the five-year gilt was not substantially tighter. However, dealers reported slow sales, and said the issue was likely to take some time to place. 'The spread is not likely to perform because the deal has no retail potential,' argued one dealer. However, an official at lead manager Samuel Montagu pointed out that Gefco paper has traded as tight as 10 basis points of gilts in the past. A 10-year issue for the Bank of Greece, its first Eurosterling deal, met a positive reception. The Greek central bank, which is rated BAA1 by Moody's and BBB- by Standard &amp; Poor's, is an unusually weak credit for the sterling market. However, careful pre-marketing of the deal, and the general view that Greece, as an EC member, is an improving credit, encouraged broad participation in the deal by UK institutional investors. The deal, arranged by SG Warburg, was launched at a spread of 175 basis points over the 10-year gilt, and tightened to 170 basis points by the end of the day. In the floating-rate sector of the sterling market, Woolwich Building Society launched a Pounds 125m four-year deal via UBS, which benefited from the substantial level of redemptions in the sector. Moody's, the US rating agency, has lowered the senior debt ratings of Credit Lyonnais and its subsidiaries from AA3 to A1, citing asset quality problems and the implications of the bank's forthcoming privatisation. The ratings were placed under review on March 29.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Fund managers gear up for a bear market  -Capital &amp; Credit Fixed-income fund managers have had a glorious run in the last few years, riding on the crest of a global bond rally that sent yields tumbling close to their historical lows. But while many bond fund managers are still preoccupied with wringing the last gains out of the ebbing rally, others are gearing up for the phase expected to begin in the latter half of this year: a period of stable or slowly rising interest rates, which will make it much harder to prosper using conventional bond strategies. 'Bond management is a bull-market profession, where fund managers seek to identify markets where interest rates are falling,' says Mr Paul Abberley, director and head of fixed income at Lombard Odier Investment Management in London. 'However, that style will become obsolete in a period of interest-rate stability or rising interest rates.' In anticipation of the bear market, Lombard Odier began to reassess its investment management style 18 months ago. It is important, says Mr Abberley, to expand one's investment universe to include countries outside the OECD and focus increasingly on emerging bond markets. Lombard Odier invests in emerging markets on a minor scale at present but over the next year these markets are expected to play a more active role in its portfolio construction. Investment managers may want also to refine the way they take bets on interest rates. Rather than looking for markets where interest rates are falling, causing bond yields to fall and prices to rise, they need to identify markets where interest rates are changing, whatever the direction. 'As long as you have interest rate changes, you can structure securities in such a way as to take advantage of those changes,' says Mr Abberley. With increased liquidity in the derivative markets, a growing array of structured products is becoming available. Bond investors who cannot buy derivative instruments can take the same view by purchasing bonds with em-bedded options, for example. This allows them to implement their own views when they are at odds with the market and means they can make money irrespective of the direction of rates and yields. Mr Abberley says an environment of stable or rising interest rates also requires more active yield curve management (taking long or short positions in different parts of the yield curve); sector plays (trading the volatility in spreads between different sectors of a bond market); and volatility trades (applying sophisticated derivatives strategies). Different interest rate scenarios can suggest various yield-curve plays. For example, in an environment of stable interest rates and a positive yield curve, a yield-curve play could simply involve riding the curve. Most markets approaching the end of the interest rate cycle have positive yield curves, where short-term rates are below long-term rates. An investor who buys and holds a long-dated, higher-yielding bond, will benefit when the yield declines as it gets closer to maturity, generating capital gains. In an environment of rising short-term interest rates, it might be more appropriate to play the yield curve at both ends, since yield curves rarely move in a parallel fashion. Rate increases at times of low inflation could be seen by market participants as an indication of a central bank's commitment to containing inflation. This may cause yields to fall and prices to rise at the long end of the yield curve. At the short end, however, the opposite may happen, with yields rising and prices falling on such rate increases. In that context, one useful strategy could be to establish a short position in short-dated, say two-year, bonds and a long position in long-dated, say seven to 10-year bonds, if one believes that the fulcrum, or pivot, of the yield curve lies somewhere between the two. One prerequisite for applying such strategies is that the portfolio guidelines allow fund managers to go short of securities, a strategy many fund management groups are not allowed to implement. 'If you take aggressive views on interest rates, some feel it becomes speculation. Some institutions have had a close look at whether this is an acceptable style of managing their assets,' says Mr Abberley. Another senior bond fund manager warns of the temptation of leveraging a bond portfolio through complex structured strategies or investment in lower-rated credits. 'We haven't yet devised a strategy for managing our portfolios in a bear market, but we won't start getting speculative, or go for negative duration (run synthetic short positions on bonds),' he says. 'We won't bet the farm.' Still, more liberal investment guidelines clearly can boost a fund's performance. Lombard Odier's conventional bond funds last year outperformed its benchmark indices by roughly 5 - 8 per cent. In contrast, one of its more liberally structured portfolios was able to outperform its benchmark index by 13.5 per cent in 1993.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Arts: There is no 'frozen music' here - Birmingham's new Convention Centre disappoints Colin Amery / Architecture The sounds of a solitary harp filled the empty hall - glancing, plangent notes almost other worldly in their purity. It was a moment of musical truth. The first of many days of trials and testing moments for the new Birmingham Symphony Hall where the first public concert will be held tonight. I leave it to my much more musical colleagues to judge the success of the acoustics of this hall; my concern is with the what the eye beholds. Was it Goethe who described architecture as 'frozen music'? Whoever it was would have found it difficult to decide which score lies behind the architecture of present day Birmingham. There is no doubt about the city's wish to try to undo much of the terrible damage inflicted upon the centre of Birmingham by the road engineers, architects and planners of the 1960s. The focus of its civic plans is the new Centenary Square which has grown out of a townscape study of the Broad Street area between Paradise Circus and Fiveways. It is here that you will find the new Convention Centre, Symphony Hall, and hotel and here you can witness the brave efforts to establish a new kind of civic place. What you see today, writ terrifyingly large, is the complete failure to design any new civic buildings of real architectural quality. The new Convention Centre is without the serious virtues of proportion, elegance or beauty. Compare it with the planned new civic buildings of Barcelona or Paris and Birmingham's efforts take it down to the level of the new Bucharest. It is a tragic tale because the city's intentions are brave and intelligent. The idea of a great series of halls for international gatherings and an acoustically promising new concert hall for a major city orchestra must be applauded. The blame for the unsatisfactory nature of the new buildings lies squarely with the architects. They have failed on a number of counts. No visible attempt has been made to relate the volumes of the halls to the public circulation spaces. The asymmetry of the bulging glass wall of the entrance facade and the crude projecting bright blue steelwork are ominous external signs of what is to come inside. It must have seemed a good idea to have an internal 'street' allowing the public to wander through the entire building to reach the canal and the now postponed commercial development; but the atmosphere in this street is horribly similar to the interior of Heathrow's terminal four. Massively over-engineered visible structure and ducts hover beneath the glass roof; you expect all that structure to be supporting something enormous, but it is just grotesquely over-scaled. The steep staircases create awkward angular spaces which are often rather desperately filled with plants. There was a limited architectural selection process back in 1984 when the Percy Thomas Partnership and Renton Howard Wood Levin Partnership were selected. They then collaborated as the Convention Centre Partnership. Other architects considered and rejected included Richard Rogers and Skidmore Owings and Merrill. The architects' brief was to design 11 halls including a 2,200 seat concert hall and a 1,500 seat conference auditorium. Their townscape study sensibly suggested the lowering of the main traffic route of Queensway and the creation of a pedestrian link from the city centre to the new square. Flexibility was the watchword of the brief - which can often mean that the client does not really know what he wants. In this case almost all the halls can be used for various uses and so they are all extensively, and expensively, equipped for almost everything. The local authority decided to adopt the 'per cent for art' plan for the Convention Centre, and it is the artists who have provided most of the redeeming features of the scheme. The brick patterned pavement of Centenary Square and its ironwork has all been beautifully designed by Tess Jaray. Seen from above it is like a wonderful carpet, and I liked the heavy weight of the railings and lamp standards. An entertaining fountain by Tom Lomax sits merrily in the square, and there is a huge figurative sculpture to come from the artist Raymond Mason. Inside the foyer area of the concert hall the artist Deanna Petherbridge has been commissioned to paint a large ziggurat-shaped mural on the foyer side of the curved rear walls of the concert hall. This 'architectural fantasy' in oil paint has been skilfully designed to fill the walls on four levels. On each level the actual space is relatively low and the artist's intention is to create a whole composition that will be seen, particularly when lit at night, from the square outside. This curved space leads into the bars and tragically there are horrible blue troughs of plants, with chrome stands and tops to take glasses, to separate the drinkers from the non drinkers. This is apparently the wish of the licensing authority - bureaucracy comes before art. These ghastly erections will effectively obscure the mural and I can quite understand why the artist is disinclined to finish her magnum opus if it is to be rendered scarcely visible. The interior of the concert hall is what most people will probably enjoy. Its form owes a great deal to the acoustical model designed by Russell Johnson of Artec Consultants Incorporated (New York). The shoebox form of the hall and the tiers of balconies are a great contrast to many of the fan-shaped wide auditoria that have been built recently. The thick walls, resonating chambers, and a moveable canopy over the orchestra will make the hall capable of an unusual mixture of clarity and warmth of sound. The finishes are hard - polished wood and waxed plaster with a glitter of chrome and polished granite. The decorative ideas behind the relentless horizontal lines and the jazzy motifs of doors and columns seem to come straight from the days of the deco cinema. There is a Wurlitzer quality to the room - not relieved by the unattractively asymmetrical design of the organ case and pipes. It is awful to be so disappointed by the sheer lack of architectural distinction in this major public building. An extraordinary opportunity in Birmingham has produced an unoriginal, styleless and deeply ordinary solution.</p>

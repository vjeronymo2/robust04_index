			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARIAN PARTY TO CHANGE IMAGE  </P> <P> Hungary's ruling Communist Party blamed itself Saturday for the current  national crisis and resolved to turn into a humane socialist party committed to  a mixed market economy and a welfare state.  </P> <P> "State socialism has brought Hungary into a critical situation," the Hungarian  Socialist Workers' Party (HSWP) said in a lengthy draft policy program  published in the Party daily Nepszabadsag.  </P> <P> "The HSWP dissociates itself from all versions of Stalinism but at the same  time feels responsible for the crisis and considers it its duty to take a part  in overcoming it," it said.  </P> <P> With Poland, Hungary has been in the forefront of the reformist wave sweeping  across Eastern Europe, to the dismay of hard-liners, notably in Czechoslovakia  and East Germany.  </P></p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate considerations take bourses higher Although the corporate news, especially in Paris, was not inspiring, rate cut hopes extended this week's rally, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS climbed on renewed hope for interest rate cuts, prompted by the strength of the franc and following the Dutch and Danish interest rate cuts on Tuesday. The CAC-40 index closed 9.93 higher at 2,225.79 in turnover of FFr5.9bn. However, the outstanding moves of the day were on the downside. The leisure business looked grim. Club Med fell FFr14, or 4 per cent to FFr321. After hours it said that a big loss in 1992-93 partly reflected local political conditions in Egypt, Senegal, Turkey and the former Yugoslavia, where 14 holiday villages had to be closed. At Euro Disney, an auditors' report on 1992-93 said that it would need financial support to face its contractual obligations in 1994. Analysts said that there was nothing new in this but the shares fell another FFr1.40 to FFr34.10. Suez dropped FFr2.20 to FFr340 as the biggest block trade of the day, 1.12m shares, went through the market at a price of FFr331.50. MADRID, too, was lifted by interest rate talk of interest rate cuts in the near future, the general index rising in spite of late profit-taking to close 1.26 higher at 317.84, in strong turnover of Pta32bn. MILAN continued higher as expectations of imminent passage of the 1994 budget and growing hopes of an interest rate cut contributed to the positive sentiment. The Comit index added 8.67 to 619.46. Ferruzzi added L50 to L2,150 and Montedison L50 or 5.8 per cent to L915 in continued response to the launch of their complex capital increases on Tuesday. Stet, the state telecommunications holding company, rose on speculation that it would follow Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano in making savings shares convertible into ordinary shares in the run up to privatisation. Its savings shares rose L73 to L3,392 while the ordinary added L33 to L4,253. Shares in Sip, the domestic telephone operator, climbed L37 to L3,577. Industrials found support in interest rate expectations. Fiat climbed L35 to L4,403 and Pirelli by L28 to L2,182. Olivetti, strong in recent days on speculation that the company would be awarded Italy's second cellular telephone licence, added another L10 to L2,130. FRANKFURT climbed on strong trade figures and as the state of Hesse confirmed the slowdown in West German inflation. The DAX index hit a new closing high of 2,197.51, up 12.58, then broke up through 2,200 to end the post bourse at 2,209.17. Turnover fell from DM10.2bn to DM9.2bn. A large buy order in London took Siemens up DM14 to DM770.50, and another DM5 to DM775.50 in the post-bourse. Allianz fell another DM15 to DM2,920, reflecting the big line in the insurer's stock which came out late last Friday. German institutions continued to buy defensive stocks. In utilities, RWE rose DM9 to DM504, Veba DM9.50 to DM515 and Viag DM10.20 to DM495. In steels, Preussag and Thyssen rose DM6 to DM424 and DM3 to DM263.50, benefiting from the positive trade data, while Mannesmann's telecoms prospects saw the latter up another DM7.50 to DM419.80. Lufthansa continued to be depressed by worries over the implementation of the US-German air traffic treaty signed earlier in the year. The airline lost DM3.50 at DM168. ZURICH established its fourth consecutive record close, the SMI index adding 24.4 to 2,942.4, with the continued strength of the franc attracting foreign funds hoping for exchange rate gains on further currency appreciation. Derivative instruments supported some shares. UBS, SFr18 higher at SFr1,384, issued warrants on its own shares, while Bankers Trust set warrants on Ciba-Geigy, whose bearers added SFr8 to SFr920. However, the strong franc also depressed some export-oriented shares. Brown Boveri shed SFr7 to SFr1,048. AMSTERDAM saw brisk foreign demand which took the CBS Tendency index 0.9 higher at 146.7. Publishers were again at the centre of attention. Elsevier gained Fl 4.10 to Fl 177.60 and Wolters Kluwer Fl 3.20 to Fl 122.20, although VNU fell Fl 1.90 to Fl 163.10. COPENHAGEN staged a solid comeback, casting aside days in the doldrums after the central bank's latest deposit and discount rate cuts to 6.25 per cent which took effect from the opening of trade. The KFX index added 2.28 or 1.65 per cent to 102.76, in sizeable turnover of SKr692m. OSLO added 1.1 per cent, supported by by falling interest rates. The all-share index climbed 6.08 to 586.75 in turnover of NKr774m after three-month money market interest rates fell to 5.42 per cent from 5.54 per cent.

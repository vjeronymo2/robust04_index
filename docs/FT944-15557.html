			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Learning to extend quality - New aids are available to take companies beyond BS accreditation Companies pursuing accreditation under BS EN ISO 9000 - what used to be BS 5750. - need to peer through a fog of marketing hype these days to find those parts of the process that genuinely improve quality. Different organisations are attempting this in different ways. The British Standards Institution, the UK's largest quality assurance assessor, is about to launch an ambitious teaching aid using CD-Rom technology. The distance learning product, called Fastraq 9000, uses video, text and sound in an interactive package to describe the methodology behind the writing of a quality manual. Fastraq 9000 took two years to develop at a project cost of Pounds 500,000. It will take an executive 16 hours to work through properly, BSI says. In complete contrast MRDL, a small Woking-based consultancy, is questioning the way many companies have implemented quality programmes and is introducing what it calls an alternative 'Minimalist Managing System'. MRDL asserts that UK companies waste Pounds 45m a year writing and managing inflexible and over-complex quality systems simply to comply with BS EN ISO 9000. Simplification of the process not only costs less, but is more likely to produce a quality manual that will become a management tool, MRDL says. But first, BSI's Fastraq 9000, which will be on sale from mid-November. BSI has targeted the product at managers interested in gaining certification and for company training purposes. According to Ram Mylvaganam, director of marketing at BSI, the most committed managers can also use it as a tool to help write a company's quality manual, thereby reducing the need for external consultants. BSI is doing its bit to dispel the idea that the BS EN ISO 9000 standard is an end in itself. Accreditation, it says, 'is just the end of the beginning'. But for a CD-based product of such length, the material is surprisingly difficult to dip into and needs to be systematically worked through from start to finish. The 10 modules are not cheap - Pounds 2,500 in total, excluding VAT, plus up to Pounds 500 for an expansion board to handle the high quality video pictures. Unfortunately, BSI has declined to say how many Fastraq 9000's it hopes to sell - so much for outsiders being able to measure its performance against objectives. Minimalist takes a different approach. It attempts to strip the narrative used to describe procedures in quality manuals. The English language, it says, is wordy and imprecise and even when clearly written can spawn confusion. Minimalist breaks down each crucial procedure in a business and puts the actions required in a matrix. Down one side of the matrix are the actions needed to perform marketing or purchasing procedures, for example; across the top is a list of who is responsible, the follow-up action required, and what other procedures depend on the action elsewhere in the organisation. One fan of the system is Black Horse Relocation Services, part of the Lloyds Bank group, which sought BS EN ISO 9000 accreditation to maintain a competitive edge. After scouring the market, Paul Bolton, general manager of network services, said he saw the limitation of many quality management systems. 'You can end up with volumes of documentation that hold the building up but do not help to manage the business,' Bolton says. MRDL provided the training for Black Horse to write its own manual using Minimalist. By minimising documentation and using the simple tabular format, Black Horse's staff were able to write their own quality system. This involvement gave them 'ownership' of a manual that has since become a working tool. 'We have noticed a lot of benefit in terms of departments that are more aware of what each other department is doing,' says Bolton.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Northern exports campaign A SELF-HELP campaign to double the northern region's manufacturing base and to treble its export performance within 10 years was launched yesterday The 'manufacturing challenge' was welcomed and strongly endorsed by many of the region's business leaders at a packed breakfast-time meeting in Newcastle upon Tyne. The campaign is the brainchild of Northern Businessman of the Year Mr Karl Watkin, chairman of Gateshead-based Crabtree Holdings. The company is the UK's leading manufacturer of metal-printing machinery, and exports virtually all its output. The challenge is supported by union leaders and the Northern Development Company, the regeneration body for north-east England and Cumbria.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mulatov from the "Half an Hour With Wang </F> Xiao" program]    [Text] Ren Jianxin, president of China's Supreme People's  Court, said last Saturday [21 May] at a meeting of the Central  Committee for Comprehensive Management of Public Security --  which he heads -- that social tensions have increased in China's  rural areas as a result of price rises, inflation, and  increasing market competition. The masses are very  dissatisfied. Some rural regions even experienced serious  difficulties in maintaining public order. The meeting discussed  the growing problem of maintaining public order in China's rural  areas.    Ren Jianxin, a senior cadre of China, emphasized that the  impact that rural areas' public security problems will have on  the situation nationwide must never be underestimated. A system  of rural cadres assuming personal responsibility for maintaining  public order is being formulated in accordance with his proposal.    Of late, China's leaders are deeply worried about the  situation in rural areas. For this reason, the State Council  promulgated a poverty alleviation plan not long ago. According  to official statistics, 80 million peasants in China are living  below the poverty line. Their annual income is under U.S.$100.  In other words, they do not have enough to eat and wear. The  goal of the government plan is to eliminate, by and large,  poverty in China by the year 2000. This and the new measures  the authorities have taken to improve public order in rural  areas are two sides of a policy that is designed to prevent  massive peasant unrest, which could lead to social and political  instability and chaos. Foreign wire services such as AFP and  REUTERS noted in their comments that local party committees and  administrative organs in some rural areas of China have become  paralyzed or semi-paralyzed. This is exactly the situation  foreign observers love to cite in interpreting why the Chinese  central authorities are implementing the system of rural cadres  assuming responsibility for maintaining public order in their  respective localities.    Reform, development, and stability -- these are the main  goals of the domestic policy offensive of the Chinese  leadership. The task facing Chinese leadership is to contain,  dilute, and eventually eliminate the destabilizing factors in  rural areas. It is particular true of poverty-stricken areas  where increases in peasant income are lagging behind the  inflation rate, and of areas with wide gaps between rich and  poor, where rich farmers sharply contrast with poor ones. This  is the kind of situation that could lead to deadly consequences.  Taking note of this danger in good time, the Chinese  authorities have implemented comprehensive measures to ensure  public order and security in the unsteady rural areas.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: CANADIAN BACON PROVES ONE WAY TO SLICE CALORIES FROM RICH PASTA  DISH  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: Please send me a revision of Spaghetti a la Carbonara, enclosed.  </P> <P>  -- R. M., Anacortes, Wash.  </P> <P> SPAGHETTI A LA CARBONARA  </P> <P> 1/4 cup butter  </P> <P> 2 eggs plus 2 egg yolks  </P> <P> 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> 1/2 pound (8 slices) bacon, preferably pancetta, cut in small strips  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons olive oil  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes  </P> <P> 1 (16-ounce) package spaghetti  </P> <P> 1/2 cup whipping cream  </P> <P> Warm serving bowl in 200 degree oven. Cream butter in small bowl and set aside.  Beat together eggs and egg yolks in another bowl. Stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan  cheese and set aside.  </P> <P> Fry bacon pieces over medium heat but do not allow to crisp. Reduce heat to low  and pour off all but 1 tablespoon bacon fat. Add olive oil and red pepper  flakes and keep warm over low heat.  </P> <P> Boil spaghetti in large kettle of boiling salted water. Do not overcook. While  spaghetti is cooking, add whipping cream to pan with bacon. Bring cream to  simmer.  </P> <P> Drain cooked spaghetti well and place in preheated bowl. Working quickly,  immediately toss spaghetti with creamed butter. Stir in hot bacon-cream  mixture, then add egg-cheese mixture, tossing until well-blended.  </P> <P> Divide between 8 heated bowls and top with remaining 1/2 cup grated Parmesan  cheese, 1 tablespoon per serving. Makes 8 (1-cup) servings.  </P> <P> DEAR R. M.: Bacon, which is practically all fat, is normally very difficult to  eliminate without missing its flavor. However, by using Canadian bacon and  reducing the amount by half I have come up with a revision that should please  your palate as well as your waistline.  </P> <P> My recipe only makes six cups, but I think it can still serve eight people  because it is so rich-tasting.  </P> <P> LIGHT SPAGHETTI A LA CARBONARA  </P> <P> 1/4 pound Canadian bacon, chopped  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons corn-oil margarine  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes  </P> <P> 1 egg plus 2 egg whites, lightly beaten  </P> <P> 1/2 cup evaporated skim milk  </P> <P> 1/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> 12 ounces spaghetti  </P> <P> Warm serving bowl in 200 degree oven.

Add red pepper  flakes and, stirring continuously with wire whisk, add beaten egg mixture.  </P> <P> As sauce begins to thicken, stir in milk and 1/3 cup cheese.

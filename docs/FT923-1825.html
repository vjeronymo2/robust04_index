			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / International Company News: Shanghai Vacuum seeks rights issue to repay debt SHANGHAI Vacuum Electron Device, the Chinese maker of television tubes and domestic fluorescent lamps, will seek approval at a shareholders' meeting on Wednesday to raise Yn600m (Dollars 107m) through a rights issue to repay bank debt, Reuter reports from Beijing. Quoting the official China Daily, the agency said Shanghai Vacuum would also seek agreement for a share split and to revise the scope of its business. The stock split would give each share a face value of Yn10 compared with the present Yn100. The company, which dominates the Shanghai stock market, expects to add Yn40m to its annual profits by reducing bank interest charges, according to Mr Xue Wenhai, chairman. He said the share split would reduce the company's price/earnings ratio and make the stock more attractive to local investors. Shanghai Vacuum was the first Chinese company to offer special B shares for foreign investors. However, the B shares have plunged in recent weeks along with other similar issues because supply has swamped demand. Mr Xue said the price of the rights issue would be decided by the People's Bank of China, the market regulator. The China Daily made no mention of the ratio of the proposed rights issue. Mr Xue said profits in the first eight months of this year reached Yn45m and the company would have no problem hitting its profit target of Yn72m for the full year. To expand the scope of its business, Mr Xue said Shanghai Vacuum was holding talks with two Japanese companies about introducing technology and equipment to produce picture tube screens. He did not name the companies.</p>

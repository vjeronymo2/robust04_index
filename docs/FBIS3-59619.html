			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO     [TEXT] After the "change-over" to German reunification, the  Max Planck Society recognized its obligation to cooperate with  the reorganization of research in the new states. It was not,  however, ready to alter its views for the sake of rapidly  establishing a unified structure of research in East and West.  One of its principles is to establish a basic research institute  only when there is an exceptional individual to lead it who  represents an area of work, within a creditable and primarily  academic field, which promises maximum innovations.    Therefore, according to President Hans Zacher in Berlin, an  immediate program was begun in 1990, in which new and  time-limited types of institutional research support were  employed. To benefit university research in the East and at the  same time to create appropriate fields for future Max Planck  Institutes, so-called "task forces" were set up.  Organizationally accompanied by the MPS and provided with  "adequate" equipment, they were able to begin immediately and  with "high scientific standards" in the universities in the new  states.    However, they can only count on the support of the MPS for  five years. By then they must be integrated into the current  universities. To this purpose, agreements were made with the  universities to appoint the group directors as university  teachers, even though the universities were burdened with large  surpluses in personnel. There was hardly any resistance from  this side appealing to university autonomy in the choice of  professors. The original goal of 25 groups has even been  exceeded with a total of 28 task forces (270 positions) at seven  universities in the five new states and Berlin.    In addition, according to Zacher, the MPS at the suggestion  of the Council on Science converted two additional, long alien  patterns of organization--also on only a time-limited basis: In  Berlin two so-called branches of existing MPS institutes from  the old states began work. The one is looked after by the Max  Planck Institute (MPI) for Extraterrestrial Physics, the other  by the MPI for Plasma Physics, both in Garching near Berlin.  Whether they will remain in this form longer than the agreed  five years will be decided by a later investigation. It is said  that even university affiliation, especially with Humboldt  University in Berlin, is conceivable.    In the end the MPS saw itself compelled by the Science  Council to do something for the humanities task forces worth  preserving from institutes of the "Academy of the Sciences of  the GDR." They did not appear to be suitable as cores of  autonomous MPS institutes, because their directions in research  (European Enlightenment, History of Science, Literary Research,  Modern Orient, Middle Eastern European Culture, Period History  and General Linguistics) could all be established at  universities, even if this didn't succeed at first. They were  therefore gathered in Berlin in seven "main humanities research  foci," so-called centers--not, however, under the cover of the  MPS itself, but under that of their own sponsor established for  them.    Whether they remain more than alien elements is still open.  Recommendations concerning their future were obtained from a  commission which involved researchers from the outside in  addition to scientists of the MPS. Accordingly, the centers are  either to operate in cooperation among themselves with "close  contact" with the universities or to be established there  directly. The Science Council will make recommendations  regarding their final status by May 1994 at the latest.    Until now there has been resistance by the universities  against the new "categories" and disagreement between the  federal government and the states on financing. The closer the  centers are to the universities, the more certain will their  financing be a state matter. If they remain separate from the  universities, other ways of financing would have to be found. It  is precisely this, however, which could be difficult; because  newly founded institutions have for some time been blocked by  the Federal Minister of Finance. According to Zacher, the  existence of the centers might depend to a great extent on the  duration or extension of the "start-up financing," which in the  meantime is assured until the end of 1994.    Thus, the MPS will in the end give up all the institutions  of  their immediate program--task forces, branches, centers; they  are only temporarily lodged with the society. In the meantime  the attention of the MPS in the new states is mainly aimed at  establishing institutes which strive for innovation. Seven  institutes have already been founded. Both of the Max Planck  Institutes for Microstructure Physics (Halle) and for Colloid  and Interface Research (Teltow) materialized due to  recommendations from the Science Council. The MPS has  established five more under its own direction: the Institutes  for Infection Biology and for History of Science (both in  Berlin), for Plant Physiology (Potsdam), for Economic Systems  Research (Jena) and for Physics of Complex Systems (Dresden).    In the final stage, there should be 15 to 20 institutes in  the east part of Germany. A density will thereby have been  reached which is comparable to that in the old states, now with  65 institutes and independent research groups.</p>

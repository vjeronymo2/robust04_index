			<p>BFN     [Text] The Serbian forces in Bosnia are escalating their  attacks against the Muslim enclave of (Bihac) in western Bosnia  while an interministerial conference is being held in Geneva  aimed at ending the hostilities through political means.  Participating in the conference are the foreign ministers of  the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany, Greece, and  Belgium as well as the international community mediators in the  Bosnian issue. Their goal is to persuade the belligerent sides  in Bosnia to return to the negotiating table. Greece is  represented by Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias in his  capacity as president of the European Union Foreign Ministers  Council.    An ATHENS NEWS AGENCY dispatch from Geneva notes that the  talks will open without any particular hopes and with the strong  impression that there are substantive differences between the  United States and France on charting a joint policy to impose a  solution on the belligerent parties in Bosnia. The dispatch  also stresses the difficulties that French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe had two days ago in persuading the U.S. leaders in  Washington to exercise effective pressure on the Muslims in  Bosnia.    It should be stressed that the U.S. Senate decided last  night  on the unilateral lifting of the arms embargo on the Muslims in  Bosnia that was imposed by the United Nations. Shortly before  leaving for Geneva, Foreign Minister Papoulias responded to  questions from correspondents. Among other things, Papoulias  said: The troika supports the EU action plan. U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher has his own ideas. Unfortunately, I  have been informed that the U.S. Senate decided to lift the arms  embargo on the Muslims in Bosnia. I think this decision could  complicate the situation.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Lufthansa set to move back into the black Lufthansa is heading back towards profitability after three years of losses, according to the German airline's chief executive. Mr Jurgen Weber said yesterday he hoped that the airline would make a profit for the current year which would enable it to pay its first dividend to ordinary shareholders since 1989. He was speaking as the airline reported a sharp fall in losses for 1993 and further improvements in the first quarter of the current year. Reflecting the impact of extensive rationalisation, pre-tax losses for the group fell from DM310.1m (Pounds 124m) to DM8.33m last year on sales of DM19.27bn, up from DM18.6bn. In the first three months of this year, the Lufthansa parent company cut its losses from DM245m to DM82m. Mr Weber said he could make no forecast about the size of the 1994 payout - to be paid in 1995 - until the second half of this year. More details are likely at the airline's annual meeting on July 7 when the company will ask shareholders' permission to raise its nominal share capital as a first step towards a rights issue. Mr Klaus Schlede, Lufthansa's finance director, said the issue would raise at least DM1.7bn, assuming a 20 per cent discount from the current share price. The funds were urgently required to replenish the group's equity capital, depleted after years of losses. The German government will not take up its entitlement to new shares, thereby reducing its holding from 51.4 per cent to about 40 per cent. Lufthansa achieved its earnings turnround last year against a backdrop of excess capacity, a sluggish world economy and continuing price pressure in the global airline industry. It said it had managed to decouple itself from the general trend by implementing a major restructuring programme, which led to a substantial reduction in staffing and costs. The airline has reduced costs by DM1.5bn in the past two years and aims to trim a further DM500m costs by 1997. Stripping out the impact of one-off items, operating profits for 1993 amounted to DM409m, swinging back from a loss of DM357m. In the first quarter of 1994, gross traffic revenues rose by 11.5 per cent to DM3.6bn for the parent company.</p>

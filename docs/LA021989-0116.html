			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> FOR NOW, RED SOX ARE TALKING ONLY BASEBALL  </P> <P> Mike Boddicker strolled into the clubhouse carrying not a bag of baseballs, but  a red-and-white polka-dot diaper bag.  </P> <P> Jeff Sellers, now a Cincinnati Red, paid a visit to the Boston Red Sox's  clubhouse, just to say hello. First-base coach Al Bumbry stuck his head out the  door and, seeing Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan doing the question and answer bit  with the media, said, "Look at you. You were in the same position the last time  I saw you. You're still talking."  </P> <P> The difference is that this is spring training -- rather, pre-spring training  -- not the hustle and bustle of the American League Championship Series.  Morgan's sessions with the media no longer include questions about Jose Canseco  and Mark McGwire; instead, Morgan was able to indulge in typical spring  training happyspeak the other day ("I like our pitching," "We'll hit more home  runs") and, in case there was someone in the crowd who hasn't heard them, he  dredged out some of his old minor-league stories.  </P> <P> The Red Sox's spring training base will got an adrenalin shot Friday when  pitchers and catchers report, and the place will be hopping this week when the  rest of the squad straggles in.  </P> <P> For now, though, Winter Haven is sleepy, and the controversy is on hold. Roger  Clemens, the multimillionaire right-hander, has had his contract problem worked  out. Wade Boggs isn't in camp yet and Penthouse isn't in the stands, so that  controversy is on hold.  </P> <P> Nor has Mike Greenwell, who wants $1.9 million for the next two years, arrived.  Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd's long-shot quest to make money through arbitration -- he  will seek $700,000 in his hearing Friday in New York -- is another issue on  hold.  </P> <P> "For now," Morgan said, "we don't have any problems. There are certainly going  to be some negative things going on down here, but I don't think that, overall,  it's going to be that bad. We won a division title last year. We're the  defending champions. And you know what? I think we can win it again. I really  do."  </P> <P> To prove his point, the manager of the Red Sox pulled out a crumpled newspaper  clipping from his shirt pocket. The clipping was a mangled portion of some  writer's feature on Oakland Athletics relief ace Dennis Eckersley, and Morgan  was particularly interested in a quote in which Eckersley sang the praises of  hard work and determination.  </P> <P> Morgan used this to help answer a question about the kind of camp he would run  in this, his first spring training as a major-league manager.  </P> <P> "Camp will be run so that the guys will learn something about baseball. We'll  go over things and we'll keep going over things," Morgan said. "Everyone will  be working hard, I can tell you that. But that doesn't mean we won't have fun.  We'll have some fun down here too."  </P> <P> Even if Boyd throws a temper tantrum if he loses his arbitration hearing? Even  if Greenwell doesn't get his money? Even if Margo Adams' tell-all expose in  Penthouse does, indeed, tell all? "Like I said, I don't think it will be that  bad," Morgan said.  </P> <P> So while the controversies wait, Morgan is able to talk, for now, about nothing  but baseball. Among his comments:  </P> <P>  -- The notion that Rice must have an exceptional spring to remain with the Red  Sox: "Not true," Morgan said. "He's not on trial. Sometimes spring numbers are  overrated. Some guy has a great spring, you keep him on the team and you get  nothing. You vow you'll never make that mistake again, but you always do. Jimmy  just has to do his work, and he's doing it."  </P> <P>  -- On the Red Sox's need for a left-handed starter: "I'd like to have one, but  if one doesn't come down the pike we'll go with five right-handers. I'd rather  do that than use a left-hander who can't do the job."  </P> <P>  -- On the Red Sox's home run production: "We'll definitely hit more home runs  this year. We had some guys who didn't hit as many last year as they can, and  getting (Nick) Esasky is going to help."  </P></p>

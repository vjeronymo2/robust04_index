			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Caracas banks win Dollars 740m aid package The Venezuelan government last night announced a financial assistance package of more than Dollars 740m (Pounds 477.4m) designed to stabilise two big commercial banks, Banco de Venezuela and Banco Progreso. The package is part of a government plan to assist several commercial banks that have suffered serious problems as part of Venezuela's bank crisis, which began last January with the failure of Banco Latino, then the country's second largest financial institution. Most of the financing will go to Banco de Venezuela, now the second largest bank, while the remainder will go to Banco Progreso. Ms Norys Aguirre, president of the government's Deposit Guaranty Fund (Fogade), said the intention was to put these and other troubled banks back on sound financial footing and to keep them operating. The government, which took control of Banco de Venezuela on Monday, plans to sell the institution 'as soon as possible', she added. In total the government is taking steps to salvage an estimated eight troubled banks, including another large bank, Banco Consolidado. The banks have been hurt in recent weeks by runs on their deposits, high levels of non-performing loans and other problems. The government took control on Monday of Banco de Venezuela which has deposits equivalent to Dollars 886m and a loan portfolio equivalent to Dollars 556m. Banco de Venezuela, founded 104 years ago, was one of the country's most solid banks. It remained open after the government takeover and depositors generally remained calm. It emerged this week that, under the outline stabilisation plan, banks that consistently fail to meet clearing house and reserve requirements will effectively be taken over by government appointees. The owners or major stockholders of affected institutions will be asked to increase capital, and to pledge their personal assets to help cover financial assistance obtained from the government and potential losses. In some cases, the owners of affected banks will be directed to carry out mergers, sell assets, reduce expenses, and take other steps to cut financial losses. As in the Banco de Venezuela case, officials want banks under government control to stay open in an attempt to avoid the panic that occurred when a group of financial institutions closed their doors earlier this year, in the first wave of the banking crisis. Banco Latino collapsed because of mismanagement and bad credit decisions. Its closure shocked the financial system, with runs on deposits.</p>

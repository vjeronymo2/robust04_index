Before that this "bully," who had been insufferably  arrogant in the past, already knew that he had become a target  in the anticorruption drive and that he could hardly escape.  Before he met his fate, however, there were two regrettable  things: First, he did not have time to enjoy his three bottles  of Louis XIII (each bottle of this wine is worth 6,700 yuan).  Second, he never got to stay in a presidential suite at  Guangzhou's White Swan Hotel. He would have spent several  thousand yuan enjoying it had he had the opportunity....    Hong Yonglin departed for another world with too many  "regrets," but his execution has left room for reflection,  because he was not the "black sheep" that the CPC propaganda  machine described him to be, but the epitome of corruption and  degeneration in the whole body of public security organs.    Corruption in the public security organs has not only  aroused  the people's call for overhauling them but also drawn the  attention of the senior CPC authorities to the seriousness of  the matter.    In mid-November 1993, the NPC Standing Committee received a  joint letter addressed to Qiao Shi and Li Peng by more than 20  important members urging for the overhaul of the public security  organs and for holding them accountable for "unhealthy  tendencies." They urged the dismissal of Public Security  Minister Tao Siju.    This was the second time the NPC Standing Committee made  such  a request. What on earth is behind the "public anger" toward  the public security minister and the public security organs?    To understand this, let us begin with the relevant  instructions given by Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi.  <H5>  Strongly Worded Instructions by Jiang, Li, and Qiao </H5>   On 8 November, Jiang Zemin gave these instructions: The  problems in public security organs are very salient. Their  personnel and organization are very loose and their discipline  and systems very disorganized. This can no longer be tolerated  and must be handled and overhauled as a major project by the  local party committees.    One can see the seriousness of the matter when Jiang Zemin  described the lawlessness among public security organs with such  adjectives as "very salient," "very loose," and "very  disorganized" and when he asserted that the situation can no  longer be tolerated.    Li Peng's instructions, however, illustrated the popular  anger at the law-enforcement organizations' knowing violation of  the law when he said: "The public security organs are the  state's law- enforcement organs. The present situation has led  to strong dissatisfaction within and outside the party. This  must be changed radically, and the role of the state's  law-enforcement organs should be brought into full play."    Qiao Shi, long in charge of procuratorial and judicial work,  gave very specific instructions when he said: "The situation of  some public security organs and leading groups is very serious.  The investigation teams and stationary teams sent to the basic  units should rely on their local party committees and on the  policemen of public security organs to quickly change the  current passivity. Those who should be dismissed should be  dismissed; those who should be transferred should be  transferred; those who should be coped with should be coped  with, and those who should be punished should be punished in  accordance with the law."    This trouble has been brewing for quite some time. The  deterioration of the public security contingent has long been a  knotty problem for the CPC. Recently, the central authorities  even organized "working teams," "investigation teams," and  "stationary teams" to tackle the serious problems in the public  security organs. In fact, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi  made the above instructions in light of the preliminary  investigations of these working teams.  <H5>  The Working Teams Are Threatened With "Death" </H5>   This time, the overhaul embraces a wide scope unseen in  recent years. It stretches to every level from the center to  localities. On 11 November, the State Council General Office,  the Ministry of Supervision, various organs, and various  ministries and commissions and offices sent 35 investigation  teams and stationary teams to the public security departments  (bureaus) of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous  regions and to the public security bureaus of some key special  zones. This was followed by the 270 or more working teams and  investigation teams or stationary teams sent on 15 November to  the public security bureaus of various prefectures, cities, and  autonomous prefectures.    Nevertheless, the investigations met strong resistance. It  reportedly happened in Shaanxi, Sichuan, Fujian, Hainan, and  Hunan that the central investigation teams or stationary teams  were confronted and threatened. It even happened that anonymous  letters containing "death" threats were received in Shaanxi.    The gravity of the problem can be understood from a piece  of statistical information issued by the Ministry of Public  Security--out of the public security departments (bureaus) at  the provincial level across China, 22 public security  departments (bureaus) have had their party committee leaders  reshuffled or readjusted; 47 vice department (bureau) heads have  either been dismissed, transferred, or persuaded to retire; and  over 180 sectional cadres have either been dismissed,  transferred, or persuaded to retire.  <H3>  The Serious Damage Lies in the Fact That the Law-Enforcement  Organs Break the Law </H3>   Figures released internally by the State Council General  Office and public security organs have revealed the "internal  scandal" of the public security organs:    In 1992, the relevant quarters received over 32,300 reports  and complaints about the misdeeds of public security organs and  public security personnel. Between January and October 1993,  the number of such reports and complaints reached over 27,600.  Over 70 percent of the reports and complaints concerned  breaches of the law, racketeering, and blackmail. In addition,  over 830 serious homicides were caused in 1992 as a result of  public security departments breaking the law and closing their  eyes to national laws.    In 1992, 1.86 percent of public security personnel received  party discipline or administrative punishment, 0.97 percent were  prosecuted, and over 72,500 were transferred or had their names  expunged.  <H5>  They Got Their Jobs Through Improper Means </H5>   Many factors contribute to the poor quality of the CPC's  public security contingent, of which a very important one is  that the new public security recruits are of poor quality. The  reason that they are of such low quality is that some unemployed  young people or former young prisoners have been used to fill  the police ranks as an expedient means of livelihood, whereas  many good young people -- taking into consideration the bad  image of the "cops" -- do not want to join the force. Even  worse, many of them have joined the police force through  improper means such as utilizing connections. Obviously, they  have joined in order to hide their infamous past.    According to GONGAN TONGXUN [Public Security Newsletter]  published by the Ministry of Public Security, the Guangdong  Public Security Department recently organized a task force to  investigate the new recruits of the public security organs in  the special economic zones and coastal areas. They found that  over 60 percent of the new recruits had previously been  unemployed or idle young people; over 40 percent had had medium  poor or poor character at school; and over 20 percent had  engaged in gang fighting, theft, hooliganism, and the like.  Moreover, they found that the 65 percent of formerly unemployed  or idle young people had joined public security organs without  going the through normal examination process.    The Anhui Provincial Public Security Department's findings  were even more startling. With the help of the central and  provincial party committee's investigation teams, they conducted  investigations of the personnel of the public security organs in  the cities of Huainan, Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, Maanshan, and  Huaibei. They found that over 85 percent of the personnel  recruited since the fall of 1990 were formerly unemployed or  idle young people and that 20 percent were rural young people  who had only finished the first year of their secondary  education and had joined the police force through unusual  connections. After rechecking them, they found that over 36  percent of the new recruits had either been punished for  criminal activities or had received administrative warnings.    Public security organs have their own records: By examining  the sources of public security personnel in over 600 large,  medium, and small cities, between 1986 and 1989, we can see that  12 percent graduated from public security and police academies,  22 percent were demobilized and retired servicemen, 30 percent  were young people from industrial and mining establishments, and  36 percent were formerly unemployed young people. Excepting  those in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shandong, the recruits had only  finished the first year of their secondary education.    Since 1990, 14 percent of the recruits have graduated from  public security or police academies, 19 percent have been  demobilized and retired servicemen, 26 percent have been young  people from industrial and mining establishments, and 41 percent  have been unemployed young people. Except for those in Beijing,  Shanghai, Tianjin, Shandong, and Liaoning, recruits have, on  average, finished the second year of their secondary education.  <H3>  Eighty Percent of the People Are Dissatisfied With the  Public Security Personnel </H3>   The CPC's propaganda machine describes the public security  personnel as guards "defending the dignity of the motherland."  Unfortunately, their lofty image is no longer popular in society  today. In public opinion polls, policemen are often the most  unwelcome individuals. On 23 November, the State Statistical  Bureau empowered 16 large and medium cities in Guangdong,  Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hebei to conduct a large-scale  public opinion poll. Regarding the situation of public security  organs and public security personnel, they interviewed over  15,000 people, including party and government cadres,  intellectuals, staff and workers, students, and housewives.  They found that 73 percent of the interviewees were  dissatisfied with the practice and work performance of the  public security organs, 8 percent were extremely dissatisfied,  and only 19 percent were satisfied.    It does not help change the bad image of public security  personnel in the eyes of the people to merely depend on  instructions from the central authorities, on overhauling  leading groups, or on shooting a few people, because the  question of the public security organs concerns the overall CPC  structure. Public security personnel wearing hats with the  national emblem are not above the common man. They have already  lost their sense of values in pursuit of money and luxury.  Shielded by the one-party dictatorship, their power has become  the best weapon in the service of graft and corruption. Law  enforcement personnel who break the law and are corrupt and  degenerate are the product of the rule by man in the CPC.</p>

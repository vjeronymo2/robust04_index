			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS analyst Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 8 TASS -- Georgiy Satarov, appointed  presidential aide here today, is taking office not at a time  when he could be congratulated on his new job. He will be faced  with the far from easy task of promoting "on behalf of the  president" proper interaction among the chambers and factions of  the new Russian parliament, which has already proved to be an  independent political force.    As a matter of fact, the 46-year-old scholar has sufficient  experience in dealing with political leaders of different  leanings. As director of the Russian Socio-Political Centre, he  was able to find common language with the Communists, with  Baburin's Russian National Union, with Nikolay Travkin's party,  whose headquarters are under the centre's roof.    The "naturalistic-experimental interest" of this scientist,  who is, moreover, a member of the Presidential Council, in all  the "sectors" of the political spectrum was not always  adequately received within President Yeltsin's administration.  This is why Satarov had to publicly explain that the state was  interested in interaction with all the political parties and  movements, because they represent a channel for promoting a  dialogue between the authorities and the society.    Being concurrently director-general of the Centre for  Applied  Political Studies -- Indem (Informations for Democracy),  Candidate of Technical Sciences Georgiy Satarov has also proved  to be a remarkable sociologist. His scientific works on the  balance of political forces within the Congress of People's  Deputies of the former Russian Supreme Soviet, which were  repeatedly published in the magazine "Russian Monitor", give  reason to assert that Satarov will apparently display an equally  correct approach to the forecasting and analysis of the current  parliament's work.    It is indicative that the president is gradually giving up  the practice of inviting politically engaged people, who, while  at the helm of power, cared mostly for their own career, but  began to oppose Yeltsin the very minute they were deprived of  it. Satarov's appointment as presidential aide (new decrees are  expected to be issued to include in the presidential  administration other members of the Presidential Council from  among independent scientists) differs positively also from the  latest personnel changes within the government.    President Yeltsin publicly stated last year that he would  "fire" Satarov for disagreeing with the timing of the next  presidential elections. The ideas of this member of the  Presidential Council, which proved necessary during the  compilation of the new Russian constitution and during the  preparation of the presidential message to the parliament, have  apparently "outweighed" the president's erstwhile anger, and one  more outstanding personality was added to the group of the  presidential aides.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Clothing and engineering form industry lobby groups EMPLOYERS in Britain's fragmented textiles and clothing industries are joining forces from today in a new body, the British Apparel and Textiles Confederation (BATC). They want to raise their industries' lobbying power at a time when the international trading agreements - General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and Multi-Fibre Arrangement - are being renegotiated. Also in London yesterday an industrial pressure group aimed at reversing almost 50 years of decline in Britain's manufacturing and engineering industries was launched. It is called the UK Industrial Group and it expects to draw its membership from mainly small to medium-sized manufacturing companies. The British Apparel and Textiles Confederation is the largest such organisation in Europe, according to Mr John Wilson, its director-general. Its size partly compensates for the fact that the textile and clothing industry has shrunk under the weight of imports from low-cost countries. Employment has fallen by about 25 per cent to 400,000 in the past decade. BATC will advise employers on industrial relations, central pay bargaining and marketing as well as lobbying. The chairman is Mr James McAdam, who retired as deputy chairman and chief executive of Coats Viyella last year. BATC's creation is the culmination of a decade's work in reconciling differences between such diverse groups as the British Throwster's Association, whose 30-odd members help to process silk, and Coats Viyella, Europe's biggest textiles manufacturer. Twelve industry bodies whose roots can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution are members of the BATC: the British Lace Federation; the British Narrow Fabrics Association; the British Throwsters' Association; the Central Council of the Irish Linen Industry; the Confederation of British Wool Textiles; the Council of British Cotton Textiles; the Scottish Textile Association; the Silk Association of Great Britain, the Textile Finishers Association; the British Clothing Industry Association; the British Knitting and Clothing Export Council and the Knitting Industries Federation. Three companies become members in their own right: Coats Viyella, Courtaulds Textiles and ICI Fibres. The engineering body's 30 founding companies, forming the UK Industrial Group, represent a variety of manufacturers from all over the country. The group is launching a recruitment drive to increase the membership to 1,000 companies by the end of next year. The group is to seek a meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. It is demanding the creation of a national economic policy to foster closer co-operation between government, industry and the City. Mr David Turnbull, director-general of the new pressure group, said that in the 1980s 'Mrs Thatcher saw off the unions but then left industry to sort it out in a free-for-all which was fatal'.</p>

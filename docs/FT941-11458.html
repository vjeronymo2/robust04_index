			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / MPs warn nuclear industry of huge costs The huge cost of scrapping Britain's nuclear plants may push up taxes and electricity bills, a parliamentary committee warned yesterday. The Public Accounts Committee, the Commons watchdog on public spending, criticised what it called the nuclear industry's repeated failure to foresee the likely costs of decommissioning. The committee said: 'Weaknesses in oversight have led to inadequate provisions in the industry's accounts.' The PAC has endorsed some of the concerns of a report by the National Audit Office in July, which warned that nuclear generators might not be able to pay for decommissioning their plants. The task of safely dismantling nuclear plants is one of the industry's biggest financial burdens. Uncertainty about the liabilities disrupted the electricity privatisation four years ago and the government retained ownership of nuclear facilities. The National Audit Office put the cost of scrapping all nuclear power stations and fuel plants, as well as some military facilities, at Pounds 18bn at 1992 prices, although much of the money will not be spent for many years. The committee called yesterday for the establishment of a 'visible guaranteed fund' to provide for the eventual decommissioning of the plants. Mr Doug McRoberts of Nuclear Electric, the generator, said last night: 'We will not be a drain on the taxpayer. Nuclear Electric needs to lay aside Pounds 2.7bn by the time our existing stations reach the end of their lives, and we have no doubt we can do that.'</p>

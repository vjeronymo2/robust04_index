			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PALMDALE'S WILSON MAY FACE PROSECUTION  </P> <P> Criminal charges are likely to be filed this week against Palmdale High  football player Darius Wilson after he tackled an official during a game  against Saugus on Friday night at College of the Canyons, a Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department spokesman said.  </P> <P> Wilson, 18, was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor battery Friday night after  a bench-clearing melee forced officials to suspend the scoreless game midway  through the fourth quarter. Wilson was released on his own recognizance.  </P> <P> The case will be presented to the Newhall district attorney, according to Lt.  Marvin Dixon of the Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's substation. "I anticipate  charges to be filed Monday or Tuesday," Dixon said.  </P> <P> Southern Section officials will review the incident before determining the  outcome of the Golden League game, according to Saugus Coach Dick Flaherty.  Flaherty contended that Saugus should be awarded a victory by forfeit but said  he will rely on school administrators to pursue the matter.  </P> <P> "I'm not interested in a suspended game," Flaherty said. "And I'm not  interested in a letting-bygones-be-bygones tie. I think a statement should be  made that will get the message across."  </P> <P> Witnesses said that Wilson, a 6-foot-2, 175-pound senior, grabbed back judge  Bradley Woolley and threw him to the ground after Palmdale was charged with  three consecutive penalties with 7:40 to play. A second official was struck by  Palmdale's Mike Warren but no arrest was made, Dixon said.  </P> <P> "I had my back turned and I heard him say, 'I'm going to kill you! I'm going to  kill you!' " Woolley, 31, said. "The next thing I knew, I had my head on the  ground and he was punching me."  </P> <P> Woolley said that he will consider filing civil charges against Wilson. "I'm  not sure what my options are," he said. "I just believe that something should  be done. This can't happen again."  </P> <P> Palmdale Principal Linda Janzen said that disciplinary action will be taken  against Wilson, a starter as a wide receiver and defensive back.  </P> <P> "Consequences will follow and the young man is aware of that," Janzen said.  "What kind of action will be taken, we don't know yet."  </P> <P> Janzen said that Wilson might be suspended or expelled from school, or simply  suspended from athletic competition. Janzen drove Wilson home after his  release.  </P> <P> "It was an emotional moment for the young man," Janzen said. "As far as I know  him, this was totally out of character for him. He is a good student. He was  remorseful, humble, polite. He didn't want to talk about it at the time."  </P> <P> After Palmdale had been assessed 15 yards for a personal foul on a Saugus punt,  two more 15-yard penalties followed after members of Palmdale's bench allegedly  directed remarks toward officials.  </P> <P> Neither Wilson nor Kent Bothwell, Palmdale's first-year coach, could be reached  for comment.  </P> <P> Palmdale, a preseason favorite to contend for the league championship, entered  the league opener with a 1-4 record. Saugus (3-2) had been outgained, 220 yards  to 30, but did not allow the Falcons to penetrate inside its 20-yard line.  </P> <P> "Apparently, there was a lot of tension between players," Janzen said. "There  is a lot of pressure on this team. They obviously want a good season."  </P></p>

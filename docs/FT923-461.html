			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Japanese agree loan to Russia JAPAN signed an agreement in Moscow yesterday for a Dollars 100m low-interest loan to Russia, the Ministry of Finance said, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The loan from the Export-Import Bank, guaranteed by the Russian government, will go to Vneshekonombank, the former Soviet foreign trade bank. It will be used to finance imports of food and medical supplies, the ministry said. The loan had been pledged in December 1990, as part of humanitarian aid, but disbursement was delayed because of Russia's failure to pay interest on debt owed to Japan. Japan has not made large-scale loans to Russia because of a dispute over four islands off northern Japan.</p>

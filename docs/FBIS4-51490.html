			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Pragmatic Compromise"] </F>   [Text] After 14 years of protracted negotiations, Malaysia  and Thailand signed agreements to jointly explore resources in  the Gulf of Thailand. What is remarkable is not that it took so  long, but that any agreement was reached at all. The area which  is now known as the Joint Development Area, covering 7,250  square kilometers on the Malaysian-Thai border, has been in the  limbo of polite dispute -- by mutual agreement it had been  consigned as a no man's land, which kept its economic potential  safely out of anyone's reach. All over the world, border  disputes cause friction between nations -- sometimes enough to  heat up into war, particularly when the area is rich in  resources. The recent Gulf War was a classic case.    Territorial disputes tend to go on and on because any  contending nation would consider it too much of a face down to  concede or compromise -- land area is so integral to the  definition of national sovereignty that no territory can be  given away or even shared. National claims are often highly  complex -- invoking history, geography, security, even ancient  tradition -- so that disputed areas are left peaceably unsettled  at best. The political dimension of border issues often leave  them too intractable for easy mediation -- but there is one way  out of this impasse. If there is sufficient consensus to subdue  politics, a practical formula can be worked out to jointly  extract the disputed territory's socio-economic potential and  share the gains. Politics, however, has a habit of getting in  the way of relations between nations, to the detriment of  economic pragmatism. The attainment of the Joint Development  Area agreements not only bears testimony to the growing maturity  of the Malaysia- Thai relationship; it forms a pointer to a path  of least resistance and mutual benefit in the resolution of  similar border problems.    It is in the nature of claimant countries never to give way  for an interim deal until the core contention of territorial  sovereignty is resolved. This centrality of sovereignty in  border disputes is why even tiny bits of wasteland can turn into  a fait accompli for all out war. Thus the ability to set aside  sovereignty for the time being is not only a victory of common  sense pragmatism over doctrinaire national self-interest. The  realization of mutual economic gain also works the other way --  it diminishes the overriding all-or-nothing significance of  territorial sovereignty. Most of the region's remaining disputes  are over uninhabited little outcrops of land which have come  into contention by being at the far limit of marine boundaries.  They become sore points only when they offer an economic  potential, usually in the form of mineral deposits. Rather  ironically, this potential can also offer a first step to an  eventual settlement, rather than the pretext for discord.    Separating the prompt gains of joint exploitation from the  decisive outcome of sovereign ownership is as hard as seeing the  wood for the trees. It not only requires clear-sightedness, but  trust and self-confidence. In ASEAN, Malaysia and Thailand are  perhaps the two who most readily see eye to eye on an emphatic  regional economic focus. Trade and economics are increasingly  dominating regional security, diplomacy and multilateralism at  the expense of political ideology. Perceiving and acting on,  the difference between winning the spoils and sharing the fruits  is easy enough for the rational person. For nations, however,  it can be a big step. Malaysia and Thailand have taken that  step.</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Rea and UBS in Lloyd's venture REA BROTHERS, the small independent merchant bank, and UBS, a subsidiary of the Union Bank of Switzerland, are joining forces to explore new investment opportunities at the Lloyd's of London insurance market. A pathfinder prospectus for a Pounds 35m investment trust backed by the two groups and supplying capital to a range of Lloyd's syndicates could be issued in early October. The two groups aim to list Finsbury Underwriting Investment Trust on the Stock Exchange. A final decision to go ahead is dependent on the publication of a detailed rule book governing the operation of 'incorporated Names' by Lloyd's early next month. Approval by existing Lloyd's Names, the individuals whose assets currently supply the market's capital base, will also be required. Names are due to meet on October 20 to vote on the market's initiative to attract corporate capital. 'We are fairly confident that if rules are promulgated we can move ahead as we plan to. But there are no guarantees,' said Mr David Lyons, a director of Rea Brothers. In particular, Lloyd's will need to reassure investors that they will not be liable for liabilities arising from old insurance policies underwritten before 1986. Lloyd's announced in April that it will transfer all such liabilities to a new company, establishing a ring fence to protect new investors. 'There must be absolute confidence that people will not be funding past losses. The ring fence must work,' explained Mr Lyons. Rea Brothers and UBS will work with Wren Underwriting Agencies and Finsbury Asset Management. Investments of some Pounds 35m will allow Lloyd's syndicates to accept up to some Pounds 60m in premium income, making the scheme less ambitious than some others currently being considered by a range of US and UK banks and finance houses. BZW and Sedgwick Lloyd's Underwriting Agents are working on a scheme to raise at least Pounds 100m to form a new investment company, while James Capel and Samuel Montagu are involved in a separate scheme which could raise up to Pounds 250m. Kleinwort Benson is understood to be examining the formation of an investment trust which support syndicates managed by Sturge Holdings. Salomon Brothers, JP Morgan, SG Warburg, Phoenix Securities and Chase Manhattan are among other companies involved in Lloyd's corporate capital initiatives. Lloyd's hopes to raise at least Pounds 500m in corporate capital boosting capacity at the market in 1994 by Pounds 1bn.</p>

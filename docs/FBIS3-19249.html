			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Klaus </F> Zoellner; place and date not given: "We Will Never Cooperate  With the PDS"]    [Text] [Zoellner] Mr. Minister-President, you have been  elected [frontrunner of the Rhineland-Palatinate ticket] without  any dissenting votes. Six months before election day, does the  mood of the Social Democrats seem to be good?    [Scharping] Yes, the mood is very good. By its clear  concentration on combating unemployment, and the reestablishment  of social justice and internal peace in Germany, the Social  Democratic Party [SPD] has distinguished itself and gained  confidence and competence and I am sure we have a very good  chance in the Bundestag election.    [Zoellner] The present mood in the population, the voters,  seems to be not so good. Never before has weariness with  politics or even an election boycott been mentioned so often....    [Scharping] First of all, politicians have to act in the way  they talk and politicians have to talk in they way they think.  The basic political capital, that is, confidence, has been  considerably damaged by the past few years and many untenable  promises, particularly regarding German unity. Nevertheless, I  think that many things in the public debate on weariness with  politics are exaggerated and wrong. I know many older and  younger men and women who are very interested in politics and  are also committed. People are annoyed at the political  behavior and political parties, too. The turnout in the  Bundestag elections will be considerably higher than many  believe.    [Zoellner] Take the new laender. In the so-called  reunification election campaign, the key points were focused  there. Is this where the established parties should expect the  greatest number of people who refuse to go the the polls, since  it is precisely there that many promises have hardly been kept,  and in many places there is decline instead of recovery?    [Scharping] I hope not! Precisely regarding eastern  Germany, one has to say: If people have lived under dictatorial  conditions for many decades and then achieve freedom and  democracy, one has to deal with the implied hope in a  particularly careful and credible way. It was a bad mistake to  promise because of the election campaign in 1990 that unity will  be managed without tax increases and it was also a bad mistake  to promise flourishing landscapes to the people in eastern  Germany. Both things have to be corrected. However, this  requires that politicians formulate objectives and that all work  credibly on them, not only in politics, but also in the  enterprises and the trade unions. The concentration of forces  and new hope in Germany -- this seems to me a promising concept  for the country and the people.    [Zoellner] Take the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. In  the new laender the PDS is increasingly accepted. How seriously  do the Social Democrats take the New Left?    [Scharping] None of the radical parties, neither the PDS nor  the Republikaner, is a partner for the SPD. On the contrary,  these parties are being combatted in a particularly resolute way  and all people in eastern Germany have to know that social  progress, internal stability, justice in Germany, the  procurement of work, that all that is in the best hands with the  Social Democrats. Those who want to vote for the PDS because  they are angry and want to protest have to know that this is the  wrong course. Those who want to take effective action for  Germany's inner unity should turn to Social Democracy. Those  who vote for the PDS throw their votes into the wastepaper  basket because this party will not participate in the formation  of will.    [Zoellner] Have I understood you correctly that, in your  opinion, the PDS is not a new leftist, democratic party, but a  radical party?    [Scharping] The PDS is the immediate successor of the  Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the old forces are also  increasingly gaining ground there. No, for us the PDS is a  party with which we cannot and will not cooperate as a matter of  principle.    [Zoellner] A clear word. That is to say, the PDS is also no  partner for a talk on the necessary majority in Bonn?    [Scharping] No. We guarantee that we will never cooperate  with the PDS or other radicals and we also guarantee that we  will not conduct an election campaign for a coalition, but for  the objective that the SPD will be able to take over the lead in  politics and the government.    [Zoellner] Finally a topical issue: nursing-care insurance.  After it looked as if an agreement on this question were not  possible, an agreement was suddenly achieved. Excuse me, but  this smacks of election tactics....    [Scharping] No. Permit me a personal remark: Since the  fall, I have made intensive efforts to bring about the  nursing-care insurance, I invested much time and strength, and I  am satisfied that a result has now finally been achieved. This  would have been earlier possible in the interest of those  affected and who need nursing care. For me this is a reasonable  and justifiable result and it is a result achieved at the very  last minute with a view to the parties' prestige. We from the  SPD would not have been able to afford the to-and-fro over more  weeks or even months.</p>

"I have beaten cancer," Woerner told the paper. "Doctors say  I have an excellent chance" to live.    The interview was published on the eve of a two-day summit  meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels.    Woerner, 59, who was West German defense minister from 1982  to 1988, said he was operated on for the third time in  mid-December in Aachen, western Germany.    He underwent surgery for colon cancer in April 1992 and June  1993.</p>

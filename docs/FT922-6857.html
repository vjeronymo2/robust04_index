			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Retail sales in April show modest rise HIGH STREET sales rose modestly in April, suggesting that consumers returned to the shops after the election - but not in large numbers. The volume of retail sales in April grew by 0.8 per cent compared with March. City analysts had been looking for more robust figures after a late Easter and widespread claims of a spending surge after the election. Although April's figure was slightly disappointing, it followed a revised 1 per cent fall in sales recorded in March. The three-monthly trend continued to show volumes of sales still declining. In the three months to April, retail sales fell by 0.3 per cent compared with the previous three months. Compared with a year ago, the volume of sales fell by 0.5 per cent. Evidence that consumers are feeling more confident is gradually gathering strength. Earlier this week, the Confederation of British Industry reported the highest retail sales for two years in its quarterly survey of the distributive trades industry. The Treasury said the April figure was mainly a rebound from the fall in March, and more evidence was needed to assess the exact state of consumer demand in the post-election period. According to yesterday's figures from the Central Statistical Office, sales by food retailers rose 0.2 per cent in the three months to April and those by mixed retailers 0.1 per cent. Sales by non-food retailers fell 0.6 per cent. In the non-food sector, however, sales of household goods rose 2 per cent in the latest three months and were up 1 per cent compared with the same period a year before. Clothing and footwear sales fell 3 per cent in the latest three months compared with the three months to January. In value terms, sales in the four-week April period totalled a non-seasonally adjusted Pounds 10.5bn, which was 4 per cent higher than a year earlier. Mr Bill Martin, chief UK economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said yesterday's figures reinforced his view that consumer demand would be exceedingly slow to revive. Yesterday's figures were the first since measures designed to improve the accuracy of economic statistics were introduced by the CSO. Previously, 3,500 retailers supplied data on a voluntary basis, but 5,000 are now obliged to respond.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Finnish banks incur FM6bn loss THE CRISIS in Finland's financial sector deepened yesterday after three of the country's leading banks announced losses of more than FM6bn (Pounds 759m) for the first eight months. The scale of the losses forced the government to reiterate its support for the sector as it warned that billions more markka in new state grants would be needed next year. Three of the leading banks, Unitas (the holding company for the Union Bank of Finland), Skopbank and Kansallis-Osaki-Pankki (KOP), warned that their performance was unlikely to improve in the final four months, with total losses for the year likely to exceed FM9bn. The banks have been battered by the severe Finnish recession and the high level of real interest rates. Credit losses and non-performing loans have soared. Rising funding costs, stagnant credit demand and falling share prices have added to difficulties. The most severe problems are being encountered by small and medium-sized businesses, many of which have been forced into bankruptcy, but the personal sector has not escaped the ravages caused by a 13 per cent unemployment rate. Total credit write-offs announced by the three banks for the first eight months amounted to FM5.2bn. The problems mean that Unitas, the holding company for the Union Bank of Finland, will now seek FM1.75bn in preference capital from the government, the maximum possible sum allowed under a FM8bn scheme set up earlier this year. Skopbank, which had to be rescued by the Bank of Finland last year, has said it will need additional financial support before the end of the year. KOP has indicated it may have to seek support from the FM20bn state guarantee fund early next year if losses continue at current levels. Mr Vesa Vainio, Unitas chief executive said: 'High domestic interest rates are the banking sector's most acute problem. Unless interest rates come down, no increase in net income from financing operations, the banks' major source of income, will be possible.' Mr Jorma Aranko, director-general of the Finnish banking supervision authority, suggested the state may convert financial support into majority stakes. Details, Page 28</p>

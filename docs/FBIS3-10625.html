A study conducted by a large retail loans bank indicates that  losses to the financial system could reach $10.4 billion. It is  estimated that the new currency might reduce the monthly  inflation rate to about 2 percent by May.    This upheaval will force the financial institutions to gain  money with new products, adjust their fees to higher rates, and  indirectly streamline their structures. Its impact should be  similar to that caused by the Cruzado Program in 1986, although  the financial system has already had to go through extensive  belt-tightening since then.    Arnoldo de Oliveira, the National Bank executive board  superintendent, emphasizes: "It will be a painful process  because it will end with a dishonest system. And after this the  system's profitability will decline."    By a dishonest system we understand the following: The bank  overlooks the huge profits yielded by floating funds -- the  unused money that remains in the current accounts. And the  customer, in turn, pretends that the bank does not have any  operational costs. Out of a total $18 billion in profits, this  sector gained $4 billion through the use of floating funds.

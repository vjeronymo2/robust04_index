			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> ANGELIC 'CLARENCE' A 'WONDERFUL LIFE' SPINOFF  </P> <P> The Family Channel premieres a movie about a guardian angel, "Clarence," at 8  tonight. Robert Carradine's entitled angel is an ingenuous character arriving  from heaven to save a suicidal mother and her children from ruin.  </P> <P> If that sounds familiar, it's because the plot is a variation of Frank Capra's  "It's a Wonderful Life." Even closer at hand, "Clarence" is a moderately  flavorful spinoff of the 1977 TV movie remake of the Capra classic called "It  Happened One Christmas," which starred Marlo Thomas.  </P> <P> "Clarence" has a piquant touch, and director Eric Tull and writers Lorne  Cameron and David Hoselton create a children's picture-book heaven in the  opening sequences with a youthful head angel dispatching the reluctant  Carradine to Earth, looking snappy in a trench coat.  </P> <P> As a Thanksgiving show, families could do a lot worse than "Clarence," and for  young viewers who don't know about the genre's antecedents (such as those '40s  classics "Heaven Can Wait" and "Stairway to Heaven"), this production has  sufficient fantasy to nudge the imagination.  </P> <P> Carradine is self-effacing and angelic, and Kate Trotter is earnest as the  widowed wife battling to save her video-game company. The script's payoff could  be stronger; the tone is a shade too fragile. But you do understand the  flustered chief angel up there when he looks through the clouds at one of his  file clerks in the opening moments and says, "The way the world is these days,  our guardian angels are working overtime as it is."

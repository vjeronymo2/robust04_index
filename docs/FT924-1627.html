			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Scottish questions provoke anger LABOUR MPS erupted in fury during the last session of Scottish questions before Christmas yesterday, as a succession of Tories used it to highlight alleged breaches of duty at a local authority that includes the parliamentary seat of Mr John Smith, the Labour leader. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, indicated that he was considering whether the allegations might amount to a breach of Monklands district council's statutory duties. 'My powers to intervene in such matters are limited by statute law,' Mr Lang said. He did, however, have discretionary powers to order a local inquiry 'if I consider that a local authority have either failed to carry out a statutory duty or I am of the opinion that an investigation should be made to determine whether they have so failed'. Answering a question from Mr Bill Walker, Tory MP for Tayside North, regarding the authority's use of public money, Mr Lang said the Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland could submit a report to him if it concluded the council had illegally authorised expenditure. The commission's recommendations might include 'the surcharging of those responsible and I am empowered to do so,' Mr Lang said. 'But I have no evidence that would be appropriate.' The row resulted from a contribution from Mr David Shaw, Tory MP for Dover, who said many Scots had been 'shocked to learn that 22 relatives of Labour councillors are employed by Monklands District Council'. Labour MPs were also incensed that the first three questions listed on the order paper were tabled by MPs representing English seats. The Commons yesterday approved a new power for Scotland's most senior law officer to appeal against sentences he considers too lenient. The move, an amendment to the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Bill due to complete its Commons stages tonight, matches changes made in England and Wales in 1988. Junior Scottish minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, envisaged that the power would be used 'very sparingly'.</p>

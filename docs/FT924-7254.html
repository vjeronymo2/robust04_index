			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (3): Here come the ozone men - Clinton and Gore will move with caution IT IS said that Bob Crandall, head of American Airlines, walks through company headquarters switching off lights before leaving work in the evening. Mr Crandall's idiosyncratic approach to reducing energy consumption, though perhaps apocryphal, illustrates US industry's changing attitude towards energy efficiency in a nation wary of regulation. The departing Bush administration has been sharply criticised by environmental groups and politicians for its reluctance to mandate any legislation towards environmental protection, preferring to rely on incentives to encourage corporate and industrial responsibility. President Bush's credibility as the 'environmental president' was shaken severely at this summer's Rio Earth Summit, partly by his reluctance to attend the summit at all, and partly by his moves to weaken a treaty to combat global warming and his refusal to sign a treaty to protect endangered species. With a new administration ready to take office at the end of the year, a large question mark hangs over industry about future policies. It seems safe to assume that the new administration will be more receptive to legislation aimed at encouraging efficiency and protecting the environment. Vice president-elect Al Gore has a reputation as an environmental activist. But it seems equally probable that the Clinton administration will continue to pursue an environmental policy which does not undermine jobs or the economy. In the area of petrol consumption, for example, Mr Clinton's position appears somewhat flexible. During the election campaign, Mr Clinton said he supported higher fuel-economy standards of 40 to 45 miles per gallon from their present levels of 27.5mpg. Following a study by the Natonal Academy of Sciences which raised questions about the practicalities of increasing fuel economy standards above 37mpg, Mr Clinton indicated that the higher range was merely a goal. Although the US has improved its efficiency significantly since the 1970s, energy efficiency does not come naturally to a nation with a wealth of natural resources. The US has about 25 per cent of the world's coal reserves, and low energy prices, which do not reflect the full costs of production and use, have further encouraged consumption. The biggest improvements in efficiency have been made in space heating and driving. But in other areas, such as homes, appliances and buildings, the US uses some 30 per cent more energy per unit of activity than other countries. In addition, it is estimated that the US emitted 22 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide in 1989, although it has less than 5 per cent of the world's population. While there is a growing acceptance of the benefits of energy efficiency in the US, there remains a large degree of uncertainty about what role, if any, federal government should play in enforcing programmes. A recent study by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy found that: 'Energy efficiency improvements lead to more jobs and higher personal income at the national level, in addition to saving consumers money, reducing energy imports and cutting pollutant emissions associated with energy.' Earlier this year, Mr Steve Nadel of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy told a congressional briefing that the Department of Energy could do more to improve the efficiency of electricity generation. According to Mr Nadel, power production efficiencies could be improved to about 40 per cent from 30 per cent by using modern generating equipment. To date, the government's main thrust has been to persuade business that energy efficiency saves money. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed an energy efficient lighting programme, called Green Lights, aimed at reducing air pollution by encouraging companies and local governments to replace existing lighting systems with more energy efficient equipment. Participation is strictly voluntary, but the EPA has made great strides in persuading companies that they will save a significant amount of money by enrolling in the programme. According to the agency, more than 425 businesses have enrolled in Green Lights since it was launched in 1991. The EPA estimates it has been installed in 2.65bn square feet of office space, saving about Dollars 6bn a year in utility bills. Following the success of its Green Lights initiative, the EPA recently introduced a second programme, Energy Star, to encourage computer manufacturers to produce energy efficient personal computers. The programme is aimed at addressing the surge in electricity use among businesses, largely because of the increased presence of high technology and power-dependent equipment in offices. About 5 per cent of electricity consumption in the commercial sector is used by computers, and this is expected to double by the year 2000. Most of the biggest computer makers in the US, including Apple Computer and IBM, have signed the EPA agreement to market energy-efficient personal computers and monitors which will automatically switch to low energy consumption when not in use. These measures could cut personal computer energy consumption in half, producing savings of about Dollars 1bn in annual power costs. In addition to the EPA's attempts to get businesses to improve their efficiency voluntarily, there have been some regulations passed in recent years to encourage efficiency. Around 20 US states now allow utilities to earn a return on their investments in conservation programmes such as energy audits. As a result, Pacific Gas and Electric offers customers incentives to improve their energy efficiency, which the utility estimates will save about 18m tonnes of carbon dioxide in the next 10 years. There is also legislation to set minimum efficiency standards for lamps, electric motors and small commercial heating and ventilation. Some companies are implementing conservation policies of their own. Minnesota Mining &amp; Mineral (3M), for example, has introduced a programme to reduce its energy use by 20 per cent between 1990 and 1995. Meanwhile, industry and environmentalists alike can only wait to see what the Clinton presidency will mean for further efficiency initiatives in the US.</p>

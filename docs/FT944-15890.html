			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Fashion: Catwalks of Milan inspire the Italian extremes - Designers line up like opposing armies behind the twin kings, Versace and Armani. Avril Groom went to view the results of these creative clashes The Italians have a word for it. Bravura is the exact description for their attitude to fashion. There are two utterly opposite versions of Italian style but the adherents of each have equal panache. On the streets of Milan, style is as brash as the city's image. The must-have accessories are a mobile telephone, a clutch of designer carrier bags and a gilt complex, new-money symbols in a country where mass prosperity arrived less than 30 years ago. But, as hidden and subtle as the private courtyard gardens behind the blank walls of the city's palazzos, there is also Milan's minimalist tendency. Its followers - women whose attitudes have evolved beyond straightforward showiness - are totally immune to the blandishments of even the most gorgeous accessory and go about, apparently bare-faced and tousle-haired, yet still looking wonderful. Perhaps both extremes are inspired by the Milan catwalks where the division in style is glaringly obvious as the designers line up like opposing armies behind the twin kings, Versace and Armani. Although everyone has apparently been watching retro films such as La Dolce Vita and the re-runs celebrating Bardot's 60th birthday, the resulting images are diametrically opposed. The lingerie-revealing or tightly-swathed woman at Dolce e Gabbana, Blumarine, Genny and Krizia is the wicked counterpart of the ingenue in her unadorned knee-length dress or belted suit at Prada, Alberta Ferretti, Jil Sander, Industria or even Gucci. There are some common links. The longer skirt, hovering somewhere around the knee, is a fashion reality, as is the skinny-cut, glam-rock trouser suit in a shiny fabric. Both are surfacing in the other fashion capitals as firm pointers for next spring. Sometimes the images blur. Versace proved that when he puts aside gilt frippery and takes out his cutting scissors the results are drop-dead glamorous rather than vulgar. While he lowered some of his skirts, Armani raised his, with wrap-fronted organza shorts and discreetly beaded net tops overtly and uncharacteristically sexy. Instead of these shows inspiring the woman, the reverse is true. Milanese designers aim to put clothes on bodies rather than roll back the frontiers of fashion thinking. So absorbed is the Italian woman in fashion that the home market accounts for a large proportion of an industry worth Pounds 35bn. She is also a voracious consumer of imported fashion - international names jostle for space in high-profile streets such as the Via della Spiga and Corso Vittorio Emmanuele - and home-grown designers need to stay ahead of the game. So their designs have undoubted feminine appeal, either to the independent woman for whom quality and feel is as important as adornment, or to those who like to capitalise on their curves - and in a city where fishnet tights and lace bodies are the current fads for normal office wear, there is no shortage of those. With these raw materials the best-dressed Italian women achieve striking results. They do it partly by spending power. 'Young women spend hugely on themselves,' says Laura Harris, an English 20-something working in Milan as consultant fashion co-ordinator for Blumarine. 'Their priorities are holidays, clothes, beauty, exercise classes and, later, plastic surgery. It's easy to look good if you shop at Armani. Most Englishwomen try to look stylish on Marks and Spencer.' She finds Italian style tasteful but safe, lacking in individuality. Designer Alberta Ferretti, acknowledged mistress of the little dress, agrees. 'We can learn from British eccentricity, that willingness to try something unexpected,' she says. When the British try, it too often looks eccentric, but when the Italians try, it seems tastefully individual. Ferretti thinks this has to do with simplicity. On the day we met, simplicity for her was a pair of old diamond drop earrings, worn with a plain black tunic dress of cobwebby knit and chiffon. Italian bravura again, where the British would tend to overload. Other examples we saw included a grey trouser suit worn with soft suede burgundy loafers, the unadorned trousers and jacket worn by Jil Sander Illustrations: Margaret Keedy that showed off her magnificent chronograph, and bold colour-schemes such as the black velvet shift which jewellery designer Angela Pintaldi picked up in New York as a vehicle for her heavy swag of amber beads, soft orange velvet bag and deep crimson velvet headband. Constructing such an artfully simple look takes time. 'We have the choice of many accessory and shoe firms, from factories to single artisans,' says Ferretti. Italy now has one of the world's lowest birthrates, so bambini create few obstacles in the search for style. 'We always take time for our own personalities,' says actress Claudia Cardinale, unofficial ambassadress for Armani. 'Looking good is part of it. The secret is to buy the best, simple clothes so your individuality shines through. I gave up wearing jewellery during the day two years ago. It is not modern and detracts from me as a person. But hair is important. I like small, neat hair - if it is not looking good I wear a crochet cap, which is practical and individual.' She was talking, resplendent in diamond earrings, at Armani's 20-year celebration in his newly-acquired 18th-century Palazzo Orsini. Next morning there was not a jewel in sight, just plain beige Armani which, she explained, she could put with everything from jeans and sweater to a bra and chiffon evening skirt. For older women this meticulousness means full make-up and hair-do at all times. Giorgio Guidotti, of MaxMara, says his mother would not even answer the door unless her toilette was complete. Fiamma Ferragamo, whose family firm's clothes and shoes, just on the sexy side of safe, are so successful that they have recently overtaken Gucci's turnover, says that even for the less wealthy a budget for hairdressser and beauty salon is normal. If you are rich, the experts come to you. Wanda Galtrucco, a member of one of Italy's leading textile industry families and a mature Versace client, goes only to the hairdresser. All her other treatments are devised at home by her personal beautician. Tiny and lively, she is a perfect example of bravura. Far from believing that Versace's mini-skirted suits are only for the young she feels they 'exalt my personality' and happily wears beaded jackets with jeans. She sparkles in pale pink and, rather than vulgarising it with more gilt jewellery, deftly adds fine antique gold and coral that ought to clash, but somehow just works. German designer Jil Sander shows and manufactures much of her collection in Italy, which is her biggest export market. A committed minimalist, she has seen changes in the past five years. 'Younger women's tastes veer towards quality and fabrics which feel good on the body - opulent minimalism, in fact. The media have spread these ideas among intelligent women globally but Italian women caught on early.' For many, the gym has replaced the beauty salon. Christina Malgara, Gucci's Paris press attache, goes to the gym twice a week and likes a natural look, which means make-up infinitely subtly applied. Tall and rangy, she wears her company's clothes unconventionally. This ease with their femininity comes, some of the women feel, from the appreciative attitude of Italian men who judge aesthetically, rather than socially like the English. 'If an Englishman sees a woman in a short skirt and high heels he assumes she is not respectable,' says Giorgio Guidotti. 'An Italian will not care, as long as she looks good.' The usual reason given for this concern for appearances in both sexes is an Italian environment full of art and history. This is not convincing, especially for those living in workaday cities such as Milan. Guidotti's less attractive explanation is probably nearer the truth. 'Italy is very provincial,' he says. 'Even Milan is a series of small communities. Families do not move around a lot; everyone knows everyone else. Girls grow up vying with each other, wanting to look good because they see the boy they fancy on the way to school. It's pride and competitiveness.' The results are legendary but they can, it seems, be learnt. Laura Harris says her style has become more polished in her two years as a Milanesa. Though her layered, skinny look could have been English, she consciously had on a neat mini-kilt instead of an exaggerated A-line and sleek knee-high boots instead of Dr Martens. But she has not quite learnt all the little ways. She did not ask to see the sketch our artist was making of her. Neither did Jil Sander. But every Italian subject asked to see her bella figura before even the rough was finished. Flights to Milan courtesy of Air UK's new route from Stansted. Flights from Pounds 145 return.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, March 31 (AFP) -- The United Nations  Protection Force in Croatia needs 2,000 additional troops to  enforce the ceasefire between Serb separatists and the Croatian  army, deputy UNPROFOR commander General John MacInnis said  Thursday [31 March].    The UN peacekeepers were "virtually prepared" to take up  positions between the antagonists in line with the ceasefire  accord signed here Wednesday which comes into effect at 0700 GMT  next Monday, the Canadian general said.    Under the deal the two sides will withdraw their forces and  heavy weapons along the confrontation line between the two  forces: the Croatian army and Serb separatists who have  proclaimed their own "Serb republic of Krajina" [RSK] on one  third of Croatian territory. Mortars are to be withdrawn 10  kilometres (six miles) and artillery 20 kilometres (12 miles)  from the confrontation lines by Monday at 0700 GMT, while the  opposing forces are to move back one kilometre by next Friday at  0700 GMT, creating a two-kilometre buffer zone in which the UN  forces will enforce the ceasefire. "We are a little short of  resources, but our plans are taking this into account, we are  aware of sensitive areas and we will concentrate our efforts on  those sensitive areas," MacInnis said.    UNPROFOR will redeploy forces currently elsewhere, notably  Belgian and Jordanian troops temporarily withdrawn from Croatia  to implement the ceasefire in Sarajevo. The 400 Russian  paratroopers sent to Sarajevo from Klisa in eastern Croatia  "will remain in Bosnia." The additional resources needed in  Croatia -- where 15,000 peacekeepers are already deployed --  amount to four mechanised infantry companies, a mechanised  infantry battalion comprising 1,000 men, four engineering  companies comprising 600 men and a squadron of six helicopters  comprising 200 men, UNPROFOR spokesman Matthew Nerzig said.    "The first difficult task will be... transforming what was  written on the map to precise locations on the ground, the  establishment of our joint (Serb-Croatian) commissions which  will have the task of confirming on the ground precisely where  those lines of separation are to be... a difficult if not  impossible task," MacInnis said. The commissions are also to  determine the number of Serb and Croatian police who under the  accord are to be deployed in limited numbers between the two  "separation lines." "We will have to go over the area point by  point, village by village, town by town in order to determine  the police presence for those areas. It's going to be a lot of  hard work," he said.</p>

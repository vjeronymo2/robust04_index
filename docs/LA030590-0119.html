Bell said.  </P> <P> He said the embassy is still awaiting a letter from the Chinese government to  formalize the agreement.  </P> <P> China took part in the U.S. scholarly exchange program for a decade, with 24  scholars traveling in each direction in recent years.  </P> <P> It abruptly canceled the 1989-90 academic year exchanges in August in anger  over U.S. criticism of the army's killing of pro-democracy protesters in  Beijing.  </P> <P> Talks on resuming the exchanges began in December, after U.S. National Security  Adviser Brent Scowcroft made a fence-mending visit to Beijing.  </P></p>

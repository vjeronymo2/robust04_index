			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> TRADE GROUPS SAY STATE LAWS ARE BEST WAY TO END LOCAL REGULATORY SPATS  </P> <P> For years, proposals to ban smoking in public places have incensed the  California Restaurant Assn. Then, this summer, the 3,000-member trade group  came out with a surprise announcement: It would support a ban on smoking in all  public places.  </P> <P> But there was a catch: The support would come only if "such regulation is  rendered on a statewide basis."  </P> <P> Frustrated trying to fend off different regulatory schemes at the city and  county level, restaurant owners are asking the Legislature to approve a bill  that would adopt state standards and overturn dozens of local laws that  regulate smoking in restaurants.  </P> <P> The effort is part of a growing movement among business trade groups of asking  state lawmakers to intercede in local regulatory spats.  </P> <P> The real estate industry persuaded the Legislature to curtail local laws that  limit the use of for-sale signs in open houses. Banks and thrifts wouldn't  support a bill to make automated teller machines safer until the legislation  was amended with a provision that prohibits local communities from enacting  their own rules.  </P> <P> Commercial property owners are turning to state lawmakers for relief from local  smoke detector rules, and legislation on rent control and pornography is also  being pushed by special interests that don't want to deal with local  regulations.  </P> <P> "You see more industries pushing for state legislation because cities are more  interested in regulating business," said Fred Main, vice president of the  California Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> Main said business first turned to state legislation in the 1950s, when it  lobbied for a uniform sales and use tax. "Business has always liked  uniformity," he said.  </P> <P> In the case of the restaurant lobby, its stance is a concession that regulation  is necessary.  </P> <P> "We have always taken a position that government should stay out of our way,"  said Stan Kyker, executive vice president of the California Restaurant Assn.  "But after much soul searching, we decided that the pattern of local regulation  that was evolving wasn't serving anyone, including our industry."  </P> <P> Restaurant owners admit that economic self-interest is behind their new  position. Fearful of suits about secondhand smoke and worried that a patchwork  of local ordinances is hurting some of its members, the association decided  that a statewide ban was the best way to go.  </P> <P> "The reversal was smart politics, California-style," Kevin Farrell wrote in a  restaurant trade magazine. "CRA, with its announcement, was able to get into  step with the public, which has clearly indicated its preference for a smoking  ban."  </P> <P> But Kyker conceded that it will be difficult to persuade the Legislature to  adopt the smoking ban. "The tobacco industry isn't happy with us at all, and we  don't have the resources they do," he said.  </P> <P> Also, the restaurant association has taken an all-or-nothing position. It wants  a ban in "all public places," which Kyker said might be interpreted as Dodger  Stadium and even open-air patios. "Our position is that restaurants should not  be singled out, which is what happens with many of these local ordinances," he  said.  </P> <P> Because the restaurant association has not come up with specific  recommendations for legislation, some charge that its change of heart was a  public relations ploy. Kyker denies that. "We intend to see this through," he  said.  </P> <P> Industries besides restaurants are also turning to the Legislature to try to  obtain relief from local regulations.  </P> <P> The California Assn. of Realtors was troubled by homeowner associations and  cities adopting laws that regulate placement of for-sale signs. Twice in three  years, the industry has pushed through state laws that permit signs to be  placed anywhere they don't pose a safety hazard.  </P> <P> This trend concerns the League of California Cities.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, it has become too easy for a special interest to come to the  Legislature and pass a bill that waters down local laws or eliminates them  altogether," said Executive Director Don Benninghoven. "When several cities  consider the same issue, it probably means that there is a legitimate problem  out there. Then we permit state lawmakers to squelch the local responses to  these concerns."  </P> <P> Business lobbyists see the trend as a practical response to a proliferation of  regulations at the local level.  </P> <P> "I don't think this is a case of business lobbyists getting together and  deciding that we are going to take away local control," said real estate  lobbyist David Booher, who has been pushing for statewide rules on rent  control. "Business sees 450 municipalities and 58 counties coming at them with  different regulatory schemes, so they look to the state Legislature to better  manage the problem."  </P> <P> State lawmakers must decide what is best left to local leaders and what is of  statewide significance. "I try to resist marching out and telling local  officials what they should be doing about all of these issues," said Tom  Hannigan (D-Fairfield).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tough U.S. Plan Irks State Bank Regulator  </P> <P> California Superintendent of Banks James E. Gilleran wants L. William Seidman,  chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., to tread carefully when he  pushes for tougher banking regulations.  </P> <P> When Gilleran heard about an FDIC proposal to prevent banks from underwriting  insurance and making real estate investments, he fired off a letter to Seidman.  </P> <P> "California offers a textbook example of how to conduct real estate and  insurance powers in a prudent and profitable manner," wrote Gilleran, who is  responsible for regulating state-chartered banks such as First Interstate,  Union Bank and Sumitomo Bank of California.  </P> <P> He encouraged Seidman "to reject any broad and sweeping changes."  </P> <P> "We too are concerned about the condition of banks in an economic downturn,"  said John Paulus, deputy superintendent of banks. "But when regulators do  something from Washington, they shouldn't paint everyone with the same brush."  </P> <P> According to Paulus, the state superintendent carefully examines banking  activity and closely monitors real estate investment and insurance activities.  </P> <P> To prove his contention that California banks aren't in serious trouble with  their real estate and insurance portfolios, Gilleran will soon release a report  that analyzes these investments and their performance.  </P> <P> Another study that supports Gilleran's position was released last week by the  California Mortgage Bankers Assn. It shows that less than 0.8% of the 8,208  commercial property loans in California are delinquent 30 or more days.  </P></p>

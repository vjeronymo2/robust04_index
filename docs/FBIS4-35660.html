			<p>BFN     [Text] Tripoli, al Maa'[May] 26 JANA (Arab Maghreb Union  Pool)--The secretary of the General Peoples Committee for Unity  met with the members of the Libyan-Algerian economic working  team which is entrusted with the task of studying the various  aspects of co-operation and integration between the Great  Jamahiriyah and Algeria in preparation for the convening of the  joint higher committee next month.    During this meeting, the secretary stressed that there was  no  alternative to serious work to achieve Arab unity to confront  the political, social, and economic challenges facing the Arab  world as part of the attempts by the imperialists to dominate  it. He emphasised the need for the goal of unity to be sacred  goal which requires extensive efforts.    He said that the deep relationship and joint goals which  bind  the al Fateh revolution and the Algerian revolution will help  them to [word indistinct] a prominent role in this sphere. He  ended by saying that co-operation, integration and unity could  not solve the problems of reaction and dependence which the  imperialists are trying to impose.    The secretary said that the Great Jamahiriyah, acted in line  with its responsibilities towards African nations [words  indistinct] assistance and support for the African liberation  movements with the aim of enhancing the movements of total  struggle which had been led by Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation  Front] movement in Mozambique, Zano and Zabo movements in  Zimbabwe, SWAPO [South-West African People's Organization]  movement in Namibia, the A.N.C and the Pan African Congress in  South Africa.    He went on to say that the liberation movements, following  the elimination of colonialism and racism have become states and  the enemies of yesterday which are forgetting their unholy  alliance with colonialism and racism, try to woo these states  and offer assistance to them while trying to forget that the  blockade imposed on the great socialist People's Libyan Arab  Jamahiriyah was caused by its support and assistance for the  African liberation movements. He confirmed that the  emancipation of South Africa from racism paves the way of the  future victory and triumph of the Arab people in occupied  Palestine who are struggling against the Zionist racist. He said  that our jubilation will not complete unless after the  achievement of the final victory for the Arab Palestinian people  and after all Arab occupied territories are regained.    He said in accordance with the African brethren and good  neighbourlyhood spirit agreement had been reached between the  Great Jamahiriyah and Chad to implement the decision of the  International Court of Justice.    The secretary said: All [word indistinct] may remember, more  than anyone else the nature of conflict between my country and  the three Western states and the practical steps taken by Libya  to find a peaceful settlement for this dispute and its  acceptance to deal with the Security Council Resolution No. 731  as nothing remains for the complete implementation generally  except the two suspects standing trial before the court which is  based on the legal principle that forbids the surrendering of  nationals for other states to try them outside its territory,  with the preparedness to let the two suspects stand [words  indistinct] and just court to be agreed upon by the parties with  the aim of establishing the truth and try them at the quarters  of the International Court of Justice but the other concerned  patriots did not respond favourably with these practical  initiatives offered by the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab  Jamahiriyah which aim at finding a fair and just settlement to  satisfy the concerned parties particularly in the wake of the  solid support of the international and regional organization for  the position of the Great Jamahiriyah and the calls for the  non-escalation of the dispute and the need to arrive at a  peaceful settlement to satisfy all parties.    The secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign  Liaison and International Cooperation paid tribute to the  positive role played by the O.A.U. towards this issue which is  represented by the decision taken in the 58th. session  unanimously by the ministerial council in Cairo and ratified by  the 29th. summit of African presidents which called for urging  the U.N. Security Council to review Resolution No. 748 and lift  the sanctions imposed on Libya in appreciation of the positive  initiatives offered by the Great Jamahiriyah to settle the  crisis. The reduced African summit held in Cairo in al Kanoun  (December) 1993 made an appeal for a peaceful settlement for the  conflict and called for a fair trial of the two suspects in a  neutral state.    The secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign  Liaison and International Cooperation appeal to the sisterly  states, friendly countries, the conscience of the world, the  intellectuals and jurists in the world to tackle and confront  this flagrant violation for the international law and the United  Nations Charter so that the Security Council may not be  transformed [word indistinct] council against smaller countries.    He concluded his speech by saying that present conditions  and  international developments oblige us to be more vigilant to  defend our causes and issues and to act towards settling all our  disputes within the framework of the Organization of African  Unity and to seek the settlement of the debts crisis which is  posing heavily on most of our countries. The confrontation of  these challenges and others will not be achieved unless through  joint will, solid collective resolve and commitment to total  African unity.</p>

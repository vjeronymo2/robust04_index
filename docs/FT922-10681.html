			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Scots bank faces escalated action INDUSTRIAL action by 16,000 Royal Bank of Scotland staff is likely to escalate if the bank continues to refuse pay talks, the banking union Bifu said yesterday. The union launched an overtime ban and work-to-contract action before the Easter weekend as part of its campaign of industrial action over pay. The union will discuss new measures early next week. It has rejected an offer of between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent for clerical grades and a performance-related pay package for managers, which it says fails to guarantee a rise.</p>

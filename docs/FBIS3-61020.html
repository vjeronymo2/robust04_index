Kachekan  (experts from the Association of Practitioners of Space Science)  under the rubric "Space Science Abroad": "Imaging  Reconnaissance"]    [Text] The start of systematic imaging reconnaissance from  space was laid down abroad with the launch of the Discoverer-13  spacecraft by the United States in 1960. It was to perform the  tasks of detecting Soviet ICBMs, determining their quantities,  ascertaining their characteristics and degree of vulnerability  and mapping the territory of the USSR to determine target  coordinates for American missiles.    Spacecraft of this type, depending on the degree of detail  of  the information obtained, were divided into survey  reconnaissance (Samos-P) spacecraft, whose operation continued  until 1972, and detail reconnaissance (Samos-M) craft, used for  a longer period (up to 1977).    The first reconnaissance satellites were equipped with a  camera. The exposed film was delivered to Earth in a special  capsule that was jettisoned from the craft on an assigned  stretch of its trajectory. A parachute system was actuated at a  certain altitude, and the capsule descended to the ocean surface  or was captured in the air by a C-130 aircraft.    It should be noted that only 26 of the 38 satellites in the  Discoverer experimental series were put into orbit, and only  half the capsules were recovered in the air or found in the  water.    The United States launched the fourth-generation LASP (Low  Altitude Surveillance Platform) spacecraft in 1971 to replace  the functions of the Samos-P and Samos-M satellites. The set of  photographic gear installed on board made it possible to obtain  pictures of territories and objects with a resolution of  0.3--0.5 meters at the ground in detail mode and 2.5--3.5 meters  in survey mode, with the transmission of information by radio  channel. The satellite, which weighed about 14 tons, had fuel  reserves that allowed it to change its operating orbital  altitude from 150 to 230 kilometers, and to adjust it to provide  for an active existence of six--eight months. The LASPs, like  the imaging reconnaissance satellites of the prior generations,  were launched periodically. A Samos-M detail  photo-reconnaissance satellite was launched, as a rule, in the  intervals between the end of the functioning of one craft and  the launch of the next into orbit. There were 20 LASPs launched  in all. The last launch (in April of 1986) was a failure--the  launch vehicle blew up in flight.    All of the functions for the performance of imaging  reconnaissance from space have been performed since that time by  the fifth-generation KH-11 satellites, which were developed on a  fundamentally new basis. The optical image is formed in them on  the surface of the light-sensitive element of a CCD  (charge-coupled device), which transforms light signals of  varying intensity into electrical ones transmitted in digital  form through a relay satellite to the ground station at Fort  Belvoir (Virginia). This information then arrives in real time  at the National Photographic Interpretation Center in  Washington, part of the CIA.    The KH-11 satellites were launched by Titan-3D and Titan-34D  launch vehicles into heliosynchronous orbits with parameters of  inclination 96.2--97.8&deg;, altitude at apogee 500--1,000 km  and perigee 210--350 km, which allows the satellites to reach  the areas being monitored at a time that is optimal in the  lighting conditions of the Earth's surface.    The special gear of the KH-11 supports a resolution in the  visible wavelength spectrum of 0.15--0.18 meters at the ground  in a photographing strip of 2.8 x 2.8 km, and 0.5--1.7 meters in  a strip of 90 x 120 km. These resolution values are potential,  and they can be obtained only under ideal surveillance  conditions (illumination of the Earth's surface of more than 950  W/m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  and insignificant effects of atmospheric  turbulence) and at absolute values of optical contrast. It was  unsuited, at the same time, for the receipt of photographs at  night. Cloud cover, which made the surveillance of the territory  being monitored more difficult, was also an insurmountable  obstacle for it.    One method of overcoming these drawbacks was tried out in  August 1989, when the Columbia space shuttle placed in orbit a  spacecraft with gear that functions in the visible and infrared  bands.    This Advanced KH-11 satellite, which was erroneously called  the KH-12, is able to obtain images in day or at night when  there are cloud levels of up to four or five. It uses a  telescope of the Hubble type with a main mirror diameter of 2.5  meters, light construction with elements of adaptive optics to  compensate for atmospheric disturbances, a wave front sensor  (shift interferometer), CCD matrices and the like.    The special gear is able to transmit images with a  resolution  at the ground in the visible spectrum of 0.08--0.1 meters in a  strip of 2.8 x 2.8 km or 0.5--1.0 meters in a strip of 90 x 120  km, and about 0.6--0.8 meters in the infrared band in a strip of  2.8 x 2.8 km. By operating in the infrared wavelengths, it can  distinguish cut leaf cover used as camouflage from living  vegetation and determine the status of objects under  surveillance.    The Advanced KH-11 satellite has the capability to detect  the  whole inventory of military hardware and armaments of various  countries with high probability, and to track their rearming or  upgrading.    A second Advanced KH-11 satellite was placed in orbit in  February 1990 by the Atlantis spacecraft. It quickly became  disabled, however. The CIA is planning to bring the number of  such satellites in orbit to three, which would make it possible  to accomplish the program of photo reconnaissance of the globe  to the full extent.

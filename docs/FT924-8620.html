			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Bleak result at Minolta reflects strategic flaw MINOLTA, the Japanese camera maker, yesterday announced pre-tax losses of Y4.98bn (Dollars 40m) for the six months ended September, reflecting the vulnerability of leading Japanese companies with a past strategy of high quality but low profitability. The company's interim statement painted a bleak picture. After reporting taxable losses of Y2bn in the same period last year, cash reserves have fallen and short-term borrowings have increased, while the value of securities holdings was eroded by the continuing weakness of the Tokyo stock market. Sales for the first half were down 11.9 per cent to Y99.5bn, as Minolta faced intense competition in the domestic camera market and struggled to fulfil its aim of shifting the sales emphasis to office equipment such as copiers and word processors. Camera sales were down 22 per cent during the period, with export earnings down 26 per cent. A restructuring plan intends to reduce the reliance on export earnings by increasing sales in the home market, but domestic sales were also 13 per cent lower. Office equipment sales were down by just over 3 per cent, and sales in the domestic market rose only marginally from Y11.2bn to Y11.9bn. The company's cash reserves fell from Y14.5bn at end March to Y8.9bn, while inventories rose from Y49.7bn to Y57bn over the past year.</p>

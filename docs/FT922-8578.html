			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally on hopes of renewed Fed easing US Treasury prices firmed slightly at both ends of the maturity spectrum yesterday as investors continued to bet that coming economic data will persuade the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  1/32 at 101 3/16 , yielding 7.890 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was  1/8 higher at 100 5/16 , yielding 5.205 per cent. The market did not wait long to add on to last week's big gains, which were achieved in the wake of a mixed employ ment report and weak money supply numbers. Attention has now switched to this week's figures, which will include reports on the latest producer prices index (today), consumer prices and retail sales (tomorrow) and weekly jobless claims and money supply (Thursday). The thinking among more optimistic investors is that if the latest statistics indicate the economic recovery is still worryingly frail, the Fed may ease monetary policy one more time. FRENCH government bond prices continued to rally yesterday following the cut in bank lending rates last week and a long holiday weekend. The benchmark 8 1/2 per cent French government OAT maturing 2002 closed on a yield of 8.57 per cent, from 8.62 per cent at the opening and at the close on Thursday. Since German government bonds continued sideways, the yield spread between the two markets at the 10-year maturity closed from 68 basis points to 61 basis points. This is the lowest spread between the two markets since early March, reversing most of the damage which resulted from political uncertainty surrounding French regional elections. The market continued to find support from the strength of the French franc, which closed slightly higher in the European exchange rate mechanism, and comfortably within its divergence limits against the D-Mark. GERMAN government bonds were little changed in nervous, lacklustre trade yesterday, with most investors held on the sidelines by uncertainty over the current wave of industrial disputes. The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London exchange, opened at 87.19 and was trading slightly below this level in late afternoon. However, trading volume was low at 41,000 contracts, little more than half the trading activity seen last week. In the cash market, the benchmark 8 per cent cash bund closed at 100.11 from 100.08, for a yield of 7.97 per cent. Prices dipped in the morning session on the news that the German current account deficit narrowed to DM300m in March from DM1.9bn in February and DM6.4bn in March 1991. The largest change was in the volume of exports, which rose from DM54.97bn in February to DM62.97bn in March. Analysts said the strength of exports suggested the economy was not slowing as quickly as had been assumed, with inflationary pressures possibly still remaining. UK government bonds were slightly weaker at the longer maturities yesterday as investors focused on the medium-term outlook for UK inflation ahead of official data expected this week. The 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed down just  1/16 of a point on the day, at 99 for a yield of 9.026 per cent. The June gilt futures contract on Liffe closed at 98.20, having opened at 98.27 and traded as high as 99.01 early in the session. Volume was slight at 21,000 contracts. Short-dated gilts fared better, however, less disturbed by fears over the inflation outlook and expectations of further government bond issuance. For example, the 10 per cent gilt maturing 1996 closed up 1/32 of a point on the day at 102 21/32 for a yield of 9.251 per cent. Dealers expected little action ahead of retail price inflation data for April, expected to be released on Friday. Analysts are expecting an increase in the 4 per cent annual rate of inflation recorded in March. But forecasts for April for year-on-year inflation range from 4.3 per cent to 4.9 per cent. Although much of the acceleration can be explained by statistical factors - the way in which tax and mortgage rate cuts depressed the RPI this time last year - any increase will focus attention on the UK's stubbornly high rate of inflation. JAPANESE government bond prices fell a shade yesterday, with concern over anticipated supply of corporate bonds continuing to pre-occupy dealers. The 10-year government benchmark bond issue No 129 closed the Tokyo day on a yield of 5.595 per cent, from 5.555 per cent at the close on Friday. Dealers said Tokyo Electric Power, the largest of the Japanese power utility companies, was preparing to launch a Y100bn 12-year bond issue in the domestic market.</p>

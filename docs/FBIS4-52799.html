			<p>BFN     [Text] The U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets  conducted a war exercise for a northward invasion and aerial  espionage.    According to military sources, on 10 and 11 May, the U.S.  imperialists dragged fighter bombers carrying nuclear weapons,  pursuit-assault planes, early-warning planes, and refueling  planes from its overseas bases into South Korea and conducted a  provocative aerial war exercise aimed at a northward invasion.    The war exercise was composed of a surprise attack on  targets  on the ground, support for ground attack, an attack in the air,  and airborne operations. Mobilized intensively for this war  exercise were airplane squadrons from U.S. bases in the Pacific  area and some 560 fighter bombers, assault planes, observation  planes, reconnaissance planes, and armed helicopters of the U.S.  occupation Air Forces in South Korea and the puppet air force.    This war exercise was conducted mainly in the skies above  Tokchok island, Yoju, Umsong, and Kuri under the command of E-3  early-warning planes known as aerial flight command post. Under  the system of this war exercise, the KC-135's were refueling in  the air the airplane squadrons flying from overseas bases into  the South Korean skies.    This war exercise, which was conducted for two days  according  to the operations planned by the Pacific-based U.S. Air Force  and Naval Headquarters, was a commotion of fire game  [pulchangnan sodong] aimed at examining the actual combat  capability of making a surprise attack for a northward invasion  in cooperation with airplane squadrons from overseas bases, the  U.S. occupation Air Force in South Korea, and the puppet air  force.    In the meantime, E-3 early-warning planes flew from overseas  bases into the South Korean skies every day in the period from 6  to 11 May to command airplane squadrons mobilized to war  exercises for a northward invasion as well as to carry out  electronic reconnaissance.    On 11 May, an RC-135 tactical reconnaissance plane moved out  from an Okinawa base into the South Korean skies and carried out  electronic reconnaissance on areas in the northern half of the  Republic while flying for a long time in the skies above Tokchok  island, Uijongbu, Yanggu, and Kansong.    Encouraged by the U.S. imperialists, the South Korean  puppets  were frenzied in firing guns and increasing armed troops in an  area adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line [MDL].    The puppets mobilized and deployed a large-caliber gun unit  in an area near Myongho-ri, Kosong County, Kangwon Province on  11 May, and dragged military vehicles carrying hundreds of armed  rascals into an area near Mago-ri, Yonchon County, Kyonggi  Province that day.    Prior to this, on 10 May, after occupying firing positions  at  Kumpa-ri in Paju County and Chokko-ri in Yonchon County, tank  units and large-caliber artillery units of the puppet army fired  some 50 bombs at areas adjacent to the MDL in the DMZ. Another  group of puppet army's armed rascals that occupied at Pangmok-ri  in Paju County fired some 500 shots of large-caliber machine  guns and automatic rifles at random, while making a raid toward  the MDL.    The South Korean puppets' planned war exercise commotion  that  is conducted everyday is a grave challenge to detente and peace  on the Korean peninsula.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARTH FIRST!  </P> <P> In "The Monkeywrenchers," I came across the sentence: "Thanks in part to the  Reagan Administration's anti-environmentalist policies . . . " It was laying  there like undisputed fact.  </P> <P> This was supposed to be a truthful, accurate story. What is here is opinion.  Opinion needs to be on the Opinion Page, or at least so noted. It is a shame  that what could otherwise be a great newspaper stoops to blending its politics  with the news.  </P> <P> BOB W. JAMES  </P> <P> La Mirada  </P></p>

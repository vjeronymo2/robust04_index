			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Chen Jinhua, minister  in charge of the State Planning Commission, delivered a report  on the 1994 plan for national economic and social development at  the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth National People's  Congress (NPC) in the Great Hall of the People today.    In his speech, Chen set the following six tasks: Developing  rural economy, improving operation of large- and medium-sized  state- owned enterprises, optimizing investment structure,  opening wider to the outside world, expanding scientific,  technological and educational undertakings and improving the  people's livelihood continuously.    He said that China will continue to strengthen the  agricultural base, invigorate the rural economy and increase  peasants' income, all of which "has an important bearing on the  nation's economic development and social stability," he said.    The country will make every effort to obtain a good harvest  and retain a steady, high and increasing output of such  principal products as grain, cotton and oil bearing crops, he  said.    China is planning to turn out 450 million tons of grain,  4.85  million tons of cotton and 17.65 million tons of oil bearing  crops.    He urged localities to protect arable land, slash the  financial burden on farmers, raise purchasing prices of grain  and cotton, develop highly efficient farming, step up  construction of agricultural infrastructure, boost investment in  the sector, accelerate application of scientific and  technological advances to agriculture, expand township  enterprises and help the poverty- stricken rural areas.    "Irrational economic structure and poor efficiency are  currently the prominent problems of the economic development of  China," he said.    He urged industries to focus on optimizing the structure and  improving performance and to maintain an effective growth rate  through deepening of the reform, opening of new markets,  strengthening of management and accelerating technological  progress.    "The current volume of total investment in fixed assets is  already large," he said. It is necessary to bring this runaway  investment growth under strict control by focusing the work on  optimizing investment structure and improving economic returns  of investment.    He said that, of the total investment in fixed assets in  state- owned enterprises and institutions this year, 485 billion  yuan will go to capital construction, 250 billion yuan to  updating of technology and 80 billion yuan to development of  real estate.    In line with industrial policies, China will "increase  investment in the construction of infrastructure, basic  industries and key industries, use the additional state  investment this year mainly in projects for agriculture, water  conservancy, transport, telecommunications, energy, necessary  raw and semi-finished materials, electronics, science and  technology and education," he said. The government will  increase investment in the development of natural resources in  the central and western regions of China.    He also urged the country to open wider to the outside world  and vigorously and effectively use foreign funds, resources,  technologies and markets.    He said that the country should realize economic growth on  the basis of scientific and technological progress and the  development of education. He urged governments at all levels  to vigorously promote advances in industrial technology,  develop key scientific and technological projects and key  industrial projects that are important to economic and social  development, quicken the commercialization, industrialization  and internationalization of China's own high and new  technologies, strengthen the infrastructure for scientific  research and develop a strong contingent of technical personnel.    He said that the government should keep education in a  strategic position, strengthen elementary education, increase  investment in education and improve the living conditions of  school teachers.    He called for continual improvement of the living standards  of the people on the basis of economic growth and increased  labor productivity.    "To meet the need of continued reforms and maintain social  stability, we will gradually establish a multi-form, multi-tier  social security system," he said.    He pointed out that promoting all-round progress in social  undertakings is an important task of macro-controls by the  state. This year, the government will formulate an outline  program for a nationwide development of social undertakings to  guide work in this regard, he said.</p>

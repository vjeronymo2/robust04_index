			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Technology: Valley's creative culture still alive - Technically Speaking 'Silicon Valley: An Economy at Risk' paints a gloomy picture of the future of California's famed high technology enclave. The report is designed as a 'wake up call' for the region's industrialists; a warning that there are problems to be resolved if Silicon Valley is to maintain its leadership role. The 'diagnostic report', prepared by the Center for Economic Competitiveness at SRI International, a technology consultancy, and sponsored by local businesses, outlines the 'warning signs' that Silicon Valley's economy is heading for decline. These include slower employment growth, a decline in venture capital financing, slowing growth in pre-competitive research and development spending and a shortage of skilled workers, as well as the rising cost of adhering to regulations, high housing prices, traffic congestion and a 'perceived decline in the quality of life'. Over the past 10 years there have been several predictions of the demise of Silicon Valley. Yet the region remains the pre-eminent center of high technology entrepreneurship and innovation. It is tempting, then , to dismiss this latest report as just another doomsday scenario and to blame its pessimism upon the fact that it was prepared during the recession from which Silicon Valley is already beginning to recover. Indeed, several of the 'problems' assigned to Silicon Valley in the report are common to all high technology regions in the US. The drop in venture capital investing is not peculiar to Silicon Valley. Neither is it alone in suffering the effects of economic recession. The most worrying issue raised by the report is the apparent failure of Silicon Valley to keep pace with the national US rate of employment growth over the period 1984-1991, according to data from the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy. However, this snapshot of a cyclical economy includes a period of sharp decline in 1991. Measured over the period 1983-1990, employment growth in Silicon Valley outperformed that in the US as a whole. Assessing the economic performance of Silicon Valley is further complicated by the fact that the region's boundaries are ill defined and constantly changing. However, some important issues are raised by the 'Economy at Risk' report. Silicon Valley is now suffering the effects of its dynamic growth, including traffic congestion and high housing costs. The latter, in particular, makes it more difficult for companies to attract and retain employees. Although bright young engineers still flock to Silicon Valley, many decide to leave the area when they want to buy a house. This has led to a 'missing generation' of mid-career professionals that is a growing problem for established companies. The regulatory environment in California is another widespread concern among Silicon Valley business leaders. Environmental, planning and employment regulations have become a serious burden, they complain. 'Joint Venture: Silicon Valley', a consortium formed to address the problems, presents three 'possible futures'. The region could become a 'high-tech Manhattan, of corporate headquarters and administrative functions, with little research or manufacturing,' it warns. More likely, the 'Virtual Valley' in which the Silicon will remain a research and development hub for global companies with a limited amount of high value-added manufacturing, plus marketing and administration. What the report's authors urge, however, is a joint initiative between the private and public sectors to transform Silicon Valley into an 'American Technopolis; a dynamic community that supports technology enterprises and retains value-added manufacturing, employment and wealth'. The danger is that in an attempt to improve upon the original, they may stifle Silicon Valley's creative culture. The valley has its problems, but it has spawned more new ventures and more important new technologies than any other place on earth. It ain't broke and it doesn't need fixing.</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HOT TIME AT THE ICE HOUSE;  </P> <P> COMEDY CLUB TO CELEBRATE 30 YEARS OF LAUGHS  </P> <P> By the time Kat Simmons goes on, the audience at the Ice House in Pasadena has  already been goaded, charmed, ambushed and tickled by a half-dozen other  stand-up comics, and everybody's haw-hawing merrily along. Most of the familiar  targets have been trotted out: game show hosts, hyperactive kids, K mart, fat  ladies in stretch pants, the save-the-whales movement, "Fantasy Island,"  liposuction and, memorably, Kellogg's Mueslix cereal.  </P> <P> "In Switzerland, that means wholesome goodness," says Eric Pielstieck, speaking  in the rounded tones of a television commercial voice-over. Then his eyes go  stony, and his voice shifts gears. "Maybe," he snaps. "But in this country,  partner, it means you've got a sinus condition and maybe you should cut back on  the dairy products."  </P> <P> The Sunday-night audience clamors for more.  </P> <P> The tall, redheaded Simmons totters onto the stage, big wedges of brass  dangling from her ears and a crooked, irrepressible grin on her face. The crowd  titters as she sizes them up. They're a lot better than her last audience, she  tells them. That was in a psychiatric ward.  </P> <P> "It was an audience of paranoid schizophrenics," she says. "There were 15 of  them. Seemed like it was 30."  </P> <P> Simmons, a new comic who is just starting to venture into the rocky terrain of  dinner theaters, small-town comedy bars, one-nighters in Palm Springs and  "open-mike" nights at the established clubs, is fast becoming a connoisseur of  audiences.  </P> <P> The tough ones, she says between sets, are the dinner-club crowds ("You have to  wait 'till everybody swallows and pays attention") or audiences that have  already been conditioned to lewdness by the last comic. "If you follow a comic  whose mind is in the gutter, you seem like Mary Poppins following Arnold  Schwarzenegger with a hemorrhoid," she says.  </P> <P> But the best audiences? No question. They're at the Ice House in Pasadena, says  Simmons.  </P> <P> Stand-up comedy, concentrated in a handful of big-city clubs until the early  1980s, is now performed in more than 200 clubs in 41 states, according to  comedy trade publications. The widely reported "comedy boom" has new clubs  popping up like mushrooms, from Bossier City, La., to Kent, Wash. The Pasadena  club, however, is already at the threshold of middle age. The Ice House -- a  tidy little place with an entrance on an alley, a small side room and a main  room that echoes with giggles and guffaws -- will be 30 years old next month.  </P> <P> "I'm not laying claim to being the oldest comedy house in the country," says  owner Bob Fisher, a short, bearded man who watches his performers cut up on  stage with wooden-faced detachment. "But put it this way. Steve Martin was  doing comedy here 12 years before the Comedy Store (one of Los Angeles'  premiere clubs) opened."  </P> <P> It's an intimate place, with no one sitting farther than about 25 feet from the  stage. The chairs are straight, the tables tiny and the walls unadorned brick  -- all deliberately Spartan. "No carpet, no acoustic tile," Fisher explains.  "The room stays lively."  </P> <P> It's also, as far as many comedians are concerned, unusually  performer-friendly. For people who routinely cross swords with hecklers, drunks  and the generally unresponsive, the Ice House usually offers appreciative  audiences. "It's like comedy heaven," says Barbara Scott, an Ice House regular,  whose act often includes a send-up of a steamy guitar-playing torch singer.  "You don't have to prove yourself over and over again. Because you're on the  stage, they seem to accept the fact that you're funny."  </P> <P> The Pasadena club debuted in 1959 as a folk music cafe. Even then, comedians  were usually part of the show, says Fisher. Lily Tomlin, the Smothers Brothers  and Bob Newhart cut early records there. In the early 1960s, Pat Paulsen  stirred things up by pouring paint on his head and swinging head-down from a  rope in the main room, letting his hair brush across blank pieces of paper.  He'd sell his "cranial paintings" to members of the audience.  </P> <P> "There was comedy here from Day 1," says Fisher, who bought the Ice House in  1978 and turned into an all-comedy venue.  </P> <P> The comedy boom may be, as some cynics suggest, just a cheap way of getting  customers into a bar ("You get a headliner for $900 and two other guys for  $200, and you sell $5,000 worth of liquor," says one road-hardened comic), but  it's drawing hundreds of new young performers into the field.  </P> <P> With comedians making it big in the movies, cable television companies planning  all-comedy channels and that national network of comedy clubs getting bigger  all the time, the opportunities seem endless.  </P> <P> "Everybody's a comic nowadays," says veteran comedian Sam Kwasman, another Ice  House regular. "Everybody's got five minutes."  </P> <P> Maybe so. But few among the 2,000 or so comics making the rounds in the United  States are getting rich at it. "It's really just an expensive habit," says  Scott, who traveled to the Ice House from Venice last week to perform for free,  just so she could make a videotape of her performance.  </P> <P> Outsiders find it difficult to grasp the pressurized, manic-depressive world of  the comedian, with its lonely pursuit of laughter, comedians say. "Comedy is a  serious business," says Kwasman, a former dancer who does cartoon voices in his  act (he recently auditioned to replace the late Mel Blanc as Elmer Fudd and  Yosemite Sam).  </P> <P> In the Pasadena club's Green Room, a sitting room where comedians waiting their  turn can watch what's happening on stage through closed-circuit television  ("Just like Johnny Carson," says Fisher), the talk often turns to the  frustrations of the business.  </P> <P> "I'm doing open-mike night at the Improv (another major Los Angeles club)  tomorrow," says Simmons, who gave up a job as a Lake Tahoe real estate broker  to pursue comedy. "Last time I did it, they told me I'd be fourth. I waited 12  hours to go on for five minutes. It's real humbling, but it keeps you doing the  footwork."  </P> <P> Wade and Karen Sheeler, a comedy duo, toast each other gaily with antacid  bottles -- each with a straw and a little paper parasol -- and Pielstieck  calmly paces the floor, getting in the mood for his first ever stand-up  performance.  </P> <P> There's usually a mutually protective camaraderie among them all, from  hungry-eyed young pistoleros to comedians who have already done Carson and  Letterman, says Simmons. "People warn you about working for a guy in Phoenix,  because he'll stiff you, or another guy who physically hit a female comic who  wasn't receptive to his advances," she says. "A lot of icky stuff happens on  the road."  </P> <P> The show unfolds rapidly. Bill Kelly, a bespectacled and overweight young man  from Illinois, hitches up his pants and talks about a "religious experience" in  his hometown. "My mother found a silhouette of the Virgin Mary in the lint  trap," he says. Sheeler &amp; Sheeler do fast-paced skits about Siamese twin  detectives and about a pair of game show hosts on a blind date.  </P> <P> He: You can keep the flowers!  </P> <P> She (gesturing dramatically): Suggested retail price -- $8.95!  </P> <P> Pielstieck does his mad tirades, John Robisch plays an endearing clod and Jim  Fleming, a young man with cerebral palsy, improvises on his own disability.  </P> <P> There's an underlying pessimism to most comics, says Robisch, after his  performance. "We all grew up as the class clowns," he says. "There's a need for  attention. Tear away the facade and it's not a pretty sight."  </P> <P> Simmons trots out some familiar targets of her own: feminine hygiene products,  self-serve gas stations, small towns. She's from Gardnerville, Nev., she tells  the audience in her good-natured manner -- "where men are men, and sheep have  their own rape crisis hot line."  </P> <P> The audience (liberally sprinkled with Simmons' friends) loves it. "They were  putty," she says pleasurably later on. "I could have stayed on for an hour."  </P></p>

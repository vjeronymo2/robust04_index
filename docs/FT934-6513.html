			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Mediobanca implicated in claims against Ferruzzi Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank guiding the restructuring of Italy's troubled Ferruzzi group, allegedly knew of severe financial difficulties and malpractices at the company well ahead of their revelation this year. The claim, made in Italy's authoritative Sole 24 Ore business newspaper, is based on leaked documents from the former administrative director of the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company. The documents include a letter giving details of the off-balance-sheet loans taken out by obscure Ferfin subsidiaries to cover up heavy trading losses by the group. The letter outlines the complex financial transactions involving loans taken out by offshore shell companies on the instructions of one of the Ferruzzi family's most trusted financial advisers based in Lausanne, Switzerland. It is addressed directly to Mr Gerardo Braggiotti, the senior Mediobanca executive responsible for Ferruzzi. Milan magistrates last week issued an arrest warrant against Mr Braggiotti's father, Enrico, a former chairman of Italy's big Banca Commerciale Italiana, regarding an alleged Dollars 50m payment to secure BCI's good offices during his period as chairman. Separately, lawyers for Montedison, the big industrial company which is Ferfin's main operating subsidiary, indicated yesterday that the legal action against former executives could soon be extended. This follows information unearthed by the magistrates investigating financial irregularities and political corruption.</p>

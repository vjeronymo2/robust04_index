			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, April 17 (AFP) -- The United Nations  Protection Force [UNPROFOR], struggling to contain Serb-Moslem  fighting in eastern Bosnia, must now choose either to pull out  of the former Yugoslav republic or to press for more troops and  a redefined mandate, a UN spokesman said here Saturday [16  April].    Michael Williams was speaking to reporters as UN special  envoy Yasushi Akashi dislcosed in a statement in Sarajevo that  UN officials had begun an "urgent review" of UNPROFOR operations  in light of the deteriorating situation in Gorazde.    The mainly Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia is a UN-declared  safe haven but is currently under siege by Bosnian Serb forces.    "The Gorazde crisis has brought us to an impasse," Williams  said.    He argued that UNPROFOR had three options before it: "a  pullout from Bosnia, a completely new role and mandate with far  greater resources in terms of troops, ... or total compliance  by Bosnian Serb authorities (with UN orders)."    Williams stressed that UNPROFOR's operation had been  rendered  "completely inadequate" because of a refusal by Bosnian Serbs to  cooperate and stressed that UN troops have not been assigned an  offensive military role.    He explained that Akashi is only entitled to authorize the  limited use of close air support by one or two NATO planes on a  precise target -- as was the case Saturday when British aircraft  were ordered to attack a Serb tank in Gorazde.    In the event, no strikes took place because of bad weather  and one of the planes was shot down, its pilot ejecting safely.    Williams said Akashi cannot order a general air operation on  an entire zone, as such authorization must come from UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    There are currently 17 UN military and civilian personnel in  Gorazde, the UN spokesman said.    UNPROFOR strength in all of former Yugoslavia today stands  at  30,000 troops, most of whom are serving in Bosnia-Herzegovina  and Croatia.    The UN Security Council on March 31 approved an increase of  3,500 soldiers for UNPROFOR after the United States objected to  plans to boost force strength by 10,000 men.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consequently, each air pollution control agency in the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas must, by virtue of Title V, incorporate and enforce all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable FIP requirements in operating permits for every source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a potential to emit at or above the level prescribed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 182 for the area's classification. Title V and EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating permit regulations do not, however, mandate adoption of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an operating permit program for nonmajor source categories (for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, in ``Severe'' areas, sources with a potential to emit less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 25 tons per year of VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Nevertheless, some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonmajor sources are subject to operating permit requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because they are major sources of air toxics, <FOOTCITE>107</FOOTCITE>  and for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources all applicable FIP requirements must be included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit and enforced by the air pollution control agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 107 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Certain nonmajor sources subject to section 111 or 112 standards may also be subject in the future to air toxics and operating permit requirements. New section 112 standards may apply to area sources (nonmajor) as well as major sources; EPA will determine whether operating permits are required for these sources when the standards are promulgated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Full transfer of authority through delegation.  EPA hopes that the State and local air pollution control agencies will quickly adopt SIP rules that are identical or comparable to the FIP rules, and which could be approved before the FIP regulation is scheduled for initial implementation. If a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State or local agency adopts an essentially indistinguishable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, EPA intends to delegate full implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities to the agency immediately following State or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local adoption, without opportunity for public comment, unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the delegation is under the authority of section 112, and not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by a good cause exception. See EPA's enabling guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for section 112(1). EPA will publish a notice of this delegation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and will otherwise try to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected sources are aware of that a State or local agency has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed program implementation responsibilities. Subsequently,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will take normal SIP approval action on the State or local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute rule, simultaneously rescinding the FIP rule in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jurisdiction's control area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  As noted in the discussion above regarding the California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer product rules, EPA is issuing federal rules for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories because the State has so far chosen not to submit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules for SIP action. Since EPA's FIP rules are essentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identical, EPA intends to delegate to CARB the authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement the program if CARB has not yet submitted its own rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for SIP approval, and if California adopts adequate authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement the FIP. In the event that CARB fails to implement its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> own rules or amends the State's rules so that they become less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent than the otherwise applicable federal rule, EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to directly enforce the provisions of the FIP consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In the future, EPA intends to promulgate in 40 CFR part 71  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions for delegation of certain federal operating permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program responsibilities to State and local agencies with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate authority to administer the program but lacking EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval of the State or local program. EPA could use this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure to grant State and local agencies the authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue operating permits prior to full EPA approval of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies' permit program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Full transfer of authority through SIP approval.  A State or local agency may adopt a rule that is comparable to the FIP rule in emissions capture, but is significantly different in approach. In that event, immediate transfer of implementation and enforcement authority through delegation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriate without opportunity for public review and comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Instead, EPA will try to ``parallel process'' SIP approval and FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rescission as the means to expedite State or local assumption of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority. <FOOTCITE>108</FOOTCITE>  This will minimize the time during which affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources are subject to overlapping and conflicting obligations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and during which EPA and the State or local agencies must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertake redundant permitting, compliance plan review, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 108 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In parallel process SIP approval, EPA, with the consent of the State, proposes approval of draft rules which may not yet have been fully adopted and submitted by the State. Final SIP approval could not occur until after all procedural SIP requirements (including State adoption and SIP submittal) have been completed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Partial transfer of authority through delegation.  To the extent that State law allows agencies to perform certain implementation responsibilities for FIP rules even without State and local rule adoption, EPA will encourage these agencies to agree to undertake, on EPA's behalf, administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and substantive roles of FIP implementation consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies' authorities and capabilities. These roles could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include: procedural and engineering review of permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications and compliance plans, preparation of draft permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and plan approval or disapproval actions, administration and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oversight of compliance reporting and recordkeeping requirements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct of source inspections, and preparation of draft notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of violation. Under these circumstances, EPA would retain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for actual federal permit issuance, where the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires permits, and for enforcement actions against sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violating FIP provisions. EPA would also maintain direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to terminate, modify, or revoke permits, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for disapproving compliance plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Partial transfer of FIP implementation authorities would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effected through delegation by MOU between the EPA Region IX and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the air pollution control officer or executive officer of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible agency. EPA will announce the terms of the partial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delegation in a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, and will inform affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources, with or without additional notice and opportunity for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Administrative Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency must determine whether the regulatory actions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory actions'' as ones that are likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in rules that may:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> UBRIACO RAPS LEMIEUX, COFFEY; PENGUINS, NORTH STARS TIE, 4-4  </P> <P> Gene Ubriaco, recently fired as coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins, put much of  the blame for the team's problems on stars Mario Lemieux and Paul Coffey.  </P> <P> "They deserted me the last two weeks," Ubriaco told the Associated Press  Thursday in Pittsburgh. "I made the mistake of treating them like men. It was  almost impossible to coach Lemieux. It was like trying to teach a shark table  manners."  </P> <P> Lemieux, who said he might answer Ubriaco's charges later, and the Penguins are  doing better under interim Coach Craig Patrick.  </P> <P> They blew a 4-1 lead and had to settle for a 4-4 tie Thursday night with the  Minnesota North Stars at Bloomington, Minn., but are 3-1-1 since Ubriaco was  dismissed.  </P> <P> Defenseman Larry Murphy went around the Penguin defense and beat Tom Barrasso  with 7:47 left in regulation to climax the North Stars' rally.  </P> <P> The tie ended Minnesota's seven-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Lemieux had an assist and has at least one point in 20 consecutive games.  </P> <P> Hartford 3, Philadelphia 2 -- It was not a good night for the Flyers. After  learning that goaltender Ron Hextall's latest injury would keep him out at  least six more weeks, they lost for the first time in four games at  Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Rookie Mike Tomlak broke a tie with a power play goal at 12:04 of the last  period to give the Whalers their first victory at Philadelphia in more than  three years.  </P> <P> Hextall, one of the best goalies in the NHL, has played only two games this  season. He reinjured a groin Wednesday night in a rehabilitation game at New  Haven, Conn.  </P> <P> Calgary 8, Quebec 2 -- The Nordiques were overwhelmed by the Flames at Calgary  and learned that goaltender Greg Millen, obtained in a trade with St. Louis,  refused to report.  </P> <P> Quebec (6-23-4) has given up 21 goals in the last three games.

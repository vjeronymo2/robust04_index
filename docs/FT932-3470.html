			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Economics Notebook: A test for the public services in poorer countries THE residents of Delhi and much of northern India were looking for scapegoats after power cuts which this week left them sweltering for many hours without lights, fans, coolers or air-conditioners. The immediate cause of their distress was a surge in demand for electricity which overwhelmed the generation and transmission network. That India, like many developing countries, does not produce enough electricity is well known. India's Ministry of Power estimates that in the year to the end of March the shortages amounted to around 9 per cent of the country's total needs and 18 per cent of its peak requirement. In the past, the standard response to power shortages in developing countries has been to build more power stations. In the late 1980s, India was building an annual average of 4,000 megawatts (MW) of generating capacity a year - the equivalent of four large power stations. By March 1992, total capacity in the public sector (which accounts for the vast majority of power) stood at 69,000MW. However, in the 1990s, capital has been much harder to find. The public sector construction programme has almost ground to a halt and India is seeking private investors, including foreign companies, to take up the slack. Even if this initiative brings results, private companies will not contribute to a significant increase in power supplies until the late 1990s, given the long lead-times in making such large investments. This gloomy prospect has forced the Indian authorities to concentrate upon doing something that should have been done a long time ago - making better use of existing plant. Indian power stations typically run below 60 per cent cent capacity. Also, 23 per cent of the power generated is lost in transmission - through theft or faulty equipment. While the efficiency of stations has improved in the past decade, transmission losses have actually increased. Acknowledging the scale of the problem, the World Bank, the principal supplier of low-interest loans for power schemes in developing countries, has slowed new credits for new power stations and is lending India Dollars 350m (Pounds 227m) to fund improvements in the existing network. The shortcomings in the Indian power supply industry highlight a general problem afflicting developing countries. A lot of time and money is lavished on new capital investments and not enough on maintaining the efficiency of existing capital, particularly in the public sector. What is true for power stations is often also true for roads and railways, pipes and sewers, and public buildings. One reason for this misallocation of resources is political: politicians, who have the last word in spending decisions, prefer to put their names to new schemes than to renovating the projects of their predecessors. Such temptations are not unique to developing nations: the problem is to increase incentives for the good management of existing resources. Many countries have opted for privatisation - private owners are much more likely than the state to ensure that capital is exploited to its full potential. But in some countries, including India, full-scale privatisation is, at best, a distant prospect. Aside from the reluctance of politicians and officials to surrender administrative power, there are very real concerns about the regulation of private companies entrusted with essential services. For example, privatising the water supply in a drought-prone country such as India would be politically impossible. The only alternative is to cajole public sector managers to become more efficient. The government can try to apply pressure, but frequently politicians' priorities will not always square with the goals of efficient management. In India. much electricity is stolen by residents of illegal slums, who attach wires to overhead cables. Since slum-dwellers have votes there is little political incentive to deprive them of free power. The World Bank and other aid donors try to improve the running of public services by directing funds towards operations which are well managed, at the expense of those which are not. But there is a limit to which outside agencies can become involved in such detailed choices without being accused of bullying and interfering with national sovereignty. Also, the worst-managed units are often in poor regions, precisely those which most need foreign aid. In India, the most efficient power stations were those in the state of Maharashtra, including wealthy Bombay, which ran at 58 per cent capacity. Those in deprived West Bengal managed only 28 per cent. Another way for foreign donors to influence change might be to supply more information to consumers in India and other developing countries. The means might be to prepare league tables comparing the efficiency of the service delivery in different states. The World Bank and other international agencies already do this for many criteria, notably GNP and GNP per capita, and for the production totals of individual industries, including electricity generation. The emphasis in such data is on volume. It would be possible to supplement the figures with statistics which measure the quality of what is produced. As far as public services are concerned, the electricity industry is a suitable starting point because production is concentrated in relatively few units, so collecting information may not be too difficult. Capacity utilisation and transmission losses might be appropriate indicators. Other possibilities include capacity use in the water industry, average delays on railway journeys, flight cancellations by domestic airlines and the number of attempted telephone calls made for one successful connection. Such figures would be of more than academic interest. Properly packaged they would be a valuable tool both for the officials who run public services and for consumers. The popularity of such inter-country comparisons is amply demonstrated by the success of the United Nations Development Programme's annual report on human development which is in its fourth year and sells 100,000 copies.</p>

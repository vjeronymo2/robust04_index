			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> VACATION HELPED EXEMPLARY LEADER  </P> <P> When a trainer and an owner put a stakes-class 3-year-old on the shelf halfway  through a season laden with rich opportunities, you immediately ask, "What went  wrong?"  </P> <P> And when the trainer answers, "Nothing, we just wanted to back off for a  while," the immediate reaction is, "Yeah, sure. So where's he going to stud?  Singapore?"  </P> <P> But in the case of Exemplary Leader, one of several upset possibilities in  Sunday's San Fernando Stakes at Santa Anita, his five-month vacation at the end  of 1989 should be taken at face value, according to his trainer, Brian  Mayberry.  </P> <P> After finishing sixth in the La Jolla Handicap at Del Mar on Aug. 6, Exemplary  Leader was given an easy 2 1/2 months around the barn. He began serious  training again in October, then resurfaced in the Malibu Stakes on Santa  Anita's opening day, Dec. 26, to run an impressive second behind the San  Fernando favorite, Music Merci.  </P> <P> "Giving him time off was an arbitrary decision on my part," said Mayberry, who  is currently on top in the Santa Anita standings. "With year-round racing,  you've got to stop sooner or later. I prefer to do it sooner."  </P> <P> Later, added Mayberry, is sometimes too late. A trainer must know when a horse  hits his peak and when that peak has passed. To do otherwise is to risk  debilitating illness or a career-ending injury.  </P> <P> "It's a very intuitive thing," Mayberry said. 'A lot of guys don't recognize  when to stop."  </P> <P> Exemplary Leader had been in steady training for 18 months when he finally got  his holiday. He ran seven times as a 2-year-old in 1988 and 10 times before the  Malibu in '89, winning one stakes and placing in four others for Jan, Mace and  Samantha Siegel.  </P> <P> Acting on Mayberry's recommendation, the Siegels paid $58,000 for Exemplary  Leader at a 1987 yearling sale in Kentucky. So far, the son of Vigors has  returned $170,038 on the investment.  </P> <P> "He's a hard-nosed colt," Mayberry said. "He did most of his maturing between  the ages of 3 and 4. That's another reason we stopped on him -- his sire didn't  get really good until he turned 5."  </P> <P> Vigors, dubbed the White Corvette because of his distinctive coat and his  electrifying acceleration, won only five of 29 starts from ages 2 through 4. As  a 5-year-old, however, he started just five times and won four major stakes in  1978, including the Santa Anita Handicap and the San Antonio Handicap.  </P> <P> Mayberry got lucky this week when Neil Drysdale decided not to run Breeders'  Cup Turf winner Prized in the San Fernando. That allowed Prized's rider, Eddie  Delahoussaye, to return on Exemplary Leader after their promising collaboration  in the Malibu.  </P> <P> "This colt likes to make one big run at the end, and Eddie seems to have  mastered knowing just when to move," Mayberry said. "I don't know if he's quite  good enough to win Sunday, but I think we've given him a chance to tell us."  </P> <P> Of the 35 horses who worked six furlongs Wednesday morning at Santa Anita, the  slowest was also the best known.  </P> <P> Gorgeous, last seen nipping at Bayakoa's heels at the end of the Breeders' Cup  Distaff, barely broke a sweat as she strolled along in 1:18 1/5 for the  distance. The exercise said nothing about her ability, which is considerable,  and everything about the style of Drysdale, her trainer.  </P> <P> Six days earlier, Drysdale matched the 4-year-old daughter of Slew o' Gold  against Prized in a "full-pads scrimmage" at about 7 1/2 furlongs. They  responded with an official seven-furlong clocking of 1:24 1/5 that track  clockers described as "breezing" rather than "handily," indicating a minimum of  effort that produced maximum results.  </P> <P> "She went right along in that work," Drysdale said. "Did quite a bit, actually.  After that, she didn't need anything much more than a 1:16 or a 1:17 on  Wednesday. Just something to keep her interested."  </P> <P> Racing fans will be watching with interest Monday when Gorgeous returns in the  El Encino Stakes at 1 1/16 miles. Of all the stars of 1989, Gorgeous was the  most enigmatic. She ran only six times, popping up at six different tracks in  California, New York, Kentucky and Florida. She won four races and finished  second twice, and the only horses to beat her, Bayakoa and Open Mind, were  later named champions.  </P> <P> Ron McAnally, Bayakoa's trainer, singled out Gorgeous as the horse to beat in  the Nov. 4 Distaff a full two months before the race, despite the fact that  Open Mind, Goodbye Halo, Miss Brio and Colonial Waters were all making  headlines at the time. Gorgeous, on the other hand, had just recovered from a  minor leg injury and was back in light training.  </P> <P> "She's a light-bodied filly, the kind you can't train too hard," McAnally said.  "I could tell the way Neil was handling her that he was gearing her up to fire  her best shot when he brought her back. And that's exactly what happened."  </P> <P> Drysdale said Gorgeous has put on weight and thickened in the right places.  Delahoussaye, her rider, agreed.  </P> <P> "She'll never be a monster," Delahoussaye said. "She's stronger now, but she  still has that more refined look you see in those old English paintings.  Anyway, it's how they look at the finish that counts, and you can't fault her  there."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Olympic Prospect will have no excuses in Saturday's seven-furlong San Carlos  Handicap. The powerful gelding drew the outside post in a field of nine,  guaranteeing the clear trip he did not get in the Palos Verdes Handicap on Dec.  30. The opposition consists of Oraibi, Candi's Gold, Raise a Stanza, On the  Menu, Tanker Port, Order, Ron Bon and Doncareer, who hung on so well to finish  third in the Malibu Stakes opening day.  </P> <P> The former European colt, Lowell, makes his main-track debut for trainer  Richard Cross in today's featured eighth race. Lowell finished a close fourth  in the Hollywood Derby on Nov. 19, after which he was purchased by Bruce  McNall. . . . The attractive feature is surrounded by eight claiming races,  three of them for maidens, proving how difficult it is for even Santa Anita to  present consistently high-quality programs in this era of year-round  competition.  </P> <P> Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Ark., has launched an aggressive response to the  devaluation of two of its major races by the North American Graded Stakes  Committee. The track will run an ad in all editions of Saturday's Daily Racing  Form, ridiculing the grading process. In addition, Oaklawn will delete all  references to race grades in its advertising, programs, and condition books.  Oaklawn management hit the roof when it was learned the Apple Blossom Handicap  for older fillies and mares had lost its Grade I rating. Four of the last five  champions in the division competed in the race, including 1989 winner Bayakoa.  </P> <P> Robbie Davis returned to action Thursday after missing Wednesday's card because  of what was apparently food poisoning. "Must have been the ski lodge pizza,"  said his agent, Jeff Franklin. "He was back working horses the next morning."  </P></p>

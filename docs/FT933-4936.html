			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Troubled French economy Hopes that 1994 will be a year of recovery for the troubled French economy were strengthened yesterday by confirmation from the government that it expects growth of 1.4 per cent in gross domestic product next year, write Alice Rawsthorn and David Buchan in Paris. However, consumer expenditure is expected to rise more slowly than initially forecast because of only small reductions in interest rates. By contrast, the government has upgraded its forecast for exports to 3.2 per cent growth due to the fall in the franc.</p>

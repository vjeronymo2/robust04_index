			<p>BFN     [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] evacuated the  division headquarters in downtown Gaza early this morning. Only  few installations in the Gaza Strip have still not been handed  over to the Palestinians. These installations will be evacuated  today or tonight. The evacuation will be completed tomorrow in  a ceremony in the Qatif Bloc. Our military affairs  correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that 24 hours after the  evacuation is completed the joint IDF and Palestinian police  patrols will start.</p>

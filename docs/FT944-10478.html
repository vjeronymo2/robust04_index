			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / CU advances to Pounds 305m on UK non-life revival Commercial Union, the large composite insurer, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up Pounds 165m at Pounds 305m for the first nine months, helped largely by the revival in the UK non-life insurance sector. Mr John Carter, chief executive, said many UK underwriting margins 'remain favourable' with claims relatively low and many premiums stable or rising. But he acknowledged that trading conditions in UK insurance were unlikely to remain as good in the next few years. Underlining the extent of competition - particularly from direct telephone-based insurers - the company reported that the number of private motor vehicles insured by it had fallen 18 per cent over the past year. The results were broadly in line with expectations and the group's shares ended unchanged at 543p. In continental Europe, strong growth in general insurance premiums helped increase operating profits in the Netherlands to Pounds 64m from Pounds 53m, but elsewhere CU made an operating loss before taxation of Pounds 6m against Pounds 24m. Contributions from the US were hit by bad weather and catastrophe claims. US operating profits before tax fell to Pounds 44m from Pounds 50m. Mr Carter said UK growth had been affected by a tough market for pension products but he forecast that the Securities and Investment Board's proposed programme for reviewing past sales of personal pension policies would not have a material effect on its statutory life profits. For the group as a whole, profits from the life business increased to Pounds 94m from Pounds 86m. Growth in new life annual premiums in continental Europe was partly offset by lower UK sales of individual life and pension products. Operating results for general insurance jumped to Pounds 202m from Pounds 57m. Total premium income in the first nine months was Pounds 4.50bn against Pounds 4.49bn. The results were the first since CU acquired on October 6 the French insurer Groupe Victoire, which will be included in the final quarter results. Shareholders' funds at September 30 totalled Pounds 2.1bn compared with Pounds 2.5bn at December 31, 1993. The drop largely reflected the poor performance of bond and equity markets. Operating ratio in the UK - which measures claims, commissions and expenses as a percentage of premiums - amounted to 97 per cent in the first nine months, against 104 per cent.</p>

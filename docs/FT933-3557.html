			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Signing of brief document may end years of conflict At 11am today in Washington, a brief document, to be signed by two old enemies on the south lawn of the White House is intended to mark the end to one of the 20th century's most bitter territorial conflicts. After 18 months of secret negotiations in isolated farmhouses in Norway, an audience of 2,500 distinguished guests will be on hand to witness Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Abu Mazen, a senior Palestine Liberation Organisation official, put their names to the outline Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. The signing will be witnessed by Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the PLO, who flew into Washington last night for the first time since 1974, and his old foe Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, who was due to arrive early this morning. It will cap an extraordinary two weeks which began when Israel and the PLO took the world by surprise by announcing they were on the the verge of an agreement on mutual recognition and limited Palestinian autonomy. In the following days momentum behind the agreement grew. Mr Rabin faced down opposition from the Israeli right wing, while last week Mr Arafat won the support of the PLO's executive council. On Friday the two leaders exchanged letters to seal the recognition agreement paving the way for today's peace deal. The US is keen to sustain the momentum for a wider Middle East peace. President Bill Clinton said the US would continued with aid and military assistance to Israel, while Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, said US troops might guarantee security in the Golan Heights after any Israeli undertaking to withdraw from the Syrian land it conquered in 1967. But Mr Clinton and Mr Al Gore, his vice president, both stressed that the US did not see itself as the sole or main provider of financial aid to support peace in the region. In an interview with the New York Times, Mr Clinton said he had secured an undertaking from King Fahd, the Saudi Arabian ruler, for a large Saudi-led financial package from the Gulf states - whose relations with the PLO were deeply soured by Mr Arafat's support for Iraqi during the Gulf War. Mr Clinton quoted the king as saying: 'You take the lead in organising it and tell us what we're supposed to do . . . and I will wait to hear from you.' Mr Clinton said he had also elicited Syrian backing for the PLO-Israeli deal during a 30-minute conversation with President Hafez al-Assad. He quoted Mr Assad as saying: 'It is a positive thing, this agreement, for all of us.' Mr Clinton said Mr Assad sought only the continued assistance of the US in mediating future negotiations with Israel over a withdrawl from the Golan Heights.</p>

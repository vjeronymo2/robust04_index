			<p>BFN     [Text] As reported earlier, Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo  Van Kiet and his Russian Counterpart V. Chernomyrdin signed in  Moscow Thursday a treaty on principles of bilateral relations.  During an official friendship visit to Russia by the Vietnamese  Government leader from 15 June, the two sides also signed other  important agreements laying new grounds for further development  of the friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and Russia.  At this connection, the Voice of Vietnam has this to say:    Russia is one of the big countries in the world with  developed agriculture and industries and great potentials in  oil, gas, machinery, and means of transport. In recent years,  Russia has been confronted with a number of social economic  difficulties such as the decrease of economic growth, inflation,  unemployment. To overcome this situation, the Russian  leadership has stepped up its relations with foreign countries  while solving its domestic problems. To get this done, Russia  has focussed on nations in Asia, especially in Southeast Asia.    The Russian foreign minister, in his talks on 15 June with  visiting Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Manh Cam said: Russia  and Vietnam share many common interests. Vietnam is Russia's  friend in Asia. On this occasion, Senior Lieutenant General  Commander (Lindegrav) said: No reason for Vietnam and Russia  forget each other. [sentence as heard]    At present, the two countries are determined to restore,  consolidate, and develop their bilateral cooperation. This  determination has been manifested through a series of agreements  and treaties signed on 16 June. Besides the treaty on the  principles of bilateral relations, Vietnam and Russia also  signed agreements on investment; on economic scientific and  technical cooperation; in agriculture, industry; and on  cooperation in fishery. These documents are new foundations for  Vietnam and Russia to develop long term cooperation for mutual  benefits on the principles of equality, and at the same, basis  for them to overcome obstacles on mechanism and forms of  cooperation in recent past.    The Russian prime minister, in the talks, assured the  Vietnamese prime minister that the two countries of Vietnam and  Russia have a fine traditional relationship. With the newly  signed documents, the two countries should bring into full play  this fine relationship.</p>

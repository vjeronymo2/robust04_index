			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Glazovskaya] </F>   [Text] Ashkhabad, 21 April (TASS) -- The first round of  Turkmen-Chinese summit talks has revealed the identity of their  stands on the main aspects of cooperation. This was stressed at  a briefing for journalists, organised by the Chinese side. It  was stated that Li Peng and Saparmurat Niyazov had expressed  satisfaction over the level of the development of bilateral  relations after the establishment of diplomatic contacts in  1992. Both leaders pointed to mutual understanding and  confidence, which are typical of the relations between their  countries. They stressed that there existed a potential for  their further deepening.    It was stated at the briefing that the talks had revealed  the  main spheres of possible economic cooperation, of which the  transportation of Turkmen gas to China is the most important one.    Participants in the talks, held in Ashkhabad, pointed out  that trade turnover between China and Turkenistan is not too  great so far, but there are chances to make it more effective.  The Chinese side expressed a lively interest in purchasing  Turkmen cotton.    Four agreements are expected to be signed at the talks,  which  will be continued on Friday. They will become more specific  after a meeting of Chiness business people with heads of Turkmen  ministries and institutions, scheduled for Friday.</p>

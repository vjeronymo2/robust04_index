			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Unity hangs on people's will: Ethiopia's stability is again under threat Ethiopia's transition from famine, civil war and state socialism to peace and democracy is uneasily poised between success and violent disintegration. The interim government, dominated by the rebel Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) which seized power eight months ago, is attempting to consolidate its position. But it faces increasing difficulties as a result of its political programme and its failure to stop Ethiopia's economic decline. Growing internecine ethnic clashes in the south of the country, open splits between the political groups which make up the loose coalition government, increasing economic hardship, opposition from the civil service, and a large body of disenchanted urban middle-class professionals have all begun to undermine the government's stability and authority. Ethiopian political observers and western diplomats are increasingly alarmed about the government's policy of decentralising power on tribal lines into what is being termed 'ethnic federalism', and the absence of any serious economic reform measures. At the heart of the scepticism lies a concern that the EPRDF, which grabbed the most powerful cabinet posts in the government when it seized power in May last year, remains wedded to the outdated, peasant-based, socialist and ethnic political philosophy it developed over years in isolation in the bush. Compounding Ethiopia's difficulties is the legacy of the collapsed regime of Mr Mengistu Haile Mariam, the former president who ruled for 14 years and exacerbated an already long-running civil war. The end of the war left 350,000 soldiers waiting to be demobilised, millions of weapons outside state armories and 20,000-25,000 former officials detained on charges from genocide to corruption. It also left the already weak economy in tatters. Between 1988 and the end of last year income per head declined an average of 3.7 per cent a year. By the time Mr Mengistu fled in the face of advancing rebels, payments on servicing Ethiopia's USDollars 3bn foreign debt had reached 76 per cent of export earnings. Domestic investment and savings had fallen sharply and inflation had climbed to an annual rate of almost 30 per cent. 'The pressures are enormous,' said one close adviser to President Meles Zenawi. 'There is only a 50:50 chance that it will all work out.' The greatest threat to stability is the government's policy of ethnic federalism which has unleashed potent tribal conflicts that could escalate into another bout of civil war. When the EPRDF seized power, it convened a national conference of political and ethnic groups to create a consensus for a coalition government, a two-and-a-half-year transitional democratic programme and to hammer out a charter enshrining basic human rights. In the process, the conference committed Ethiopia to a decentralisation of power on tribal lines. The country has been divided into 14 ethnic regions which are scheduled to hold Ethiopia's first democratic elections in March. Voters will decide the composition of 14 regional assemblies which will have significant autonomy over policing, education, language and local taxation. But in the run-up to the polls, dominant tribes in each area have been jockeying for power against their minority rivals and fighting has been intense, particularly in the south. Several thousand lives have been lost in the past seven months. Villages have also been razed as competing groups try to seize more land. President Meles admits that the policy of ethnic federalism is fraught with 'dangers' and 'irrational fall-outs'. But he said that after years of central government and the oppression of ethnic groups there was no alternative. 'Ethiopia can be united under one condition - if the people so desire. Any other attempt is a recipe for civil war.' However, efforts to broaden the EPRDF beyond its traditionally narrow political base of the Tigrayan and northern Amhara peoples have failed. It seems likely that after the elections the country will have about 20 ethnic political groups but no national political organisation capable of winning support across them. Absorbed by this political transformation the government has neglected the economy. President Meles says his government has already prepared sweeping revisions of the labour and investment codes, transport sector policy and is studying how to liberalise trade, restructure the financial system and dismantle state-owned industries. A government delegation was also due to sign its first agreement with the World Bank in Washington last week for an emergency programme which would be worth about USDollars 650m over two years. But the government has yet to transform any economic ideas into concrete measures. Critics say the recently published transitional economic policy document is too half-hearted in its commitment to the free market. The pressures released by Mr Meles' takeover of Ethiopia remain formidable. Without greater speed on economic reform and political consensus-building, Ethiopia is likely to lose another opportunity to end its sad history of impoverishment and fratricidal civil war.</p>

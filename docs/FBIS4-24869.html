			<p>BFN     [Text] Rome, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Italian President Oscar  Luigi Scalfaro and newly elected Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi held talks with visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton  today on a number of bilateral and international issues.    Clinton arrived here Thursday [2 June] to start his  week-long  visit to Europe, which takes in France and Britain, linked to  the commemoration activities for the 50th anniversary of the  D-Day landings in Europe during the Second World War.    In the talks, the leaders exchanged views on bilateral  relations and ways of reducing mass unemployment. They also  examined the preparations for the summit of the Group of Seven  industrialized nations to be held in Italy next month.    Clinton praised Italy for its support for the operation of  the Forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in  Bosnia.    Referring to the proposed increase of permanent seats in the  U.N. Security Council, Clinton told Berlusconi that the United  States supported the efforts by Japan and Germany to seek a  permanent seat each in the Council. He also said that he would  not rule out the idea of extending membership to more countries.    Between the meeting with Scalfaro and talks with Berlusconi,  Clinton went to the Vatican and met Pope John Paul.    Clinton acknowledged at the news conference that there were  "genuine differences" with the pope on abortion and  contraception, which the Catholic Church forbids.    The main theme of the talks, according to Vatican sources,  was the procedure for a U.N. population conference due to be  held in Cairo in September.    The Vatican fears the conference, which is drawing up a  20-year-plan to stabilize world population, will back abortion  and contraception.</p>

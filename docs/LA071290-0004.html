			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON / ON RESTAURANTS: SOUTHWEST IN EVERY DIRECTION  </P> <P> The 16th-Century Spanish adventurers who vainly searched the American Southwest  for the fabled lost cities of gold may have been inspired by a  misunderstanding.  </P> <P> There certainly was a language barrier between these guys and the locals who  gave them directions, and what they may actually have been told about was not  cities of gold, but of golden caviar.  </P> <P> You might reach that conclusion, at any rate, by reading the menu at  Cilantro's, which offers an appetizer of chile corn crab cakes with golden  caviar and sour cream. Golden caviar -- and crab, too -- certainly was beyond  the reach of the Indians who developed the original Southwest cuisine. But the  point of the new Southwest cuisine, handled very well by this immensely popular  restaurant on the eastern edge of Del Mar, is to achieve a Southwest-style  effect by jumbling almost any ingredients with one or a few traditional  staples.  </P> <P> The menu is, by and large, as striking as the dining room, in which wood, stone  and metal surfaces are cleverly woven into a sophisticated environment.  Appetizers are listed as tapas (snacks), and two or three could be ordered as  an alternative to a formal entree. In addition to the crab cakes (which were  tasty enough, but not very different from the classic Maryland version), the  starter list offers oysters baked under cilantro pesto; blue corn nachos with  black beans, salsa and cheese; grilled skewers of shrimp or chicken first  soaked in a spicy marinade, and a most unusual queso fundido.  </P> <P> This last varies considerably from the typical Mexican dish, and bakes a round  creamy goat cheese in a sharp puree of Romaine lettuce, pungent herbs and pine  nuts.  </P> <P> Baskets of hot, homemade tortillas arrive throughout the meal; oversized and  light, these might be greeted critically by aficionados of the genuine Mexican  product, but they are quite good. Many other extras are available at a price,  including jalapeno relish, a basket of blue corn tortilla chips, sweet potato  chips with fruit salsa, a relish of black beans and papaya and a pile of onion  rings hotly seasoned with red chile.  </P> <P> The entree list is relatively brief but by no means lightweight. It opens with  grilled salmon seasoned with chipotle chilies, garlic, oregano and cilantro  vinaigrette, and moves along to a spit-roasted chicken rubbed with hot peppers,  a grilled rib-eye steak doused with a sauce of roasted tomatoes and poblano  chilies, and fajitas of beef, chicken or shark.  </P> <P> The roast duck with a slurry-like sauce of pureed dried cherries and chilies  takes the duck-with-fruit sauce theme in a delicious new direction. There is  great subtlety to the hot-sweet sauce, and the bird itself is roasted carefully  to an extremely juicy finish.  </P> <P> The "Rio Grande" lamb chops similarly undergo a careful grilling; these gain a  slight edge from a cilantro-based "pesto" and are garnished with a suave,  slightly creamy succotash that adds chopped bell peppers and onions to the  usual corn-lima bean combination.  </P> <P> A chile relleno stuffed with smoked chicken, oyster mushrooms, spinach and  cheese looked to have been sprinkled with confetti, thanks to the relish of  corn and minced peppers; the effect was teasingly hot and rather savory.  </P> <P> The kitchen prepares a selection of desserts daily and serves them in generous  portions -- these tend to be very sweet, probably as an antidote to the  spiciness that characterizes so many of the dishes. The choice recently  included white chocolate cheesecake, profiteroles drenched with both caramel  and chocolate sauces, and a flavorful cherry-apple crisp garnished with scoops  of excellent homemade ice cream.  </P> <P> CILANTRO'S  </P> <P> 3702 Via de la Valle, Del Mar  </P> <P> Calls: 259-8777  </P> <P> Hours: Lunch served weekdays, dinner nightly  </P> <P> Cost: Dinner for two, including a glass of wine each, tax and tip, about $40 to  $70.

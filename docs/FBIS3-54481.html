The embassy will open in the next few months but Libya has  already named Muhammad al-Fayturi as its charge d'affaires in  the Emirates.    The foreign ministry acting undersecretary, Sayf Sa'id, met  al- Fayturi on Tuesday "after Libya decided to reopen its  diplomatic mission here," the official UAE news agency WAM said.    Libya closed its embassy in the UAE and several other  countries in the mid-1980s apparently because it wanted to cut  overspending due to a decline in oil prices, an Arab diplomat  said.    It was not clear what prompted the latest move since oil  prices have stayed weak. But the decision coincides with  Libya's dispute with the West over the 1988 Lockerbie plane  bombing.    The Gulf states -- oil producers like Libya -- have good  ties  with Washington and London, which demand the hand-over of two  Libyan suspects in the bombing over the Scottish village of  Lockerbie that cost 270 lives.</p>

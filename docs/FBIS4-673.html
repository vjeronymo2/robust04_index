			<p>BFN     [Text] State President F. W. de Klerk says he hopes for a  speedy agreement on the guidelines for mediation between the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC. He was addressing a news  conference on the latest crisis in Pretoria at the end of what  could be the last cabinet meeting.    [Begin recording] [De Klerk, in English] We can, through  this  mediation effort, move towards agreements which have escaped us  for a very long time. We would like to see such agreements, and  we instructed our delegation not to be technical, but to ensure  that agreement is reached which will make successful mediation  possible.    [Correspondent Ronel van Zyl] He said the cabinet has  discussed proposals by the working group which is examining the  position of the Zulu monarchy and found them to be acceptable.  President de Klerk said the government has some criticism of  the proposals, but believes the solution to the problem could be  contained in some of them. Referring to the postponement of the  election date, President de Klerk said he saw no reason which  could justify such a move at this point.    [De Klerk, in English] I sincerely believe that it is in the  best interests of all South Africans, also of all the people of  kwaZulu-Natal, that the elections take place on the scheduled  date. But nobody can prevent any leader to put the question in  negotiation on the agenda, and in a true spirit of negotiation,  I'm always willing to listen to arguments of anybody, and to  interact on the basis of such arguments.    [Van Zyl] President de Klerk said strikes are causing  increasing problems, particularly in the former self-governing  territories and independent states. He welcomed efforts by the  Transitional Executive Council to play a role in the prevention  of such strikes. [end recording]</p>

The students denounced this painful incident and demanded a  halt to the peace negotiations with Israel.    After one hour of slogan shouting, when the square became  overcrowded with other citizens, the police dispersed the  demonstrators in order to prevent other elements infiltrating  them and to keep traffic moving as it had begun to be disrupted.  The police used tear gas and some warning shots to disperse the  demonstrators.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by C. Doonan and C. Govender] </F>   [Text] Durban March 31 SAPA -- Natal African National  Congress leaders on Thursday [31 March] welcomed the  announcement of a state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu provided  it was aimed at establishing a climate for free and fair  elections. The emergency was announced as political violence  continued to rage in Natal with an unprecedented toll of close  to 300 expected for March.    African National Congress Midlands leader Harry Gwala said  while his organisation was opposed to an emergency "for obvious  reasons", it appeared the current declaration was aimed at  establishing a climate for free and fair elections.    "We're hoping the security forces will deal with those  elements bent on destabilising the election and not turn it (the  emergency) on victims of this violence," he said.    Mr Gwala said he further hoped the security forces would  liaise and co-operate with "organisations and communities  affected".    He rejected Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi's contention that deploying troops in kwaZulu would be  perceived as an invasion. "KwaZulu is not separate from South  Africa, it's an integral part. There's no such thing as an  invasion at all."    Northern Natal ANC Secretary Senzo Mchunu said his region  hoped the emergency would mean deployment of the SA Defence  Force and SA Police in areas of violence in the province.    He lashed out at the IFP's rejection of the emergency,  charging the party was "not genuine or serious" about the loss  of life in the territory.    "No person in Natal could say they don't want an added  security presence here in the light of the violence. What is at  stake is the lives of the people. The state of emergency will  bring policing closer to the people," he said.    Southern Natal ANC secretary S'bu Ndebele said the kwaZulu  Police had not fulfilled its duty of maintaining law and order.    "Chief Buthelezi's refusal to discharge his task as chief  minister and minister of law and order leaves very little  alternative.    "We do welcome the move. The ANC wants action on the state  of  anarchy that now prevails here, where people can go on the  rampage and no-one is willing or able to?stop them."    A statement from the ANC's southern Natal Media Officer  Dumisani Makhaye said all democratic forces should ensure the  emergency was not used to "trample on the rights of people".    "The state of emergency must ensure free campaigning for or  against the elections and peaceful demonstrations. It must be  meant to protect free political activity for all organisations  and parties and to stop the carnage. No rational person can be  against this.    "The state of emergency must take all necessary measures to  prevent those forces that are bent on causing violence against  the people.    "The Transitional Executive Council, Independent Electoral  Commission and the South African Government must jointly  administer its implementation."</p>

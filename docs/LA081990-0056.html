			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SINGAPORE PREPARES FOR CHANGE TO A YOUNGER, MORE RELAXED LEADERSHIP;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: NEW MIDDLE CLASS TIRES OF GOVERNMENT'S INTOLERANCE OF DISSENT AND  PERCEIVED MICRO-MANAGEMENT OF EVERYDAY LIFE.  </P> <P> After more than 25 years of ruling this prosperous island city-state with an  iron hand, Lee Kuan Yew has announced that he will step down as prime minister  later this year to make way for younger leaders who promise a more relaxed  style of governing.  </P> <P> But with Lee vowing to stay active in political affairs, many Singaporeans and  foreign analysts say they are uncertain how far the new leaders will be allowed  to move away from authoritarianism in order to accommodate a growing desire for  change among young, affluent professionals.  </P> <P> In many ways, the planned transition here shows that Singapore has been  affected by the movement toward political liberalization that has toppled  communist regimes in Eastern Europe -- even though Asia's authoritarian  governments have long held that this part of the world is different from  others.  </P> <P> Asians, according to their argument, have an ingrained cultural preference for  a strong, paternalistic ruler and tend to be more respectful of authority than  Westerners. And, so the argument goes, most authoritarian governments here have  responded to popular needs by successfully managing their countries' economies  rather than embarking on political liberalization.  </P> <P> East Asia and Southeast Asia are home to some of the world's fastest-growing  economies, as well as to some highly authoritarian governments. Singapore is an  example of this combination.  </P> <P> By linking itself with the major economies of the world and becoming a  financial and trading hub, Singapore overcame its geographic vulnerability and  lack of natural resources to now boast the second highest per capita income in  the region next to Japan. This city-state, with only 2.7 million people, is  widely referred to as one of Asia's "Little Dragons," a newly industrializing  country alongside Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea.  </P> <P> But economic prosperity has come at a price in terms of political freedoms.  When Singapore was made independent in August, 1965, it was threatened by an  active communist insurgency and torn by racial and religious divisions. Lee,  through his People's Action Party, purged the country's suspected communist  leaders, with most jailed under the sweeping Internal Security Act. But still  today, decades later, government critics suspected of communist leanings face  detention without trial.  </P> <P> Opposition parties, while legal, are not encouraged, and its leaders are often  legally harassed. Recently, J. B. Jeyaretnam, head of the opposition Worker's  Party, lost a libel suit brought by Lee for remarks Jeyaretnam made during a  1988 rally, and was ordered to pay a large fine to the prime minister.  </P> <P> The press, too, is limited. Arguing that restrictions are necessary to avoid  inflaming racial and religious tensions in this culturally diverse country, the  government has warned the press that its role is to help build popular support  for official policies and not to act as a watchdog like the Western press.  </P> <P> The circulations of two foreign publications, the Asian Wall Street Journal and  the Far Eastern Economic Review, have been severely restricted and their  reporters barred from the country after the government accused them of  "interfering" in Singapore's domestic politics.  </P> <P> Many observers, including Western diplomats and some Singaporeans, believe the  country's new middle class has grown tired of the government's intolerance of  dissent and the perceived micro-management of everyday life.  </P> <P> The government, for example, limits the number of new automobiles that may be  purchased and fines citizens heavily for jaywalking, littering and for failing  to keep public toilets clean. It has launched "politeness" campaigns and takes  an active interest in the lives of all citizens, drawing complaints from some  young Singaporeans.  </P> <P> To be sure, the ruling party is still popular, but each successive election has  shown a small erosion of its public support, most recently in 1988 when it won  61.8%, its lowest total ever.  </P> <P> The 66-year-old Lee has announced that he is stepping aside, and his designated  successor, Goh Chok Tong, the current first deputy prime minister and defense  minister, is promising leadership that is less domineering, more open to  accommodating differing viewpoints and more suitable to the demands of a modern  and affluent society.  </P> <P> "Today's Singapore is very different from yesterday's Singapore," Goh said in  an interview at the Defense Ministry, where his office is located. "We started  off as an independent nation born out of separation from Malaysia. We went  through struggles, and communal conflicts and so on, to build today's  Singapore.  </P> <P> "The people are much better off today, well-educated. There is a larger pool at  the top who can contribute very much to policy-making, formulation (and)  analysis. So one of the changes I have in mind is to get this group to play a  bigger role in building the next stage for Singapore. Hence I have chosen to  have a more decentralized style of government."  </P> <P> Comparing himself to the domineering Lee, Goh opted for a wartime analogy. "I  think Mr. Lee was more like a revolutionary leader -- a strategist, a  propagandist, a commander, a commando -- all rolled into one. I think I am more  like a commander-in-chief of a conventional army in peacetime."  </P> <P> Goh conceded that his style is being prompted partly by rising popular  resentment of authoritarianism. "People think that we overgovern. They resent  it." He said many younger Singaporeans believe that the government is "very  good, very efficient but very autocratic."  </P> <P> One of Goh's first tasks will be to persuade skeptics that the leadership  change, now scheduled for November, will be genuine. Lee will stay on in the  Cabinet as a senior minister without portfolio, and many here question whether  the soft-spoken, bespectacled Goh will be able to assert his consensual style  over the dominant Lee.  </P> <P> The premier himself aptly described his own driving personality two years ago,  when first discussing his plan to step down, he said: "Even from my sick bed,  even if you are going to lower me into the grave, and I feel that something is  going wrong, I'll get up."  </P> <P> Goh will also have to contend with emerging young leaders drawn into civilian  jobs from the military and led by the prime minister's son, Brig. Gen. Lee  Hsien Loong. The younger Lee is believed to hold views on governing that are  closer to his father's than are Goh's.  </P> <P> The perception here is widespread that Goh will be a caretaker prime minister  until the younger Lee, known as "B.G.," takes over.  </P> <P> "What chance has Goh got, wedged in between Lee Kuan Yew on one side and B. G.  Lee on the other side?" said Jeyaretnam, the opposition leader. He said the  announced plan for a more open style "is all just for public consumption. A lot  of foreigners are taken in by it. . . . It's for public image."  </P> <P> Goh, in the interview, seemed aware of the perception of many that Lee will  continue to play a dominant role here. While noting that Lee is a "dominant  man," Goh said he does not think Lee would "be overbearing in giving his  views."  </P></p>

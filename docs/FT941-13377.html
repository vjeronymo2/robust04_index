			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Bill to restore trade union rights at GCHQ given formal first reading A bill to restore trade union rights at GCHQ, the government's intelligence-gathering centre in Cheltenham, was given a formal first reading in the Commons yesterday - the 10th anniversary of the ban - though it has no chance of becoming law for lack of parliamentary time. The Commons voted by 222 votes to 69, a majority of 153, to allow Labour MP Mr David Winnick to introduce the bill. Ten of the sacked workers earlier delivered a letter to 10 Downing Street calling for the ban to be lifted.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Arts: Assured Beauty - Ballet ENGLISH National Ballet has just gained a new staging of The Sleeping Beauty. Produced by Ronald Hynd, it is essentially - and wisely - the traditional text which he knew as a premier danseur with the Royal Ballet. There is little innovation - Carabosse flies in and out, with no little panache, on wires; the trick is somewhat minimised by having the Lilac Fairy (in 'anything you can do, I can do better' mood) joining the Prince in a similar lift-off at the end of the Vision Scene  - and much sensible conservation. Petipa, as I never cease repeating, Knew Best. I would query Hynd's need to bring in an extra Fairy at the Christening, in the cause of symmetry I'd guess, but also of musical crassness, because Tchaikovsky also Knew Best. In much else we recognise the rule of good sense, and affection for a work that is a central truth about ballet itself. The score was very decently played by ENB's orchestra on Monday night in Southampton, where I saw Beauty at the Mayflower Theatre, and most significantly, the choreography was set out with commendable clarity by ENB's dancers. It is some comment upon the work - and the weeding-out - already undertaken by Derek Deane, ENB's new artistic director, that the lacklustre troupe we have been watching during the past few years has been so transformed. There is brightness and assurance to the work of the corps de ballet, and the Prologue's fairy variations were far more secure as expositions of classic style than anything the company showed us under the previous regime. If Deane can thus inspire his artists after a few months, we have much to look forward to. Such a masterpiece as Beauty will either enhance or utterly destroy its interpreters, but Hynd's love for the ballet, and Deane's sense of performance standards, have put the company on its mettle. The design is by Peter Docherty. He has provided a setting of soaring pillars set against sky-scapes that suggest seasonal moods, with golden-leafed branches which feature significantly and beautifully in the action. The visual effect is most poetic in the Hunting scene and the Awakening: autumnal magic is potent. About his costumes I have certain reservations, more to do with fabric than cut or shape, for he follows the correct historical progress from Louis XIII to Louis XIV, and the Watteau-esque designs for the Hunt are splendid. But modern artificial fibres have an unnatural sheen, unvarying and unresponsive to light. They blare, and the solid blocks of courtiers in blue and acid aniline green in the Prologue, the lurking presence of lurex in gleaming bodices, do not give that feeling of impossible luxury and Versailles' elegance vital to Beauty's power. The company performances are commendable because testimony to serious work and serious coaching. Hynd has made a charming trio for the third act jewels, well done by Josephine Jewkes, Graham Rowe, Stephen Sherriff, and I saw very neat Bluebirds from Yet Sen Chang and Ambra Vallo. Carabosse was well and malevolently played by Kevin Richmond. Aurora and her prince were taken by two new recruits: Cecilia Kerche from Brazil, and the Frenchman, Cyril Pierre. Miss Kerche is a secure performer, but I did not think her physique or her temperament revealed her as one of nature's Auroras. The ultimate and glorious demands of the role - the ballerina as incarnation of a classic ideal - have yet to be met in a reading I found un-nuanced. M. Pierre is a handsome figure and an admirable partner, but he did not show that princely dignity in dancing which makes the last act duet a portrait of a nobleman. The most satisfying performance of the evening came from Evelyne DeSutter, returned to the company after several years, as the Lilac Fairy. Her delicate physique, the elegance of her style are a delight. English National Ballet plays Beauty in Southampton this week; then visits Manchester (week of November 1), Liverpool (Nov 8), Bristol (Nov 16), Leeds (Nov 22).</p>

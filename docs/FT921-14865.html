			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Dalepak jumps 42% at midway 'DESPITE the economic conditions being the worst in Dalepak Foods' 16-year history', the food manufacturer continued its steady progress with a 42 per cent jump in pre-tax profits in the six months to October 31 1991. In the corresponding period they rose by 71 per cent and in the year to April 30 1991 by 57 per cent. This time taxable profits of Pounds 1.71m (Pounds 1.2m) were struck on turnover fractionally ahead at Pounds 21.2m (Pounds 21.1m). Turnover in continuing activities was up 15 per cent, with Dalepak and Fawcetts, the frozen food businesses, rising 14 and 16 per cent respectively. The company said that its traditional meat grillsteak market grew 8 per cent in the half after several years of decline. The markets for its vegetable-based products grew rapidly, stimulated by new product launches and heavy marketing expenditure. The interest bill fell to Pounds 15,000 (Pounds 148,000) and earnings emerged at 10.13p (6.99p) per share. The interim dividend is lifted to 1.5p (1.2p), an increase of 25 per cent.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Italy approves despatch of troops THE Italian cabinet yesterday approved despatch of 2,500 servicemen to Somalia at the request of the UN and US, with 1,200 troops to support UN humanitarian operations in Mozambique, Robert Graham reports from Rome. Most of the contingent will arrive in Somalia by boat and should be fully operational by January 4. The US is said to have sought Italy's military presence given its colonial links with Somalia and knowledge of the factions in the civil war. Rome is keen to prove its international role and leadership of Nato's southern flank rapid intervention force. Steven Butler reports from Tokyo: Japan is considering whether to contribute financially to UN-backed relief efforts in Somalia, Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet secretary, said yesterday. His comments were the strongest indication yet that Japan would back the effort, although Tokyo may still be vulnerable to criticism that its response was late and inadequate. Its slow reaction is thought to have damaged its chances of becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council. It was still too early to discuss the size of a Japanese contribution, Mr Kato added, but Japan faced no constitutional barriers to supporting this humanitarian effort. Tokyo might provide medical aid and refugee relief, and would consider sending personnel. There would be little public support for Japan's sending troops to Somalia.</p>

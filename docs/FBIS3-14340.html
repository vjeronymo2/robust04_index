			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, March 26 (AFP) -- The PLO and Israel agreed  Saturday [26 March] that an accord on security for the massacre  town of Hebron could be signed on Tuesday, clearing the way for  a resumption of talks on Palestinian self-rule.    The accord could be signed when the two sides reconvene on  Tuesday morning in Cairo if the final details are ironed out in  time, said the PLO's chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th.    "As soon as this accord is signed, the negotiations on  launching autonomy in Gaza and Jericho will resume immediately,"  after a month-long suspension because of the Hebron massacre, he  told AFP.    Sha'th said the agreement would cover the deployment of  Palestinian police and Norwegian observers in the West Bank town  where a Jewish settler killed 30 Moslem worshippers on February  25.    The Israeli government will "commit itself to adopt measures  to prevent friction" between the 450 settlers and 120,000  Palestinians of Hebron, he added.    Sha'th confirmed earlier reports from Israel that the key  outstanding issue was the number of police and observers to be  posted in the town.    The police will be posted at fixed points around Hebron to  guard schools, hospitals and the university, he said. Joint  Israeli-Palestinian units would patrol the town.    He implicitly acknowledged that the Israeli army would have  the final word on security, saying "the situation in Hebron will  be different from Gaza and Jericho," where autonomy is to be  launched.    As for the autonomy negotiations, a final accord on the  launch will be signed by April 13, the original date on which  the Israeli army was to have pulled out of Gaza and Jericho,  said Sha'th.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said earlier that he  hoped the autonomy talks would resume on Tuesday along with a  final session on the security arrangements for Hebron.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Steady hand at the centre AS MR John Major's accident- prone government sheds one minister here and another there, Mr Kenneth Clarke looks a reassuringly solid figure in the storm. Within less than a month of taking office as chancellor, he gives every sign of being in charge and invulnerable. Yet his chief achievement to date lies less in the field of economics than in presentation. He has succeeded, remarkably, in giving the appearance of candour while offering no obvious hostages to fortune. In a government that is singularly short of political finesse, this talent is not to be underestimated  - especially when the demands of the electorate have to be reconciled with the requirements of the markets. But as Mr Clarke himself has implicitly acknowledged, this is the easy bit. He has arrived in the job at the optimal moment in the electoral cycle. His predecessor had, after a fashion, grasped many of the more difficult nettles. And it is clear that a recovery is well under way. This week the Central Statistical Office revised upwards its estimate for non-oil GDP in the first quarter to reveal an annualised rate of growth not far short of 3 per cent. The personal sector is beginning to cheer up a bit. The household savings ratio, whose high level played a large part in prolonging the recession, is now coming down fast, from 11.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year to 10.3 per cent in the first quarter of 1993. The unemployment figures have pleasingly defied the precedent set in the recession of the early 1980s, by falling in line with the upturn in economic activity. The corporate sector's balance sheet, meantime, has been substantially tidied up. In the first quarter of the year its financial deficit was almost down to zero. Unit labour costs have been falling at a very un-British rate, thereby adding to the competitiveness of industry's exports and giving stock market analysts a good story to tell. Even the broad definition of money, M4, has been accelerating in recent months, suggesting that something might just be stirring in the bowels of a hitherto quiescent monetary system. Time to talk Against that background Mr Clarke has been right to talk rather than to act. It is not unreasonable to wait until the strength of the recovery can be more accurately gauged before contemplating a cut in interest rates. The more so, since a cut before the Christchurch by-election would severely diminish his credibility in the markets, while antagonising Britain's partners in the European Community. Having failed to persuade the Germans to embark on a co-ordinated cut in interest rates this week, the French, who face mounting unemployment and growing pressure for protection, would be enraged by any such move after last September's devaluation of sterling. Yet the test will come in due course. Mr Clarke describes himself as belonging to the 'hard centre'. He claims to be pro-growth, but anti-inflation; both pro-Europe and in favour of free markets; and a proponent of enlightened social reform, whose Midlands background entails sympathy for the manufacturing businesses on which Thatcherite politicians used to pronounce anathemas in the 1980s. Yet the elements in this seemingly attractive cocktail are not all readily reconcilable. The first signs of where the potential difficulties lie are beginning to emerge. Spending round For all the recent ministerial rhetoric about a fierce public spending round, Mr Clarke has made it clear that there will be no reduction in spending below existing targets, despite the forecast public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn. After the big increases in public spending since Mr Major became prime minister, we will have more modest increases, but increases none the less  - notwithstanding the Portillo review and calls by social security secretary Mr Peter Lilley for a public debate on the future of the welfare state. In Mr Clarke's judgment that is the most that can be achieved by a precarious government with too many dissidents on the backbenches. He is probably right. He could also point out, as Goldman Sachs has done, that public spending is actually lower in relation to GDP than it was when the economy emerged from the recessions of the early 1980s and the mid-1970s. There is a problem with revenue. Hence the chancellor's controversial warning in his interview with the FT this week that he will be ready to raise taxes in his November Budget unless recovery brings a faster reduction in government borrowing. If taxes are increased, then the chancellor will no doubt be tempted to rebalance monetary policy simultaneously. A chancellor whose sympathies lie in the Midlands might well see merit in taxing consumption, while relying on interest rate cuts to help shift resources into exports and investment. But to tax consumption, if the recovery looks weak, will require a great deal of courage. We shall know the potency of Mr Clarke's cocktail in a matter of months.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Making a meal of a dog's dinner: The world petfood market Pampered pooches and pussies support large petfood industries on both sides of the Atlantic - but the markets in the US and Europe are as different as cats and dogs. The idea of making and selling food for pets was American, although English dogs can claim the inspiration. Mr James Spratt of Cincinnati, Ohio, created the dog biscuit industry a century ago after watching dogs scavenging for biscuits on an English dock. Canned dog food quickly followed, and soon fortunes were being made. Fans of PG Wodehouse novels will remember how keen the English aristocracy was to marry its sons to US dog biscuit heiresses. In the mature US and UK markets, where growth has stagnated, consolidation and rationalisation appear to be the ways forward for petfood manufacturers, but there seems plenty of scope for growth in the rest of Europe. Spain, for example, spent just Pounds 200m on petfood last year compared with Pounds 1.2bn in the UK. The contrast between the two markets reflects differences in living habits and retail structure. Many more Britons give their pets prepared food bought from supermarkets, while in southern Europe, pets are fed more on kitchen scraps. The different outlooks for the Anglo-Saxon and continental markets were highlighted by two recent deals. Nestle, the world's largest foods group, paid Dollars 510m (Pounds 323m) to Grand Metropolitan, the UK food and drinks group, for Alpo, its US petfoods business. The purchase took Nestle to second place in the US, behind market leader Ralston Purina, which has about 19 per cent. Dalgety, the UK food and agribusiness group, bought two privately owned Spanish petfood companies to expand its continental business. Nestle believes its purchase could make it market leader in canned dog food in the US. A recent study by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, showed Nestle had 14 per cent of this market and 4 per cent in the EU; it also has 39 per cent of the US canned cat food market and 10 per cent in the EU. Figures from the Washington-based Pet Food Institute show that US pet owners spent Dollars 4.99bn on dog food and Dollars 3.44bn on cat food last year. Nestle competes with Mars and Quaker Oats on both sides of the Atlantic. Mars is clear market leader in Europe with a 47.3 per cent share in 1993 grocery store sales, while Nestle languishes in fourth place. Dalgety is thought to have paid about Pounds 17m for the two Spanish companies - Nido Industrial and Pet-Bon - which have combined assets of Pounds 11m. The move takes it into Spain for the first time. The deal follows Dalgety's Pounds 42m acquisition last November of Paragon Petcare from British Petroleum, which gave it access to the French, German, Dutch and Belgian markets. Dalgety now considers itself second to Mars in the European market in volume terms, although just below Quaker by value. It is difficult to get an overall picture of the market, as it can be divided by country; between cat and dog; 'wet' (canned) and dry; and grocery and non-grocery. But Dalgety's best estimates suggest plenty of scope for higher sales in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium. In Italy, for example, 82 per cent of the calorific value required to support the 7m cats comes from commercial petfood, with 89 per cent for a dog population of 6m. Italy's prepared petfood market, comprising 102,000 tonnes of cat food and 120,000 tonnes of dog food, was worth only Pounds 479,000 last year. In the UK a comparable 7m cats put away 549,000 tonnes, while 6.8m dogs consumed 619,000 tonnes. While Europe remains a collection of local markets, Mars has started to unify it through the strong brand presence of Pedigree Chum and Whiskas. Mr Richard Clothier, Dalgety's chief executive, argues that cats in Italy and Scotland should like the same food - unlike the human population.</p>

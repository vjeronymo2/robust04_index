			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: WHEN SEX IS PAINFUL  </P> <P> Question: After 40 years of a satisfying marriage, I find that having sexual  relations has become painful.  </P> <P> I have no desire to start on a series of tests or to undergo extensive  treatment, but I would like to do something about the problem. Could there  possibly be any simple solutions to such a problem?  </P> <P> Answer: The solution to the problem you raised may not require extensive tests  or treatments. For example, the use of estrogen replacement therapy or  lubricants may be sufficient to eliminate the discomfort you are experiencing.  I suggest you check with your physician. You may be pleasantly surprised at how  simple the solution may be.  </P></p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (31): As house prices fall, so do old certainties - Do we still need to buy our home? / The financial case for renting is strong, but don't overlook the psychological factors THIS MAY sound like heresy in a land of property-owning democracy. But who needs to buy a house? The general arguments in favour of home-ownership are well rehearsed - it offers you extra freedom and independence, and also provides you with a tradable asset. Start a mortgage, and you are making regular payments towards buying something which could stand as an investment in its own right. Pay the rent, and the money goes down the drain. You have successfully sheltered yourself, but it is no more an investment than the money you spend on bus fares. Sadly, the repossessions crisis and the sudden trough in housing prices, has forced people to look at the argument again. Certainly, if you were a homeowner in the 1980s, you would have been well placed. The Halifax House Price Index (see page 33), set at 100 in 1983, stood at 223.1 at the beginning of 1989. During 1988 prices rose 20.8 per cent, and in the previous year the index had risen by 23.3 per cent. All of this capital appreciation came from an investment which you could use, happily, every day of your life. What made a house such a good investment? Peter Smith, of the advisers Hill Martin, identifies three factors which fuelled the domestic housing market: Loans to buy housing have benefited from very favourable tax treatment. Mortgage Interest Relief At Source (Miras) was once available for an amount sufficient to cover most mortgages, at the borrower's top marginal rate of tax. Now, Miras has been allowed to 'wither on the vine' at Pounds 30,000, which is no longer enough to fund the average mortgage. It has also been limited to the basic 25 per cent rate of tax. Mr Smith concludes that buying a house with a mortgage can no longer realistically be called tax-efficient. Housing has traditionally been in short supply, which helps to force prices up. Again, this is no longer the case, following the Thatcherite reforms of the early 1980s. Credit for house-buying has always been cheap, allowing for truly 'geared' investment. Now, high real interest rates (compared with inflation) are the norm. Quite apart from dampening the demand in the market, this also makes it tougher to benefit to the full from selling a house for a profit when you have only parted with a fraction of its original price. Add these factors up, and it has been possible over the last two decades to make significant profits from what Mr Smith describes as 'geared tax-efficient investment in speculative markets'. None of the conditions for this now seem to apply. This might explain why the Halifax index had dropped to 214.7 by the beginning of this year. Some would argue that the housing market is set for further depression, which might tilt the argument more steeply against buying rather than renting. Why buy now if the house will be cheaper in a year's time? But this line of argument can get very complicated. It might be simpler to assume that a house will now do no more than keep pace with inflation, like most commodities in the economy. Several building societies currently seem to be working on this hypothesis. If you make this assumption, renting becomes a viable option. It also gets much easier to decide which is the easier move. Financially, all you need look at is the relative cost per week. If it is cheaper to rent, do so. Coming down to the numbers like this can seem too simple. If you would feel psychologically better in a house of your own - as would many young families  -that could be sufficient reason for buying a house. Those with a taste for garish interior decor, or who want to use their home as a base for breeding rottweilers, might also find the terms of a rental lease too restrictive. But David Kauders, a Taunton-based financial adviser specialising in gilts, can point to two cases where renting looks much more attractive. First, he points to a client who had paid off her mortgage, and then continued to live in her cottage. On Mr Kauders' advice, she sold it, realising about Pounds 90,000, and put this into a portfolio of government securities. The rent on her new (larger) property was around three-quarters the net income from the government bonds, meaning that the remaining quarter was hers to spend as a supplement to income. She also had no exposure to declining property values - needless to say, the price of her old cottage has dropped since she left. This manoeuvre was possible, according to Mr Kauders, because residential property was still overvalued - hence bond yields are much healthier than the rental yields from residential property. His other scenario concerns a family which has still not joined the property ladder. If that family has children to whom it wants to provide a settled environment, the general and psychological advantages of ownership become considerable. But otherwise, a young family will probably want flexibility. They will also be happier about paying the deposit on rental accommodation than for a mortgage. Add to this, the 'sunk costs' in terms of time spent searching, legal fees, and (unless you buy in the next few months) stamp duty, and renting looks sensible. None of this means that you should immediately sell the family home in which you are happily settled. Neither does it mean that you should not back your hunch if you find what you think is a very cheap house in a good situation. But the presumption that you should always buy if you are able to do so has surely gone.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SELLING AND RENTING: THREE EXAMPLES (POUNDS)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       A         B               C  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Capital value                     90,000    75,000            120,000 Replacement property:             Larger    Similar   Same house, let Rental, incl              insurance             4,500      3,300             4,800 Gross income from government securities                        *8,120      7,100            11,400 Net income (25% tax)               6,090      5,325             8,550 Income gain from renting           1,590      2,025             3,750  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Example A is the case referred to in the article.

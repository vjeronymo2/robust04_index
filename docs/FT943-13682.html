			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Moslem civilians forced over frontline, say United Nations officials Bosnian Serb fighters have rounded up hundreds of Moslem civilians in Bijelina, north-eastern Bosnia, imprisoning many and expelling some over the frontline, UN officials and eyewitnesses said yesterday, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. The Serb Population Exchange Commission, in concert with the Panthers, a Bosnian Serb paramilitary group, imprisoned 800 Moslems, said witnesses in the town on Bosnia's frontier with Serbia. UN spokesmen said at least 135 women, children and elderly men were also forced across the frontline near Tuzla, the biggest Bosnian government stronghold in the north-east, after being robbed and beaten. 'We fear for our lives,' said a non-Serb woman speaking by telephone from Bijelina amid the biggest wave of forced expulsions in over a year. 'This is just like the Gestapo in the second world war,' she added. Mr Kris Janowski, spokesman of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Sarajevo, said: 'They were told that they were being exchanged (for Serbs) or sent abroad and they had to renounce claims to their property. Then they were robbed at the confrontation line and pushed over to the other side. . . with some shots fired over their heads.' Up to 4,000 Moslems remain in Bijelina. Moslems comprised the majority of the population of 35,000 before Serb paramilitaries, with the Yugoslav army, waged war against Bosnian independence in April 1992. All but a handful lost their jobs, property and homes. 'It is now terror on the streets. They are trying to clear out the last Moslems,' said a 29-year-old Serb inhabitant. The expulsions are another sign of Serb refusal to abandon their self-proclaimed state and endorse a plan to preserve Bosnia-Hercegovina as a unified country composed of two loosely joined ethnic mini-states.</p>

Officials of the Schwechat drug police thought the route of the  24-year-old U.S. citizen James R. highly unusual. The man  arrived on Aeroflot flight SU 261 from Brazil via Moscow at  Vienna's Schwechat Airport at noon on Wednesday [16 February].  During a careful check, 4 kg of heroin was discovered in the  false bottom of his bag.    When he was interrogated, James R. claimed that he was only  the courier, and that he had received the drugs in Brazil. His  statements led to the arrest of three Nigerians in Vienna on the  same day. For technical reasons, the police declined on  Thursday [17 February] to disclose their names and the functions  within the drug ring.    Yesterday the fingerprints of the arrested drug dealers were  checked. Results are expected today, Friday. Moreover, an  exact analysis of the impounded drugs is not yet available.</p>

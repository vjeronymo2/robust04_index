			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The United States has announced that it will send a  diplomatic note to Poland, asking that no assistance be given to  the regime in Burma. The Americans maintain that the Poles are  helping the local junta by providing military training and  maintenance of military equipment.    Here is Wladyslaw Klaczynski, the director of the Foreign  Affairs Ministry Information Department:    [Begin recording] [Klaczynski] So far, the Foreign Affairs  Ministry has received nothing from the Americans.    We have not sold assault helicopters. Two years ago we sold  transport helicopters from Swidnik. Allegedly, the Burmese have  installed some weapons in them. This could happen.    I would like to recall that Burma is not subject to any ban  by the United Nations Organization.    [Unidentified correspondent] Precisely, are we bound by UN  bans or by U.S. bans?    [Klaczynski] We are bound only by UN bans and by our own  morality. [end recording]</p>

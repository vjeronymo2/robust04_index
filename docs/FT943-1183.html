			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Skilled labour shortage 'hampers recruitment' Small companies say a shortage of skilled labour is hampering their recruitment efforts. A survey by the British Chambers of Commerce and the business finance specialist Alex Lawrie says as many as 39 per cent claim to be suffering from a 'skills gap', with two-thirds citing the literacy of recruits as their main problem. More than half said recruits suffered from poor numeracy. The survey included 487 companies, each employing fewer than 50 people. Just more than a third of respondents said the cost of recruiting and training staff was a barrier to their company's employment prospects. Two-thirds said they had trouble in finding staff of the required calibre. The survey found the single most important barrier to employment was 'low or unpredictable demand in the economy', with 54 per cent citing this as their most important difficulty. Small companies said the most difficult jobs to fill were in production/engineering (39 per cent), followed by marketing and sales (38 per cent). One in five reported difficulties in recruiting managerial or secretarial staff. Mr Richard Brown, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said yesterday: 'The basic skills base has long been the Achilles heel of long-term industrial success. If the government is looking to small firms to hire people - and they are right to do so - it will be seriously disappointed while so many barriers remain.' Many small companies complained about the lack of flexibility and adaptability among their employees as well as 'a scarcity of creativity and imagination'. Only 13 per cent found that their local training and enterprise council 'had been useful in identifying and meeting skills needs'. More than half the sample said the poverty trap was a barrier to employment, with recruits being better off living on social security than with the kind of pay package offered by small employers. Just under 40 per cent cited direct wage costs as a barrier to job creation. British Chambers of Commerce, 9 Tufton Street, London SWI 3QB. Pounds 60.00.</p>

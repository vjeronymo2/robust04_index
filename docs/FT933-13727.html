			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Reorganisation at Independent Inv Independent Investment proposes to reorganise its capital to ensure that the market value of shareholders' investment reflects more closely the underlying net asset value. The scheme involves cancelling the ordinary shares and warrants and setting up a holding company, Ivory &amp; Sime Enterprise Capital, in which shareholders will receive ordinary shares and convertible unsecured loan stock units, and warrant holders get warrants with rights to subscribe for ordinary shares. For every Pounds 100 of formula asset value attributable to each holding at the reference date - expected to be September 10 - an ordinary holder will receive 60 ISEC shares with an initial net asset value of Pounds 1 and 40 convertible loan stock units of Pounds 1. Meetings are expected to be held on August 18. High Court sanction will be required.</p>

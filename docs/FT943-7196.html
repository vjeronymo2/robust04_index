			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / India's airport Customs men are no longer ogres: Getting through the green channel is easier, but problems remain Three years after the start of economic liberalisation, the customs men at Delhi's international airport have done their best to adapt to deregulation. Before, the protection of the globe's most regimented economy outside the communist world required that officials treated travellers with the greatest suspicion. Dressed in white military-style uniform, the customs men were lords of all they surveyed. Anyone carrying a videocamera or computer had to have serial numbers indelibly written into their passport, to ensure the item was not sold in some black-market bazaar. Home-bound visitors who came to the airport without a declared item had to write a long letter of explanation and apology, and hope customs officials would read it before the flight was called. Today, officials are prepared to take on trust visitors bearing a modest amount of luggage, though almost every bag is still X-rayed. The customs men remain suspicious of anyone carrying two or more of any high-priced piece of electronics. 'This is my camera and that's my wife's,' is not an explanation they like to hear. Armed with the latest price lists from Sony and Toshiba, they know the exact cost of your new portable compact disc-player, even if you seem to have forgotten. As far as the casual visitor to India is concerned, there is no comparison with what went before. As one customs man says: 'The green channel is now a mile wide'. Over at the cargo terminal change is rather less discernible. On first arriving in Delhi two years ago, innocent of the complexities of Indian bureaucracy, I went into the cargo terminal to collect a shipment of clothes. Having obtained from the airline office a vital document called a delivery order and then strolling over to the customs hall to pick up my cases, I asked a customs man where to collect the shipment. He laughed and said: 'Sir, you have completed stage one of a 13-stage process'. This week, I discovered the process still consists of 13 stages, when going to collect another shipment, mainly food for my three children who pine for tuna fish and baked beans. Those who find it bizarre that anyone could go to the trouble of flying tuna fish and baked beans around the world have never lived in a closed economy. The passage through customs takes place inside an enormous warehouse, in which travellers' possessions are stored behind metal fences. At one end there is a gate, near which are the offices of the many officials to whom the visitor must report before he can claim his baggage. In summer the building is stiflingly hot, except for the officials' glass-walled cabins which are cooled by air-conditioning to a few degrees below zero. The International Airports Authority of India (IAAI) offers travellers a guide through the maze of desk and counters. First, obtain the delivery order, says the IAAI. Then file the baggage declaration form; obtain the location slips; obtain the shipmentfrom IAAI staff; complete the customs inspection; return the shipment to IAAI staff; pay the duty; obtain an 'out-of-charge' form from customs against a duty payment receipt; obtain a bank challan from the IAAI; pay the IAAI charges; obtain an IAAI gate pass; present customs-cleared documents to IAAI staff; take delivery of the shipment from IAAI; pay octroi (local transport tax). I am still not sure what a challan is, as it gets buried in all the other documents one must carry around from one counter to another. The greatest importance is attached to paperwork. A wrong number on any of the documents needed to gain access to one's goods can mean long delays. The officials are not in the least irritated by the mind-numbing tedium of their work; they know perfectly well that lots of rules means lots of jobs for airport staff. After two and a quarter hours, my shipment is delivered to me on a trolley. It is quarter to one in the afternoon and I am the first person to leave the warehouse that day. I sign one record book to acknowledge receipt, and the trolley moves forward five yards. I sign another record book and the warehouse guards lift the chain which bars the warehouse entrance. At last I have access to the tuna and baked beans.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Major acts to avert leadership challenge: PM warns he will fight to stay in office as Hurd seeks to unite party Mr John Major yesterday sought to pre-empt a challenge to his party leadership later this year with a blunt warning to Tory critics that he would fight to remain in 10 Downing Street. In a move calculated to avert the threat of a leadership crisis after this summer's local and European elections, the prime minister said he had a mandate to remain in office at least until the general election due by 1997. His comments coincided with a renewed attempt by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, to unite the Conservative party around a common position for the June European elections. In a speech echoed by the prime minister, Mr Hurd said Europe should abandon grand ambitions for a federal structure in favour of making the present institutions work effectively. But amid a continuing battle within the Conservative party to shape its manifesto for the European elections, that stance was attacked by Sir Edward Heath, former prime minister, who said it would diminish Britain's influence within the Union. Mr Major's remarks followed the speculation at Westminster that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has been positioning himself to challenge Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, for the leadership if Mr Major steps down. Mr Clarke, in an interview with The Independent, made it clear that he remained a contender for the leadership, 'but at a time of John Major's choosing'. Speaking on BBC Radio's Jimmy Young programme, Mr Major brushed aside suggestions that the expected defeats for the Conservatives in the local and European elections in May and June could force him from office. Recalling that in 1992 the Conservatives had won more votes than any party in UK history, he said: 'I was elected to remain prime minister of this country at least until the next election and beyond it if I win it.' Mr Major said talk that Mr Heseltine was poised to replace him was 'unreal'. He declared: 'I have never run away from a challenge in my life and I'm surely not doing so now.' Acknowledging that he had faced constant allegations of weakness and indecision, Mr Major insisted that he had not been shaken from his main policy objectives: 'The things that matter are what emerges at the end of the struggles, not what vitriol may be hurled during the time of the struggles.' He offered an upbeat assessment of economic prospects, emphasising that inflation was set to remain below 3 per cent and that growth this year would meet the Treasury's forecast of 2.5 per cent. But Mr Major was forced to admit that the Conservatives' pre-election promises in 1992 to cut taxes had been based on an over-optimistic assessment of the economic outlook. Referring to the impending tax increases, he said: 'We did get it wrong. But the important thing, having got it wrong, is not to shrink from the action that is necessary to put the economy on the right path.' Mr Clarke said that he did not propose to reduce taxes 'before recovery or before we have healthier public finances'. Mr Major accepted that the government had made a 'mistake' when in 1988 it had briefly linked the sale of arms to Malaysia with aid provision. The mistake had been put right, he said. A new opinion poll in Scotland, published last night, showed the Conservatives with the support of just 13 per cent of voters.

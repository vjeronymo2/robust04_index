			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Monetary slowdown easing THE long slowdown in Japanese money supply growth may be reaching its end, according to Bank of Japan figures, published yesterday, which indicate the rate of contraction is slowing. The broadly defined money supply fell by 0.3 per cent in January from a year earlier, the fifth consecutive month of contraction. However, the rate of contraction has eased considerably in the past few months from a 0.6 per cent fall in October and November and 0.4 per cent in December. At the same time, the bank's measure of broad liquidity grew by 2.5 per cent from a year before, an unchanged rate from December. Broad liquidity growth has been reasonably stable at between 2.4 and 2.7 per cent a month for the past five months. The trend in M2, meanwhile, has gradually shifted from a 5.7 per cent month-on-month contraction last September to 1.5 per cent growth in January compared with the previous month. It is not clear what is causing the slight improvement in the money supply growth rate. It may reflect increased lending by commercial banks, which may gather pace in the wake of the recent cut in the official discount rate to an historic low of 2.5 per cent. Much of the growth in lending is coming from public sector financial institutions which provide loans and finance for small businesses. These agencies have had recent sharp increases in their budgets which are just showing through in higher lending.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Johnson Cleaners' shares fall on gloomy statements Johnson Group Cleaners' shares yesterday slid 9 per cent to 287p as the dry cleaning and textile rental group announced a 5 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits and warned the full-year return was likely to fall this year. Mr Terry Greer, chairman, said the first half had proved difficult in both the dry cleaning and the textile rentals businesses. Profits had fallen from Pounds 8.7m to Pounds 8.2m on sales up 2 per cent to Pounds 83.2m for the 26 weeks to June 25. He expected no material improvement in the second half and said it was 'unlikely that the results for the full year will match those of 1993.' The gloomy statements should not have come as a surprise to investors who had been warned of difficult trading conditions both at the year-end and at the annual meeting. However, analysts pulled back forecasts for the full year from about Pounds 18m to Pounds 17m after the announcement. Analysts cited disappointment that Johnson Group had not yet got to grips with the losses in the US franchise business, which they estimated was losing up to Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) a year. Johnson also suffered its first real setback on textile rental, with margins estimated to have fallen by 2.7 points to 19.6 per cent. Mr Greer said textile rental in the UK had been hit by price pressure and the costs of developing its new business of supplying uniforms to the food sector. The textile rental division returned operating profits 8 per cent lower at Pounds 4.6m, on sales 5 per cent higher at Pounds 23.5m. The contribution from dry cleaning fell by 4 per cent to Pounds 3.98m on sales marginally higher at Pounds 59.7m (Pounds 59.3m). Adverse weather in the UK and the absence of any revival in discretionary spending by consumers meant that sales had remained virtually flat, Mr Greer said. The interim dividend is held for the fifth consecutive year at 2.8p. This contrasted with Johnson's decision last year to increase the final pay-out for the first time in three years. Earnings fell by 7 per cent to 10.44p. COMMENT The drop in Johnson's share price may reflect the fact that the market is finally beginning to realise this company will be a late bloomer in any recovery. Evidence from previous recessions shows Johnson picking up after four years of recovery. So far, the UK has enjoyed two. The setback in UK textile rental is disappointing, but the group still enjoys the highest margins in its peer group. The one big question is how long it takes the company to get to grips with the US losses. This, like dry cleaning, will depend on recovery. The forecasts of about Pounds 17m for this year leave the shares on a prospective p/e of about 14 times. This looks about right given the gloomy prospects this year.</p>

Kelam announced that the CE political committee report on  Estonia's obligation was highly positive and stressed that  Estonia had done the maximum possible in the circumstances and  time limits. Kelam had also discussed the Russian issue,  stressing that Russia's admission must be considered calmly and  without any pressure from outside. He referred to a EU council  declaration which had stressed the need to admit Russia in the  CE as soon as possible.    "I pointed out, among other things, that Russia granted  amnesty to the coup organisers, that the positions of the  military are constantly strengthening there, and mentioned that  Russia is going back on its promise to pull out its troops by  August 31," Kelam told the news conference.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / SFO defeats threat to powers THE Serious Fraud Office has defeated a High Court ruling that threatened to limit its investigatory powers. In an important judgment on the 'right to silence', five law Lords yesterday upheld the SFO's claim that it has the legal right to continue questioning a suspect about an offence after he or she is charged with it. The Lords examined the exceptional powers, given to the SFO by parliament, that remove from people questioned the right to silence. The SFO had appealed against a ruling last November on a challenge to its powers by Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, chairman of Wallace Smith Trust, who has been charged with fraud involving at least Pounds 97m. After Mr Smith had been charged and cautioned by the police that he was not obliged to say anything, he was required by the SFO to answer questions under section 2 of the 1987 Criminal Justice Act. The section empowers the SFO to compel a person under investigation to answer questions or produce documents, under penalty of up to six months in jail, and/or a fine. The High Court granted Mr Smith a declaration that before questioning a person about an offence with which he has been charged the SFO must inform him that he is not obliged to answer. Yesterday Lord Mustill said Mr Smith had argued that an SFO investigation, and therefore its compulsory powers, ended when a person was charged. That proposition was impossible to sustain, Lord Mustill added. The act gave the SFO the power to question about 'any matter relevant to the investigation' and it was unreal to suggest that once a person had been charged there could no longer be any such relevant matter. Mr Smith had then argued that the 1987 act must be understood to preserve the right to silence. But Lord Mustill said statutory interference with that right was almost as old as the right itself. The caution the police had to give was not directly linked to the right but was a development relating to the admissibility of confessions, and once that was recognised Mr Smith's argument fell away. The appeal was not concerned with the admissibility at trial of responses to SFO questions, or with ensuring the responses were voluntary, so there was no reason to force on the act a qualification with which it had nothing to do. Mr George Staple, SFO director, said later that the judgment represented an important clarification of the SFO's section 2 powers. 'It will enable us to exercise these powers more widely than we have in the past due to the uncertainty in the law.' The whole issue of the right to silence is among the subjects being considered by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, which is due to report next spring.</p>

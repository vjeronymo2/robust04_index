			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Insurer in block trade COMPOSITE insurance group Sun Alliance featured as the market's most heavily traded stock as US insurer Chubb sold a block of 47.5m Sun Alliance shares into the UK market as its part of a mutual shift in shareholdings between the two groups. Under the terms of an agreed shift of strategic stakes, Chubb said it would lower its holding in Sun from around 9 per cent to some 3 per cent, while Sun Alliance's stake in Chubb would be reduced from the 9 per cent level down to around 5 per cent. Chubb's sale of Sun Alliance shares was undertaken by three broking houses, SG Warburg Securities, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Three brokers were said to have bought the Sun Alliance shares for 304p each and placed them with various institutions at 308p a share. Dealers said the stock was placed easily within an hour or so. Sun shares dropped back to close 12 weaker at 314p, with turnover accelerating to reach an extremely heavy 118m shares by the end of the day. As its part of the deal Sun said it intended to sell 3.4m Chubb shares via a secondary offering to US investors by the same brokers involved in the UK sale of Sun shares. The Chubb sale is the latest in a series of significant share liquidations by Sun Alliance, which have raised around Pounds 484m for the insurance group. Last week the group sold a block of 9.5m shares, or around 8 per cent, in London &amp; Manchester, the life assurance group. In late September Sun sold most of its 14 per cent interest in Commercial Union. Cellular stocks busy Confirmation that BT is selling its 22 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular, the biggest of the US cellular phone companies, to AT&amp;T, taking a substantial profit in the process, triggered a sharp rise in BT shares. Other UK cellular stocks also made rapid progress, notably the Securicor group of companies, as the stock market grew more confident that BT may soon move to acquire the minority 40 per cent holding in Cellnet, the UK cellular group. BT already owns 60 per cent of Cellnet. The steep rise in BT also helped shares of Vodafone improve as institutions began to revalue UK cellular phone businesses. BT 'old' shares opened sharply higher at 393p, after terms of the McCaw/AT&amp;T deal were revealed, but later turned back to close a net 5 1/2 up at 382p. The 'new' shares opened at 293p but came off to close 5 ahead on balance at 278p. Turnover in the two stocks reached 10m and 11m shares respectively. Securicor shares extended Wednesday's excellent performance, closing a further 57 stronger at 925p. The more widely traded Securicor 'A' stock ended 58 higher at 620p after very heavy turnover of 1.6m shares. Security Services jumped 57 to 520p. Vodafone, the other UK cellular phone company, climbed 13 to 391p. Telecoms specialists viewed the McCaw sale as a good deal, with one analyst pointing out that BT had emerged with a profit and could now move towards acquiring outright control of Cellnet. 'McCaw was a big mistake by BT and they have been allowed to get off the hook with a profit, and the means to effectively swap their holding in McCaw for the rest of Cellnet,' said an analyst. BAT strong A follow-up to strong results and reassuring legal news helped BAT Industries put on one of the best performances in the FT-SE 100 Index yesterday. The shares were up 15 for most of the day and jumped a further 8 in late afternoon trading to close 23 ahead at 937p after 3.3m traded. The tobacco and insurance group's good business prospects prompted profit upgradings by many brokers. County NatWest raised its forecasts to Pounds 1.55bn from Pounds 1.5bn for 1992 and to Pounds 1.8bn from Pounds 1.7bn for 1993. Analyst Mr Simon Willis added that if the average sterling exchange rate was adjusted to Dollars 1.50 the 1993 figure would rise to Pounds 2bn. Then, in the afternoon, news broke that a smoking liability case hanging over US group Philip Morris had been withdrawn. Analysts had been sceptical for some time that the plaintiff would be able to sue successfully. Nevertheless, the possibility had cast a pall over tobacco companies with business in the US, and one sector specialist said: 'If BAT had not been so strong in the past few days it would have risen a lot more than 8 points on the news.' Rothmans International also benefited from the news, closing 13 higher at 620p. BP's third-quarter figures came as a pleasant surprise to the market, with replacement cost profits of Pounds 172m at the top end of expectations. 'This is a step in the right direction,' said Mr Nick Clayton at Smith New Court, although the analyst added: 'There is still a very long way to go.' Strauss Turnbull, a long-time bear of BP, said: 'The debt is still rising, the shares are a sell.' BP stock settled 2 higher at 225p and turnover reached 13m shares. Other oil issues came under renewed pressure as oil prices continued to lose ground. Expectations that Hanson would withdraw its bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall in the face of the higher Tomkins approach proved correct. However, Hansons' announcement came too late to affect share prices. Hanson and Tomkins rose 3 apiece to 232p and 228p respectively. RHM eased a halfpenny to 262p. Pharmaceuticals group Smith &amp; Nephew saw its heaviest turnover for at least five years, with Smith New Court said to be buying between 9m and 10m shares on behalf of an institutional client. Large blocks of shares recorded at 157p and 158 1/2 p on the Seaq electronic ticker suggested that the marketmaker had taken on stock at the lower price and placed it at the higher. The shares appreciated 4 1/2 to 157 1/2 p on final turnover of more than 17m. Dollar-earning pharmaceuticals were held back by the Clinton factor. Glaxo eased 3 to 819p, SmithKline Beecham 'A' drifted 4 to 536p and Wellcome was taken back 9 to 1009p. ICI fell in early trading on news of a fire at one of its plants in northwest England. However, the stock recovered, helped by news that its paints unit had bought a network of trade branches in France to expand its European decorative paint business, and ended a net 8 firmer at 1048p. Chemicals group Croda International was held back as Hoare Govett withdrew its buy stance on the stock. Croda closed a penny lower at 214p. TI Group gave up 15 to 292p on reports that Hoare Govett had become the latest broker to reduce its current year profits estimates. The broker is said to have advised investors to switch out of TI and into VSEL, which closed 8 better at 463p, also boosted by an order from British Gas. Industry figures showing an 8 per cent rise in October car sales helped Lex Service add 7 at 220p. Bid speculation continued in APV, helping the shares gain another 4 to 102p, with Siemens, the German heavy engineering and electricals group mentioned as a possible suitor for APV. A combination of a profits downgrade and a stock overhang sent Weir Group into retreat. The shares closed 20 down at 514p. Among leisure stocks, Rank Organisation was in demand on speculation that the company would soon announce a deal to sell its 15 provincial hotels and one in London to a private operator for around Pounds 65m. The shares jumped 19 to 619p in trade of 1.5m. Compass Group gained 4 to 459p after the company announced two acquisitions. Analysts said the purchases indicated that Compass was unlikely to restart talks to acquire Forte subsidiary Gardner Merchant. Shares in Forte responded by easing 4 to 158p.

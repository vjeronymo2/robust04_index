			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Botnar's group wins Fiat deal: AFG gains further car franchise AUTOMOTIVE and Financial Group (AFG), the motor retailer controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, has succeeded in gaining the Fiat group franchise for 25 of its dealerships. AFG is quickly becoming one of the top three multi-franchise UK dealer groups and has gained franchises from at least seven leading carmakers. The future of the group was placed at risk when Nissan UK, its sister company, lost the lucrative Nissan importer/distributor franchise at the end of last year as a consequence of the legal conflict between Mr Botnar and Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker. Mr Botnar, chairman and managing director of Automotive Financial Group Holdings, the holding company for AFG, is in Switzerland. He was abroad when a warrant was issued for his arrest by the Inland Revenue at the end of January, and he has not since returned to the UK. AFG was previously the largest UK motor retailer, with about 160 sites, but sold exclusively Nissan new vehicles. The loss of Nissan forced it to undertake drastic restructuring in an effort to find replacement franchises. The group has succeeded in refranchising at least 68 of its UK dealerships and it has emerged as the largest UK dealer group for three European carmakers - Fiat, Renault and Citroen. Under the Fiat franchise, the dealerships are largely dual franchises consisting of either Fiat-Alfa Romeo or Fiat-Lancia. AFG has also secured the Citroen franchise for 14 dealerships, Renault and Peugeot for 11 each, Vauxhall for four (with one additional dealership under discussion), Honda for two and Volkswagen/Audi for one. The restructuring of the AFG network into a multi-franchise group and the build-up by Nissan Motor of its own dealer network has caused a considerable upheaval in the UK retail motor trade. Nissan Motor's network of dealers was opened with 150 outlets at the beginning of the year and is planned to expand to a total of 250 to 270 dealers by the end of the year.</p>

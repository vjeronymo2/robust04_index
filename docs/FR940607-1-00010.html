This proposal would require the installation of retainers and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket on the center of the wing rear spar of the airplane. This proposal is prompted by an analysis conducted by the manufacturer, which revealed that failure of a lateral control mixer bracket could result in uncommanded deployment of the spoiler. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent inadvertent asymmetric deployment of the spoiler, which may lead to reduced controllability of the airplane.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by August 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;26&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

The FAA has reviewed the results of this analysis and has determined that failure of the lateral control mixer bracket could result in uncommanded deployment of the spoiler on Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes, and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes, as well as on Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes, since the brackets are designed similarly on these airplanes. This condition, if not corrected, could result in inadvertent asymmetric deployment of the spoiler, which may lead to reduced controllability of the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 27&hyph;222 [for Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10 (military) airplanes], and MD&hyph;11 Service Bulletin 27&hyph;34 (for Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes), both dated November 1, 1993, that describe procedures for installation of retainers and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket on the center of the wing rear spar of the airplane. This installation will minimize the possibility for uncommanded extension of the spoiler in the event of a bracket failure or separation from the airplane structure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require installation of retainers and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket on the center of the wing rear spar of the airplane. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the applicable service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

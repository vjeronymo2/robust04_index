			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Toyota to Change Way It Reports Sales: The Japanese auto maker broke with  industry tradition and said it would start reporting sales of both its imported  and U.S.-built cars and trucks every 10 days.  </P> <P> If other Japanese-based firms follow suit, it will mark a small victory for  Chrysler. The U.S. auto firm recently said that it would quit reporting sales  every 10 days, partly in protest against the Japanese practice of reporting  only the fast-rising sales of its U.S.-built vehicles and omitting the weaker  import sales until month's end. Chrysler had no immediate comment.  </P></p>

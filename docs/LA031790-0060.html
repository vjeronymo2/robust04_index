			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAY HIKE: A SMALL REMINDER OF PASTORAL 18TH-CENTURY CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> On the map, the new Arroyo Trabuco addition to O'Neill Regional Park in Orange  County looks inspiring. A long green finger shaped like the Mediterranean  island of Crete extends from the main part of the park all the way to Mission  Viejo. Along the bottom of a tranquil canyon a 5-mile trail beckons.  </P> <P> Alas, as many a great explorer has discovered, the map is not the territory.  O'Neill Regional Park is every bit as big and green as it is pictured on the  maps; however, the park's nicest section, Arroyo Trabuco, is almost completely  fenced off and closed to public use. Only a small part of the arroyo is open to  hikers.  </P> <P> Pending lawsuits against Orange County concerning two mountain lion attacks in  nearby Caspers Regional Park prompted the county parks department to restrict  use of wild areas, including Arroyo Trabuco. And while lawyers argue and park  planners plan, Arroyo Trabuco is being lined with subdivisions.  </P> <P> According to historical accounts, a soldier marching with Gaspar de Portola's  1769 expedition lost his firearm in this hilly region. He no doubt would be  astonished at the number of Orange County place names inspired by his mistake.  Trabuco, which means "blunderbuss" in Spanish, names a canyon, a creek, a  plain, a trail, a road and even a ranger district of the Cleveland National  Forest.  </P> <P> If that unknown soldier hiked this way again, he would be amazed at the drastic  changes in the land. But he might recognize part of Trabuco Canyon, where the  modern trekker can explore a small slice of the pastoral Southern California of  two centuries ago.  </P> <P> A good way to learn about the ecology of Trabuco Canyon is to walk the park's  nature trail. Trabuco Creek Trail, with stops keyed to a pamphlet available at  the park's entry station, meanders through an oak and sycamore woodland and  explores Plano Trabuco, or Trabuco Flat, a level alluvial surface deposited by  runoff from the Santa Ana Mountains.  </P> <P> Directions to trailhead:: From the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 5) in El Toro,  exit on El Toro Road and drive 7 1/2 miles to Live Oak Canyon Road. Turn right  and proceed 3 miles to O'Neill Regional Park. There is a $2 vehicle entry fee.  </P> <P> Visitors are asked to sign a Park Use Permit and Waiver of Liability. Anyone  under 18 must be supervised by an adult.  </P> <P> Park in the day-use lot near the entrance. Cross the usually dry Trabuco Creek  over a cement spillway and pick up the signed trail on the far bank.  </P> <P> The hike: The nature trail explores what botanists call a riparian area,  characterized by the lush growth of creek-side vegetation. You'll walk under  oaks and sycamores and be treated to a view of the twin mile-high peaks of Old  Saddleback -- Mt. Modjeska and Mt. Santiago.  </P> <P> Trabuco Creek, which relies on winter rains for replenishment, is dry this  year. During a wet year, Trabuco Creek flows from its headwaters on the  shoulders of Old Saddleback about 40 miles through Trabuco Canyon and southern  Orange County to its confluence with San Juan Creek, 2 1/2 miles from the  Pacific.  </P> <P> At signpost No. 17 of the nature trail, you can leave the loop and continue up  creek. The arroyo opens up and you get a good view to the south of Trabuco Flat  -- a mesa sculpted by the floodwaters of Arroyo Trabuco. On weekdays, the  intrusive sounds of bulldozers and construction -- from more than 2 miles away  -- resound through the canyon.  </P> <P> The trail joins a man-made berm on the left side of the arroyo. You can step  off the trail to a picnic area near the group camps or continue to the Live Oak  Canyon Road bridge. Return the same way.  </P> <P> TRABUCO CREEK TRAIL: 2 miles round trip through O'Neill Regional Park  </P></p>

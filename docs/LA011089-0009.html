			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NURSING CRISIS  </P> <P> In response to the editorial "Curing the Nurse Shortage" (Dec. 29), I disagree  with the "experts who prepared the constructive report for the U.S. Department  of Health Services."  </P> <P> The commission's finding that the "money matters most" is wrong. The fact is  that money cannot replace the decrease in a caring attitude toward patients.  However, in addition to the change in attitude, it is important that nurses  have "professional recognition, representation on policy-making, regulatory and  accreditation boards, and the use of a more collaborative approach between  nurses and other health professionals and the management."  </P> <P> The hot-line effort to inform men and women about nursing career opportunities  should include one very important question: Does the person, who is inquiring,  really understand the meaning of the four-letter word care?  </P> <P> ESTHER KAHAN  </P> <P> Rolling Hills Estates  </P></p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): How the model works Consumers are asked questions to tease out their satisfaction and commitment to all the leading brands in a given category. Each consumer emerges with one of many hundreds of possible combinations of answers. These are number-crunched to create a matrix. Sophisticated mathematical models, using catastrophe theory (which identifies the cusp where gradual changes stop, and a leap to a new state occurs) are then applied to break out clusters of different types of consumer, such as 'entrenched' or 'convertible'. At the same time, attitudes towards each brand's strengths and weaknesses are gathered. Perceptual maps, profiling the different attitudes of purchasers and non-purchasers, pinpoint why consumers are staying loyal or defecting, and suggest where marketing effort needs to be directed. To test the model, a US tobacco company analysed the US cigarette market in June 1990. Two and a half years later, it recontacted the 2,478 consumers it had questioned. Despite price changes and volatility in the market, only 32 per cent of the 'entrenched' consumers had switched brands, compared with 79 per cent of those identified as 'convertible'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dries Vermeulen] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 6 SAPA -- African National  Congress National Executive Committee member and former Youth  League chief Peter Mokaba says the ANC will march into the  kwaZulu capital of Ulundi to show that it is not afraid of  Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.    SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news on  Wednesday [6 April] reported Mr Mokaba as saying his  organisation was becoming tired of listening to demands made by  Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. The king would end up with  nothing if he continued to be used, as Mr Mokaba put it, by Mr  Buthelezi.    Mr Buthelezi should learn from the events in Bophuthatswana,  he said.    Referring to the recent killing of Zulu people at the ANC's  national headquarters in Johannesburg, Mr Mokaba blamed Mr  Buthelezi for allegedly sending his people to the building.    Meanwhile, the ANC Youth League's [ANCYL] Executive is  apparently discussing plans to isolate the IFP, kwaZulu leaders  and to bring about the withdrawal of the kwaZulu Police force.    This according to ANCYL Executive Committee member Lassy  Chiwayo. Mr Chiwayo said ANCYL would never accept the  postponement of elections. He went on to urge ANC youth to be  disciplined and to respect the democratic right of others to  conduct election campaigns.</p>

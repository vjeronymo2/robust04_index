			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Australian insurer to step up Kemper link QBE, the Australian general insurer, is stepping up its links with Chicago-based Kemper International through a new joint venture in the Asia-Pacific region and a strategic alliance under which both companies would provide reciprocal services for multinational clients. Kemper International is the international arm of Chicago-based Kemper National Insurance Companies, the 13th largest property casualty insurer in the US, and former parent of Kemper Corporation, the listed financial services group. The joint venture company will provide engineering and loss control services throughout Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific islands, and will begin operating during the first quarter of 1995. Under the new strategic alliance, QBE will administer Kemper's licence in Australia and service some of its global direct insurance requirements. QBE, which has representation in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Hong Kong, added that it planned to set up a new 'global accounts' division as a result of the new alliance. This will take in the local portfolio of Kemper in Australia, and aim to service national accounts, exporters, and multinationals requiring risk management services. Existing Kemper staff are being offered jobs with either the joint venture company or with QBE's new division.</p>

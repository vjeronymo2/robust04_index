			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Social housing in Hackney Hackney Borough Council has selected LAING HOMES SPECIAL PROJECTS as development partners for London's largest social housing project to date. The Pounds 64m scheme will see the transformation over the next five years of the Holly Street Estate in Hackney and provide 1,050 new and refurbished homes. System-built in the early 1970s, the estate achieved notoriety for its multiple social, economic and environmental problems. Now this is all set to change with the proposed new and refurbished homes constructed following traditional Victorian street patterns, and offering predominately low-rise accommodation with gardens. Tenure will be mixed. The Council will retain some properties for rent, while the majority will be managed by a consortium of housing associations. One hundred new homes will be set aside for the elderly, including those needing sheltered accommmodation, and for people with special needs. In addition 218 properties will be offered for sale and there will also be some self-build projects. A training centre for construction and other skills will be established with a target to create 200 permanent jobs during the lifetime of the project. Demolition works for the project will commence towards the end of 1993. Funding will be provided by the Department of the Environment for City Challenge and Estate Action, the Housing Corporation and from private sales.</p>

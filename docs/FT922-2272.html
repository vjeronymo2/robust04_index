			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Philippine winner to be proclaimed THE proclamation of Mr Fidel Ramos as winner in the May 11 Philippine presidential election is expected to take place next Wednesday. Mr Ramos, a former defence secretary, gained the biggest number of votes in the count completed around midnight on Tuesday by Congress. A committee is now preparing a final report to be presented to a joint session next week which will proclaim the winner. Also to be proclaimed by Congress is the winning candidate for vice-president, Mr Joseph Estrada, a former member of the Senate who originally gained popularity as a film actor. In the past few days Mr Ramos has been holding meetings with business and church leaders and with some of his leading opponents in the election. Mr Ramos, who was supported during the campaign by outgoing President Corazon Aquino, ended up with more than 874,000 votes ahead of Mrs Miriam Defensor Santiago, the combative former immigration commissioner. Members of Congress sympathetic to Mrs Santiago are expected to seek to delay next week's proclamation proceedings. Mrs Santiago has vowed to round up support among the youth in protesting at the election results. In third place was Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, business tycoon and a well-known associate of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Mr Cojuangco trailed Mr Ramos by 1.22m votes and Mrs Santiago by some 351,000 votes. Mr Ramos won 5.34m votes, representing 23.6 per cent of the total number of votes counted.</p>

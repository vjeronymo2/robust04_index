			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Key terms and issues in debate UNIVERSAL COVERAGE: The bottom line of the original Clinton plan was health cover for all Americans, the only exceptions being specific social or religious groups with objections to inclusion. Of the four congressional committees that approved versions of healthcare legislation, only the influential Senate finance committee rejected this demand. It opted instead for a target of 95 per cent population cover by 2002. A commission would recommend mandatory measures if this target were not met. However, the Senate in particular may take its lead from the committee's failure to back universal coverage and President Clinton has now signalled flexibility. EMPLOYER MANDATE: Another cornerstone of the Clinton plan, this requires employers to pay the bulk of their workers' health insurance costs - 80 per cent in the administration's proposals. However, the Senate finance committee also rejected this concept, again prompting Mr Clinton to hint at compromise. Joint employer/employee mandates have been floated as a way of resolving this toughest question in healthcare reform - who pays? COST CONTROLS: All the versions of healthcare reform legislation approved by congressional committees envisage some form of cost containment measures, such as taxes on expensive premiums, fee schedules and cost targets or outright caps on how much premiums can be raised each year. TAXATION: Apart from employer and employee mandates, extra taxes have been proposed to pay for health reform. These include extra taxes on cigarettes, guns and ammunition, and assessments on some big employers. HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANISATIONS: Organisations which offer consumers a range of health benefits for an annual fee, largely using medical practitioners under contract. Consolidation in the healthcare industry and consumers' desire to cut costs are strengthening the HMOs independently of the progress of healthcare reform legislation. FEE-FOR-SERVICE: The traditional American way of doing medicine, where doctors are paid by patients or their insurers for each consultation or treatment. Specialist (and therefore expensive) doctors are already coming under pressure from the HMOs and the more standardised cover they offer. INSURANCE MARKET REFORM: Under all the bills voted out of congressional committees, insurers will be required to sell a standard benefits package. Measures are also planned to prevent insurers discriminating against the old and the sick. MEDICARE AND MEDICAID: Existing government health programmes for the elderly and the poor respectively. Current versions of reform legislation envisage the abolition of Medicaid as beneficiaries take up insurance elsewhere, with the government picking up the tab. The House Ways and Means committee approved a massive extension of Medicare to those who could not buy insurance elsewhere. ABORTION: A divisive issue both in and out of Congress that could sink reform altogether. The administration wants abortion cover included in the standard package of healthcare benefits, but the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, which supports health reform, has vowed to fight on this issue.</p>

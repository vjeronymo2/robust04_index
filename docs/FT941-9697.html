			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / New plans for Milk Marque Farmers signed up with Milk Marque, the voluntary co-operative to be formed when the Milk Marketing Board is abolished later this year, have been given a cooling-off period to change their minds. The board yesterday submitted new plans for its reorganisation after the government had rejected its previous proposals because it said they would give Milk Marque too dominant a position. The board said that when the plan was approved farmers would have two weeks to reconsider their position.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Bringing maturity to swashbuckling Sun / A look at changes planned by Phillip Samper For a company with a reputation for the kind of brashness and aggression that frightens the giants of the computer industry, Sun Microsystems has been uncommonly quiet of late. That should change once Phillip Samper, appointed president of Sun's computer systems division (SMCC) at the beginning of the year, gets his business strategy for the division up and running. Multimedia and networking are important elements in his plans. Sun, a California-based workstation manufacturer, is already a key contributor to the Internet, the global web of interconnected computers and computer networks which has some 25m users. Sun was an early adopter of the rules which have to be followed to transmit data on the Internet. As a consequence, it reckons that as much as 56 per cent of Internet traffic runs on its computers, while most of the software written to help users find their way round the network - applications with names like Mosaic, Archie and Gopher - was developed on Sun systems. The potential of the Internet, however, is often lost on users who find the business of making the connection difficult, expensive and time-consuming. Last week, Sun announced new kinds of computers that it describes as Internet servers which will make it easy for untrained users to find their way on to and around the Internet. The servers - microcomputers costing between Pounds 6,000 and Pounds 13,500 - essentially take the user step-by-step through the connection process. Sun has been a pioneer in exploiting the commercial possibilities of the Internet and is a member of CommerceNet, an industry consortium working on the creation of an electronic marketplace over the Net. Now live, it is expected to offer electronic shopping and banking soon. There is a less serious side to Sun's Internet activities: recently it worked with Thinking Pictures, a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab, to create an Internet database for the Rolling Stones' 'Voodoo Lounge' concert tour. Stored on the database are concert dates, video and audio clips of the band at work, and a library of photographs. SMCC is Sun's principal operating division, a company with no scruples about telling larger competitors like International Business Machines and Digital Equipment that it intends to grow by eating their lunch (taking market share from them). Scott McNealy, founder and chairman, relishes what he describes as the company's 'in-your-face' attitude. Samper is more moderate. He calls it 'swashbuckling'. He is not the most obvious choice as leader of a technical workstation manufacturer. Fifty nine in February, he was formerly vice-chairman of Eastman Kodak. During his 28 years with Kodak he led the photographic and information management division and managed Kodak's operations internationally. He does, however, have experience as a purchaser and user of corporate computer systems, and has been on Sun's board of directors since 1991. Kodak was at one point an investor in Sun. The company is at a critical point in its development. Founded in 1982, Sun grew rapidly and profitably through the 1980s by building workstations - hugely powerful personal computers used by scientists and engineers - that were demonstrably faster than the competition. The secret was a microprocessor chip called 'Sparc'. Today, Sun is still the leader in workstations with a 37.8 per cent share of the market - ahead of Hewlett-Packard (19.6 per cent) and DEC (11.1 per cent). Analysts worry, however, that other chips such as 'PowerPC' from IBM and 'Alpha' from DEC have leap-frogged ahead of Sparc. One answer from the Californian company has been to seek an extensive alliance with Fujitsu of Japan - a world leader in chip manufacturing technology - to design and build faster and better versions of Sparc. Samper, however, believes that management changes are just as important, as the company moves past the psychologically important Dollars 5bn revenue point. 'We have to find ways of keeping the spirit of a small company with the management structure of a large one,' he says. He makes two comments: 'First, Sun has to understand the global market better. Silicon Valley companies often have two problems - understanding there is a US market outside Silicon Valley and understanding there is a world market outside the US. Second, Sun needs a different approach to marketing and in particular to advertising and public relations.' At present, it spends only Dollars 15m or Dollars 20m a year on advertising and the like: a relic of Sun's origins in technical computing where recommendations were passed on by word of mouth. Competitors spend up to 10 times more, and Samper is anxious to see a substantial increase in Sun's advertising budget. His principal role, however, is to inject experience and maturity into a young and ambitious management team. 'We have to learn that swashbuckling is not the answer to business; business is the answer to business.' He argues that executives in fast-growing companies become expert at fire fighting but do not spent enough time on fire prevention. An example: the financial hiccough Sun suffered around the turn of the decade when, of all things, its computer-based accounting system proved inadequate. The problem has been rectified and the new system is continually upgraded. 'God willing, we will never have that problem again,' says Semper with feeling. He believes that Sun will be a leader in each of the key technologies over the next few years. He argues, for example, that the likely winners of the microprocessor wars will be Intel (probably in conjunction with Hewlett Packard), IBM, Motorola and Apple with PowerPC and the Sun Sparc. In operating systems, Microsoft will be represented by Windows NT or a variant, IBM by OS/2 and Sun by Solaris, thepackaged version of Sun's Unix operating software. In the key area of object-oriented technology, which many see as the future of computer programming, there will be Microsoft's Cairo, Taligent from IBM, Apple and Hewlett Packard and NextStep from Steve Jobs' Next group. Sun has a 10 per cent stake in Next. However, the low-margin PC business is one battlefield that Sun seems unlikely to invade. 'We keep looking at PCs, but I have to be certain we can make money there,' says Semper.</p>

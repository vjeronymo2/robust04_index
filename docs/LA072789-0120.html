			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACLU CHARGES HARASSMENT OF AIDS ACTIVISTS  </P> <P> The American Civil Liberties Union on Wednesday accused the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department of harassing AIDS activists in an effort to silence  critics of the county's AIDS policies.  </P> <P> In a seven-page letter to Sheriff Sherman Block, ACLU attorneys demanded an end  to alleged searches and surveillance of members of the AIDS Coalition to  Unleash Power/Los Angeles (ACT UP/LA).  </P> <P> "We are asking that the Sheriff's Department stop harassing people based on  their lawful political activism," said ACLU attorney Jon Davidson. "If police  are allowed to intimidate and harass people who protest government action, then  all people who complain about the actions of politicians are in danger."  </P> <P> Davidson charged that sheriff's deputies have been covertly photographing  participants in AIDS demonstrations and have followed and illegally searched  the car of an ACT UP/LA member without producing a warrant.  </P> <P> Davidson said he based his allegations on discussions with AIDS activists. He  demanded in the letter that the sheriff, under the California Public Records  Act, turn over all documents relating to searches and surveillance of coalition  members.  </P> <P> Block was unavailable for comment Wednesday. A spokesman declined to comment on  specific charges contained in the letter, but issued a brief statement noting  that the department recently completed an investigation resulting in  misdemeanor charges against three members of the group for allegedly spraying  graffiti on county buildings.  </P> <P> Davidson called the charges groundless and said they were "further evidence of  an attempt by the county to suppress speech critical of its inaction in the  face of the AIDS crisis."  </P> <P> AIDS activists have accused the Board of Supervisors of lacking commitment in  the fight against the disease. But members of of ACT UP/LA have denied that the  group was responsible for the vandalism.  </P> <P> "Regardless of whether or not a few individuals who happen to be members of ACT  UP/LA participated in painting graffiti on county buildings, there was and  continues to be no ground to investigate other ACT UP/LA members or to harass  the organization or its members," Davidson said in the letter.  </P> <P> Davidson said in an interview that if the harassment continues, he will  consider filing suit against the sheriff alleging violations of the AIDS  activists' civil rights. He said the suit could result in civil penalties  against the sheriff and the county.  </P> <P> The ACLU lawyer said he wrote the letter after being contacted by members of  the AIDS coalition.  </P> <P> He said the harassment has included sheriff's deputies "surreptitiously  monitoring and photographing numerous ACT UP/LA lawful demonstrations and press  conferences," detaining and following ACT UP/LA members and searching an ACT  UP/LA member's car "without his or anyone else's consent and without showing a  search warrant to anyone."  </P></p>

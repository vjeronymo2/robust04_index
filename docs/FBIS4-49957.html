			<p>BFN     [Text] In his office on the afternoon of 5 May, Ruan  Chongwu, provincial party secretary and governor, listened to a  report submitted by the provincial industrial department. He  made detailed inquiries about enterprises' production and  operation, technical transformation, reforms, and so on. He  also issued instructions on accelerating the pace of industrial  development.    Ruan Chongwu pointed out: At present, funding remains the  primary problem facing industrial production. Since the  beginning of this year, there has been a tight money supply for  enterprises in general. In particular, they have faced  difficulties in obtaining circulating funds. To solve the  funding problem, the key lies in inviting foreign investments.  Departments in charge of industry and enterprises must exert  great efforts to make use of foreign capital. With regard to  making use of foreign capital, we can invigorate our original  capital through equity transactions.    Ruan Chongwu emphasized: Our province's industrial technical  level is low, and our industrial scale is small. To develop our  industry, we must carry out large projects, especially those  projects that can make full use of our province's strong points  in natural resources -- such as oil refining; the petrochemical  industry; the building materials industry, which includes  ceramics, glass, cement, and bricks; as well as tropical crops;  and the aquatic products processing industry. These projects  promise high hopes of success. As long as we succeed in  carrying out these large projects, our industry can be pushed to  new heights. As long as our products are marketable, we can  promote these projects. In particular, there is a big market  for natural drinks. On the one hand, we must develop new  products on a large scale. On the other, we must improve  packaging. The problem of funds arising in the new, large  projects also can be solved by inviting foreign investment and  by making use of foreign capital.    As for enterprise reform, Ruan Chongwu stressed: The pace of  enterprise reform must be accelerated. In state-owned  enterprises, it is necessary to actively promote reform in the  corporation system, with the emphasis on the system of  limited-liability shareholding companies. This is the key to  transforming the operational mechanisms of enterprises and  enhancing their vigor. While carrying out enterprise reform, we  must thoroughly solve the problems of enterprises' leadership  mechanisms, efficiency, and contributions to society. It is  very important to choose managers and factory directors well.  Government departments must standardize their conduct and  refrain from exercising excessive control over enterprises or  interfering too much in own their affairs. The Industrial  Department and a sugar plant held a meeting to discuss the way  to separate the surplus labor force from the plant. It was good  and necessary to do so.    In conclusion, Ruan Chongwu emphasized: Without exception,  enterprises in Hainan -- whether they are covered by the  provincial budget or belong to any ownership system -- are  treated equally. The provincial industrial department is the  unit responsible for all industries in the province. It must  serve all industrial enterprises so as to jointly promote the  great development of Hainan's industry.</p>

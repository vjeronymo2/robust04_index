			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Further arrests in Milan bribery inquiry MILAN magistrates investigating misuse of public funds yesterday ordered arrests linked to reconstruction work in an alpine valley devastated by floods six years ago, Reuter reports from Milan. The magistrates ordered the arrest of two construction company owners and two officials of the state road-building agency Anas on corruption charges linked to the 1987 Valtellina disaster. Fifty-three people were killed when a flood swept away two villages in the Valtellina, a valley north-east of Milan. Damage was estimated at L3,000bn (Pounds 1.3bn) and 1,500 people were left homeless in one of Milan's favourite weekend haunts. The Italian government set in motion massive reconstruction projects after the disaster. In southern Italy, magistrates have revived separate inquiries about allegations of large-scale fraud over rebuilding work after a 1980 earthquake that killed 3,000 people in the Irpinia region, east of Naples. Investigations into the Irpinia scandal had made no progress for years despite a damning parliamentary inquiry led by Italy's current head of state, Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, then an MP. The Milan investigations into widespread collusion between politicians and businessmen, however, have spawned a host of similar inquiries in the rest of Italy over the last year and once again turned the spotlight on the Irpinia earthquake. A former prime minister, Mr Ciriaco De Mita, resigned on Tuesday as the man charged with revamping Italy's chaotic political system after the Christian Democrat politician's brother was arrested in connection with alleged fraud in the Irpinia case. The parliamentary committee that Mr De Mita chaired yesterday overwhelmingly rejected his resignation, but the former prime minister asked for more time to decide his future. While the scope of corruption investigations continued to broaden, the Italian parliament delayed a decision on waiving immunity on Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader. The delay was caused by new evidence which parliament wished to study. This centred on allegations made by Mr Claudio Martelli, the former justice minister and one-time political associate of Mr Craxi, that the latter had personally been involved in collecting illicit contributions for the party. Magistrates in Rome and several other cities have been investigating for at least two months the activities of Anas during the 1980s. Road building accounts for 10 per cent of the annual L30,000bn budget for public works contracts. Some arrests had already been made, but yesterday's moves underscored the extent of the investigation.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Arts: Richard Alston in La Rochelle - Dance Richard Alston, late of the Rambert Dance Company, is the best choreographer we Britons have - even though we do not now know where we will find him next. All around us dance is straining against its nature - towards heavy-footedness, expressionism, mime routine, or academicism - but Alston just keeps making real dances. This seems an old-fashioned virtue now, but it is a true one. And it is the reason why, not long ago, he seemed our modern dance's brightest pioneer. Noone since Ashton has done more to establish a British dance style. Alston is also exceptionally musical. Sometimes he has tried the wrong music  -scores too ineffable (Mozart) or too weak (Steve Reich) - and this was the main flaw in his work for the Rambert during his last four years there (1989-92). But when music inspires him, there is no choreographer alive who can better illuminate his score. Just as Balanchine's dances taught thousands of dance-goers (even some music critics) how to hear and love Stravinsky and Hindemith, so Alston has taught many of us to concentrate with pleasure on Charles Amirkhanian, Nigel Osborne, Simon Waters, Peter Maxwell Davies. Music and dance are different elements; Alston is one of those rare alchemists who can fuse them to create a sum larger than the parts. It is our loss than his latest work was made in the much better-subsidised dance terrain of France. Le Marteau sans maitre, to Pierre Boulez's eponymous score, has been created in La Rochelle, in rehearsal conditions that any British troupe should envy, for the Compagnie Chopinot. Boulez's long score (40 minutes) passes through a wide variety of tempo and sound (soprano, percussion, wind, strings, in different combinations), and has stimulated Alston to fashion a rich, constantly shifting, line of dances - as if Boulez has created a whole gallery and Alston were showing us room after room. And because this is music through which whole currents of world music seems to pass (Oriental, African, Schoenberg, Satie, Cage), the dance seems alert too to wide currents of history and culture. Everything has texture. Apart from his musical gifts, Alston has an exceptional flair for showing the body to maximum 3-D effect The effect is sculptural, but not static; motion is implicit even in the choreography's stillnesses. The work is structured to emphasise male-female duets and differences between male and female styles; Alston is not telling stories or illustrating the enigmatic Rene Char poems that form the music's text, but he is allowing a large structural tension to evolve poetically. (All of which illumines the score.) As the piece reaches its conclusion, Chopinot herself and Georgette Louison Kala-Lobe (her real-life sister) meet - first with, then without, their partners. The effect is poignant, and the piece ends on Chopinot alone, moving between shadows and light. Le Marteau is part of an Alston double bill; the other work is a revival of his 1977 Rainbow Bandit, originally made on London Contemporary Dance Theatre, in which Gerard Boucher's lighting emphasises the abstract drama behind the work. 'Le Marteau sans maitre' is being toured in France by Compagnie Chopinot until June. Richard Alston is one of the four choreographers featured in Part Two of 'Striding Out - Aspects of Contemporary and New Dance in Britain,' by Stephanie Jordan (Dance Books, Pounds 10)</p>

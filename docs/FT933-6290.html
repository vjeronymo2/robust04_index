			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / International Company News: SCA to raise SKr1.4bn after surge in profits SCA, Sweden's second largest forestry group, yesterday became the latest Swedish company to announce a large rights issue as it unveiled a dramatic jump in first-half profits to SKr550m (Dollars 68.1m) from SKr94m. The group is seeking to raise SKr1.4bn to fund SKr3bn in new investments. Its biggest investment will be in a newsprint plant at Aylesford in south-east England where its share of a SKr3bn expansion project is expected to cost SKr1.5bn. SCA also plans to convert a newsprint machine in Sweden to higher quality coated paper production at a cost of SKr1.25bn and to spend SKr350m on adding recycling capacity to a plant in Austria. The group said cost-cutting, the weaker Swedish krona and volume growth lay behind its improved first-half result which was achieved on a 7 per cent increase in net sales to SKr16.75bn. It noted that all its paper mills were profitable, but its Swedish pulp mill remained in the red. The biggest turnround was achieved by SCA Graphic Paper, which swung to an operating profit of SKr56m from a SKr159m loss, while its Molnlycke hygiene division strengthened operating profits to SKr530m from SKr355m. SCA was cautious about prospects, noting that economic trends in the US and Europe had developed less favourably than it had hoped. It now expects a full-year profit of between SKr1.1bn and SKr1.3bn, a refinement of its earlier prediction of a SKr1bn to SKr1.5bn profit. SCA is the fourth big Swedish group to announce a rights issue in the last two weeks, following forestry sector rival MoDo and two of the country's leading banks. Worries that the spate of new issues is beginning to soak up market liquidity together with the company's cautious tone about prospects contributed to a slight easing of its share price, which fell SKr2 to SKr129. SCA said it hopes shortly to finalise a joint venture with Mondi Europe, largely owned by South African interests, to expand newsprint production capacity at Aylesford.</p>

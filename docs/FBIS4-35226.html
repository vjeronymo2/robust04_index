			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 29 May (INA)--President Saddam Husayn has  chaired a joint meeting of the Revolution Command Council [RCC]  and the Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party.    An official spokesman made the following statement after the  meeting:    The joint meeting of the RCC and the Iraq Command of the  Arab  Socialist Ba'th Party discussed the report which Tariq 'Aziz,  member of the RCC and deputy prime minister, submitted to the  meeting regarding the recent session of the UN Security Council.    The joint meeting asserted that the positive positions  expressed during last March's session have been strengthened and  have increased the number of Security Council member states that  voice a positive position toward Iraq and call for lifting the  unjust blockade imposed on it.    It is now obvious that the overwhelming majority of the  Security Council member states call for acknowledging the  progress made in applying Security Council resolutions and for  the need to discuss the lifting of the blockade as soon as  possible. It has also become clear that the U.S. position is  the principal obstacle to lifting the blockade for reasons that  have nothing to do with the Security Council's resolutions, that  this position has been isolated in the Security Council and is  not supported by the majority of the Security Council's member  states, and that U.S. statements on the continuation of the  blockade and postponing plans to lift it express nervousness  caused by the isolation of the U.S. position in the Security  Council and the international community, which is stepping up  its demand that the unjust blockade, which has begun to  embarrass the U.S. position inside and outside the Security  Council, be lifted.    The spokesman said: The leadership in Iraq highly values the  states which adopted a fair position during the Council's  debates, especially Russia, France, China, Brazil, Spain,  Pakistan, Nigeria, and other states in the Council.    The spokesman appealed to these states and the international  community in general to strengthen and develop their position  and work persistently to lift the unjust blockade.    A plan has been drawn up to continue contacts with these  states, as well as with Arab and international sides during the  coming period.    The meeting was attended by Hatim Hamdan al-'Azzawi, chief  of  the Presidential Office.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Military Communique No. 23 issued by the Defense Ministry] </F>   [Text] Our heroic armed forces continued their operations  with high morale yesterday and today. They succeeded in foiling  repeated assaults by the forces of the al-Ahmar gang, and  delivered deadly blows to those forces in the depths of their  defensive positions, with the help of almighty God and by virtue  of the determination of the fighters, who arise from the just  cause they are defending and their certainty of winning a clear  victory.    As this military communique was being written, our forces  were delivering crushing blows to the hostile forces in the area  around Kirsh, inflicting vast casualties, and forcing them to  retreat and surrender. On the Abyan axis, our heroic forces are  continuing their pursuit of remnants of hostile forces, and are  mopping up the remaining pockets of resistance.    This morning our forces foiled every desperate assault made  by units from the scattered hostile forces. Our forces  inflicted major defeats on these forces, to the satisfaction of  our heroic fighters and the good and loyal inhabitants of Abyan,  who face the prospect of certain victory in this destructive war  -- unleashed against our people in the southern governorates by  the bloody, fascist al-Ahmar gang.</p>

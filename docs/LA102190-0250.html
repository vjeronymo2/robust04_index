			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TURN IN, TUNE ON, SPEAK OUT  </P> <P> Here are the responses to the Sept. 30 question: What did you think of the  season's first episode of 'Twin Peaks'?  </P> <P> I am obsessed with "Twin Peaks." I think it is the best series there ever was  in the world. All the actors are wonderful and exciting. The show is soooooooo  exciting, and you always are never sure who the killer is. I hope the series  never ends. Agent Cooper is the prize of the show. He's wonderful. "Twin Peaks"  should go all the way.  </P> <P> Erin Evarts, Camarillo  </P> <P> Sorry to say I was very disappointed in the season debut of "Twin Peaks." I  thought it was very boring; in fact I fell asleep. "Twin Peaks" started out  very good but got too involved and too complicated to keep up with the plot.  So, I give up.  </P> <P> Gail V. Schmitt, Costa Mesa  </P> <P> I am obsessed with ABC's mystery series "Twin Peaks." I think and dream "Twin  Peaks." I drive my parents crazy with 'Peaks talk. After watching Sunday's  season opener, I was even more in awe! This brilliant (David) Lynch series is  full of fabulous acting, fabulous directing and fabulous writing.(I guess I  would say it's fabulous.) As a "Twin Peaks" fan, I just want to say keep up the  good work and Agent Cooper, stay strange.  </P> <P> Jessica L. Rosenthal, Agoura Hills  </P> <P> I suppose I, like a lot of people, have a "love-hate" relationship with "Twin  Peaks." Immediately after the two-hour premiere was over, I proclaimed that I  was finished watching "Twin Peaks" forever. The producers had strung me along  for another two hours, and thrown in some disturbing gratuitous weirdness that  is becoming older by the minute.  </P> <P> But the real problem is that after a sleepless night filled with thoughts of  Bob, smiling bags and mysterious giants, I found myself ready to go through it  again.  </P> <P> There is something addictive about "Twin Peaks." No matter how frightening it  is or how frustrating its vague answers are, the viewer feels that he must go  back to "Twin Peaks" again.  </P> <P> And yes -- I'll be there next Saturday night, and the next -- to go through the  whole cycle all over once more.  </P> <P> Lauren Walden, Orange  </P> <P> "Twin Peaks" grabs my attention, it compares to no other show on TV. Forget  about who killed Laura Palmer. If they don't tell us soon, we're going to  forget about her. Besides, there's so much more going on to keep us busy.  </P> <P> Glady Mills, Northridge  </P> <P> I was satisfied with the season premiere of "Twin Peaks." As usual, Agent  Cooper was the highlight of the show. It was especially nice to see Albert  Rosenfield again. That dim-witted butler who served Cooper's warm milk got on  my nerves. Good job, Lynch and Frost.  </P> <P> Tommy Jung, Cypress  </P> <P> "Twin Peaks" continues to be a real thriller -- a production which keeps you on  the edge of your seat. I actually almost jumped out of mine Sunday night.  </P> <P> Charra de Marco, Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Unlikely allies make a connection - FT writers look at yesterday's three-way global telecoms link-up Few of the world's larger telecommunications operators are more dissimilar than Sprint and the French and German state companies. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are state-owned national monopolies. Sprint, with revenues barely a third as large as its new German partner, has fought former monopolists every day of its life, in the process building an impressive international portfolio. Yet for all three companies, yesterday's alliance was the answer to a similar problem: how to become a serious challenger in the emerging market for one-stop international telecoms services. For France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, the deal satisfies a long-held desire to find a US partner to strengthen their international expansion and their position in the large corporate sector ahead of the liberalisation of the European telecommunications market in 1998. Sprint's existing client base among multinationals, its modern data network and its brand name are seen as valuable assets. The French and German operators signed an Ecu1bn (Dollars 862m) alliance last December to strengthen their existing 'Eunetcom' joint venture to provide corporate services. A US deal was the next vital step. However, for both European companies it is far from the last step. Yesterday, Mr Marcel Roulet, chairman of France Telecom, spoke of extending the agreement to include new partners in the Asia-Pacific region. Although he declined to mention the potential partners, NTT, the largest Japanese operator, is a possibility. Mr Roulet was at pains to stress that the Sprint deal was consistent with his company's existing investment plans, and could be financed through cashflow or borrowings. Neither, he said, would it undermine France Telecom's policy of reducing its financial charges. The aim is to cut financial charges to 3 per cent of sales by 1998, compared with the current level of just under 7 per cent. France Telecom's status as an 'autonomous operator under public law' has ruled out the exchange of shares to seal alliances. Last year, the French government announced plans to convert the operator into a state-owned joint stock company. But strong opposition from its 155,000 employees forced a retreat. Mr Roulet is trying to persuade his staff of the need for reform. However, privatisation remains a distant prospect. So too, therefore, is the prospect of a cross-shareholding with Sprint. Yesterday's deal, then, seems unlikely to accelerate France Telecom's entry into the private sector. Mr Roulet and Mr Helmut Ricke, his German counterpart, also played down the prospect of a more rapid liberalisation of the Franco-German voice telecommunications market as a condition for regulatory approval. Deutsche Telekom has already been expanding rapidly eastwards. Last year, it took a 30 per cent stake in Matav, the Hungarian state-owned telecommunications group, which it bought with Ameritech of the US for Dollars 875m. It also has a stake in Astra, the international satellite television company, and a share in mobile and fixed networks in Russia and Ukraine. The operator also has EU ambitions: it has just joined the Spanish Cometa consortium bidding for a mobile telephone licence in Spain. However, Deutsche Telekom's internal problems are just as pressing as those of its French partner. It is in tough talks with the postal union which may threaten the next stage of privatisation, the creation of a joint stock company by January 1 1995. Mr Ricke said the company would 'have considerable difficulties' finding the DM1.75bn (Dollars 1.1bn) it needs to finance the purchase of an 11.1 per cent stake in Sprint, the first tranche of a two-stage operation to give the French and German companies 20 per cent of Sprint. The money had, however, been set aside in the company's medium-term financial plan. 'Even if it (privatisation) does fail, this project will be safeguarded,' said Mr Ricke. Unless Mr Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition can persuade the opposition Social Democrats to vote in favour of privatisation before June 29, it will be impossible to meet the existing privatisation deadline, since privatisation requires a two-thirds parliamentary majority to be approved. That may not overturn the Sprint deal, but it will make its extension problematic. For Sprint, the European alliance offers added credibility and financial muscle, as it tries to attract business from multi-national companies in the fast-growing global market. Sprint is the smallest of America's three long-distance telecommunications groups, with a market share of around 9.5 per cent compared with the 19 per cent held by MCI and some 60 per cent by AT&amp;T. A tie-up with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom links it with the dominant carriers in two countries which contain some 14 per cent of the world's multinationals. With a further 29 per cent located in the US, that gives the alliance a potential market of nearly 50 per cent of the world's leading companies before it starts the harder task of winning business in other countries. Sprint already has a substantial presence in the international market for corporate data traffic through SprintNet, one of the world's leading leading data networks. SprintNet's operations outside the US will be injected into the global partnership with the French and Germans. Mr Bill Esrey, Sprint's chairman, yesterday highlighted two probable uses for the Dollars 4bn of new equity Sprint is raising. Some will be earmarked to pay down debt. Sprint also plans to use the money on new investments, notably a planned alliance with other US wireless service providers to create a seamless national mobile telephone network. As part of this scheme, Sprint plans to bid for US licences for a new system of mobile telephony - personal communications services (PCS) - being auctioned at the end of this year.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Observer: Crass commercial Gasps of astonishment from assembled and hard-bitten hacks greeted Benetton's attempts yesterday in London to justify its latest foray into the wilder Fellini-esque reaches of advertising bad taste. Luciano Benetton, a founder of the Italian clothes firm, and his side-kick Oliviero Toscani, in charge of Benetton's advertising campaigns, were blithely oblivious to any and all suggestions that a photograph of a dying Aids patient, another of a mafia murder victim, one of hapless Albanian refugees, or yet another of a black African guerrilla carrying a human femur, are pretty lousy ways to advertise the merits of a Benetton T-shirt. One black journalist asked what image the femur-photo was trying to depict - cannibalism? 'If you interpret it that way, then it is so,' answered a confident Toscani. His view of advertising is somewhat unusual; its purpose for Benetton, he said, is to increase 'social awareness'. Then again, what sort of social awareness was going to develop by showing a picture of Albanians leaping into the sea in order to take refuge in Italy last year - from whence the Italian government has since been trying very hard to expel them? Sounds of spluttering from uncomfortable style gurus.</p>

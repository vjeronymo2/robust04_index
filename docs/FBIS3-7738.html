			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar has described the  mutual granting of most-favored-nation status as the greatest  success of his official visit to the People's Republic of China.  He said this at a news conference at Bratislava airport,  immediately after the return of the Slovak delegation. The  prifme minister considers Thailand to be an important trade and  economic partner, too. According to Meciar, Slovakia has  achieved a certain opening with regard to relations with Turkey,  and Pakistani officials are also showing an interest in visiting  Slovakia.    At the news conference, the prime minister refused to  comment  on the resignations of Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac and  Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik. He said that so far he has not  heard President's Kovac's stand and that he has not yet gathered  enough information about the matter. He also failed to comment  on the alleged statements by Jan Slota, the newly elected  chairman of the Slovak National Party [SNS], who is said to have  expressed admiration of Russian ultranationalist Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy. The prime minister stressed that the SNS  continues to be the coalition partner of the HZDS [Movement for  a Democratic Slovakia].    A trend toward implementing elements of an authoritarian  regime is what is emerging when the internal political situation  in Slovakia is assessed abroad. This was said by Foreign  Minister Jozef Moravcik at a news conference in Bratislava. He  said that, if this proves to be true, Slovakia's position  abroad, with regard to its integration into Europe, would  suffer. Jozef Moravcik expressed the view that Slovakia's  foreign policy orientation will be preserved because Slovakia  has already taken important international legal steps in that  direction, such as signing the association agreement with the  European Union and the umbrella agreement on participating in  the Partnership for Peace program.</p>

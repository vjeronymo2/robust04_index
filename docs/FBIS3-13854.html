Kamal told MENA that the aim of the meeting is to coordinate  positions and give the five concerned Arab parties an  opportunity to consult over future actions. This will be  especially useful after the issue of resuming the peace talks is  settled in light of the UN Security Council resolution adopted  today. The resolution condemns the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre  and backs the protection of Palestinians in the occupied  territories.    Kamal said next Saturday's meeting will also discuss the  serious negative repercussions of the massacre on the peace  process and likely criminal plans that Israeli settlers might be  drawing up in response to the Security Council resolution.</p>

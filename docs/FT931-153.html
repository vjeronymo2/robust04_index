			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Fresh obstacle prompts doubt on Maastricht bill A FRESH OBSTACLE brought renewed uncertainty to the passage of the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty yesterday, as the House of Commons was offered a further opportunity to debate and vote on the social chapter. The new debate will be on an amendment backed by the Labour leadership, which could force the government to choose between accepting the social chapter and being unable to ratify the treaty, after the Maastricht bill itself had been passed. The final dilemma for the government would arise only if Tory Euro-rebels explicitly voted for the social chapter - which they do not support - as a tactical move to try to wreck the treaty. But passing the new amendment would cast a further shadow over the UK's ratification process. Ministers also received two boosts yesterday, when the government narrowly won a procedural motion enabling debate to continue into the small hours, and when Mr Michael Morris, the MP who chairs the detailed committee discussion of the bill, announced he had reversed his decision to allow a vote on another social chapter amendment. An alliance of opposition MPs and Tory rebels had been threatening an embarrassing defeat for the government on the issue. Although the government insisted that the amendment now ruled out could have been passed without wrecking the treaty, defeat would have raised the prospect of Tory rebels applying for judicial review of that legal opinion. Mr Morris faced protests in the Commons from Labour and from Tory Euro-sceptics at his decision not to allow the vote. The issue could be raised again at a later stage. The amendment which has been chosen would prevent powers being transferred to European institutions under the legislation, until the Commons had decided whether the social chapter should apply to the UK. Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, and government legal officials have yet to give a view, but Labour believes it would make a separate debate and vote on the social chapter necessary once parliament had discussed the Maastricht bill. Ministers said yesterday that Mr Morris's decisions left the government 'roughly where we were before', but Mr George Robertson, Labour's European spokesman, said that his party had gained a clear advantage. The Liberal Democrats have signalled they would support the new amendment, but Tory Euro-rebels gave a cool response. They held an emergency meeting last night and their apparent immediate disarray may give the government some comfort. Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT REJECTS STATE TAX ON MULTINATIONALS  </P> <P> An appellate court has dealt California another setback in the high-stakes  battle to save its so-called "unitary tax" on foreign-based multinational  corporations -- a ruling that could cost the state hundreds of millions of  dollars.  </P> <P> The 3rd District Court of Appeal in Sacramento, deciding in favor of  London-based Barclays Bank and its California subsidiary, found that  California's unitary system is unconstitutional because it violates the foreign  commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.  </P> <P> Although the ruling is not expected to have an immediate impact on the state  budget problem because of likely appeals that could drag on for months or  years, state Controller Gray Davis called it "another dark cloud on the state's  already gloomy finances."  </P> <P> Davis said the loss to the state, once appeals are exhausted, would be $526  million in back taxes, interest and administrative costs. There also would be  ongoing, still unknown losses because of California's inability to continue  levying the tax.  </P> <P> Davis, chairman of the Franchise Tax Board, which administers the tax, said an  appeal was all but certain. "As a practical matter, the decision would preclude  our auditors from examining the books of foreign-based multinationals," Davis  said.  </P> <P> The ruling, handed down last Friday, marked the latest chapter in a bitter  controversy between state tax officials and foreign business interests that has  been raging since the early 1970s. Under the unitary system, the state taxes  multinational corporations on the basis of each firm's worldwide earnings,  payroll and property holdings. The state figures that if 2% of a corporation's  business operations are in California, then the state should have the right to  apply its bank and corporation tax to 2% of a company's worldwide taxable  income.  </P> <P> California established the tax in the belief that unless taxable income is  based on a corporation's worldwide operations, the firm will be able to shift  profits from one subsidiary to another, report losses locally, and escape an  income tax here altogether.  </P> <P> Foreign business interests contend that California's unitary method is used  nowhere else in the world, requires them to keep separate sets of books,  unfairly taxes profit centers outside of California, and requires them to turn  over confidential corporate records to state auditors.  </P> <P> In 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state, holding that the  unitary system was a legally sound way of taxing corporations. That ruling  failed to definitively address the foreign policy questions and whether the  state was usurping the federal government's role in setting tax policy. In the  latest decision, the appellate court ruled that the tax usurped federal  authority.  </P> <P> In 1986, the Legislature, hoping to defuse the political and legal powder keg,  revised the state's taxing system to give multinational corporations a tax  break that now amounts to about $300 million a year. Controversy continued over  the unitary tax.  </P> <P> Joanne M. Garvey, a San Francisco attorney who represents Barclays, said the  unitary system "has been an international cause celebre from the moment the  state tried to apply it."  </P> <P> Garvey said the unitary method "is contrary to all international tax systems,"  contending that "even the federal government has had nothing but problems with  it."  </P> <P> In a unanimous opinion, the Court of Appeal seemed to agree, ruling that the  unitary system is unconstitutional because it poses a threat to international  commerce and runs contrary to federal policy on taxing of foreign corporations  as voiced by the administrations of four Presidents.  </P> <P> The case was filed by Barclays Bank after a state Franchise Tax Board demand  that the British firm pay an additional $154,098 in 1977 state taxes.  </P> <P> The governments of the United Kingdom and Canada joined Barclays in the  protest, arguing that the tax violates widely accepted international standards  and could lead to retaliation against U.S. firms operating in their countries.  The U.S. Justice Department joined the two foreign governments in the appeal,  arguing against the California tax.  </P> <P> The three-member state appellate panel, in a decision written by Associate  Justice Hugh A. Evans, described the tax as "an irritant in our foreign  commerce relations" with "adverse implications for American foreign policy."  </P> <P> The Barclays ruling does not affect a second major unitary tax suit on its way  to a decision -- filed by Colgate-Palmolive Corp. and representing the legal  interests of U.S.-based corporations.  </P> <P> Should the state also lose that suit, Controller Davis said the state could  lose an estimated $3.3 billion in tax refunds, penalties, interest payments,  fees and lost tax payments.  </P> <P> "It's scary. It's one more hole in the dike whose leak is all but fatal now,"  said Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Assembly  Ways and Means Committee, which is grappling with a budget shortfall that could  reach $6 billion over this year and next, even without the adverse court  ruling.  </P> <P> On the broader budget front, lawmakers -- after a little more than 24 hours in  session -- returned to their districts Tuesday without acting on Gov. George  Deukmejian's proposed $1-billion austerity plan.  </P> <P> Both houses of the Legislature left committees behind in the Capitol to study  the lame-duck governor's plan. Leaders acknowledged that no action on the  budget was contemplated until after Gov.-elect Pete Wilson takes office in  January.  </P> <P> "I don't want to do it piecemeal," Vasconcellos said.  </P> <P> The assemblyman said it made more sense for lawmakers to act on a projected  $800-million deficit in the current year's budget at the same time the  Legislature is looking at how to extricate the state from a possible  $4.9-billion shortfall next fiscal year, which begins July 1.  </P> <P> The Senate recessed until Jan. 7, the day Wilson will be sworn in. The Assembly  recessed until Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) calls them back  to town. In all likelihood, that will be Jan. 7.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Daniel M. Weintraub contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> The unitary tax was established in California more than 50 years ago to make  sure that multinational corporations paid their fair share of taxes to the  state. Using a complex formula, a company's taxes are based on a share of its  total income worldwide. The British conglomerate Barclays Bank challenged the  tax as being unconstitutional after the state Franchise Tax Board determined  that the company owed an additional $154,098 for 1977. The company won in  Superior Court in Sacramento and won again after the tax board appealed.  </P></p>

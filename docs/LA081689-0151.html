			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UPSET BUT OPTIMISTIC, DRAVECKY HEADS FOR S.F. WITH BROKEN ARM  </P> <P> Giants pitcher Dave Dravecky, with his broken left arm in a sling, appeared  upset but optimistic as he headed back for San Francisco today, confident that  "everything is going to be all right."  </P> <P> Dravecky's dramatic comeback was stalled, and his career again was placed in in  jeopardy, when he broke a bone in his pitching arm while on the mound against  the Montreal Expos on Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Dravecky was making his second start of the season for San Francisco, a year  after undergoing surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from his left arm. He fell  face down on the mound after delivering a pitch to Tim Raines in the sixth  inning. (Story, Part III, Page 1.)  </P> <P> Dravecky was wheeled from Olympic Stadium on a stretcher and taken to Queen  Elizabeth Hospital, where he learned that the humerus bone in his left arm, the  bone between the elbow and the shoulder, had snapped when he delivered the  pitch.  </P> <P> Leaving his hotel this morning to catch a flight to San Francisco, Dravecky,  33, appeared upset but said, "Everything is going to be all right" when asked  if he thought his career was over.  </P> <P> "The Lord is in control," Dravecky said.  </P> <P> Dravecky, his arm in a padded sling, said he is not going to think about a  comeback for the moment.  </P> <P> "At this point I'm not concerned about that," he said. "I think the key is  going through rehabilitation."  </P> <P> He conceded that his season is probably over.  </P> <P> But Dravecky, who helped the Giants to a 3-2 victory over the Expos in the  game, said he is happy he left on a winning note.  </P></p>

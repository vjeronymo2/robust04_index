			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Changchun, January 9 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's  Jilin Province accelerated its pace of reform and opening up in  1993, and gained strong momentum for further economic  development.    Statistics show that the gross national product of Jilin  last  year reached 55 billion yuan-worth, an increase of 14.3 percent  over the previous year.    The total retail volume of commodities topped 35 billion  yuan- worth -- a growth of 18 percent over 1992.    The province has taken bold measures to transform the  operational mechanisms of its industrial enterprises, and more  and more state-owned enterprises are being granted  decision-making powers in management and operation, local  officials said.    Further reform measures have been implemented in the  personnel and income-distribution systems in about 2,600 local  state-owned enterprises. Hundreds of state-owned enterprises  have been auctioned off or sold.    The number of share-holding enterprises in Jilin province  has  reached 371 so far.    Meanwhile, the provincial government has also attached much  importance to the reform of the price system. The prices of  coal, refined oil, cement and timber are now under market  regulation.    The number of industrial products with controlled prices  have  been reduced from 23 to 12.    As one of the country's largest grain producers, Jilin has  increased its agricultural input and made special efforts to  lighten the burden on local farmers.    In spite of being stricken with serious natural disasters,  the province still managed to get a bump harvest last year, with  grain output totalling 19 billion kg and a growth of 7.1 percent  in the average income of farmers.    Taking advantage of the international exploration of the  Tuman River delta, Jilin has expanded its economic co-operation  and exchanges with foreign countries, especially neighboring  countries in northeast Asia.    The export turnover of Jilin last year topped 1.6 billion  U.S. dollars-worth, and the province actually utilized 650  million U.S. dollars in foreign investment, both substantial  growths over the previous year.    Meanwhile, the improvement of transportation and  communication facilities, and the speeding up of infrastructure  construction have created a better economic environment in  Jilin, the officials said.</p>

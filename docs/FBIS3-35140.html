(Silvera) from Mizoram have joined the Union Council of  Ministers. Mr. Ram Lakhan Singh Yadav was sworn in as a cabinet  minister by President Shankar Dayal Sharma at a brief ceremony  at Rashtrapati Bhavan [President House] this afternoon. The  74-year-old Mr. Yadav will look after chemicals and fertilizers  portfolio. Mr. Yadav, a backward class leader, had contested the  1991 elections from Arrah on the Janata Dal ticket but had  supported the Narasimha Rao government in the crucial  no-confidence vote in July last year.    Dr. C. (Silvera) was sworn in as the minister of state for  health and family welfare. Dr. (Silvera) is Lok Sabha member  from Mizoram and the first union minister from the state. Vice  President Mr. K.R. Narayanan, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, a  number of his cabinet colleagues, and Mizoram Chief Minister Lal  Thanhawla were present on the occasion. This is the third  expansion of the Council of Ministers since Mr. Rao assumed  office in 1991. The strength of the council now goes up to 59.</p>

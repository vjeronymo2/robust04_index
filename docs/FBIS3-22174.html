			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dimcho Evstatiev and Dimitur Kozhukharov: </F> ``Bulgaria Will Have a Storage Depot for Radioactive Waste From  Kozloduy'']    [Text] Bulgaria has been developing nuclear power for more  than 20 years now, but has yet to develop a proper position  regarding the problem of disposing of the radioactive waste from  nuclear power plants. In the recent past, various state  institutions have made attempts to overcome this backwardness,  but despite this we still have no national strategy backed up by  legislation and no specialized organization for controlling  radioactive waste. Meanwhile, the waste is accumulating at the  Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, and the amounts of low- and  medium-level waste already exceed 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes. In  recent years high-level waste nuclear fuel has been added to  these deposits. Debates have been going on in the press as to  whether this high- level waste should be stored at Kozloduy for  40-50 years or whether it should be sent abroad for reprocessing  in return for payment. In either case, the high-level waste  produced after the fuel has been treated will most likely be  buried in Bulgaria, for which we will need a deep underground  storage site.    In 1991, the Council of Ministers asked the Bulgarian  Academy  of Sciences to develop a concept for a national radioactive  waste storage depot. A large team of experts was formed from  seven Academy of Sciences institutes, who were joined by  specialists from Sofia University, the University of Mining and  Geology, the Committee on Geology and Mineral Resources, the  Committee for Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, and other  departments.    The end result of the study showed that sites do exist in  Bulgaria that are suitable for constructing stores close to the  surface for low- and medium-level waste with a comparatively  short life, which, after treatment and packing in special  containers, does not present any particular danger to the  surrounding environment. As far as high-level waste is  concerned, it is impossible to give a clearcut answer at this  stage, because such waste takes tens of thousands of years to  decay and the requirements relating to its storage deep  underground are exceptionally stringent.    The studies and investigations carried out by Bulgarian  Academy of Sciences have produced 56 scientific papers, the main  results of which were submitted in summary form to the  interested government departments. We now face a far more  demanding and difficult task that must be fulfilled without  delay, namely to complete additional studies and investigations  of the most promising prospective storage sites and then select  a few of them for detailed investigation. Such detailed  investigations are extremely expensive (in the United States,  Switzerland, Italy, and other countries they cost tens of  millions of dollars), and for this reason it is vitally  important to select the fewest possible prospective sites.    It takes over 10 years to investigate, design, and construct  a storage depot for low- and medium-level waste, and 20 to 30  years to construct one for high-level radioactive waste. We  therefore have no time to lose, and should immediately begin the  next stage of completing the task on the basis of the Academy of  Sciences report. Naturally, this cannot be achieved without  active government intervention. In the United States, the  commission on the problem of a national radioactive waste  storage depot was chaired by the President himself. In Bulgaria  too, the head of state should oversee the solving of this  problem, in view of the negative reaction that may be expected  from the local population and the risk of departmental interests  exerting excessive influence. The responsible departments  already display extreme secretiveness regarding information on  contacts with prospective foreign partners, on the allocation of  funds, and the conditions for their use, which is evidently  connected with rivalry in controlling these funds. There is a  real danger that the money that we will borrow from foreign  creditors will be frittered away in the departmental budgets or  appropriated in one form or another by foreign companies without  any major work being completed.    This is why we insist that the government should most  actively address the problem of finding a storage site for the  radioactive waste from our nuclear plant and adopt concrete  decisions on a national strategy and legislation, on setting up  an independent agency for controlling radioactive waste, and on  pressing issues relating to further investigations and research  into designing the storage depot.    Bulgaria has indeed delayed far too long in resolving the  radioactive waste problem. However, we still have at our  disposal a considerable reserve of competent scientists and  specialists, the geology of our land has been thoroughly  surveyed, and all this forms a good basis for making speedy  progress.    In Western countries with advanced nuclear power industries,  one basic principle in developing a national strategy is not to  leave succeeding generations with any economic or ecological  problems arising from the underground storage of radioactive  waste. In Bulgaria, on the other hand, we have tacitly adopted  a different ``strategy,'' according to which our generation will  merely consume the nuclear energy, while the following  generations will have to solve the problem of dealing with the  radioactive waste from nuclear power production.</p>

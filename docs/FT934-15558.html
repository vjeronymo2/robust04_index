			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: EMU under scrutiny THE future of European currency policy hangs in the balance this week as Germany deliberates on the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. Concentration on the implications for currency are likely to come to the fore as the impact of disappointing US job figures is taken on board. Barring unforeseen dramas the German constitutional court will tomorrow rule on whether Maastricht conforms with the country's basic law. The most damning ruling would be for no move to Economic Monetary Union (EMU) without some form of vote. As opinion polls suggest more than 70 per cent of voters would oppose abolition of the D - Mark, a test of Maastricht at the polls would probably end German participation in EMU. Mr Paul Chertkow, currency analyst at UBS, said: 'If the court votes no, convergence goes out the window. Countries with high unemployment and low inflation would have to cut and run on the UK model. There would be no anchor and currencies would be assessed on their fundamental value.' It is more likely that the court will ratify the Treaty but attach strings. This could prompt heavy selling of the Ecu and affect its constituent parts, the main currencies in the exchange rate mechanism. The potential impact of an adverse German decision was overshadowed by tension surrounding US employment data for September. When the figures came in on Friday they matched most forecasts but the make-up suggested any hopes for US recovery were premature. Heavy dollar selling was compounded by expiry of dollar/D - Mark options expiry and sent the US currency sharply lower against leading currencies. Worries about the US economy are likely to be compounded by flat consumer and producer price statistics this week.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / MPs in split over 'supergun' report MPs investigating the Iraqi 'supergun' affair split yesterday over a report which criticises officials but stops short of attacking the intelligence services and ministers. The cross-party trade and industry select committee approved, by six votes to four, a report in time for publication on Monday - hours before the House of Commons rises until after the general election. Four Conservative MPs on the committee tried to block the report, partly because they believe criticisms implied in it have not been properly substantiated or investigated. One, Mr Keith Hampson, Tory MP for north-west Leeds, voted against the report because he wanted further inquiries into fresh allegations about how much was known by Sheffield Forgemasters, one of the companies at the centre of the controversy. The Department of Trade and Industry has said it was not fully briefed about the Iraqi project until March 1990, when eight sections of steel tubing manufactured by Sheffield Forgemasters were seized by customs officials at Teesport near Middlesbrough. At least two of the Tories also opposed a paragraph which says Customs and Excise impeded the committee's investigation by refusing to answer questions fully because of their role as a prosecuting authority. At the same time, the four Labour MPs on the Tory-dominated committee failed to win support for a series of amendments which argued that it was not credible that the security forces were unaware of the so-called 'Project Babylon' prior to March 1990. The Labour MPs also failed to insert amendments questioning whether the information available should have been passed to ministers. The report blames officials at the DTI and at the Ministry of Defence for not pooling information which, if put together, should have provoked suspicions much earlier. It suggests, however, the mistakes were innocent, rather than part of a conspiracy. There is also mild criticism of two companies involved - Sheffield Foremasters and Walter Somers for not investigating further the true purpose of the parts they were making.</p>

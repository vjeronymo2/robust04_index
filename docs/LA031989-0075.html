			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASTING SPELLS  </P> <P> I am surprised that in these days of consumer (subscriber) protection you have  failed to warn readers that Judith Morgan can be a "trouble maker." I have  enjoyed her many and varied trips second-hand through her articles, but it was  not until February, 1988, and her series on Antarctica that I became aware of  the power of bewitchment. What gives her the right to cast her spells on us  innocent, routine encumbered readers, or the right to rekindle old dreams.  </P> <P> I have thought of her encroachment into my life many times since that series,  especially last January when I, too, experienced (firsthand this time)  pepper-and-salt ridges of penguins, incredible icebergs (though not as large as  Rhode Island), pink skies and the indescribable beauty of the Antarctic. Thanks  for sharing her travels and literary skill with us.  </P> <P> NORMAN DOSHIER  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P></p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Protesters to be deported CHINA was last night reported to be preparing to release and expel seven Europeans after detaining them for staging a human rights protest in Tiananmen Square, site of the pro-democracy demonstrations two years ago which were crushed by the army. The seven included Mr Bob Parry, a British Labour MP, as well as two French trade unionists, and local parliamentarians from Saxony and Geneva belonging to the European Labour Group which supports trade union rights. The group was detained after unfurling a banner in Tiananmen Square which read in Chinese, 'Long live free labour unions'. They had previously been refused a meeting by the Ministry of Justice after reportedly telling foreign journalists that China's only officially tolerated trade union was not independent. China has banned political protest of any kind since cracking down on student protest in June 1989. Ma Yuzhen, China's ambassador to London, was summoned to the Foreign Office yesterday afternoon where he received a formal protest from Britain's foreign office minister of state, Mr Alastair Goodlad.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Letter: Cash flow pressures on N Sea operators Sir, The innuendo at the conclusion of Ian Rutledge's letter (July 20), about the tax regime applying to offshore oil and gas activity, and the working relationship between oil companies and government, is misplaced. The North Sea is in world terms a high-cost operating province. Predictions of flat real international oil sterling prices, coupled with unit costs of work offshore that are now rising much faster than monetary inflation, are giving the UK offshore companies a thin time. Indeed some are experiencing negative cash flows for their current overall activities. Does Dr Rutledge believe in taxing negative cash flows? A stable fiscal system is necessary to keep interest alive in the North Sea under such economic conditions, and this is certainly in the country's short- and long-term interest, especially from the aspect of the industry's substantial (Pounds 7.6bn per annum in 1991) contribution to GNP and to the UK's balance of payments position. Nevertheless, marginal tax take on the larger, generally older, fields remains at some 86 per cent. The technological progress and business skills of the industry need the complement of a responsive tax regime to give confidence to companies when they contemplate continuing to extend their investment in the North Sea under the very tight economic returns it now offers. There are plenty of oil and gas investment opportunities available elsewhere in the world if the UK gets this wrong.

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Balladur warns Moscow France's prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, said yesterday that President Boris Yeltsin's Russia had a big role to play in Europe's future but made it clear there should be no retreat from democracy, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Balladur told a Moscow news conference that Mr Yeltsin's leadership 'incarnates democratic legitimacy' and France's goodwill would embrace the parliament which emerged from next month's elections. Mr Balladur was the first western head of government to visit Moscow since Mr Yeltsin used tanks to crush an armed revolt on October 4 in a dramatic showdown with hardline deputies who had blocked his market reforms. The French prime minister used his two-day visit to press his country's initiative for a proposed pact on European security which received backing from the European Community at the summit in Brussels last week. He said that he had told Mr Yeltsin and the prime minister, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, that Russia would be 'an essential partner' for the success of this initiative. Mr Balladur was at pains to say nothing that could be construed as interference in the run-up to Russian elections on December 12.</p>

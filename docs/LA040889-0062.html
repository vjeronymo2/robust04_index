			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LPGA TOURNAMENT AT POWAY;  </P> <P> WITH OKAMOTO OUT, BROWN, DAVIES TIE FOR LEAD  </P> <P> There are many contenders at the halfway point of the LPGA tour's Red Robin  Kyocera Inamori tournament at StoneRidge, but defending champion Ayako Okamoto  isn't one of them.  </P> <P> In fact, Okamoto is no longer in the tournament. After winning here twice in a  row, the Japanese veteran bowed out Friday when she added a nine-over-par 80 to  her first-round 75 and missed the cut by eight strokes.  </P> <P> So while Nancy Brown and Laura Davies moved into a tie for the lead with  36-hole scores of 136, Okamoto bemoaned the extension of a slump that has  plagued her all season.  </P> <P> "It's really, really frustrating," Okamoto said. "I felt frustrated the whole  day, all week, every day, every shot."  </P> <P> Okamoto led the tour in 1987 by earning $466,034 and finished sixth last year  with $300,206, but has won only $12,946 in 1989. This is the second consecutive  week she has failed to make the cut.  </P> <P> Both Brown and Davies, who had trailed by one stroke with 69s after the first  round, shot 67s Friday. Martha Nause's 68 left her a stroke behind at 137, and  Dale Eggeling and Cindy Rarick dropped from a tie for the lead to a tie for  fourth with Sue Tonkin at 138.  </P> <P> Deedee Lasker, the other first-round leader, shot a 74 and skidded to a tie for  18th at 142.  </P> <P> Sue Thomas made the tournament's first hole in one on the 16th.  </P></p>

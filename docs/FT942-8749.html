			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Labour keeps lid on leadership race Labour yesterday attempted to clamp down on speculation about the party leadership by extending a ban on campaigning until after the European parliament election on June 9. The shadow cabinet gave unanimous endorsement to demands from Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader, for a three-week moratorium on leadership statements. The moratorium is intended to stop speculation about the leadership undermining Labour's campaign for the election, in which the party hopes to win up to 15 extra seats. But officials said there would be no sanctions against candidates who break the rules except 'a great deal of criticism from their colleagues'. The decision was announced as it emerged that Mr Gordon Brown, one of two modernist contenders, will make a major speech to the Welsh Labour conference on Sunday. Mr Brown, the shadow chancellor, whose unofficial campaign has flagged in the week since the death of John Smith, the former leader, will be free under the rules to set out his view of Labour's future. Labour MPs were sceptical about the prospects of a successful ban on campaigning. Some said it would simply encourage arms-length electioneering by supporters. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, who was to have addressed the Welsh conference during its cancelled Saturday session, has declined an invitation to speak on Sunday. But he and the two other main contenders - Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, and Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary - are free to give interviews as long as they do not announce formally that they are standing. Mrs Beckett, a potential leftwing candidate, will be interviewed by Sir David Frost on BBC television on Sunday. The problems the party will face in keeping a lid on public campaigning were underlined by claims that Mr Peter Mandelson, MP for Hartlepool and Labour's former publicity director, had been campaigning for Mr Blair. The allegation, levelled by Mr Nigel Griffiths, shadow consumer affairs minister and a supporter of Mr Brown, was quickly withdrawn after protests from the shadow chancellor's office. John Smith will be buried on the Scottish island of Iona on Saturday after a funeral tomorrow at the church in Edinburgh where he was a regular worshipper.

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Victaulic shares fall 20% on warning THE STOCK market wiped 20 per cent off the value of shares in Victaulic yesterday after the pipe and fittings supplier to British Gas warned that it had seen a drop in its turnover in the first half of the year. The company says it is suffering from a downturn in investment in pipeline infrastructure at British Gas because of the uncertainty created by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the company. 'We were down last year, but the situation has deteriorated even further this year and we're about 30 per cent off where we were in 1991,' said Mr David Stewart, managing director. The company said the delay in the publication of the monopolies commission's report had cast a deeper cloud of uncertainty over the industry. The commission is due to deliver its report by the end of July - it was granted an extension to delay publication from April. Victaulic said the reduction in activity levels would lead to pre-tax profits for the half year being up to 20 per cent lower than in 1992. In the first half of 1992, Victaulic made a profit of Pounds 6.9m on sales of Pounds 51.2m. The company's shares dropped yesterday from 315p to 253p. Victaulic's experience is widespread across the gas supply industry, according to Mr John Cull at the Society of British Gas Industries. 'Companies have seen their marketplace continue to tumble over the past year with a dramatic effect on all parts of their business,' he said.</p>

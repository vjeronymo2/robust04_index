			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Dutch parties to discuss coalition Three Dutch political parties will this week begin exploring the formation of a coalition excluding the centrist Christian Democrats (CDA) from government for the first time in modern Dutch politics. Queen Beatrix has appointed three elder statesmen from Labour, the right-wing Liberals and the left-of-centre D66 to hold preliminary talks on the possibility of creating a cabinet without the CDA. The CDA of the outgoing prime minister, Mr Ruud Lubbers, suffered heavy losses in general elections on May 3. Labour, which had ruled as a junior coalition partner with the CDA for five years, also lost seats in parliament but emerged as the biggest party overall. The Liberals and D66, by contrast, made strong gains at the polls. The Queen's appointment of three 'informateurs' to explore a new coalition brings the possibility of a cabinet without the CDA a step closer. But there are still formidable hurdles on the road to a left-right cabinet, an untried phenomenon in Dutch politics. The three politicians - Mr Klaas de Vries for Labour, Mr Gijs van Ardenne for the Liberals and Mr Jan Vis for D66 - will have to try to bridge the gap between Labour, which wants no new reform of the social security system, and the Liberals, which is proposing a radical cut in benefits provided by the state. The three men do not hold seats in the lower house of parliament and are not involved in the day-to-day politics of their parties, making it easier for them to explore options than it would be for colleagues who stood in the election. If the three make progress, their party leaders may then be asked by the queen to launch formal negotiations on a new coalition. However, the process could take weeks, and any failure to agree would give the CDA a chance to return to government and avoid relegation to the opposition benches.</p>

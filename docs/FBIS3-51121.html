The Caribbean island's foreign minister was welcomed at  Kotoka International Airport by his Ghanaian counterpart, Obed  Asamoah, and Juan Carretero, Havana's ambassador in Accra.    Interviewed by local media, Robaina said one of the goals of  the trip is to explain the domestic situation in Cuba and  changes being implemented in the economic sector.    He said his country's government is interested in knowing  about the situation in Ghana, a country with which it maintains  a fluid trade which stands out within the context of the  so-called Black Continent.    Referring to the Latin American country's planned foreign  policy for 1994, the head of Cuban diplomacy said it must be  different, because the situation so demands.    The key is to have the ability to exist in a constantly  changing world and to ensure that our views are known at the  international level, he said.    The foreign minister said that despite predictions by the  international media in 1993, his country is living, working, and  has opted to counter the adverse situation it is facing with  many efforts, without sacrificing sacred achievements, such as  in health and education.    Referring to this, he said 1993 should go down in history as  the most difficult year for the revolution, which was born in  1959, but 1994 is the beginning of an upward trend.    During his 48-hour stay in Accra, Robaina will meet with  Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlins; Justice Daniel Annan,  parliament leader; the foreign minister; and Richard Kwame  Peprah, energy and mines minister and chairman of the  Cuban-Ghanaian Mixed Commission.    He will also meet with members of various friendship  associations and the Cuban ambassadors to Cape Verde,  Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria, Benin, and Burkina Faso.    The foreign minister and his delegation will leave on  Tuesday  for Angola, the second phase of his two-week tour, which also  includes Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Namibia.</p>

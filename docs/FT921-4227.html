			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Le Pen makes a play for children's vote The National Front wants to let parents vote on behalf of their minor children in a move to encourage French people to have bigger families, Reuter reports from Paris. The so-called 'family vote' was one of 51 social proposals in a manifesto issued by the anti-immigrant party led by Jean-Marie Le Pen ahead of March 22 regional elections. 'The place of families in the national community must be enhanced. It is abnormal that children who ensure the future of the nation do not count in elections,' it said. 'It is therefore important to establish full universal suffrage by giving the right to vote to every citizen, adult or minor. This vote will be exercised by the parents: the father for boys and the mother for girls,' the National Front said. Bruno Megret, the party's chief ideologist, said the idea was logical since parents were legally responsible for their children. The manifesto said the children would have no say until they turned 18 and could vote for themselves. The National Front's social charter also featured proposals to stop child benefit and welfare payments to immigrants, give French nationals priority in state housing and student grants, and pay mothers to stay at home and raise children.</p>

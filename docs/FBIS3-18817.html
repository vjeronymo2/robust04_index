Quizzed on Italian radio as to the findings of Commission  Chairman Ugo Pecchioli, Mancino said: "I did not keep silent.  When the (embezzled) funds were returned thanks to the work of  a magistrate, I considered it a correct operation, and there is  no obligation to report a correct operation. Subsequently, no  one informed me when a judicial inquiry began. I read it in the  papers like the Rt. Honourable Pecchioli, so we were in the same  position".    Mancino also reiterated the view that even if he had known  of  the probe and informed the Commission, he would have exposed  himself to charges of breaking judicial secrecy.    "If I had known of the preventive detention measures and had  spoken to the Secret Service Commission, notwithstanding the  fact that that Commission is bound to secrecy and in particular  to state secrecy, no one would have spared me the accusation of  violating a judicial secret," he said.    In a separate issue related to the Sisde probe, Electoral  Reform Minister Leopoldo Elia today rejected the contention that  President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro should step down after the March  27-28 elections to defend himself from charges of pocketing  Sisde cheques like other interior ministers before and after him.    Elia stressed that the much-debated statement from Rome  prosecutors on Thursday [3 March] had cleared Scalfaro of all  imputations against him, "just as it would have done for a  normal citizen."    He also pointed out that the Italian Constitution "lays down  a much stronger bond of continuity for the president than for  government or Parliament."    Scalfaro's term of office is due to end in 1999. Some  political forces, notably the Northern League, have indicated  they will press for his resignation if they win the elections.</p>

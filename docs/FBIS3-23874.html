This Is What the President of  Tatarstan Promised in an Interview With NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Back  in January"]    [Text] Kazan, January--My meeting with Mintimer Shaymiyev,  president of Tatarstan, was scheduled to take place at the  Borovoye-Matyushino recreation center, at a guest dacha near  Kazan.    The leadership settlement is not that big--40 frame houses,  not particularly aesthetic in appearance. The whole charm of the  settlement is the forest and the age-old firs, the tops of which  glisten with the white of frost and gleams of the sun. They are  almost all two-family houses. The chairman of the Supreme Soviet  is the neighbor of the mayor of Kazan. The atmosphere in the  dachas is, I would say, simple.    The guest house stands out in the settlement somewhat both  by  its external appearance and its interior. It was built by  craftsmen from General Service Department. And the cottage had  been furnished with imported furnishings, only the radio being  of national production. Neither imported furniture nor foreign  equipment catches the eye in the homes of the leadership. This  detail of the life of the president's entourage and the  president himself has probably performed a considerable role in  the way in which relations between the first person of the state  and his people have taken shape. There is not that glaring,  striking difference in the living standard here: The apartment  of the working professional, the lecturer at the higher  educational institution, and the farmer of average means might  be furnished in this way.    [Vladina] I never cease to be amazed at the modesty of the  furnishing of your home, in your office, and, now, at the dacha.  What is this--a character trait of yours, or economics, or a  specially cultivated style?    [Shaymiyev] It is a rule of life.    [Vladina] I remember the voice of the people: The old  authorities had everything and thought about the people. The new  ones--poor democrats--until they are through stealing, will not  remember the people.    [Shaymiyev] I would like to sincerely confess that I  sometimes feel awkward at being better dressed when I meet  people because, seeing today's low living standard, I do not  consider that I have the right to wish for something further,  over and above what is necessary. This could serve as an  irritant.    [Vladina] Yes, but the republic has, all the same, just one  president....    [Shaymiyev] I understand, but, still. This depends on  character, perhaps. But I cannot do otherwise.    [Vladina] I was at your national theater, attending the  premier of the youth show. It is a lively, sparkling  performance, and the theater has survived since it is in receipt  of a sizable government subsidy. Does this apply to the whole  sphere of culture and research? How are you finding the means  for this?    [Shaymiyev] Three years ago our artistic unions, theaters,  and cultural institutions were in a dreadfully calamitous state.  That is what power is for--to help gifted people not only  survive but create. After all, their gifts are God-given, can I  compare myself with them?... In order to help them, we set up  the Culture Support Fund. These are not just words; the fund  operates. Each month the artistic unions meet and determine  which writer, artist, or actor specifically needs assistance. We  have given all theaters a subsidy, the actors have begun to  travel more, and we support overseas travel.    The artistic intelligentsia has gained a second wind, as it  were.... We also now stage various contests, children's  festivals, say. A song contest for the President's Prize was  held recently. Small amounts, perhaps, but we allocate money for  this.    Last year we conducted a song festival-contest among adults.  A $1,000 first prize was established. There are $1,000 also for  the winners of the annual Chaliapin Festival, and contestants  from overseas also take part. Practically all children from the  kindergartens and schools take part in the children's festivals.    Of course, there are expenses, big expenses, there is no  denying that! But we believe that this is a matter of state  importance and we do not begrudge the money, therefore. You  yourself know how the people perceive this.... Nothing happens  or emerges just like that, of its own accord--specially people's  normal relationship with the state authorities.    (I recalled how the president had responded to the heckling  comments of people in the lower stands of the stadium at the  time of the opening of the winter season--racing was starting.  Everyone was in the grip of a common passion, having completely  forgotten about ranks and titles. It was 20 below, and the  stands were uncovered, and for this reason the president and his  entourage stopped to warm themselves at small,  unattractive-looking service areas. I was struck by an  interesting detail here: Someone had closed the door to an  adjoining room, where, most likely, people of a somewhat lower  level were congregated. The president reacted instantly, and his  eyes revealed a flash of dissatisfaction. "Open the door. We are  all together." I saw the "iron" Mintimer [this is what his name  sounds like in translation])    You have to work the whole time. This is strenuous work.  Illusions pass. Everything is difficult, and I do not believe  that it will get any easier in the future. Nonetheless, whenever  I am in Moscow, I try to conclude each visit with a trip to the  theater. The last time I went to see Rostand, Raykin's, and saw  "Cyrano de Bergerac"....    (And I suddenly hear the president performing:    "Ah, me! I have long been capable of standing frozen in  admiration    "At the sight of grass or a gentle flower...")    [Vladina] I was pleasantly gratified by the small number of  commercial stalls in Kazan. The crime-breeding situation in the  city is not, therefore, that dramatic, perhaps?    [Shaymiyev] I would not judge the progress of market reform  by the stalls. I do not believe that this is an indicator,  because the formation of stock companies here is somewhat ahead  of schedule now. We were for a long time criticized for not  getting involved in this, but we needed to prepare thoroughly  for this step. Large enterprises are now engaged in the  formation of stock companies here, and progress is evident.    [Vladina] Are you moving into first place among the CIS  states?    [Shaymiyev] Well, first or not first.... But what have we  done? We have distributed the R10,000 vouchers to all our  inhabitants. We added up--we had more property, and we opened  supplementary accounts in savings banks for each inhabitant of  the republic, children included. And such an account is called  the registered privatization voucher--R30,000 in each of them.  Auctions have now been held. And stock has been issued, and  investment funds have appeared.    [Vladina] And what about privatization of housing here? Has  it begun?    [Shaymiyev] No, we have not embarked on it yet. This is a  very painful problem for us. We have studied the experience of  Moscow and St. Petersburg. Many mistakes were made in Moscow,  after all, and we sought our own approach. We are also investing  with property people who have been on the waiting list for  housing for a long time and who did not have such and the very  neediest in order that these people retain at least some  advantage: We are opening for them accounts supplementary to the  R30,000 deposits.... And privatization of housing has worked.  Everything has now been thought through, it would seem, and the  value of the property to be privatized and the cost of garbage  removal, operation of the elevator, and so on, and so forth have  been determined. There have been mistakes in this plan also,  perhaps; otherwise, whence the racketeering in housing--this is  an appalling business.... In order to rid ourselves of this, we  also have thought up some things: We have introduced a special  drafting mechanism, which will help people to some extent. When  it is a question specifically of the interests of an individual,  everything needs to be given serious thought. For we are  breaking with established principles for the first time, people  have never been involved in this before, and it is, therefore,  hard to foresee the various consequences. And all the criminal  world does is keep a watch on where weak spots may emerge in  order to take advantage of them at a rush.    [Vladina] Culture, housing.... It is perfectly obvious that  you are ahead of others here. And land? Is land reform under way  here?    [Shaymiyev] How many years can this game be played? Remember  how the center spoke about private property at first: We will  have done with the kolkhozes and sovkhozes, then we will give  out the land. Then, prior to the elections, an edict appeared.  Now, after the elections, Boris Nikolayevich makes changes to  this edict: This and that was not done right, apparently, let us  adjust it.... In a word, there is once again confirmation of the  proposition that you should be in no hurry to jump up and  salute, for all this is attended by additional difficulties for  the people. Everything needs to be thought through first! There  is the story of the shepherd who was grazing his sheep and who  decided to have some fun: He shouted and begged for help--wolves  were attacking the herd.... He fooled them! And everyone ran to  help as fast as possible. Since the shepherd had done this once,  twice, a third time, when the wolves really attacked, no one  heeded his calls for help.... There has, therefore, to be belief!    [Vladina] Mintimir Sharipovich, concerning belief.... Do you  attend the mosque?    [Shaymiyev] The mosque? I am an atheist.    [Vladina] But you were born to a religious family?    [Shaymiyev] My mother's influence. My father was not a  believer. I did last year, as president, attend the Central  Mosque. It was the big festival of Kurban Bayram. And I have now  just been to the Orthodox Cathedral of Peter and Paul on  Christmas Eve, 6 January....    [Vladina] And today is our, Christian,  holiday--Epiphany--and  I would like to ask you: What do you do not out of official duty  but at the command of the heart?    [Shaymiyev] Duty of the heart.... Attitude toward the  mosque... yes? In any event, the mosque and Islam appeal only to  the good. I joyfully accept the serious revival of religion,  therefore. When I first attended the Peter and Paul Cathedral, I  inspected the very rich iconostasis, one of the best, and  understood what a cultural asset this is.    [Vladina] Like all people, you surely have moods of  depression. Is a president entitled to this, and how do you  restore the balance of the soul?    [Shaymiyev] I prefer solitude at such times.    [Vladina] Do you not miss the past?    [Shaymiyev] I would like to emphasize once again that  although I did not suffer from the former system, did not suffer  as a person--I grew in stature continually--I was the  nomenklatura of that system, as they say: There is no escaping  the life that has been lived. But we can no longer live as we  did. I perceived perestroyka with satisfaction, and there are no  problems here because I, as an industrial manager, now also do  the same thing, I organize people for work.    I very much like the economist Leontieff's formula: The  economy is a ship or sailboat, which has to have a rudder and a  sail. And to be able to move by the set course, it needs wind.  Interest, the driving force of an economy, is the wind. The  interest of each individual--this is ultimately the incentive to  the most efficient labor. The sphere of application of the human  intellect or hands, be it private property or other forms of the  use of this interest, is not that important, therefore. The main  thing is that there be interest in labor. We must make use of  this factor. The old social system did not, alas, afford us  access to any form of activity. We attempted to operate via  ideology, compulsion, and socialist competition, but were unable  to properly awaken interest in what was being done. And it was  unclear to me how this was to be achieved other than by a change  of the form of ownership. The fact that we are changing the form  of ownership--I am not in any doubt about this. The ways of  achieving the goal leave much to be desired, of course. Property  should in time, therefore, pass into normal hands; there is no  escaping this process. I cannot imagine our future otherwise.  But I cannot say of which system--capitalism or socialism--I am  a devotee: There is simply no such thing as capitalism in the  form in which we were taught.    [Vladina] Your attitude toward Zhirinovskiy?    [Shaymiyev] I do not trust Zhirinovskiy.    [Vladina] People put their trust....    [Shaymiyev] No, they did not. This was a protest against  what  is happening in society. I personally cannot take this election  seriously, perhaps this is my mistake. The democrats have begun  to accuse one another of having failed to unite for no good  reason, otherwise they would have won. This is rubbish! Had they  not separated into blocs and operated under the slogan of  Russia's Choice, they would have lost even more heavily. Today  Yavlinskiy and Shakhray have won some number of votes also. But  what is there in the program of Russia's Choice to attract the  people? Why should people have voted for this bloc, for the  mistakes they made? No one should be accused of anything,  therefore; it is conclusions that need to be drawn: A course  correction is needed. This was the fundamental mistake--counting  on foreign assistance. It is time to produce everything  ourselves.    [Vladina] Today, when the Constitution of Russia has been  approved and your republic has a special position, are you  personally not experiencing psychological strain on account of  the opposition to the powerful will of the center? Are you up to  this?    [Shaymiyev] We walked out of the Constitutional Conference  because Tatarstan's voice was not being heard. We were, after  all, already living by the Constitution--by the old Constitution  of the Russian Federation, it is true. The very concept of  sovereignty is absent from the new Constitution. It is  altogether incomprehensible how it is possible to forget about  the Federal Treaty, which both the present president and the  former Supreme Soviet presented to the people as a tremendous  achievement for the sake of preservation of the Russian  Federation. Today the Federation Treaty has been forgotten, as  it were, and it would, most likely, be best were no one to  remember it. Is this right?... Almost half the republics of the  Russian Federation rejected the Constitution since it is  incapable of securing the complete accord of our society, even  taking account of the fact that it was adopted in accordance  with low requirements. It turns out that one-third of the  populace voted for the adoption of the Constitution, but the  majority has to live in accordance with it. But I still hope  that there will be no further violation of the Constitution of  the Russian Federation. Neither by the president nor by anyone  else. And now, continuing the process of negotiations with the  Russian Federation, we must within the frameworks of the  Constitutions of Russia and Tatarstan come to an accord. Is this  more difficult today than yesterday? Undoubtedly. But can  agreement be reached? I believe so.    [Vladina] From where do you derive your strength in  defending  your case that this is an understanding of the true interests of  both the people of Tatarstan and of Russia as a federation?    [Shaymiyev] You know, this could be defined as inner  opposition, but I do not wish to call it this, although this,  perhaps, is what many people think. But, from my viewpoint, it  is the position that could help build a more democratic federal  Russian state. Unfortunately, we are not taking advantage of  this propitious moment in history and have once again taken the  path of easy solutions, because building an empire and a unitary  state on a smaller scale in the place of the former Union seemed  far simpler than building a democratic federation. It is  necessary for this, after all, to negotiate with us and with the  other states; it is necessary to have sufficient patience and to  reach an accord in order that society be rid of the constant  tension.    But there is another aspect of the matter also. I am now  told: We have a Constitution, it has been adopted, your voice  was not heard. What next? I say: We need to come to some  arrangement, everything needs to be resolved in civilized  fashion. If some people are dreaming of other forms of  cooperation and power pressure, we have already had this. Why  resort to such a solution of questions? When there is a lack of  other arguments and the patience to negotiate. Of course, any  people within the former Union and Russia could today still be  "driven" into any regime; people lived for so many decades "in a  regime," after all, but then there should be an end to the talk  about democracy.    [Vladina] Have we gone back to what we had before?    [Shaymiyev] To worse than what we had before, even. It is  for  this reason that the soundness of my position and my conviction  give me strength. The position of Tatarstan is that of the  building of a law-based democratic Russian Federation. We shall  not abandon our positions, although we will, via, perhaps,  compromise even, arrive at a treaty with the Russian Federation.  We will sign it. There will come a time when our case is  recognized. I have a composed attitude toward this.    [Vladina] You have an upcoming meeting with Yeltsin. What do  you expect of it, what might the compromise be?    [Shaymiyev] The president and I have a normal relationship,  but our positions do not always coincide. We have agreed to  continue the negotiations and reach mutual accord. Unless my  intuition deceives me, I believe that we will have signed the  treaty before March. But on condition that no one seek seeming  advantages for himself, neither party. Repeat elections are  scheduled here for 13 March. After all, Russia also has an  interest in Tatarstan being represented in both the Duma and the  Federation Council. If Tatarstan is not represented, as today,  in either the Duma or the Federation Council, the  constitutional, legal question--where is Tatarstan--will arise.  In order that the elections be held on 13 March, therefore, the  treaty should have been signed and relations with the Russian  Federation regulated by that time. Then we also will tell our  people: We have come to an agreement, the provisions of the  relationship have been formulated, and we will take part in the  activity of the Duma and the Federation Council--in a word, in  the affairs of Russia.    [Vladina] Nine months have elapsed since our last meeting,  and I see that life in the republic is in some respects better,  in some respects more difficult. Prices have jumped. You have  not adopted shock therapy. Are not some adjustments needed  today, inasmuch as all of Russia is going a different way?    [Shaymiyev] The adjustments have already been made. We have  now released prices on many commodities. Did you notice, come to  that, that we now have the lowest prices for bread, milk, and  dairy products in Russia?    [Vladina] A very marked difference! Although there are goods  that are more expensive.    [Shaymiyev] The dairy products and bread are cheaper thanks  to subsidies. These foods should be affordable to everyone. We  are releasing the prices of other types of food, as in  neighboring regions also. But an entirely different policy is  being implemented here today: A program of targeted social  protection of the populace has been activated. A very serious  office has been created. We have converted one of our institutes  furnished with computer equipment and possessing experienced  personnel into a social studies and social problems center. A  methods system according to which not a single person must find  himself below the poverty line has been devised. According to  the data bank, the information--this includes the consumer  basket, several types of budget, minimum included, the  subsistence minimum, definition of each stratum of the  population by income, and so forth--is checked weekly (not  monthly!). It has been hard work, but we have done a good thing,  because it is now known with what and how each family is living.  It is on the basis of this information that we adopt the social  protection measures. Thus, each child, regardless of whether he  is an urban or rural inhabitant, is specifically protected here  now. There is protection also for retirees, who receive a  pension according to our procedure: If the pension is small, it  is raised to the subsistence minimum.    [Vladina] And what is the subsistence minimum here?    [Shaymiyev] It changes weekly, but has to be sufficient to  ensure not even a subsistence--we have now adopted a somewhat  higher plank--a social minimum, which includes the cost not only  of foodstuffs but also the apartment charge, utilities, the  purchase of basic necessities.    [Vladina] Do retirees travel free here?    [Shaymiyev] Thus far, yes.    [Vladina] It is said in Moscow that Tatarstan is behind in  its payment of taxes to the federal coffers and that this is why  it is better off. Is this right?    [Shaymiyev] No. We have now settled the tax affairs, having  signed in the fourth quarter with the Russian Federation an  agreement with which we are complying. But we have stuck to our  opinion here that the republics and regions should not operate  on the basis of a subsidy and that in settling up with the  Russian treasury we should keep for ourselves a necessary amount  of the revenue. We are not, therefore, nor will we be, sitting  in the corridors of the Ministry of Finance either. This also is  a firm position. There is another aspect of the matter also:  Revenue depends on work. Tatarstan is accused of not paying  sufficient taxes, but no one has inquired as to how Tatarstan is  working. How is another region laying claim to a large piece of  the pie working? How, for example, do the same 100 hectares of  land in regions that are different, but similar in terms of  climatic conditions, "work"? There is agricultural land, there  is plowland. We need to see what each 100 hectares produces--how  much grain, meat, milk, and other products. And let there be  comparisons. Many people have forgotten about this now,  unfortunately. We have high indicators. Agricultural products,  in particular, have in the past two years grown more than ever  before: from 8 to 11 percent in 1993. Without a developed  agriculture, speaking about the success of the economy of any  country with any social foundations is simply not serious.    [Vladina] You still have the previous parliament here. How  were the events in Moscow on 3-4 October evaluated here?    [Shaymiyev] The present composition of the parliament of  Tatarstan is a parliament of the perestroyka period. The entire  path that we have negotiated thus far we have negotiated via  decisions of the present parliament, beginning with the adoption  of the Declaration of State Sovereignty, the Constitution, and  all other laws. We could say that parliament is not  restructuring the economy, not adopting fateful decisions....  But this parliament cannot be blamed for this. It is essential  first to reform the Supreme Soviet. Life goes on, the multiparty  system is becoming a rule of life--these are our present  realities, whether we like it or not, whether the parties are  good or bad. And if the parties insist that elections need to be  conducted on a multiparty basis, we have to agree, their voice  has to be heard. There is an argument for early elections.    [Vladina] Is your opinion on the events in Moscow on 3-4  October identical to that of parliament?    [Shaymiyev] There can be no identical opinion at this  time--either in Moscow or in the regions or throughout Russia.  Just as there are no identical answers to the questions of the  present day. Because there is a crisis in the country. A real  crisis, which has been tackled in the most deplorable fashion.    [Vladina] You think it could have been tackled in some other  way?    [Shaymiyev] Is this an "option" if it has been paid for at  the cost of people's lives?    [Vladina] There is talk increasingly often today about  Eurasian solidarity, but for many centuries Russians and Tatars  have confirmed by deeds that living together is possible. What  is Tatarstan's contribution to this process in Russia and the  CIS?    [Shaymiyev] Half of the population of Tatarstan is composed  of Tatars, half, representatives of other nationalities. And it  has been the case for centuries that all have lived in peace and  harmony. It is not just today. There were, it is true, attempts  by various leaders of extreme forces to drive a wedge between  people in the perestroyka period. But this was unsuccessful even  under the conditions of an aggravated political situation. This  phenomenon should be studied in greater depth for future use of  the useful experience in the relations of Russia and the CIS.    Another, no less important, problem is the position of the  Russian-speaking population in the republics of Central Asia and  other republics. The problem cannot, I believe, nor need it be  resolved merely by the movement of people to Russia. If there is  a desire to leave, of course, this is another matter. But it  should be remembered that people are bound by  good-neighborliness cultivated by the life of many, many  generations.    I wondered why I had no sense of oppression or fear in  Tatarstan. This may be explained, of course, by the crime  situation, which is calmer than in other regions: People go to  the movies, the theater, the museum. Life goes on.... But it is  not this that is the main thing. Perhaps it can be explained by  belief, it is not yet exhausted! People are well disposed toward  the authorities. It is odd, but they love the president. It had  always seemed to me that a house could not be built on love  alone. For from love to hatred it is but a single step. And I  asked Mintimer Shaymiyev: Is it not frightening facing the  people's love?    "Whether they love or do not love is still open to question,  but there is a respectful attitude on the part of the absolute  majority. And I believe that people are not afraid of me.  Justifying their hopes is the main thing. And this imposes quite  a commitment!"</p>

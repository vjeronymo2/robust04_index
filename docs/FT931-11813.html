			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Greyfriars nav dips on repayment SHARES IN Greyfriars Investment dropped 2p to 15p on Friday after it announced that an early repayment of a loan note had reduced the net asset value by 5.4p. Investment trusts borrow money - 'gear up' is the jargon - when they believe that the return on equities will outweigh those on fixed interest. However, the loan note was deep discounted and its repayment entitlement is growing at 13 per cent a year. The terms of the loan notes include a covenant; although that has not been breached, the company repaid half the loan note in August last year, and has decided it was prudent to pay off the other half now.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (25): History of British films stored on database - User View WHO played the female lead in Yield to the Night in 1956? Film buffs with a lapse of memory for such details should soon see the benefits of a five-year programme at the British Film Institute, to log all its visual and historical data on an Adabas database. The SIFT (Summary of Information on Film and Television) database is unusual in two respects. It has been designed specifically for hands-on use by non-computer experts, and will be used to store visual and historical data, as well as text. Eventually, the plan is to provide terminals on desks at public libraries, with CD ROMs holding an encyclopaedia of filmographic information. The BFI has around 500 staff and a turnover of Pounds 20m, half-financed by the government, the rest coming from donations and sales. Its activities include setting up the National Film Archive, a collection of more than 170,000 films and TV programmes, some dating back to the earliest days of cinema. At present, around 130 in-house staff use the database, all through application 'front-ends.' 'We have a basic enquiry system that's very simple to use,' comments Frank Carberry, BFI's database administrator. One of the main concerns in the choice was the volume of data: everything previously had been kept on a million or so card files, sorted by film titles. This made the information inaccessible and impossibly bulky: for practical use it had to be cross-referenced. 'Basically, BFI had many sources of information - individuals, organisations, even different departments,' explains Mr Carberrry. 'Different bodies had 'packets' of information: we needed the database to bring it all together, validating the pieces of information against one another.' Because of the volume of information, database performance was a main consideration in the selection process. The BFI also had a strict spending limit. Other contenders were Oracle and Ingres, both running under the 'open' Unix operating system. BFI plumped for Adabas mainly on the grounds of speed and performance. At the time, Software AG had no Unix offering, (it has only recently delivered one), so the BFI could not benefit from the competitive pricing of various Unix hardware offerings: the best value, with promised upgradeability, was the Digital Vax. The SIFT database runs on a Digital Vax 4300 computer, though it may well need an upgrade eventually: Mr Carberry ventures that a greater number of users could create an i/o bottleneck, leading to slow response times. The BFI has done no in-house development at all: it used Software AG's consultancy, although the specification was written by computer manager Peter Rutland. One of the advantages of the database, according to Frank Carberry, has been far wider access to the data, and greater speed. Reports are far easier - for example, ad hoc reports by subject. Despite the fact that hardly any of the BFI staff had seen a computer before the project was implemented in 1988, there is great in-house enthusiasm, and now there are requests for weekend use of laptop computers.</p>

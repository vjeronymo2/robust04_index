			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Slimmer Stakis loses Pounds 3.4m STAKIS, the hotels and healthcare group where a rescue was launched last year by Sir Lewis Robertson, yesterday highlighted a 22 per cent improvement in operating profits from its core businesses as evidence that its fortunes were beginning to recover. However, the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.39m for the six months to March 29. That compared with losses of Pounds 45.1m last time after exceptional costs of Pounds 43.7m. Excluding the exceptional item, the pre-tax loss was roughly doubled, reflecting interest payments up from Pounds 8.81m to Pounds 11.8m. Sir Lewis became chairman last spring. He sacked Mr Andros Stakis, the chief executive and son of Sir Reo Stakis, the Glasgow-based company's founder and previous chairman, and embarked on slimming the group. In December Mr David Michels, formerly with Hilton International, became chief executive. Operating profit from continuing activities increased from Pounds 6.92m to Pounds 8.41m, with operating profit in hotels rising 89 per cent to Pounds 4.7m reflecting reduced overheads and improved margins. Healthcare operating profit doubled to Pounds 1.28m as nursing homes filled up and the business matured. Operating profit in casinos, which Stakis is retaining after failing to sell them at a satisfactory price, fell 36 per cent to Pounds 2.46m because of reduced takings from the Barracuda in London and from casinos in the north of England. Overall operating profit, including businesses to be discontinued, rose 13 per cent, from Pounds 7.43m to Pounds 8.38m. Because of the decision not to sell the casinos, Stakis is still negotiating with its 21 banks, some of them foreign, to roll over its debt, which has declined from Pounds 215m last September to Pounds 200m. 'In practice there has been a rolling over,' said Sir Lewis, 'but the formalities are not yet complete. The big banks have been helpful but the convoy has to move at the pace of the slowest.' As part of the recovery policy Stakis has sold its public houses and most of its restaurants, and entrusted its commercial property portfolio to the management of Co-ordinated Land and Estates, which has so far achieved sales of Pounds 4.5m. Losses per share were 1.24p (16.22p) and no interim dividend is declared (0.45p). Although analysts expect the group roughly to break even this year, Sir Lewis said that 'the signs for next full year to September 1993 are at present encouraging.'</p>

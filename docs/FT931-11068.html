			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: S&amp;P re-classifies Chrysler and GM STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, yesterday downgraded its ratings of struggling General Motors' debt but raised its ratings on Detroit rival Chrysler following the company's successful Dollars 1.78bn share offer this week. S&amp;P's action on Chrysler brought the company to within one notch of its declared goal of getting its senior debt re-classified as investment grade, rather than the more speculative 'junk' label it has now. The downgrading of GM, which follows similar action in November by the Moody's, the other leading rating agency, keeps it well within the investment grade band yet could make it more expensive for the company to borrow funds. GM's senior debt has been lowered from Single-A Minus to Triple-B Plus, while its commercial paper rating has been lowered from A-1 to A-2. GM has relied on commercial paper as an important source of cheap funds, which it then uses to offer financing on GM vehicles. S&amp;P said that GM's pension and medical liabilities were now materially larger than previously assumed and servicing these massive benefit obligations would be a 'a substantial drain on the company's financial resources . . . for the foreseeable future'. However, it added that with improving domestic demand, the negative cash-flow of 1990 to 1992 was unlikely to persist and 'further erosion in credit quality within the next few years is unlikely'. GM replied that the action came as the financial condition and liquidity of the company was showing strong positive momentum. S&amp;P, which raised Chrysler's debt rating from Single-B-Plus to Double-B when its share issue was announced on January 11, lifted it a further notch yesterday to Double-B plus. Its next grade up is Triple-B minus, which qualifies as investment grade. The action followed news that the share issue had gone well, with Chrysler selling 46m shares, rather than the 40m planned, at a price of Dollars 38 3/4 . S&amp;P said that further success by Chrysler with new product launches could allow the company to bolster financial flexibility to levels adequate to protect the company in the event of another severe downturn in automotive market conditions.</p>

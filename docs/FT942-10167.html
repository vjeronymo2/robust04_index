			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Malaysia shortlists airport contractors Ten consortia of contractors made up of local and foreign groups have been shortlisted to carry out work on a new international airport outside Kuala Lumpur. The consortia include groups from France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and the US, but none from Britain. In late February the Malaysian government imposed a ban on giving government contracts to British groups after reports critical of the Malaysian leadership appeared in the British press. Kuala Lumpur's new airport, which is priced at between MDollars 9bn and MDollars 12bn (Pounds 2.35bn - Pounds 3.1bn) is one of southeast Asia's biggest infrastructure projects. The 10 consortia are competing for a MDollars 3bn contract for work on the airport's main terminal building. The airport is due to be open by the end of 1997 but there are doubts it can be completed by then.</p>

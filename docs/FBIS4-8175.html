			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- Special Russian envoy  Vitaliy Churkin said after the talks with Srpska republic  president Radovan Karadzic in Pale this evening that "ways are  being sought to restore the peace negotiations and to find a  political solution to the current crisis."    President Karadzic said Russian diplomats would try to  bridge  the current gap between the Serb side and the UN Protection  Forces [UNPROFOR].    The talks between Churkin and Karadzic lasted almost an  hour.  The Russian envoy said he was immediately leaving for Sarajevo,  where he should meet UNPROFOR officials.    "I hope to return [to Pale] this evening to resume talks  with  president Karadzic," Churkin added.    Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic told reporters  that the previous crisis (NATO ultimatum on 20 February) had  been successfully resolved owing to Churkin.    "However, now we do not know how to find a way out of this  situation, but we know for certain that UNPROFOR has abused the  presence of UN representatives,, blamed the Serbs for the  attacks, and bombed our positions," Karadzic said.    "We do not see how we can cooperate with UNPROFOR when they  have sided with one of the sides in the civil war. However, the  Russian diplomacy will try to bridge the gap between us and  UNPROFOR," Karadzic said.    It is expected that talks between Karadzic and Churkin will  be resumed later this evening after the Russian envoy returns  from the Muslim part of Sarajevo.</p>

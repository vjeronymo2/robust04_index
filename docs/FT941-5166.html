			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Air logjam Ambitious plans for creating an open skies regime on air traffic between the US and the UK have run into difficulties. The two governments and their airlines are now bickering about who is to blame and there is a real risk of a trade war over the issue. How far yesterday's decision by British Airways to suspend further investment in its associate USAir is connected with this dispute is not clear. Commercial considerations on their own are probably explanation enough: until USAir has a viable restructuring programme in place, further investment will be money down the drain. Nevertheless, the inter-governmental wrangle can hardly have helped. An essential part of BA's strategy is to link its trans-Atlantic flights with USAir's domestic US services through 'code-sharing'. But the US has threatened to cancel this code-sharing arrangement, which comes up for renewal on March 17th, unless its airlines secure greater access to British airports, especially Heathrow. Britain, in turn, has threatened to retaliate by cutting the number of US flights to Heathrow. What on earth are two governments which profess to want a completely liberal air traffic regime between their countries up to? Unless they smarten up their act pretty sharply, they will damage the interests of trans-Atlantic passengers and lose their authority to lecture third countries about opening up their markets. The snag is that both governments' negotiating agendas have been hijacked by their national airlines. This is damaging because the airlines, quite rationally, are lobbying for their own narrow interests not their country's broader national interests. Each country's airlines would clearly prefer the other country's market to be opened while keeping their own closed. BA wants to be free to expand in the US but is determined to slow the growth of competition at its valuable hub at Heathrow. Similarly, US airlines such as Delta and American Airlines want greater access to Heathrow and other UK airports but are anxious to stall BA's growth in the US. If one airline cannot secure such unilateral opening of another country's market, they may well calculate it is better to keep both markets closed than press for an open skies regime. Partially closed skies provide them with some monopoly protection. Such an outcome, though, would not be in the broader national interest of either the US or the UK. Abolishing the current restrictions would lead to more flights between a wider range of airports in both countries. Greater competition would also drive down air fares and the consequent increase in trans'Atlantic travel would boost trade and tourism. For an open market to be negotiated, the governments will need to gain a wider perspective than that of their airlines. The prize of doing so is great and should be enthusiastically grasped.</p>

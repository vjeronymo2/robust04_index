			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Rupee falls amid speculation THE Indian rupee fluctuated wildly on foreign exchange markets yesterday amid speculation that the government would soon make the currency fully convertible for trade transactions. The government last year made the rupee partially convertible - a key part of its programme to liberalise the economy and promote foreign trade and investment. The speculation was triggered by a Reserve Bank of India announcement warning banks to avoid speculating against the rupee in foreign exchange markets. A central bank notice set a ceiling of Dollars 1m on the speculative investment commercial banks could make in foreign currencies. Since the Reserve Bank issued a similar notice just before the introduction of partial convertibility, yesterday's circular prompted rumours that an announcement on full convertibility was imminent. A leading foreign exchange dealer said: 'Full convertibility is one possibility and it is the most probable outcome.' Mr V Janakiraman, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, said last night that the stipulation was merely to prevent the building of positions in the rupee market. Earlier, when word about the Reserve Bank's notice spread around Bombay, the rupee fell in hectic trading before recovering slightly to end at Rs30.12 to the US dollar (Rs51.84 to the British pound). In the past, however, officials have said that the government's policy is to introduce full convertibility on the trade account as soon as India's foreign exchange reserves are large enough to protect the rupee against excessive price fluctuations.</p>

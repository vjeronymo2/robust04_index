			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Sunderland to be sole European producer for Nissan Micras Starter motor: Nissan's assembly plant in Sunderland is to be the sole producer in Europe for its new range of Micra cars, which was announced yesterday in Tokyo, Kevin Done and Steven Butler write. Production of the new-generation Nissan Micra, (pictured above) sold as the Nissan March in Japan, is expected to begin in the UK in the summer. Nissan is spending Pounds 150m on expanding the plant to produce the car, taking its investment in the site to Pounds 850m. The car is expected to go on sale in Europe in the late autumn. The Sunderland plant will become the sole production source for Micras to be sold in Europe and will replace exports from Japan of the existing Micra. Nissan is planning to build 35,000 new-generation Micras at Sunderland this year, with output rising to 130,000 next year. The new Micra will be added to the existing output of the Nissan Primera family car. Total output is planned to rise to 175,000 this year and 270,000 next year. The launch of the UK-built Micra will form part of Nissan's efforts to penetrate the southern European markets of Spain, Italy and France, which traditionally have been dominated by small cars.</p>

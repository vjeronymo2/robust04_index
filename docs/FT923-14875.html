			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Delors seething at 'power-mad' jibes: David Buchan meets a much-misunderstood Commission president JACQUES Delors puts a brave public face on the burgeoning debate over the Maastricht treaty's future. 'What is good about the period of ratification is that the Community will be better built with the informed participation of Europe's citizens than on indifference,' he said in an interview with the Financial Times. 'To build it on indifference would be to base it on sand.' Privately, he is still seething about the role of power-grabber into which he feels some people have cast him. In particular, he contests claims that, before the Danish vote against Maastricht, he tried to use the admission of new members into the Community as a pretext to centralise more power in Brussels, and that he only became interested in 'subsidiarity' after Denmark's vote. He is still more thin-skinned to criticism than most major politicians. But he is also more insistent than most politicians on getting his own facts right. To back up a point on northern countries' self-interest in giving the south more money, for instance, he breaks off the interview to go burrowing through his files for a figure on Iberian imports. To questions on when/how/if Maastricht might be ratified, Mr Delors maintains a Trappist silence. Denmark's future in the EC can, he says, 'only be tackled when the other 11 countries have ratified the treaty'. Britain's prime minister, John Major, showed 'a margin of prudence', he says, in remarking that Britain might not ratify the treaty this year. Mr Delors is confident that his fellow Frenchmen will approve Maastricht, but is unsure of precisely what role he will play in the September referendum campaign. The French vote will be crucial, and he turns its importance against the treaty's opponents. 'There are those in France who say France will disappear in the construction of Europe. But the fact that everyone is now looking to France shows this not to be the case.' He acknowledges that the Community's internal debate about Maastricht may put off some people in countries which have applied to join the EC. 'They must run the same risks as us ..at least they are being well-informed about what is at stake.' But Mr Delors goes on the offensive on three points: The EC budget. 'We must have the means to carry out our ambitions,' he says in support of his plan to raise EC spending by Ecu21bn (Pounds 15bn) a year by 1997-9 to meet the Community's external commitments, to close the growing gap between the competitiveness of EC companies and those of Japan, and to meet the needs of southern EC countries. Only this last goal requires genuinely new money - about Ecu8bn out of the Ecu21 bn increase - Mr Delors says. European governments would have to spend more on helping their companies and neighbouring countries, even if the Community did not exist, he points out. But the Community exists and goes on growing. 'You cannot give the same budget to a young man of 18 years as to a one-year-old baby.' Economic cohesion and convergence. The link between these two issues should interest all EC states, says Mr Delors. Giving more cohesion money, or structural economic aid, to the poorer countries helps them to build their basic infrastructure, partly by buying equipment from richer EC states. Having dug out the Iberian imports figures, he says Spain and Portugal increased purchases from other EC states by 190 per cent in 1985-90. Subsidiarity. Mr Delors says he has taken the initiative on this 'to show people that we are not in the process of building an (EC) decision-making machine that automatically grabs more and more power'. Community laws must be both necessary and comprehensible. But de-centralisation cannot be pushed too far. 'If, in the name of de-centralisation, we were to scrap Community controls on car emissions, we would be taking two serious steps backwards - breaking up the single market and hurting the cause of reducing trans-frontier pollution.' Nor, he says, should the citizen be frightened by the complexity in EC legislation, which is no greater than at the national level. 'After all, every year millions of Britons fill out tax forms based on an enormously complicated tax code.' Subsidiarity has an even stronger role to play in foreign policy. The Maastricht treaty commits the 12 states to gradually taking more 'common actions'. But Mr Delors says 'we have 12 foreign policy machines, with strong traditions and geo-political interests .. and this is not going to change overnight'. The most striking recent freelance initiative was President Mitterrand's mercy mission to Sarajevo, straight from last week's EC summit in Lisbon. Had the French president informed Mr Delors in advance? 'No, when I got back to Brussels, my wife told me she had heard about it on the radio - but I don't complain.'</p>

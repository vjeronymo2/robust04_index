			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (1): A challenge which cannot be ignored - Computer networking opens up new opportunities for business, ranging from simple electronic mail to a plethora of multimedia services Computer networking, at one time a narrowly focused, technical subject for electronics specialists, has become synonymous with a raft of profound changes which are expected to reshape business in the late 1990s. Business leaders ignore its implications at their peril. Among the expected changes are the growth of electronic channels to the customer: home shopping, for example, through video catalogues will profoundly influence retailing. The potential of the automated teller machine, widely deployed by banks and other financial institutions, has yet to be fully explored and could provide an electronic market stall for a broad range of goods and services. The ability of computer networks to overcome barriers of time and space will increasingly threaten the position of intermediates in a wide range of industries, starting with financial services. The growth of desk-top video-conferencing, now being pioneered by telecommunications companies including AT&amp;T and British Telecom as well as computer manufacturers like International Business Machines and Olivetti, seems certain to have an impact on the travel business. All of this implies drastically more flexible and higher capacity networks than those available at present. The chief technical change is expected to be be the emergence of an enterprise-wide, high speed network capable of carrying all an organisation's electronic traffic. This implies a single network capable of supporting data, voice, facsimile and video. Such a network could carry services ranging from simple electronic mail to a plethora of multimedia services. Multimedia services involve text, graphics, video and sound converted into computer language and delivered through a single interactive channel. Networks of this kind should prove more cost effective and efficient than the multiplicity of parallel networks which characterise voice and data communications in large organisations today, but they will also make possible new ways of doing business and facilitate new commercial relationships. Forrester Research, for example, a US-based consultancy, anticipates the emergence of 'social computing': 'It will consist of a new generation of telephones, televisions, and personal computers that access on-line services through a variety of networks. We assert that large firms will use social computing to build new connections to customers. Companies that do not address the emergence of this powerful new communications channel will suffer in the marketplace'. The message seems to have struck home. Mr James Cosgrove, head of AT&amp;T's data-communications services group, says customer demand for the new services is almost outstripping the company's ability to provide them: 'Their argument is: 'If I do not keep up with this, I will be at a competitive disadvantage,'' he says. Mr Cosgrove identifies at least three trends driving change. First, the convergence of computers and communications in the move from mainframe based data processing to client-server, or networked, systems: 'Routers and local area networks have changed the way people think about computing. Today, people think about networking' he says. The growth of local and wide area networks has led to the emergence of a lively group of companies which provide the hardware and software which make them work. Novell, for example, the market leader in networking software, earlier this year formed a networking alliance with AT&amp;T. Hubs, the control and management centres at the heart of local areas networks, and routers which interconnect networks are provided by Cisco, 3Com, Chipcom, Cabletron and Synoptics among others. The rates of growth of these companies illustrates the health of the sector. Chipcom turned over Dollars 48m in 1991, Dollars 87m in 1992 and Dollars 150m last year. Second, the emergence of highly mobile employees; they are more effective because they are able to spend more time with their customers. Mobile employees have to be supported with the elements of a 'virtual office' - portable computing and telephony; cellular radio links for voice and data. Third, a growth in intercompany as opposed to intra-company networking. Companies generally established data networks on a proprietary basis to disseminate information through their own organisations. Today, the aim is to share information on a much broader basis. The influence of Lotus Notes, software which enables groups of people to share and work on the same information, Mr Cosgrove says, could be compared to a new industrial revolution. The keys to many of the new possibilities are information carried in digital form so it can be stored and manipulated by computers, high bandwidth fibre optic cabling providing adequate conduits for the volume of information carried, a new generation of powerful microprocessors and, most important, an enabling technology called asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) which looks like revolutionising the way computer networks are built. It provides high speed transmission and is suitable for many kinds of traffic including voice, data, facsimile, real-time video, CD-quality audio and imaging. In the US, carriers including AT&amp;T and US Sprint are already offering their customers services based on ATM technology. In Europe, a committee led by Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, warned that Europe could not afford to be left behind. 'One important development is the integrated services digital network, ISDN. This offers the opportunity to send not only voice but also data and even moving images through telephone lines,' a committee report said. 'ISDN is only the first step. New multimedia services, for instance, high quality video communications, require even more performance. ISDN is showing the way and the next technological wave aims for the multimedia world. This is integrated broadband communications providing an opportunity to combine all media in a flexible way. The lead technology to implement this is ATM.' ATM is the latest step in a technological progression which began with packet switching in the 1970s. As the technology has improved, speed and capacity has risen inexorably. Packet switching involves the movement of labelled packets of data each of which takes the best route through a network. It works well, but it is slow. Frame relay, the current favourite, is faster. ATM gets its speed from technological improvements which mean that each packet needs only minimal addressing and minimal error correction. Most managers are aware, however, that information technology properly implemented has the potential to boost business efficiency while poorly designed and poorly implemented, it is more likely to damage a company's performance, absorbing money, creating inflexibility and taking up senior management time. This double-edged property of IT is amply demonstrated in the current growth of computer networking. On the one hand, through networking, managers have the opportunity to change the shape of their organisations for the better by the timely dissemination of information through and between companies. On the other, it not easy to accomplish. Senior managers may see parallels between the stage networking has reached today and the early days of data processing. The complexity and novelty of the changes involved requires technical skills which are in short supply. Substantial cultural barriers may have to be negotiated - and most companies today are not prepared for the structural changes which follow on from advanced computer communications. Some organisations have already decided they are not in the business of network management and have outsourced their network services to companies like AT&amp;T, BT, Cable &amp; Wireless and GEIS. If the 1970s and 1980s was the heyday of the data processing manager, it seems clear that over the next few years the network manager will take a leading role in setting a company's IT strategy.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                  NETWORKING EXPENDITURE TRENDS  ------------------------------------------------------------------- European networking expenditure trends - hardware, software and services - by vertical market, 1993-92, in percentage terms.*  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Sector                                         Per cent  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Banking sector                                   12.8 Insurance and other finance                      19.3 Discrete manufacturing                           11.5 Process manufacturing                            15.2 Health care sector                                4.6 Business and other services                      14.7 Transport, communications and utilities          10.4 Retail sector                                    20.8 Wholesale sector                                  8.2 Government departments                            8.7 Educational sector                               15.0 Other sectors                                    -2.0 Total                                            13.2  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Information communication technology (ICT): forecasts for market value in millions of ECUs in Europe for selected areas of equipment and services this year (and 1995 in brackets):*  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Local area networks, hardware       2,2033     (2,319) Data communications hardware         3,616     (3,933) Data network services               16,185    (17,279) ICT maintenance, support services   51,626    (53,866) Customer premises equipment         11,101    (11,290) Computer hardware                   39,525    (40,657) Information technology hardware     52,080    (53,403) Voice network services             101,973   (110,477) Total European IT market           125,120   (130,370) Total European ICT market          275,070   (289,620)  ------------------------------------------------------------------- *In the European Union and European Free Trade Association (Efta).  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: European Information Technology Observatory, 1994; Lyoner Strasse 18, D-60528, Frankfurt/Main, Germany  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

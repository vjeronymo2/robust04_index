			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Political Notebook: Major grits his teeth to shuffle cabinet pack Prime ministers don't like reshuffles. Choosing who sits around the cabinet table is the most powerful prerogative of their office. But contrary to intuitive wisdom they rarely enjoy exercising it. Even Baroness Thatcher found it hard to sack the disaffected and the incompetent in her governments. She did preside over one or two spectacular reshuffles - as when she cleared out the 'wets' in the autumn of 1981. But she was not as confident in wielding the knife as it may appear in retrospect - witness the survival of Lord Walker. Mr John Major's track record suggests that he finds it even harder. He did grit his teeth last year to sack Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor. But the impact of what was meant to be seen as a strong re-assertion of his authority was undercut by the timidity of the accompanying changes. His time in Downing Street has left the impression of a prime minister in the thrall of the competing factions in his party. Promotion of a good performer on the centre-left of the party must always be balanced by advancement of someone on the right. Mr Major has made no secret of his frustration - most notably with his tirade against the cabinet 'bastards'. The essential task of a reshuffle should be to improve the quality of government. This administration needs more competent, steadier ministers at all levels. But Mr Major's position is such that now he has announced his plans - and foreshadowed in the process a period of dangerous instability during the next month - he must also persuade his critics that he can be master in his own house. Lady Thatcher recounts with satisfaction in her memoirs that after her September 1981 reshuffle The Times commented in its editorial column that the impression left was that of 'the indelible stamp and style of the prime minister herself'. Mr Major needs a similar review. That brings us to the personalities. The pivotal figure in deciding the shape of the reshuffle is Mr Douglas Hurd. The foreign secretary's recent carefree demeanour has been of someone preparing to move to a more tranquil career. But he has told friends that he is not ready to jump from the Titanic. Before leaving - probably next year - he wants to drop a few anchors for for-eign policy in the late 1990s. So Mr Major's room for manoeuvre may well be limited. Mr Kenneth Clarke will remain chancellor. Mr Michael Howard has not had a good year, but seems safe at the Home Office. With those three great offices of state accounted for, the realistic option is for a radical shake-up further along the cabinet table. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, will leave one vacancy. But Mr Major needs three or four more. Mr John Patten at education, Mr Peter Brooke at heritage, Mr John MacGregor at transport, and Lord Wakeham, the leader of the Lords, are among the most obvious candidates for dismissal or retirement. If Mr Major heeds the advice of his soul-mates he might sack a 'bastard' - pour encourager les autres. But the fate of the friendless Mr Patten will be regarded by Tory MPs and ministers alike as the litmus test of the shake-up. If he stays in the cabinet Mr Major will be branded weak. If the prime minister keeps Mr Graham Bright, his parliamentary private secretary, the epithets will be a great deal harsher. The candidates for promotion to the cabinet are obvious enough - Mr Stephen Dorrell at the Treasury, Dr Brian Mawhinney at health, Mr Jonathan Aitken at defence and, possibly, Mr David Davis, the public services minister. If Mr Major is imaginative he will add Mr David Curry and Mr Jeremy Hanley to that list. Along the corridor, Lord Hesketh is said to be keen to return to government as leader of the Lords. As to the redistribution of portfolios among those who retain their places, the most important appointment will be that of party chairman. Mr Major is being urged by some to press Mr Michael Heseltine into the post. But it is more likely that he will appoint a close political ally. One intriguing possibility is Mr Tony Newton, the underrated leader of the House of Commons. Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, could move into Mr Newton's slot. Mr David Hunt is also in the race for the chairmanship. Elsewhere, Mr Michael Portillo can expect his own department, although Mr Major will not want to give the standard-bearer of Thatcherism too big a promotion. But when the dust settles in mid-July it will not be so much each individual appointment that counts. His administration has been beset by a lack of constancy for which Mr Major has often shouldered too much of the blame. Now he needs a team that will offer both competence and loyalty. Reshuffles do not have the miraculous qualities often ascribed to them. But this one will count.</p>

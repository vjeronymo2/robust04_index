			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY: THIS IS NO PLACE FOR A PICNIC  </P> <P> Let's go back to the scene of the crime: the New England Patriots locker room.  Like all NFL locker rooms, it is where the players undress, shower, dress,  gossip, play cards, stretch, read the paper, exchange head butts, meet with the  coach, emit the occasional primal scream and also where they can be interviewed  by sportswriters and their electronic-media brethren. The place smells of salve  and sweat and laundry baskets overflowing with jockstraps. You get used to the  atmosphere, but no one would ever confuse a locker room with, say, the Tulerie  Gardens. In other words, don't bring a picnic lunch.  </P> <P> On a recent day, a day not unlike any other, Lisa Olson, who covers the  Patriots for the Boston Herald, sat down for a locker-room interview with  cornerback Maurice Hurst. This is how she does her job. She and the other media  are welcome in this sanctuary, if not by all the players, then certainly by all  the owners interested in seeing stories on their teams.  </P> <P> Publicity, we need not be reminded, is what sells tickets. And, of course,  stories are what sell newspapers. It's a neat arrangement that biologists would  call symbiotic.  </P> <P> On this particular day, during the interview, five of the Patriots emerged  naked from the shower to approach Olson, taunting her with sexual insinuation  and suggestions of lewd behavior. Tight end Zeke Mowatt has been named as one  player who shook his genitals in Olson's face, asking her if she wanted to  touch them.  </P> <P> Olson has called it mind rape. Team owner Victor Kiam -- you've seen him on the  Remington commercials -- viewed it differently. Kiam, sitting comfortably on  the razor's edge of insensitivity, said the Herald was "asking for trouble" by  sending a woman reporter to the locker room and that players "can wiggle their  waggles in front of her face as far as I'm concerned." All that he didn't say  was that she should have relaxed and enjoyed it. Vic, how do you think those  Lady Remingtons are selling now?  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the waggle-wiggling continues. Olson has reported that not exactly  everyone has been supportive.  </P> <P> "I've had messages left on my machine," she told one newspaper, "telling me  that I was asking for it, that I'm a whore, that I probably sleep with the  players.  </P> <P> If the situation weren't so traumatic for Olson, it would almost be funny. What  is at work here is a terrifying flight of adolescent male fantasy. Many men,  including athletes, actually believe the women who become sportswriters make  this career decision based on a desire to see athletes naked. It is my  experience that you don't need to be a sportswriter to see athletes undressed,  unless all the women hanging around hotels with ballplayers show up just for  the free in-room movies.  </P> <P> Locker rooms are not sexy. Despite what you may have seen in "Bull Durham," the  closest thing I've noticed to sex in a locker room is a proliferation of girlie  magazines. More male fantasy. I've never known a woman sportswriter who didn't  believe that entering a locker room was the most distasteful part of her job.  To tell you the truth, most men sportswriters would say the exact same thing.  </P> <P> As far as I'm concerned, they could close the locker rooms to everyone. I've  smelled enough dirty socks, just counting the ones I'm wearing. In my perfect  world, you'd review a ballgame much as a critic reviews a movie or a play. But  the present system isn't going to change, and women are now full-fledged  members of that system.  </P> <P> Haven't we gotten past equal access? I think even Judge Souter is for it. Of  course, some make the argument that men aren't allowed in women tennis players'  dressing rooms. That's true. Neither are women sportswriters. All anyone can  ask for is an level playing field and no waggle wiggling.  </P> <P> Please understand, the locker room is not show and tell. I've never seen a  woman sportswriter try to sneak a peek, and, in fact, most athletes cover  themselves anyway.  </P> <P> Of course, there are exceptions. Back in the early '80s, four or five Los  Angeles Dodgers players had a routine in place for whenever a woman entered the  clubhouse. These players would parade naked. And they especially loved bending  over for what is called a moon shot. This is when you could really use a Lady  Remington.  </P> <P> Do you think women are lining up by the thousands to get up close and personal  with some baseball player's naked rear end? Or how far does the male fantasy  extend? Look next for a whipped cream dispenser in the clubhouse.  </P> <P> Kiam has certainly done his part to calm the situation. He called Olson "a  classic bitch." Then, in a TV interview, he said he had seen Olson hanging  around the shower room, presumably looking for -- at? -- a player.  </P> <P> "Now the story is that she got lost," Kiam said. "Well, I think most people  know what a shower is."  </P> <P> And most know what the truth is, too. Later, Kiam, confronted with the truth,  issued a statement that he didn't see Olson near the shower after all, and  neither did anyone else. Reagan called that misspeaking.  </P> <P> Now, people are talking about boycotting Patriots' games. The Boston chapter of  the National Organization for Women is calling for a boycott of all Remington  products, and Kiam will be sorry he bought any part of this business.  </P> <P> Even the slow-moving NFL will be forced to punish the guilty players. Too much  bad publicity otherwise.  </P> <P> And what of Olson? She's back in the locker room. It's her job. Trust me,  that's all it is.  </P></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Rabin seeks to revive spirit of 1948 ISRAEL'S government is coming under increasing public criticism for its failure either to stem the worsening tide of political violence or to make progress in Middle East peace negotiations. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, who last week cut short a visit to the US because of the situation at home, yesterday sought to invoke the spirit of 1948 when the State of Israel was created. He reminded the public that without the toughness shown by his generation, Israel would never have been born. 'The Israeli public must return to what it once was: a fighting nation, a coping nation, a nation which knows that in the current confrontation the winner is the one who does not tire or become seized with fear,' he earlier told the Knesset (parliament). President Chaim Herzog added his appeal for public calm. Mr Rabin won last June's general election on the twin policies of toughness on security issues and quick progress towards a negotiated peace agreement with the Palestinians. His emotional appeal to the public underlines how little progress he has made on either issue. On Monday night several Israelis were hurt in west Jerusalem as police with water cannon battled hundreds of demonstrators protesting at the government's inability to halt the wave of random stabbings by Arabs and the deaths of soldiers ambushed in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Since Mr Rabin ordered the expulsion of 415 men from the occupied territories in mid-December, 12 Israelis have been killed. During the same period Israeli forces have killed more than 70 Palestinians and wounded hundreds more. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, said talks with Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, would be held in Washington on Friday in a new effort to resolve the issue of the expelled Palestinians.</p>

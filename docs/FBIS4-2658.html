			<p>BFN     [Text] Canberra, April 11 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese delegate  said today that China "has always pursued a policy of opposing  illegal migration and trafficking."    Feng Shibin, Chinese delegate and counsellor of the Chinese  Embassy in Australia, made the remarks at a two-day informal  regional consultation on illegal migration held here today.    The consultation, hosted by the Australian Department of  Immigration, offers a forum to exchange views and information on  the problem of illegal migration in the region.    Feng said that the Chinese Government has adopted a series  of  effective measures to prevent illegal migration, including the  strengthening of legislation, the strict law enforcement,  education and economic development.    He described the illegal migration as an "international  problem," which he said "can not be solved by any single  country."    "The Chinese Government is willing to cooperate with other  countries in the effort to prevent illegal migration," he  stressed.    China, he said, maintains that all countries should further  increase their cooperation on the basis of mutual respect and  equal consultation.    Feng concluded that "normal exchanges of personnel should be  guaranteed" while cracking down on illegal migration and normal  contacts between people in different countries should be  encouraged and facilitated.    The consultation was attended by delegates from 17 nations  of  the region and the office of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees.</p>

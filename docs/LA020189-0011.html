			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The State Department condemned free-lance missions into Laos, saying such  forays "are counterproductive to efforts to fully account for Americans missing  in action." State Department spokesman Charles Redman's statement was a  response to a protest by the Laotian government about an incursion from  Thailand in early January, apparently involving one or two Americans. U.S.  officials could not identify the Americans and said they did not know if they  had been arrested. Two Americans were held by Laos last fall after crossing the  border and spreading notices of a reward for delivery of American prisoners  from the Vietnam War.  </P></p>

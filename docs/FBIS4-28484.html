			<p>BFN     [Text] At a meeting of the first subcommittee of the House  of Representatives Budget Committee held on the morning of 7  June, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai stated his views  on how to proceed with future administrative reform, saying:  "We will draw an outline for the immediate future as early as  possible by forming an effective deliberation mechanism to work  closely with the tax reform committee (of the ruling parties)."    He added: "In the long-term, a five-year plan will be  formulated."    Kumagai's remarks indicated the government plans to draw up  a  five-year administrative reform plan, and deal with it through  the implementation of a two-tier package consisting of short and  mid-to-long-term plans.    He was replying to a question asked by Noboru Usami from  Sakigake [Harbinger].</p>

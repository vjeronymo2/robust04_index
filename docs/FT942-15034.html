			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Intimidation found before Malawi poll Serious anomalies in the run-up to Malawi's elections on May 17 are noted in a report published today by a UN Joint International Observer Group, reinforcing earlier findings of the national Electoral Commission. Both bodies report intimidation, violence, bribery and theft or confiscation of voters' registration cards. The ruling Malawi Congress party emerges as the main culprit, but some opposition parties are also said to be engaged in turf wars and violent disruption of opponents' rallies. The United Nations group does not however consider the abuses it has found to be an insuperable barrier to free elections.</p>

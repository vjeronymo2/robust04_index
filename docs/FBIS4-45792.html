			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Michael Peter: "Werra and Weser </F> Remain Salty"; Subheads: "Despite Production Breakthrough in  Potash Industry Rivers Not Recovering as Much as Expected";  "Salt Load Supposed to Be Cut in Half Again by 1995"]    [Text]Duesseldorf, 8 April 1994 -- The Werra and Weser are  supposed to become living rivers again. The production  breakthrough in the Thuringian potash plants was only the first  step along the way. The salt content of the rivers can be scaled  back to a tolerable level by means of interim salt storage  underground and modern production processes.    For a decade, Federal Republic of Germany [FRG] and German  Democratic Republic [DDR] representatives negotiated over the  introduction of salt into the Werra and Weser. Lower Saxony's  environmental minister, Monika Griefahn, retrospectively sums up  the failed endeavors: "The DDR authorities at that time simply  were not interested in a solution." The change and production  breakthrough in Thuringia's potash plants instantaneously  yielded what politicians did not succeed in doing: the Werra and  Weser will continue henceforth to be spared immense loads of  salt.    In peak periods the Werra was twice as salty as the North  Sea. In 1988, from second to second, 226 kilograms [kg] of  chloride were still being introduced into the Werra, as attested  by measurements at the Gerstungen water depth gauge. Since then,  to be sure, the chloride load has diminished by about two  thirds. But even this easing of the pollution is still not  enough to establish even merely approximately ecologically  wholesome conditions in the flow of the Werra and Weser rivers.  Stephan von Keitz of the Hessian environmental ministry puts it  clearly: "As long as there is a potash industry in Germany we  will not be able to convert the Werra into a fresh water river."    In order to reduce the salt load to a tolerable amount and  to  keep the salt concentration constant, the laender bordering the  Werra/Weser and federal environmental ministry are applying 70  million German marks [DM] to finance the construction of  temporary storage sites for saline solutions at the East German  potash centers of Merkers and Unterbreizbach. On weekdays the  reservoirs are filled with salt water that is flushed into the  Werra on "salt-free" weekends.    Additionally, in the future underground storage of saline  solutions in geological cavities of the dolomite slab is  supposed to be used in Thuringia too. In Hesse the "subterranean  bathtubs" are used as final storage sites for the saline  effluents, whereas in Thuringia they are supposed to be used as  temporary storage. If the Werra carries less water, the "tubs"  are filled with saline solution. When more water is being  carried the liquid effluent from the potash production is then  pumped into the river. Hence the Werra in the final analysis is  not spared a single ton of salt but the concentration of  chloride can be kept constant. In this context, Juergen Hulsch,  a water expert in the Lower Saxony environmental ministry,  comments that the "buffering of the salt shocks" may often be  more important for the Werra's and Weser's biosystem than the  absolute salt load.    An attempt at temporary underground storage is supposed to  begin this week. The appropriate Thuringian water authorities  still have not granted approval. They are afraid that the  drinking water will be put at risk by the temporary submersion.  Earlier in Hesse, slightly salty, standing water showed up in  the cavities at the surfaces where the saline effluents of the  potash industry were submerged.    While only the salt concentration in the river can be kept  constant using temporary storage, modern production processes  make it possible to reduce the salt load much more effectively.  Currently in Thuringia, potash (potassium chloride, KCl) is  washed out. In a second wash cycle kieserite (magnesium sulfate)  is separated from rock salt (NaCl). Hans-Joachim Scharf, an  employee of Kali und Salz AG in Kassel explains: "Such washing  of kieserite accounts for the accumulation of large quantities  of saline effluents." The flotation process solves the salt  separation much more elegantly: tiny air bubbles on the surfaces  of the kieserite crystals give buoyancy to the kieserite. "It  can be siphoned off as foam, while rock salt accumulates as  solid residue and can be stockpiled," is Sharf's description of  the process.    The flotation process common in West German potash plants is  now also being applied in Thuringia. On the other hand, the  situation is otherwise with the electrostatic raw salt  separation process [ESTA] that Kali und Salz AG has been using  for a long time in West Germany. In the mostly effluent-free  ESTA process, the different electrostatic charge of the salt  minerals contained in the raw salt is exploited. In the initial  stage rock salt is separated from the other salt minerals. In  subsequent stages kieserite is separated from potash. Alfred  Heinz, a chemist and potash specialist in Thuringia's  environmental ministry, believes that high costs account for the  ESTA process not being used in Thuringia's potash plants.    Two-thirds less saline effluent results from the ESTA  process. The other side of the coin is that the salt has to be  stockpiled. According to Scharf, nearly 10 million tons [t] of  waste salt were stockpiled in West Germany in 1992. Four million  tons of salt were buried or introduced into the Werra. Clearing  the stockpiles and compressing them back into the mines that  have been worked is in fact possible and even done occasionally.  According to Scharf, however, it is now universally feasible for  economic reasons and would signal the end of potash production.  The same argument applies to a solution proposed as early as the  mid-seventies: creation of a salt-water pipeline from the Werra  directly into the North Sea.    Actually, the international potash market is marked by  overcapacity and declining earnings. Mining in the German pits  is steadily waning: between 1988 and 1993 total German demand  dropped from 5.8 million t of K2O to three million  tons of K2O. Hence, more potash was produced in the  GDR than the merger of Kali und Salz (west) and Mitteldeutsche  Kali (east) is at present jointly producing.    Despite all the economic difficulties the endeavors of the  laender bordering the Werra/Weser and the federation are  pointing the way. Accordingly, the chloride presently being  introduced into the Werra has to be reduced from nearly 70  kilograms [kg]/second [s] to 40 kg/s by 1995. Over the medium  term this value should be cut in half once more. In terms of  concentration this signifies 2,500 milligrams [mg] of chloride  per liter of water in the Werra at the Gerstungen water depth  gauge in 1995. In this connection chloride is merely the  principal parameter for analysis, the actual amount of salt  totals nearly twice as much.    Federation and laender want to achieve a value of 500  mg/liter [l] for the Weser. Hulsch emphasizes: "As a result we  will get just below the threshold of biological disruption. That  would be tremendous progress considering that the Weser has now  been virtually dead." Still, even then the city of Bremen would  not be able to derive any potable water from the Weser since,  according to potable water guidelines, the chloride  concentration is not allowed to exceed 200 mg/l.</p>

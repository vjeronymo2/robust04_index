			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARTERING RECOGNITION FOR PUTATIVE POWS?;  </P> <P> VIETNAM NOW: A CASE FOR NORMALIZING RELATIONS WITH HANOI BY JOHN LEBOUTILLIER  INTRODUCTION BY RICHARD M. NIXON (PRAEGER: $18.95; 144 PP.)  </P> <P> This book calls for the United States to normalize diplomatic relations with  the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, immediately and without preconditions. In  his dedication, the author reveals what he considers the principal benefit to  be derived from this action: "To the hundreds of American Prisoners of War,  still held against their will, who will be freed only when there is a new  relationship between Washington and Hanoi." The U.S. policy of economic and  diplomatic isolation of Vietnam since 1975, he contends, has thrust Hanoi into  the arms of Moscow and increased the Soviet presence in Southeast Asia.  </P> <P> This flawed U.S. policy of hostility to Hanoi has been imposed, the author  asserts, by a clandestine group of second-level officials within the Executive  Branch with links to the CIA. This cabal, whose adherents shared a common  experience during the Vietnam War, still is angry that the United States lost  the War in Congress and on the American streets, the author believes, and is  punishing Hanoi with harsh measures of isolation.  </P> <P> The author, John Leboutillier, is a right-wing former Congressman from New York  who served one term in Congress, from 1981 to 1983. For the past six years he  has been president of a group called Account for POW/MIAs Inc., which proclaims  itself "dedicated to bringing home living American POWs still held in  Indochina."  </P> <P> While Leboutillier's call for normalization with Hanoi is not without merit,  his fundamental assumption is doubtful and his political analysis twisted. He  provides no evidence that American prisoners are alive in Indochina. No sources  are cited for his assertions -- the book is devoid of footnotes. Professionals  within the U.S. government who have been responsible for investigating the  POW/MIA issue since the Communist takeover of Indochina in 1975 point out that  there is minimal possibility that any American POWs are alive in Indochina.  </P> <P> The Carter Administration's position from 1976 to 1981, following careful  investigation of all leads about POW/MIAs, was encapsulated in the official  statement: "There is no credible evidence to indicate that any Americans are  currently held against their will in Indochina." A Select Committee of the  House of Representatives on Missing Persons in Southeast Asia, after a 15-month  investigation which began in September of 1975, concluded that "no Americans  are still being held alive as prisoners in Indochina, or elsewhere, as a result  of the war in Indochina." However, many specialists on the MIA/POW issue in  both Congress and the executive branch believe that Hanoi may possess  information and possibly the remains of American POW/MIAs which it has not yet  provided to U.S. authorities.  </P> <P> Even former President Nixon, who provides an introduction to this book,  expresses doubt about the author's contention, noting, "I do not share the  author's optimism that Americans are still alive in Indochina." Nixon does make  the argument that Hanoi must account for all of the MIAs before the United  States normalizes relations. But on this score also, Nixon disagrees on "timing  and tactics" with Leboutillier, who insists that the United States should  establish diplomatic relations with Hanoi without preconditions.  </P> <P> Despite the weight of evidence that no American POW/MIAs remain alive in  Indochina, a suspicion to the contrary continues to haunt segments of the  American public, the armed services and the Congress. It is understandable that  families who have lost a husband or son in Indochina would cling to the hope  that he is still alive. The issue has been kept active by a small but well  organized pressure group, the National League of Families of American Prisoners  and Missing in Southeast Asia. Popular films like "Rambo" and TV features about  MIAs have sustained the belief of some that Americans are being held captive in  Indochina.  </P> <P> The Reagan Administration, reflecting President Reagan's strong personal  interest in the MIA question, altered the approach of the Carter Administration  with the following announcement: "Although we have thus far been unable to  prove that Americans are still detained against their will, the information  available to us precludes ruling out that possibility." The Bush Administration  appears to be continuing the approach of its predecessor. Thus, in the absence  of reliable guidance from authoritative government sources that the chances are  minimal that American prisoners remain alive in Indochina, political  pronouncements like those found in this book will continue to cloud the issue  of U.S. relations with Vietnam.  </P> <P> There are sound reasons of U.S. national interest to give serious consideration  to normalization of diplomatic relations with Hanoi. Cyrus Vance, President  Carter's Secretary of State, pursued negotiations for normalization of  relations with Hanoi, but these efforts gave way to U.S. normalization  negotiations with Beijing, spearheaded by former National Security Adviser  Zbigniew Brzezinski, which took priority.  </P> <P> When negotiations with Vietnam resumed and almost had reached fruition, they  were postponed indefinitely when Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December of 1978.  The United States subsequently put forth the condition that Vietnam must  withdraw its troops from Cambodia before normalization could proceed. Now that  Vietnam has apparently withdrawn its troops (a development not treated in this  book, since it went to press before the Vietnamese withdrawal), there is reason  for reconsideration of normalization.  </P> <P> Certain bilateral issues of concern to the United States, such as the  emigration of Amerasians, the treatment of political prisoners, the orderly  departure of refugees, and visas to Vietnam for Vietnamese refugees living in  America, as well as securing information about POW/MIAs, could be handled  directly with Hanoi. The United States might open channels through which Hanoi  could reduce its dependence upon the Soviet Union, if gradually, and increase  Vietnam's potential for peaceful cooperation with its Southeast Asian neighbors  and the West, a goal which the new Vietnamese leadership has publicly embraced.  </P> <P> However, as long as China remains hostile to Vietnam, Hanoi should be expected  to retain a close relationship with the Soviet Union that will serve as a  counterweight to the threat from China. Nevertheless, terminating the isolation  of Hanoi and drawing it into the rapidly developing world of Southeast Asia  could reduce tensions, help with the solution of the refugee problem, and  increase the potential for stability in the region.  </P></p>

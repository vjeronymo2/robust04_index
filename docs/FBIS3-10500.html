"I do not believe we have to anticipate so much," Chamorro  said when asked about her Costa Rican colleague's statements  over the past weekend. Calderon said he disagreed with  Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Pallais' arguments for  charging a $5.00 fee for every tourist coming from Costa Rica on  the San Juan River.    "We will wait and see what happens" with Costa Rican  President Jose Maria Figueres Olsen, who will be sworn in on 8  May, Chamorro said in brief statements to the media after  inaugurating a seminar on juveniles in prison.    Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister Pallais said Calderon  Fournier's statements were "exaggerated" and considered it  unnecessary to go to The Hague to solve their differences  regarding the San Juan River. Nicaragua "is free to take the  measures it considers appropriate in its territory, and Costa  Rica must respect our decisions," Pallais told reporters when he  referred to the immigration controls implemented by the  Nicaraguan Government at the river, which is the border between  both countries.    Last week Pallais asserted that the "Canas-Jerez" treaty  signed in the last century "only" gives Costa Rica the right to  navigate freely on the river for commercial purposes, not for  tourism.</p>

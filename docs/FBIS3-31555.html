			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 21 (AFP) -- United Nations forces in  Sarajevo are Monday [21 February] to verify the continuing  withdrawal of Bosnian Serb heavy weapons and to consolidate  their positions around the battered capital.    UN officials late Sunday confirmed that both Bosnian Serb  and  Moslem forces had sufficiently complied with a NATO ultimatum to  remove their artillery units from around the city by 0000 GMT  Monday.    As a result, they said, there was no immediate need for NATO  warplanes to carry out threatened air strikes.    General Andre Soubirou, UN commander for Sarajevo, expressed  satisfaction that in the 10 days since the NATO ultimatum was  issued Bosnian Serb units had handed over 225 weapons to UN  control and the mainly Moslem Bosnian army 43.    While some weapony does remain within a 20-kilometer (12.5  mile) Sarajevo exclusion zone imposed by NATO, United Nations  officers on Sunday minimized its importance.    UN troops on Monday will be flown by helicopter to the nine  Serb military sites -- out of 41 -- that they had been unable to  inspect by the end of the day Sunday because of heavy snow.    From first light reconnaissance aircraft will also return to  action, and according to Soubirou, "we should have a precise  idea of the situation by the end of the morning."    At the 10 weapons collection points already established --  eight for the Serbs and two for the Moslems -- armed UN guards  have orders to use force to prevent any party from recovering  them.    NATO air strikes are also possible if UN ground troops  holding the weapons come under attack.    Monday should also see the arrival outside Sarajevo of a  second contingent of the 400 Russian peacekeeping troops whose  deployment had been sought by the Serbs in exchange for  compliance with the NATO ultimatum.    A first contingent has since late Sunday been stationed near  Grbavica, where they are to deploy.</p>

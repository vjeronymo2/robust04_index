			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / No second trial for Seelig and Spens FORMER MERCHANT bankers Mr Roger Seelig and Lord Spens will not face a further trial on fraud and false accounting charges arising from the Guinness takeover of Distillers in 1986, the Serious Fraud Office said yesterday. On Tuesday, 4 1/2 months after their trial began, Mr Justice Henry discharged the jury because Mr Seelig could no longer defend himself adequately. He said two psychiatrists believed that, because of the mental, physical and emotional strain Mr Seelig was suffering, there was a risk that he might do 'something irrevocable' if the trial went on. Miss Elizabeth Gloster QC, for the SFO, told the judge that Mrs Barbara Mills QC, SFO director, had decided not to subject either Mr Seelig or Lord Spens to a second trial. 'It appears to her that, in the light of the medical evidence relating to Mr Seelig's mental condition, it is not realistic to suppose that he will be in an adequately fit mental state to endure a long trial within the reasonably foreseeable future, and that, even if . . . he were to recover sufficiently within a reasonable period of time to face a second trial, there would be a real and substantial risk of a recurrence of the same problems.' In those circumstances Mrs Mills had asked Sir Patrick Mayhew QC, the attorney-general, to consider directing that a nolle prosequi, which halts proceedings but is not equivalent to an acquittal, be entered to stay the proceedings against Mr Seelig, and that had been done. Miss Gloster said Lord Spens was in a different position as his health did not appear to prevent him standing trial again. 'However, Lord Spens has already had to face the strains of a long trial which finally aborted, through no fault of his own, without a verdict.' Mrs Mills therefore had to consider whether, 'notwithstanding that she remains satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to proceed against Lord Spens, the public interest requires him to be subjected to the rigours of a second lengthy trial.' Her decision was that it did not, Miss Gloster said. 'The events which gave rise to the charges against Lord Spens happened some six years ago. His alleged culpability as one of several recruits to the illegal share-support scheme may be regarded, in comparative terms, as of lesser gravity than that of those who took the centre-stage position. It could be regarded as unfair to proceed to a second trial at which Mr Seelig was absent.' In addition, Mrs Mills had taken into account the costs to the public of a retrial. 'Accordingly,' Miss Gloster said, 'the director has decided that, in the very special circumstances of this case, the prosecution should not offer any further evidence against Lord Spens in respect of the counts in this indictment.' The judge then sat in private to hear an application by Lord Spens that the judge enter a formal not guilty verdict against him. That was adjourned until Friday. Outside the court Lord Spens said the position was very unsatisfactory. 'The collapse of this trial has absolutely nothing to do with me. Mr Seelig has been discharged and I am in limbo as to whether I have been acquitted and whether I can get costs.'</p>

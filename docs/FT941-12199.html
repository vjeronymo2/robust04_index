			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Banks make cautious moves to try to win more friends Customers expecting an instant transformation in the behaviour of banks as a result of the new code of banking practice, to be published next week, should not hold their breath. The fact it is called a 'second edition' of the code rather than a new version shows it is not a fresh start, but a refinement of the original code published two years ago. Specific improvements will be made. These include plans for banks to introduce pre-notification of charges for personal customers, and tighter rules on how they may obtain the consent of their customers to pass on account details to other parts of the group. The governing principles of the code - that banks should be fair and reasonable in their dealings with customers - are to be incorporated in the code itself, to promote greater compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of the guidance. Banks will also do more to ensure that both customers and staff are aware of the code's provisions. The changes are the result of a tortuous process. An independent advisory committee led by Sir George Blunden, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, made recommendations late last year to a working party representing banks and building societies. That working party, comprising members from the British Bankers' Association, the Building Societies Association and the Association of Payment Clearing Services, came to its own views on the recommendations. The new code will be published by the three associations, after consultation with their own members. Sir George believes that bankers have improved since work on the original code began in 1990. 'I have been much impressed with the change in attitude of the banks between four years ago and now, about the importance of a good code in improving bank-customer relationships,' he says. Those involved in the discussions say the banks rejected the review committee's advice in only one minor respect, and in many areas - pre-notification of charges included - they went beyond the recommendations. The commercial logic for banks of improving relations with personal customers - or at least with certain types of customer - has become increasingly evident. Competition is intensifying for customers who are confident enough in the service from their bank or society that they look to those institutions for a range of financial services. But the code can also conflict with those competitive pressures. The annual report from Sir George's committee on its enforcement, published last July, for example criticised Barclays Bank which had been requiring customers applying for new accounts, credit cards or loans to sign forms consenting to account information being given to other companies within the Barclays group. Barclays has said that it will change its ways, and produce new forms enabling customers to 'opt in' to agreeing that information about their account may be distributed, but these are not yet in use. The conflict is one example of the limitations of the voluntary system, particularly as it is intended to act as a substitute for statutory guidelines. The code resulted from the work of the Jack committee in the late 1980s on banking law. That recommended a statutory code of practice for banks' relations with private customers. The government did not want to legislate on this, and agreed with the associations that instead there should be a voluntary code based on recommendations from an independent advisory committee. The Treasury's continuing ability to legislate has given it influence in the discussions on revising the code. Its wishes have been heeded sufficiently for the government to continue to back the current system. In the absence of a move to legislation, the voluntary arrangement has some value for customers as the best code they have. For banks and societies it has a value also in diffusing pressure for a more draconian system.</p>

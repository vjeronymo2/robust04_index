			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain 2nd Rank Oleksandr Shcherbakov under the </F> rubric "Our Special Correspondents Report From Sevastopol": "In  the Interests of the State and the Institute"]    [Text] The teachers and cadets of the power-engineering  department of the Sevastopol Naval Institute imeni P.S. Nakhimov  have launched another semester under new conditions. Qualitative  changes in the training programs of the specialists for both the  fleet and for the national economy have taken place under the  supervision of department chief Captain 1st Rank V. Kiryachenko.    The Department of Electric-power Engineering (Chief, Captain  1st Rank S. Smyrnov), for example, has begun to train nuclear  engineers for Derzhkomatom [State Committee for Nuclear Power].    The instructors of the Department for the Operation and  Repair of Ships, under the supervision of Captain 1st Rank A.  Lobanov, have developed a comprehensive program for shipbuilding  and ship repairs for all of Ukraine, and have begun to train  cadets in it.    A program under which the training of frogmen instructors  for  the military and civilian fleets is conducted has been  introduced in the Department of Underwater Training and  Shiplifting (chief, Captain 2nd Rank V. Holovin).    These facts testify to one thing--that the Sevastopol Naval  Institute is being reformed in the interests of the state and  the fleet, and also in the interests of the professors,  instructors and cadets of the SVMI.</p>

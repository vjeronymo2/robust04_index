			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: KLM tumbles 11.6% in second quarter KLM Royal Dutch Airlines reported an 11.6 per cent decline in net profit for the second quarter and cautioned for the first time that it expects to post a loss for the whole of 1992-93. It blamed the downturn during the traditionally strong summer months of July to September on the lower dollar, continued losses at its 20 per cent-owned Northwest Airlines of the US, and narrower margins due to fierce fare wars. Net profit fell to Fl 170.1m (Dollars 100m) in the second quarter from Fl 192.5 a year earlier, reducing first-half net profit to Fl 208.5m from Fl 328.4m. The result was better than many analysts had predicted, and KLM's shares closed slightly higher at Fl 22.50 compared with Wednesday's close of Fl 22.10. The adverse effects of fare wars and currency movements were expected to be 'reinforced' in the second half of 1992-93 ending March 31. Despite prospects of continued traffic growth and the positive influence of the airline's cost-cutting efforts, KLM said it saw an unspecified loss for the full year. In KLM's second quarter, turnover rose by 6 per cent to Fl 2.29bn, but costs increased by 7 per cent to Fl 2.06bn, causing operating profit to fall to Fl 232.8m from Fl 242.6m a year earlier. Financial charges nearly doubled to Fl 105m from Fl 55.6m, reflecting an increase in long-term debt, higher interest rates, lower interest income and added interest expenses resulting from the consolidation of KLM's stake in Air Littoral of France since January 1.</p>

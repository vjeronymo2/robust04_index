			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn/Salonika (DPA) -- The Federal Government is  calling for a European harmonization of asylum laws. This is  necessary in order to keep the negative effects of national  measures on other member states as small as possible, Kurt  Schelter, state secretary in the FRG Interior Ministry, stated  at a two-day informal meeting of the interior ministers of the  European Union [EU] in Salonika on Friday [6 May].    In addition, it is, above all, necessary to develop a common  attitude toward returning and integrating civil war refugees,  the head of the German delegation said, according to a press  release by the FRG Interior Ministry. The "priorities in this  field were discussed in different ways at the conference," the  press release adds.    The creation of instruments for a more fair sharing of the  burden in coping with refugee problems is urgently necessary  within the European Union. Germany is willing to make  constructive contributions to coming to terms with the pressure  of immigration. The indispensable precondition for that is that  the member states must first set down the conditions for the  acceptance of legal immigrants.    Stilianos Papathemelis, Greek minister of public order,  stated that the external borders of the European Union must be  better protected from illegal immigrants and stricter checks of  refugees must be introduced in EU countries.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Battle looms over Italy's new securities law - The controversy surrounding the so-called SIM requirement After years of foreign jibes about their 'cowboy' financial markets, Italy's lawmakers have reacted angrily to demands from abroad for urgent changes to securities legislation which has just taken effect. Named after the Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (SIM) - the novel type of securities trading house it creates - the legislation has been vilified by foreign bankers who claim it is anti-competitive and breaches the Treaty of Rome. The problem lies in a section of the law obliging foreign securities houses operating in Italy to set up a SIM. The requirement covers both equity trading on the domestic market and even the sales of securities, of any type, to Italian investors other than SIMs and banks. Foreign criticisms have been taken up by the European Commission. Following a meeting of senior EC officials in Brussels last Friday, the dispute could lead to a fight in the European Court if a solution is not found soon. A letter to the Commission this week from Mr Gianni De Michelis, the Italian foreign minister, hinted at some possibility of relaxing the rules for companies providing financial services from abroad, but that may not be enough for the Commission. The outcry has been led by big City of London-based UK and US investment banks. Rather than covering the continent with separate trading operations, many have centralised their securities trading activities in London. For Mr Neil Matthewson, a director of the British Merchant Banking and Securities Houses Association, the Italian requirement to set up a SIM infringes the Treaty of Rome. 'The point has been raised by many of our members, which are mainly major investment banks and securities houses doing cross-border business, and they are concerned about the costs involved in being obliged to set up new Italian operations,' he said. Similar misgivings are voiced by the International Securities Market Association (formerly called the Association of International Bond Dealers) as well as individual banks. A lawyer at one London-based house says the SIMs law puts foreigners at a huge disadvantage. 'So far, it hasn't been enforced by the Italian authorities. Nor has a counter-party said it won't trade with us because we're not a SIM. But it could happen soon'. Even more of a nightmare for the banks is the possibility that counter-parties might try to use the law to repudiate a long-term transaction such as a swap. Last September the UK government complained formally to the European Commission. Mr John Redwood, the minister of state for corporate affairs, said the local incorporation requirement of the SIMs law was an 'unacceptable' barrier to the freedom of establishment and the free provision of services under the Treaty of Rome. 'I hope the Commission will take the necessary action to encourage the Italian government to take steps to repeal this bad law,' he added. Last December, the Commission issued a formal warning. It argued that the law's provision requiring companies to incorporate in Italy appeared to violate Articles 52 and 59 of the Treaty of Rome, and the relevant sections should be suspended. The SIMs law took effect unchanged in January. With deadlines for an Italian response slipping past, the SIMs law was one of the top items on the agenda at a regular Commission meeting last Friday to examine possible infringements of EC rules. However, the matter was postponed for a month. Officials in Brussels stress the stay of execution implies no softening in their position. Mr De Michelis's letter is now being examined. But if no real progress is made, the Commission will issue a 'reasoned opinion', setting out why it believes EC rules had been breached. Failing remedial action, a referral to the European Court could follow. The response in Italian financial circles has been chilly so far. After spending years reforming their securities markets, the calls for change have not gone down well. With competition from London a growing threat domestically, many brokers have preferred to attack the UK market rather defend the new Italian rules. Mr Attilio Ventura, the chairman of the stockbrokers' committee at the Milan bourse, said: 'The initiative reveals above all the internal weakness of the UK market, which no longer feels dominant and takes increasing note instead of competition from other financial centres.' Reactions at Consob, Italy's companies and stock market watchdog, have been more measured. According to a top official, no foreign governments objected to the SIMs law during its three-year gestation period. 'The UK authorities knew about the draft rules from the start. The article they object to was in from the outset and was never changed.' The rush to the law's defence is understandable. The legislation is the central part of a series of long-awaited measures to reform of Italy's securities markets, including banning insider trading and protection for minorities in takeover bids. 'The SIMs law is designed to create transparency and order,' says Consob. That could only be done by requiring securities trading to be concentrated through a SIM. 'Until the Community's Investment Services Directive - which allows for national supervision of all financial intermediaries by the AUTHOrites in their home country - comes into effect, we have no choice but to demand trading be carried out through a SIM,' Consob continues. Some foreigners reject the transparency argument as a cover for protectionism. 'The Italians know London is Europe's securities trading centre and that Italian banks are still minnows there. This way, they hope to win back some securities business and gain time until a few domestic institutions grow strong enough to take a bigger role in international markets,' claims one London-based dealer Consob disagrees. 'We didn't even know there were so many operators selling to Italians from abroad,' says the official, somewhat disingenuously. 'Our priority was greater transparency better supervision, not protectionism'. Italians' bitterness that they are being singled out is backed by claims that incorporation rules in France and Spain are tougher than the SIMs law. However, the Commission believes the SIMs law is more restrictive than others. Neither side looks ready to back down. With general elections due in April, the Italians would find it difficult to change the law quickly, even if they wanted to. Mr De Michelis's letter may represent a step forward. But failing a compromise, the battle looks set to intensify.</p>

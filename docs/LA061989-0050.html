			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOTT OSTLER: AS LONG AS GIBSON CAN RUN, DODGER SPIRIT WILL BURN BRIGHT  </P> <P> Showtime lives in Los Angeles, and as long as it stays alive, the Dodgers will  not be out of the pennant race.  </P> <P> Kirk (Showtime) Gibson, dropped from his leadoff spot in the batting order  Sunday when second baseman Willie Randolph took the day off to nurse an injury,  continued to intimidate, unnerve, outrun and out-think the opposition.  </P> <P> On Old-Timers Day at Dodger Stadium, Gibson inspired memories of one Dodger  old-timer who was in attendance in spirit only.  </P> <P> "Gibson is a manufacturer of runs," Manager Tom Lasorda said after the Dodgers'  5-3 win over the Braves. "He is as good at manufacturing runs as anyone I've  seen since Jackie."  </P> <P> That's Jackie Robinson, for you youngsters. The late Mr. Robinson is best known  for integrating baseball, of course. But the men he played with and against  speak reverently of his fire on the bases.  </P> <P> Nobody in the stadium ever rested when Jackie Robinson got on base. He was  daring, arrogant, alert and defiant. He wanted to bother the opposition, rattle  them, anger them.  </P> <P> Gibson comes at you with the same basic pain-in-the-fanny style. Sunday he  walked twice, bunted for a hit, stole a base, stretched a straight single into  a double and caused a Dodger run to score when it shouldn't have.  </P> <P> With Jose Gonzalez on first base in the fifth, Gibson drew a walk, but ball  four was inside and got past catcher Jody Davis, a wild pitch. Gibson sprinted  to first, Gonzalez rounded second and broke hard for third, Gibson rounded  first and broke hard for second, drawing a long throw from the backstop that  allowed Gonzalez to score.  </P> <P> That's what baseball people mean by manufacturing a run. It's a dull term for  an exciting play. They make it sound like the run was created in a factory in  the City of Commerce and shipped via UPS to Dodger Stadium, signed for by  clubhouse man Nobe Kawano.  </P> <P> In reality, "manufacturing" is the kind of action that makes a day at the  ballpark worthwhile. As Lasorda said, "I would pay to see Kirk Gibson play  baseball."  </P> <P> Gibson has simply been wearing out the opposition. In six games batting  leadoff, he manufactured seven hits, seven walks and scored six runs.  </P> <P> Sunday, still in a leadoff frame of mind despite batting third, he was four for  four in getting on base, and boy, were the Braves tired of seeing Gibson's  scraggly face out there on the bases.  </P> <P> When Gibson gets on base, even by a walk, all bets are off, all rules of  civility are suspended. It's Showtime.  </P> <P> It's roller-derby baseball, although Gibson wishes to stress that what he does  should not be construed as mindless abandon, but calculated risk-taking.  </P> <P> "The key to baserunning," he said, "is to give yourself the opportunity. If I  don't run hard to first (on the wild-pitch ball four), I can't try for second.  </P> <P> "You don't run yourself into outs, but you gotta force the issue sometimes. I'm  running to second (on the wild pitch) because I know Jose Gonzalez is running  to third, that S.O.B."  </P> <P> S.O.B., of course, is a compliment in this context.  </P> <P> Although he has been here a season and a half, Gibson has never embraced the  SoCal jogging mentality. He has two speeds: Painful Limp, and Damn the  Torpedoes.  </P> <P> Lasorda's insertion of Gibson into the leadoff spot seven games ago may have  been a move borne of desperation, and it certainly violated the baseball rule  of never putting your most productive power hitter at the top of the order. But  it was a masterful move.  </P> <P> As Mike Tyson will tell you, you should come with your most powerful punch  right from the bell. If I was Dodger manager, I would want to expose the  opposition to Gibson as quickly as possible. I would not only bat him leadoff,  I would have him take the lineup card up to home plate, preferably going into  the dish spikes-high.  </P> <P> Will Lasorda put Gibson back at leadoff in the future?  </P> <P> "It's a possibility, yeah," said Tofu Tommy.  </P> <P> If you've paid any attention to Gibson, you probably know what he had to say  Sunday about his preference of spots in the batting order.  </P> <P> "I could care less," he said. "With my speed, my job is to get on base, move  the defensive alignments. It changes the game when I get on base."  </P> <P> When Gibson gets on base, you can almost hear the opposition moan and grumble,  you can almost see them twitch and lean forward just a bit.  </P> <P> Baseball is a peaceful, predictable game until Gibson enters the fray. If  you're on the other team, he ticks you off, wears you out. Who the hell does he  think he is, sliding into second on an obvious single? Damn hotdog.  </P> <P> If the opposition can't rest, neither can Gibson's teammates. How would you  like to be the kid, Gonzalez, had Jose sauntered into second base on that wild  pitch that Gibson turned into a two-baser?  </P> <P> It would have been the last sauntering the young man would have done on this  team. Gibson would have pulled Jose aside and explained the facts of life,  i.e.: Know the situation. Give yourself the opportunity. Run, don't saunter.  </P> <P> With Mike Marshall out of the lineup with a bad back and Eddie Murray slumping,  the only way the Dodgers can stay in the race is through the marvel of  manufacturing.  </P> <P> Sunday they gave a clinic on that facet of baseball, and wherever he was,  Jackie, the Master Manufacturer, must have been smiling.  </P></p>

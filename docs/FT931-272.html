			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK presses Iraq on UN demands BRITAIN insisted yesterday that Iraq would have to comply in full with United Nations resolutions, whoever was in power in Baghdad, our Foreign Staff writes. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, made clear the policy towards Iraq remained unchanged. His comments followed reports that Britain was divorcing itself from past policies which insisted that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had to be out of power before international sanctions were lifted. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'The government's policy towards Iraq is unchanged and will remain the same, whatever regime is in power in Baghdad. 'Iraq must fully comply with all its international obligations. This means full implementation of all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.' Mr Hurd had made this clear in a meeting with leaders of the Iraqi national congress, who are in London on a private visit. But the spokeswoman acknowledged that President Saddam was unlikely to comply with all the relevant resolutions and had evaded his obligations for the past two years. She said Britain's UN ambassador, Sir David Hannay, had stressed there were no grounds for lifting sanctions against Iraq while many requirements were still outstanding. The UN sanctions committee agreed on Monday night at its periodic review to maintain the sanctions against Iraq which were imposed in August 1990 when Baghdad's troops invaded Kuwait. The UN still wants Iraq to comply with demands over respecting the border with Kuwait, co-operating with the special commission on its weapons of mass destruction, returning Kuwait's military property. It also wants an end to repression of the civilian population.</p>

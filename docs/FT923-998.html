			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Asia-Pacific group embraces the inevitable: Apec's loose form gets a permanence that reflects region's growing integration THE Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group is beginning to think big. Washington sent only a low-powered delegation to the group's fourth annual meeting in Bangkok this month. Although ministers from Apec's 14 other members were not entirely happy, they made sympathetic noises about the Bush administration's electoral preoccupations; Mr James Baker had left the State Department and was running Mr George Bush's presidential election campaign, while Ms Carla Hills, US trade representative, was said to be tied up with her daughter's wedding. But the ministers carried on regardless, agreeing on the creation of an Apec secretariat in Singapore with a maximum budget of Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.2m) in its first year and pressing ahead with exploratory plans for regional trade liberalisation. A small group is to prepare a blueprint for trade and investment co-operation in the Asia-Pacific region to the year 2000. It will report to Apec ministers at next year's meeting in the US and economic co-operation could eventually spill over into political and security issues. With the decision to site its secretariat in Singapore, the loose gathering that spans the Pacific and includes some of the world's largest and fastest-growing economies is about to become a permanent institution. The choice of Singapore also establishes Apec's heart in the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), whose six members (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand), were at first afraid of being swamped by Apec's large members. Apec covers the US, Canada, Japan, Korea, the 'three Chinas' (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan), the Asean states, Australia and New Zealand. It encompasses two existing free trade agreements (US-Canada and Australia-New Zealand) and two more that have just been agreed (the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Asean Free Trade Area). Enthusiasm for Apec has waxed and waned. No trade barriers have fallen and no action has been taken on proposals to harmonise standards or exchange university students. The Australian objection to US wheat export subsidies is only the latest area of trade friction. But a sense of inevitability has started to creep into its proceedings as Apec has passed through successive stages of development and as some of its exploratory projects have begun to take shape. Although they have strong trade and investment ties with other parts of the world, in particular Europe, an Apec study* completed last month shows that the group's economies are integrating faster than the global trend. Members are able to hold regular consultations on economic and trade issues because they share common concerns - such as a desire to see the multilateral Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade completed rapidly and the Gatt system strengthened. Apec has shown no signs of becoming a belligerent trade bloc, partly because the region is no longer so apprehensive about the single market turning the EC into a closed trade bloc. Rather than envisaging it as a trade bloc, some Apec members are beginning to talk of regional liberalisation as a tool for encouraging a step-by-step further lowering of trade barriers globally, a view that appears to fit Mr Bush's 'strategic network'. Reaffirming their commitment to the Gatt system, Apec ministers called for the Uruguay Round to be completed within this year and for the draft agreement compiled by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director general, to be 'the key document' for reaching a conclusion. Singapore, the site of the secretariat, is now poised to become the nerve centre for computer networks that will offer Apec members easy access to regional trade and investment data. Some are talking about standardising and digitalising customs and other business documents that could be transmitted through these networks, greatly increasing the convenience of trade in the region. Australia, under whose initiative Apec was created in November 1989, has retained the role of pace-maker. Last week the Australian foreign minister, Mr Gareth Evans, successfully urged Apec ministers to press ahead with the exploration of regional trade liberalisation. There are, however, still members who would prefer to go slow. Within Asean, Malaysia is now willing to participate fully in Apec, but still prefers its own version of regional co-operation, the East Asia Economic Caucus, that would exclude the North Americans and possibly Australia and New Zealand. Kuala Lumpur envisages these groups forming 'concentric circles', preferably with Asean at the core. Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysian international trade and industry minister, also questioned last week whether Mr Evans was being realistic in suggesting some kind of common market across an ocean as vast as the Pacific. With Mexico likely to be the next to join Apec, largely through its membership of Nafta, some South East Asians are concerned that the balance could be tilted to the east Pacific. Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesian foreign minister, made a point of arguing that Papua New Guinea might be a more suitable candidate for Apec membership. * Apec Ad Hoc Economic Group Meeting Report: Vision for the Economy of the Asia-Pacific Region in the Year 2000 and Tasks Ahead, compiled by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                APEC: Intra-regional trade (1991)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Total exports            Intra-APEC exports                      (US dollarsm)         Value            % of total                                        (US dollarsm)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia               42,044             30,937               74 Brunei                   2,597              2,175               84 Canada                 126,160            108,595               86 China                   71,986             56,052               78 Hong Kong               98,579             69,915               71 Indonesia               29,142             23,434               80 Japan                  314,892            208,081               66 S Korea                 69,489             46,430               67 Malaysia                34,405             26,464               77 New Zealand              9,585              6,297               66 Philippines              8,840              6,756               76 Singapore               59,188             42,957               73 Taiwan                  79,254             58,010               73 Thailand                27,562             17,642               64 US                     421,755            206,645               49 TOTAL                1,395,478            910,390               65  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

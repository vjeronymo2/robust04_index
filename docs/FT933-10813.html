			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Arts: Building on the imagination - Architecture I'm worried about Sir Peter Holmes. He was until recently the chairman of Shell Transport and Trading plc, and every working morning he climbed 52 flights of stairs to reach his office on the 26th floor of the Shell Tower on London's South Bank. He says in one of the programmes in the BBC 2 series Architecture of the Imagination (9.30pm every Friday for five weeks) that 'it is a form of pain, but I do it to keep fit.' I can hardly bear to think of the limbo Sir Peter must be in now he has retired; how does he try out his muscles every morning without the challenge of those Shell stairs? How he must miss that private satisfaction of greeting his visitors at the lift door knowing that he has himself scaled the flights on foot. I suppose we had all thought of the skyscrapers of New York as giant 'ego statements' but not many company chairman take the climb to the top quite so literally. The interesting thing about this new architectural series for BBC 2 by the independent producers Third Eye Productions, is that it deals with architecture without dwelling on buildings. Architecture of the Imagination explores built elements of our surroundings from the psychological, mythological and poetic points of view. There are five programmes, each one focused upon one element - the door, the stairway, the window, the bridge and the tower. To extend the ideas examined in the programmes each evening a classic film will be shown that features one of the five themes. These films will undoubtedly add a great deal to the series as they have clearly been so carefully selected. Last Friday, for example, the first programme, 'The Door' was well supported by Fritz Lang's 'Secret Beyond the Door'. The whole series is anchored by the presence in each programme of the American writer, cultural historian and psychologist James Hillman, who provides a constantly illuminating commentary. There is a risk in this sort of programme that the psychological approach to the everyday can look both obvious and contrived. James Hillman's approach is questioning rather than dogmatic and his manner is agreeably gentle. The viewer is allowed to let his own imagination roam - and this is unusual in television. Mark Kidel is clearly a very sensitive and visually literate producer and director. He seemed to me to have an excellent rapport with artists - and I have to say I found the artists' responses by far the most rewarding aspect of the programmes. It was noteworthy too how few architects there are in the programmes: can this be some comment upon the quality of their imagination? Critics have the privilege of seeing all five programmes on video in advance and I can confidently say that, although the first programme last Friday on 'The Door' was good , the series gets better and better as it goes on. The pairing of feature films and programmes that is particularly effective is that of 'The Tower' and King Vidor's remarkable film based on Ayn Rand's book The Fountainhead. This is the film that inspires men to become architects; it stars Gary Cooper as the architect/hero and I am sure much architectural arrogance can be blamed on the powerful imagery of this film. All architects will be glued to BBC 2 that night. Last Friday's programme on the door introduced us to our guide, Mr Hillman, and with him an artist, a freemason and a Russian Orthodox priest. The ideas we have of emotional security and practical safety were considered as well as the role the door plays as a welcoming and an excluding agent. The film clips showed many a panting heroine slamming her door against the ravages of the world. The artist Ben Johnson has a calmer approach although he is obsessive about doors and indeed asks visitors to his studio to remove their shoes before they cross the threshold into his own world. He paints doorways and vistas endlessly and is as concerned with their physical reality as with their symbolism. Father Benedict Ramsden almost took us into the inner sanctum of the Russian Orthodox Church behind the iconostasis which is the screen that separates the congregation and the area reserved for the priests. This was one of the most beautiful parts of the programme where the camera and the architecture were creatively used to inspire us with a sense of mystery. The discussion that James Hillman has with us and with himself in this first part of the series does raise important questions about private and public space. His conclusions about the open plan office and the way it conflicts with our need for personal territory is significant. Perhaps architects do need the services of psycholanalysts to help them avoid the errors they have certainly made in defining space as an abstract thing, not a worldly and everyday reality. Try not to miss the programme on 'The Staircase' this Friday for the marvellous insights it gives into the work of the artist Deanna Petherbridge  -a glimpse of her dream world is highly illuminating. It is the mixture of art, psychology and architecture that makes this a rewarding series. It should be compulsory viewing for architects but more particularly for anyone engaged in architectural education. For anyone engaged with students of architecture every Friday in August must be spent in front of the TV: at last a holistic approach to a subject that has been isolated by architects for far too long.</p>

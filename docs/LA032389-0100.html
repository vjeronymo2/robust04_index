			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Women who smoke marijuana during pregnancy may stunt the growth of their  fetuses, producing babies who are smaller than normal, a study published in  today's New England Journal of Medicine shows. The research found that mothers  who smoked pot while pregnant produced babies who averaged three ounces lighter  and two-tenths of an inch shorter than non-users' newborns. Although their  study does not definitely prove that marijuana slows growth in the womb, the  researchers said that pot smoking is common during pregnancy, and women should  be cautioned about the link. "It definitely supports the case that marijuana  has an effect on the fetus," said Coryl Jones, a research psychologist at the  National Institute on Drug Abuse in Bethesda, Md.  </P></p>

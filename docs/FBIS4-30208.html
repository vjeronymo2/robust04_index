			<p>BFN     [Text] One of the sources of income for fishermen in the  island district of Phu Quy, Binh Thuan Province, is to conduct  fishing activities in the Truong Sa [Spratly] Archipelago area.    There are 450 fishing boats of all types on Phu Quy Island  and local fishermen earn their income chiefly from deep-sea  fishing and diving. In the beginning, fishermen did not want to  go and fish in the Truong Sa Archipelago area for fear of poor  catches and long trips and a lack of large boats. In early  1993, a fisherman from Phu Quy Island stayed in Truong Sa for  one and a half months and earned 150 million dong from shark  fishing. Since then, the movement to fish in Truong Sa has  developed quickly. A total of 94 fishing boats operated in  Truong Sa in 1993 and fishermen caught 5.6 tonnes of shark fins,  250 tonnes of shark flesh, and 180 tonnes of snapper flesh.  Since early this year, as many as 150 fishing boats with 1,200  crewmen aboard have conducted fishing activities in Truong Sa.  Each trip brought about two tonnes of snapper and goby and an  average profit of between three and five million dong. On some  occasions, fishermen earned as much as nine million dong in  profit per trip.    To encourage fishermen to operate in Truong Sa, Binh Thuan  Province has adopted a policy under which fishermen who invest  in the building of large boats having a 45 horsepower-capacity  or more for deep-sea fishing activities, especially in the  Truong Sa Archipelago area, will be exempted from taxes for one  year. Fishermen will also receive the wholehearted assistance of  the defenders on the island.</p>

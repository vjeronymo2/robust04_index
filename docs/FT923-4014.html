			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Observer: Photo call Hard times in the Tory party ahead of its conference in Brighton next month. The activists' newspaper, Conservative Newsline, carries a poignant ad offering a signed black and white photograph of Margaret Thatcher. The vendor, obviously a victim of the recession, vouches that the photo comes with a letter of authentication from Downing Street. 'Serious' offers only are invited. Observer guesses the price of a second-class return to Brighton would do the trick.</p>

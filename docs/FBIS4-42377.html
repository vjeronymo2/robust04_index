			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Michael Theodoulou report: "Tehran Exploits Bosnia </F> Conflict To Bolster Regime"]    [Text] Revelations that Iranian diplomats have forged  documents which claim to show that Britain's policy in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is anti-Muslim are further proof that the  government in Tehran is using the conflict in former Yugoslavia  to bolster support for itself.    The plight of Bosnia's Muslims has become the latest  anti-Western rallying cry for Iran's leadership, which is trying  to whip up revolutionary fervour to coincide with the fifth  anniversary of the Ayatollah Khomeini's death on Saturday.  Photographs depicting the suffering of Muslims in the besieged  Bosnian town of Gorazde are prominent in the lobbies of several  hotels in the capital, and the subject has dominated Friday  prayers at Tehran University for months.    In spite of its economic crisis, Iran is sending arms to  Islamic fundamentalists in the West Bank and Gaza, Algeria and  Sudan, and last month donated 1 million pounds to Bosnian  Muslims. Tehran radio began broadcasting propaganda in  Serbo-Croat on short-wave transmissions to Bosnia. Iranian  government officials and diplomats in Tehran believe President  Rafsanjani would like to see better ties with the West, but is  being forced to retreat by pressure from hardliners. Iran's  foreign policy has hardened markedly in recent weeks.    Tehran attacked Saudi Arabia after Riyadh prevented Iranian  pilgrims holding anti-Western demonstrations during the annual  haj pilgrimage. And yesterday the Iranians arrested two Iraqis  they claimed were high-ranking intelligence officers sent to  organise sabotage.    Iranian leaders are using the row with Britain to prove  their  revolutionary credentials while at the same time presenting  Tehran as the Islamic world's leading champion of dispossessed  Muslims. Radical groups which have the upper hand are urging  Iran to sever ties with Britain following accusations that a  listening device was planted in the Iranian Embassy in London.    Hojjat-oleslam Rafsanjani tried to tackle the hard-liners  last autumn by dissolving the 15 Khordad Foundation, a shadowy  pseudocharitable organisation based in Qom which put a 1.3  million [currency not specified] bounty on Salman Rushdie's  head. However, the move was blocked by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,  Iran's spiritual leader, who went on Tehran Radio to insist that  Muslims worldwide were duty-bound to murder Rushdie.    "The two men have had at least one screaming row over  (Salman) Rushdie," an Iranian official said. "Rafsanjani would  love to crush these autonomous religious circles that are  getting in his way, but they are financially independent and  constitutionally they are answerable to Khamenei.    The Rushdiefatwa remains a rallying cry for radicals hoping  to reinvigorate waning revolutionary fervour, but it has impeded  the President's attempts to improve relations with the West and  win investment crucial to the faltering economic reforms on  which he has staked his reputation. Iranian hard-liners have  gained strength following the economic crisis which is blamed on  Hojjat-oleslam Rafsanjani's programme.    The President surprised diplomats last month by taking a  high  profile in the row with Britain by alleging that M16 was bugging  the Iranian Embassy in London. He incited the Iranian media,  and several newspapers urged the government to sever ties with  what one paper called "the ageing father of colonialism."  Despite the unpopularity of Iran's Islamic leadership, its  attempts to incite anti-British sentiment are guaranteed some  success in a society ready to believe conspiracy theories  against the old colonial master whose history of meddling in  Iranian affairs is taught to children in all schools.</p>

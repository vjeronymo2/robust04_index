			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / French Socialists try to heal rift MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, yesterday tried to ease Socialist party tensions by hosting talks for senior Socialists, including former prime minister and probable presidential candidate Mr Michel Rocard. Mr Rocard last week called on the left to abandon socialism after next month's parliamentary elections in favour of an alliance with the ecologists. This call for a 'political big bang' has caused turmoil on the left. The Socialist party, haunted by scandals and weary after a decade in power, is heading for heavy defeat. The Socialists will today receive yet another electoral setback with the publication of provisional GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 1992, which are expected to show a fall in absolute terms for the first time since the Gulf war. Paribas, the prominent Paris bank, estimates that GDP fell 0.4 per cent in the fourth quarter when the economy was squeezed by high interest rates and the franc's strength. Recent economic surveys have warned of a further deterioration, suggesting a further fall in GDP in the first quarter of 1993. This means the hitherto relatively resilient French economy. will be technically in recession, after two successive quarters of economic decline. However, the Socialists yesterday were more concerned with their internal problems. Mr Beregovoy was clearly anxious for party leaders to present a united front in the run-up to the polls. He arranged yesterday's lunch gathering to finalise plans for the last phase of the campaign. It was attended by Mr Laurent Fabius, Socialist first secretary, Mr Jean Arnoux, the party's parliamentary leader, by Mr Rocard and Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president. Mr Arnoux said the Socialists were in 'perfect harmony' and described Mr Rocard's 'big bang' as a chance to expand 'the socialist universe'. Mr Rocard and Mr Delors told reporters they had an 'excellent' lunch 'between friends'.</p>

The latest episode in the endless dispute on the right took  place on the "Mixer" television show when the National Alliance  leader yesterday tried to treat the "losing" Bossi  superciliously. "He is afraid of the elections, he is envious  of those who are taking away his votes. He is almost  ridiculous, now that he is spurning the very votes in the south  that he previously sought to gain by every means. As for  ideologies, we can forget about Bossi; I do not think that he  knows what they are." In jest, he played the tower game that he  himself suggested: "If I had to choose between [Secretary of the  Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] Occhetto and Bossi, I would  throw off the latter. I cannot forget the way in which League  members treated the mayor when he talked about solidarity."    "When Bossi tried to gain votes in the south they sent him  back to the valleys." He added: "I am not worried about the  disputes within the [rightist] alliance. If a voter hears Bossi  speak, he will not decide to vote for Occhetto, but he could  vote for me." What if Bossi became crucial to your accession to  government, [show host] Minoli asked? "That is simple. It is  enough that he adhere to two essential points -- national unity  and solidarity."    The insults and attacks that Fini directed at the League  leader were almost matched by the respect with which he treated  Occhetto and his many reservations about his ally, [Forza Italia  leader] Berlusconi. In the end Occhetto nearly came out better  ("So what if Berlusconi calls them communists? I call them the  PDS.") Spurred on by Minoli, Fini told Berlusconi that the  television system must be reorganized with new rules that apply  to everyone, including Fininvest ("Cutting back the public and  private networks and improving the quality of television  programs.") What is his criticism of Berlusconi? "His tendency  to feel often like the center of the world." One of your  proposals, Minoli said, is to grant small- and medium-sized  entrepreneurs the same credit treatment reserved for major  groups. Does Berlusconi know that? "Certainly he knows it.  Within the pole for freedoms we are the component that  guarantees social awareness and solidarity." There was also a  brusque reminder to [Forza Italia economist] Antonio Martino and  Forza Italia on the tax question: "They said that allowances to  those earning less will compensate for the single tax rate, but  they have not explained how. Martino has a duty to explain  these allowances right away and to be clear about the whole  issue. He said that a family of four in Rome can live on 18  million lire a year: That is not true; it is not enough.  Martino must be clearer." [passage omitted]</p>

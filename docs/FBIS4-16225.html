			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Lessons" rubric: </F> "Officials and Directors in the Lead in Local Elections.  `Independent Candidates' Would be Obliged To Disclose Party  Affiliation"]    [Text] It was announced at yesterday's sitting of the  Central Electoral Commission that the elections for local organs  of representative power had taken place in 69 regions of Russia.  In 61 regions, they are recognized as having taken place, and  in 19 regions local parliaments have already been fully formed.  Elections in another 11 regions and "by-elections" for 50  organs of power in the regions are to take place before the year  is out.    According to Central Electoral Commission information, 31.7  percent of the seats won belong to representatives of the  executive power, 21 percent to directors of industrial  enterprises, and more than 10 percent to "people prominent in  agriculture." Nearly 10 percent of the seats have been won by  white collar workers, journalists, etc. Lawyers have won as  little as 2.5 percent of all seats.    According to Nikolay Ryabov, the "Russia's Choice" bloc is  in  the lead for those elected from party lists (22 percent),  trailed by the Communist Party (14 percent of the votes) and the  Agrarian Party (7 percent). In the overwhelming majority of  Federation components, however, deputies were elected in  accordance with the majority system. According to officials of  the Central Electoral Commission, "as little as 14 percent of  candidates were nominated by electoral blocs, even fewer were  registered, and still fewer were elected." Nikolay Ryabov did  not deny media information that Communists posing as  "independent candidates" were in the lead among the remaining 80  to 85 percent of the candidates. "In fact, when they describe  themselves as independent, it is often hard for the voters to  see who they really are," the Electoral Commission chairman  complained in an interview for your SEGODNYA correspondent. He  advised that the draft law "On the Fundamental Guarantees of  Voting Rights of Russian Federation Citizens" contains a  provision making it mandatory for all candidates to indicate  their party affiliation "so as the voters will have no doubt."    The draft law, constituting "framework" norms for regional  election statutes, will soon be submitted to Boris Yeltsin and  forwarded to the Public Chamber under the president. Next, Mr.  Ryabov hopes, the president will introduce a corresponding  "legislative initiative" to the State Duma, and the lower  chamber would look at it before its summer recess.</p>

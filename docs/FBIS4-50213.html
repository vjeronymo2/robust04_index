State Councillor Li Guixian called on governments  at all levels to pay full attention to the major significance of  successfully carrying out civil affairs work, strengthen  leadership over this work, closely combine the implementation of  this conference's guidelines with the formulation and  implementation of the local plans for "attaining the level of  comparatively well-off," and the "87" plan for tackling the most  difficult problems while supporting the poor areas, and enable  civil affairs work to better serve the party's central task and  the work of safeguarding social stability.    During the conference, delegates exchanged the experiences  in  civil affairs work of various localities and clearly defined  future tasks. They held that the convocation of this conference  was not only a practical guiding significance in civil affairs  work but also of major significance in safeguarding social  stability and promoting the work concerning the overall  situation.    At the conference, 128 counties (cities, prefectures,  banners), including Fengnan County in Hebei Province, and 211  townships and towns (neighborhoods), including the Shibalidian  Township in Chaoyang in Beijing Municipality, were respectively  named advanced counties (cities, prefectures, banners) in civil  affairs work and townships and towns (neighborhoods) outstanding  in all aspects by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Today, the  Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Personnel have  also decided to confer the title of national advanced worker of  the civil affairs department on 163 comrades, such as Han  Shuzhen, and the title of national model worker of the civil  affairs department on 37 comrades, including Liu Aizhen. Among  the great number of advanced models from the civil affairs  departments across the country, 12 outstanding delegates also  received the award of the highest honor -- the oxen  award--today, from the Ministry of Civil Affairs.    At the closing session, Li Guixian stressed: Civil affairs  work is an important aspect in government work, having a direct  bearing on social stability and on economic and social  development, closely linked with the immediate interests of the  broad masses of people, and having the strong characteristics of  social endeavor and mass participation. He said: Always  listening to the voices of the masses, caring for the immediate  interests of the masses, and safeguarding and guaranteeing the  basic living rights and interests of the masses of people,  constitutes the fundamental purpose of our party and the  government. Successfully carrying out civil affairs work is  precisely the specific manifestation of this purpose and of the  superiority of the socialist system.    Li Guixian held that for now and for some time to come, the  priority in civil affairs work is to do a good job in social  security work and building grass-roots organizations. He said:  The social security system is an important support project of  the socialist market economic structure, having a bearing on  whether the reform of the economic structure can be smoothly  carried out or not. All localities should pay great attention to  it and realistically do their work well. The grass-roots  political power and the grass-roots self-government  organizations of the masses constitute the foundation of all  fields of work. The civil affairs departments in all localities  should actively coordinate with relevant departments to  reshuffle and build the grass-roots organizations.    Li Guixian also called on the civil affairs departments in  all localities to do a good job in administrative zoning, social  management, marriage and funeral management, as well as the work  of taking in the people or sending them back to their original  places.

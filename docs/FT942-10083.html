			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Observer: More pennies Roll up, roll up, anyone want to buy a theatre? It's not a bad time to own a slice of London's West End. Ticket sales rose 6 per cent last year to a record 11.5m. The theatre now in the limelight is the spankingly refurbished Playhouse, down by the Embankment, which Ray Cooney bought two years ago for Pounds 2.4m after Lord Archer couldn't make a go of it. 'I'll take Pounds 2.7m,' says Cooney, who found that owning a theatre interfered with his preferred occupation of comedy writing. He is fairly relaxed about the small loss he made running it: 'Theatres are not investments which make a return of 10 or 20 per cent a year. They are just a delight to own.' With just 786 seats, The Playhouse is too small for the money-spinning, long-running musicals. But the lure of the footlights, the thrill of the first nights, should tempt some optimistic angel, perhaps in New York - or even Hong Kong, where Cooney is pitching hard.</p>

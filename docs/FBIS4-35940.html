			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Message from Arab League Secretary General 'Abd-al-Majid to </F> the speaker of the House of Representatives]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.    His Excellency brother 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar,  speaker  of the House of Representatives, Republic of Yemen.    Greetings;    I received with appreciation and concern the Yemeni House of  Representatives' message on 30 May 1994, conveyed to us by  Ambassador Ahmad Muhammad Luqman, permanent representative of  the Republic of Yemen to the Arab League.    I would like to stress to your excellency that the  developments in the Republic of Yemen have always been the  concern of the Arab League because the strength and stability of  Yemen, as well as the safety of its people, are a support for  the Arab nation and joint Arab action.    Proceeding from this, I dispatched a mission to the Republic  of Yemen on 4 March 1994. Furthermore, the 101st session of the  Arab League Council issued a statement on 26 March 1994,  affirming its deep concern over the developments in Yemen and  urging the Yemeni political leaders to double their efforts to  resolve differences in a way that strengthens unity and spreads  stability in Yemen and security in the whole region. Also, the  Arab League Council adopted in its extraordinary session  Resolution No. 5,409 on 7 May 1994, a copy of which is attached  to this letter. In this resolution, the Arab League Council  called for an immediate cease-fire and ending the deterioration  in Yemen to safeguard its unity.    Within this framework, their majesties and excellencies the  Arab kings and presidents, as well as Arab national  organizations and personalities, continued their efforts to stop  Arab bloodshed in sisterly Yemen and to preserve its resources  and achievements. I also sent a high-level delegation to Sanaa  where it met with His Excellency President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  and a number of ranking Yemeni figures.    I am still exerting efforts and holding contacts in  accordance with the abovementioned Arab League Council  resolution, using all the potentials of the Arab League  Secretariat to achieve this noble objective.    I appeal to you -- in light of what is dictated on you by  your responsibility -- to exert efforts and do what is  appropriate and effective to implement the resolution of Arab  legitimacy.    I ask God to grant us all success for the wellbeing and  safety of the sisterly Yemeni Arab people. God knows our  intention, and He leads us to the right path.    God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you.    [Signed] Secretary General Dr. Ahmad 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid</p>

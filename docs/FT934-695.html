			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: All lottery profit should go to good causes Sir, To reply to your editorial, 'Charity lottery' (December 20), we have been planning our bid for the national lottery since 1988 as a result of a visit to the Irish Republic, where charities, sport, theatre and the arts all benefit from the lottery. I was one of a number of businessmen who, as a result of that visit, offered our business skills to set up and run a national lottery for worthwhile causes. In almost every other country and state in the world this is exactly how the national lottery is run. A group of managers - some with lottery experience  -is appointed directly by the government to set up the lottery. It is a myth to think that it is a particularly difficult company to set up. It is no more difficult to set up and run than, say, an airline is. The difference is that the national lottery is, in effect, a licence to print money. Any good, competent business managers drawing on the right expertise can run and promote it. Almost any of the groups which have put their names forward would be quite capable of running it. This is not a particularly entrepreneurial venture. Therefore, the question that needs to be asked is: is it really necessary to add an extra layer of shareholders, over the managers, who can sit back and cream off hundreds of millions of pounds of profit that could otherwise be going to good causes? Furthermore, there will be millions of people in Britain who will have a flutter every week on the national lottery hoping to become millionaires. However, we believe - and believe we will be able to prove conclusively to the director of Oflot - that many of these same people will be happy to spend a pound or two more a week if they can be assured that all the profits are going to charity. As the former speaker of the House of Commons, Lord Tonypandy, said: 'As a matter of principle I wanted nothing to do with the national lottery. I, along with many others, disagree with gambling. However, with all the profits going to good causes, I'm not only happy to change my mind but to become a trustee of the Lottery Foundation. I might even have a flutter myself.' We believe that there are hundreds of thousands of people who will participate more fully with a lottery designed to maximise the take for charitable causes. We are not only saying this. I, together with others, am willing to devote considerable time and sums of money (with no wish for any return) to prove this to be the case.

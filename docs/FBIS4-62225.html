			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 12 May -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin  has congratulated the workforce of the All Russian Television  and Radio Company on the occasion of its third anniversary,  which is marked today.    "I well remember the first broadcasts of Russian radio and  Russian television," the Russian leader commented. "These  events were a true festival of democracy and glasnost, the  enthusiasm of journalists, and the sincere desire to tell and  show the truth.    "Not everything worked out or is working out. There are not  a few problems, faced with which, I know, one sometimes loses  heart. But stand firm and I am sure that you will succeed  honorably in travelling the difficult path of our Russian  reforms.    "I will never forget that many-hours-long broadcast of that  awful October night [Russian TV's special all-night program  during the conflict with the Supreme Soviet in October 1993],  which has become a masterpiece of television. I bow before your  courage and loyalty to your professional duty. I believe in the  enormous creative potential of your workforce. I wish you new  successes," the president of Russia stressed.</p>

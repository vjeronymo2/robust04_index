			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bridgestone expects to break even in Europe BRIDGESTONE, the Japanese tyremaker, expects to break even in Europe this year but foresees a tough 1993 for its worldwide operations, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Akira Yeiri, the chairman, told a news conference that the world's second-largest tyre company had not changed the 1992 earnings projections released in July. Bridgestone, which holds around 50 per cent of its domestic market, bought US tyremaker Firestone in 1988. That forecast saw 1992 parent net profit at Y38bn, (Dollars 31.9m), down from a March forecast of Y40bn. Mr Yeiri said restructuring in Europe, which led to a Dollars 100m net loss in its European operations in 1991, would help the group break even this year. Last month, Bridgestone said it saw a total net loss of about Dollars 150m in its US and European units this year. A Bridgestone official said yesterday that those losses were expected to be entirely in the US. While there were losses in the US in the first half, operations there will break even in the second half, Mr Yeiri said. 'We see no real recovery (in world tyre markets),' Mr Yeiri said, adding that 1993 would be 'extremely difficult'. He said that in the current climate it was not easy to raise prices. The Bridgestone chairman said US tyre sales in general should rise by about 10 per cent this year from their 1991 level in volume terms. Mr Jean Fourmy, Bridgestone/Firestone Europe chairman, said the French tyre replacement market rose slightly in the first half of 1992 but had fallen sharply since then. The group expected a decline in the volume of sales for the full year, he said. He added that Bridgestone France and Firestone France would merge in 1993 but retain separate brand names and distribution networks.</p>

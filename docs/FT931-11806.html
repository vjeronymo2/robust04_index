That was well up on the adjusted deficit of Pounds 294,000 recorded for the same period of the previous year, but significantly down on the Pounds 2.74m loss reported for the second half of the 1991-92 year. The first half loss was struck after taking account of an exceptional provision of Pounds 1.57m which related to the disposal of discontinued activities. Interest charges rose to Pounds 510,000 (Pounds 447,000). Turnover of continuing activities totalled Pounds 11.86m (Pounds 12.16m). Losses per share emerged at 18.1p (1.4p).

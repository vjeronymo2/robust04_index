			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During the meeting with Foreign Minister Irfan  Ljubijankic, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe voiced disgust  with the massacre that was committed in Sarajevo last weekend,  and at the same time added that despite the events on the ground  a political solution has no alternative.    The European 12 at yesterday's meeting reiterated EU support  to the realization of the joint plan, Juppe said. At the same  time, he put forward an assessment that the plan has not been  realized so far due to insufficient contribution by the United  States and Russia. The political and diplomatic EU action is  aimed at convincing both countries to exert political pressure  on Serbia and Croatia in the Geneva talks.    Juppe explained to Minister Ljubijankic that the EU plan  should not be viewed as something definite, in the sense of take  it or leave it. On the contrary, Europe is willing to improve  it. The condition for this is a sincere approach to the  negotiations by all sides.    According to the French minister, the next NATO meeting in  Brussels will be very significant regarding even sharper  articulation of the stances taken by the European Union. He  underscored that the final decision will, nevertheless, be  passed by the EU ministers on the basis of yesterday's  declaration.    Juppe was interested whether the Bosnia-Herzegovina  authorities can guarantee security to the Serbs in, as he said,  their parts of Sarajevo after the Serbian artillery has  withdrawn to a sufficient distance from the town. Minister  Ljubijankic reminded that the Serbs in Sarajevo and elsewhere in  Bosnia-Herzegovina have never been threatened so far, nor will  they be in the future.    During the meeting with Belgian Foreign Minister Willy  Claes,  the Belgian colleague said to our foreign minister that the EU  attitude toward a concrete action in Bosnia has definitely  changed after the last two massacres in Sarajevo. Claes's  conclusion was that the decision about the ultimatum to the  Serbs must be brought by NATO after examining all possible  consequences. He is convinced that a consensus will be reached,  even though the military experts will strive to prophetize  caution and risks.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Flights disrupted as pilots seek private rates of pay INDIAN businessmen, trying to recover from the disruption of the Ayodhya crisis, have run into a more familiar difficulty - a strike by pilots of Indian Airlines, Stefan Wagstyl reports from New Delhi. The state-owned domestic carrier has been operating only about 25 per cent of its normal flights since most pilots went on strike on Friday, throwing the timetable into chaos. The pilots want pay increases to close the gap with the salaries paid by India's newly created private airlines. Indian Airlines management retorts that the private carriers' pilots are much more productive than those at Indian Airlines. The managers also say the pilots' pay is already excessively high. An official estimates the average pilot receives about Rs30,000 (Pounds 670) a month, or about ten times as much as a booking clerk and three times as much as the airline's chairman. The dispute highlights the problems of liberalisation. The government has authorised private companies to operate scheduled routes to promote competition and raise standards of efficiency at Indian Airlines and at Vayudoot, a smaller state-owned carrier. Seven new carriers have taken to the skies, including Bombay-based East West Airlines, the largest, which has challenged Indian Airlines on some of its busiest routes. Passengers have reported dramatic improvements in service on routes where Indian Airlines has to compete with East West. But Indian Airlines complains that East West can cream off the best routes whereas Indian Airlines is required to serve all corners of a vast country. Indian Airlines adds that East West is poaching pilots. The state carrier, which has 570 pilots, has lost about 30 this year to East West and other operators. Their departure has increased the workload for the remaining aircrew and fuelled the grievances which have led to the strike. The pilots originally threatened disruptive action in October, but held back while talks with the managers dragged on. The strike this month coincides with high season for business and tourist visitors to India. It will further harm confidence in the country, which has already been battered by the violence which followed the sacking of the mosque in Ayodhya by Hindu militants. American, European and Japanese tour operators which have cancelled trips because of the Ayodhya crisis see little reason to resume business with India until the air strike is settled. However, Indian Airlines says it cannot cave in to the pilots' demands if it is to cut its losses as required by the government. To prove its determination, it this week leased two Tu-154 airliners from the newly created Uzbekistan Airlines, complete with crew, and plans to lease several more if the strike continues.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS: VALLEY COLLEGE;  </P> <P> FUNDS SOUGHT FOR BETTER LIGHTING  </P> <P> The Associated Student Union at Valley College has started a drive to raise  funds to improve night lighting on the Van Nuys campus because of safety  concerns voiced by both students and faculty.  </P> <P> There also had been complaints about poor night lighting in previous semesters,  student leaders said, but little was done about it.  </P> <P> Last spring, an ASU survey determined that more than 50 outside lights were  broken.  </P> <P> The administration replaced some, but not all, of these lights, ASU leaders  said. New lighting packs were installed on the outside walls of the bungalows  on the south and southeast portions of the campus.  </P> <P> Recently, about 40 ASU students and teachers held a candlelight vigil to  discuss what could be done.  </P> <P> "We wanted to get the whole student body aware that we want to do something  about the problem," said ASU president Alaine Jelsyik.  </P> <P> As a result of the vigil, Jelsyik said, the ASU is seeking donations from  various businesses to repair the broken lights and to change all lights from  opaque glass to a brighter, clear glass.  </P> <P> "After a year of nothing being done, we needed to start a project for better  lighting and the safety of all students," said Shoshana Blum, student  commissioner of handicap awareness.  </P> <P> A campus fund-raiser to collect money to replace and repair light bulbs also is  under consideration.  </P> <P> In addition, members of Night Watch, an Administration of Justice Club project,  are escorting students to their cars at night.  </P> <P> "I decided to drop my night class because of the fear I had, walking alone  after class," said student Yvonne Rodriguez.

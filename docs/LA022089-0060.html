			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON YOUR OWN: STRIKING A BLOW FOR BETTER ROMANCE  </P> <P> Person A: "Do you love me?"  </P> <P> Person B: "I'm here, aren't I?"  </P> <P> Sometimes I try to imagine what would happen if people who received this  evasive non-reply began to pour cold water over the person who gave them such a  stingy response, in a simultaneous, worldwide demonstration of unity. What a  revolution for romance! What a blow for better communication! I can enjoy the  fantasy, but I cannot advocate such mayhem and certainly could not guarantee a  happy outcome from this rebellion. However, it is important for people who  subsist on this meager diet of verbal affection to let the other person know  that "I'm here, aren't I?" is simply not good enough.  </P> <P> Men usually have a tougher time communicating emotions and their more tender  feelings. But the problem is certainly not restricted to men. In one scene  during the Broadway musical "Fiddler on the Roof," Tevye begins to think about  his relationship with his wife, Goldie. They sing a wonderful duet. Tevye  starts by asking Goldie "Do you love me?" She looks at him as if he is crazy  and proceeds to list everything she has done for him over the years -- she has  cooked for him, cleaned for him and borne his children. He continues to ask her  "But, do you love me?"  </P> <P> A person who finds it hard to say "I love you" may ask "Why is it important?  I'm there, I do things for her and with her -- can't she tell?" Not  necessarily. He should be asking himself, "Why do I find it so difficult to say  'I love you' straight out?"  </P> <P> The most obvious possibility is that he does not love the other person. If that  is true, then his answer is an evasion, which is what the person asking the  question fears.  </P> <P> Another possibility is that the person who gives a stingy reply may view  relationships between the sexes as power struggles. He or she may think that  saying "I love you" weakens his or her position and gives more power to the  other person.  </P> <P> You may be involved with someone who is verbally withholding. There may still  be hope for your relationship. If he or she shows caring feelings by being  loyal, supportive, protective and remembering what pleases you, then you may  start to feel OK when you hear "I'm here, aren't I?" and understand that it is  the best your partner can do.  </P> <P> But before you remain in a relationship with a person who cannot give you more  open expressions of affection, you must ask yourself, "If this never changes,  is it all right with me?" If it is not all right you may put yourself in a  state of chronic frustration.  </P> <P> Does this mean you should abandon your attempts to let the other person know  how important it is for him or her to express his or her love in words? No. If  you assume the other person loves you, he or she may be trainable. Look at  "Fiddler on the Roof." After Tevye persists and explains to Goldie why he wants  to know if she loves him, she reviews all they have been through together and  concedes that after 25 years she guesses she loves him. "After 25 years," he  sings contentedly, "it's good to know."  </P> <P> But it would be nice not to have to wait that long, wouldn't it?  </P> <P>  Questions and statements about the single life may be addressed to Howard  Halpern, Ph.D., in care of Special Features, 130 5th Ave., New York, N.Y.  10011.

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: More carrot than stick in BT3 sale - Roland Rudd and Philip Coggan examine the inducements on offer INSPECTOR MOROSE, alias comedian Mel Smith, will soon be talking on television about the incentives on offer to retail investors in the government's sale of its remaining BT shares in July. Meanwhile, the government's own inspectors - in the form of S G Warburg, global co-ordinator of the offer - have already been offering institutions inducements to buy existing BT shares. Institutional shareholders which increase their BT holding before the close of the offer will be rewarded with more new shares if, as expected, the Pounds 5bn float is over-subscribed. Those that try to depress the share price, by selling short the stock aggressively, will be penalised when the new shares are allocated. Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive, says the bank has learnt from the last government sale of BT shares when it was also the lead adviser. In 1991, Warburg warned big shareholders that it would take a very dim view of any attempts to depress BT's share price. This infuriated the institutions, which complained that the government was trying to rig the market. This time, Lord Cairns says he is offering the 'carrot approach' in place of the stick which caused the fuss in the first place. Institutions still think the government is rigging the market - but are much happier at the way Warburg is going about it. Irrespective of whether the market is being rigged, however, it can only be good news for the small investor if the mechanism keeps BT's share price buoyant. The only concern for potential investors is that once the Treasury loses its financial interest in BT, uncertainty about regulation is likely to increase. The timing of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into British Gas - due to arrive on ministers' desks just after the BT issue - could not come at a worse time. There is also the emergence of wider competition to BT's basic business. Tim Hirst, analyst at Kleinwort Benson - one of the stockbrokers which declined to take part in the sale when it was not asked to be a global manager - says the potential impact has been underestimated. He expects cable operators will be providing telephones to more than 2m residential and 550,000 business customers by 1997, compared with 150,000 today. Hirst estimates this could cost BT Pounds 550m a year in lost line rental and call volumes. That is only 4 per cent of its present revenues but, since much of its network costs are fixed, there could be a painful impact on profits. Warburg's research on BT, published yesterday, dismisses such fears. James Golob, telecommunications analyst, says: 'Although there will be new competition . . . it does not appear to be on a scale that will materially alter the rate of gain of market share from BT.' Meanwhile, the government has widened the net of 'share shops' through which investors can apply for the BT3 issue. Those who register with, and apply through, a share shop can expect to receive greater preference when shares are allocated than those who apply through the Share Information Office. Some of the companies which have become share shops are offering further incentives for investors who register for BT3 shares. Barclays is offering to waive the Pounds 30-plus-VAT joining and subscription fees on its select and single company personal equity plans. Those who register will also be entitled to free membership for three months of the Barclayshare Portfolio Administration Service or the Barclayshare Advisory Service. Lloyds bank is offering a 'low-cost' postal share dealing service covering all shares on the London Stock Exchange. The Share Centre is providing a Pounds 3 Argos 'premier points' card, allowing discounts off goods at Argos stores for successful applicants. It is also offering a 24-hour telephone dealing service with a minimum commission rate of Pounds 8. Details on 071-757-4000.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Salvation Front [NSF] insists on early  presidential elections, NSF leader Ilya Konstantinov told his  organization's National Council in Moscow on Sunday. He said  that the National Salvation Front would sign the Memorandum on  Civic Accord only if this demand was fulfilled.    Ilya Konstantinov, Gennadiy Sayenko, Mikhail Astafyev and  Mikhail Titov criticized the Civic Accord pact and announced  that they would not sign it, although they would take part in  its discussion on April 26.    Konstantinov also said that the NSF's main task now was to  find and support a candidate representing the opposition.    Member of the NSF's Political Council Sazhi Umalatova stated  that former Soviet prime minister Nikolay Ryzhkov would suit all  opposition forces.    Members of the NSF's National Council sharply criticized the  government and president.</p>

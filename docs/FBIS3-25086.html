In a  statement issued at Tamale, the committee requested the public  to cooperate and warned that any person found involved in  criminal activities would be severely dealt with.    The assurance came in the wake of fears generated by the  general state of insecurity as a result of mob attacks on  certain sections of the community since last week. The military  and police have been deployed at strategic areas in the  municipality to curb further acts of violence. Some  reinforcements have also been dispatched to the East Gonja and  Yendi Districts where fighting is reported to be still going on  despite the call for cease-fire by the northern sector brigade  commander of the Ghana Armed Forces.    According to people fleeing the fighting from Salaga, the  casualty rate is high. In another development, Dagbon leaders  in Tamale have formed a task force to help stop the burning and  looting of property by irate mobs.    Meanwhile, a GHANA NEWS AGENCY report said that the state of  insecurity had resulted in many people, mainly in the public  service, leaving the municipality. Already all first and second  cycle schools in the municipality have closed down following  threats of mob attack. The National Mobilization Program [NMP]  and the Red Cross Society in Tamale have, meanwhile, registered  over 2,000 refugees who have fled the ethnic fighting in parts  of the region. The refugees are mainly students, national  service personnel, and displaced people, including women and  children. The report said that about 600 of the refugees are  camped at the Nyohene Vocational Center and are fed by the local  community because the NMP and the Red Cross have nothing in  stock. It said the rest of the refugees, who feel their lives  are endangered in Tamale, are being kept in a military camp.</p>

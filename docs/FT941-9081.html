			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Cigna warns on cost of LA earthquake Cigna, the US insurer, reported a fall in after-tax profits last year as it took a Dollars 244m charge to cover asbestos and environmental costs. It also restructured its property and casualty operations. The company said it would report after-tax losses of Dollars 60m in the current quarter, due to the Californian earthquake, and Dollars 25m attributable to the severe weather in the US. However, Mr Wilson Taylor, chief executive, said the restructuring on the property and casualty side, which led to a Dollars 107m after-tax charge, would lead to improved results in the future. Net income for the year fell to Dollars 234m, or Dollars 3.25 a share, from Dollars 311m, or Dollars 4.34, in 1992. In the final three months of 1993, net income jumped to Dollars 194m from Dollars 50mm, boosted by after-tax realised investment gains of Dollars 102m, compared with Dollars 19m in the 1992 quarter. Operating income in Cigna's life and health insurance businesses was up 42 per cent for the year, to Dollars 464m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "r.l.": "Poor Devil, He Is Going Bananas -- </F> Bossi Has the Last Word"]    [Text] Rome -- [Northern League Secretary] Bossi spoke  last, and his words were heavy-handed: "[former League  ideologue] Miglio? He must have felt so peeved at young  [Institutional Reforms Minister] Speroni getting ahead of him  that he went mildly bananas...." Thus ended the day when the  League's former ideologue shot point-blank at the Bandwagon's  [League nickname] leaders, and the latter finally replied with a  broadside: Some, like [Interior Minister] Maroni, with  affection; others, like Bossi, by branding him as a quasilunatic.    The first to reply to Miglio's accusations, in the morning,  was [League Chairman] Franco Rocchetta. Interviewed immediately  after the senator's [Miglio] speech in the house, the party's  chairman minimized its impact: "Miglio? He was relatively  tough, very articulate, but he did not say anything that we did  not know already."    Then the press agencies published an interview granted by  Miglio in the morning, in which he accused the League of being  involved in illegal financing operations. This time it was  Francesco Speroni who replied: "The professor is so outside the  League from an organizational point of view, that I fail to  understand how he dares make such inferences." The recently  appointed minister also stated that he had offered Miglio the  post of head of the institutional reform organizational  structure: "I tried asking him for his help but, much to my  regret, he refused," Speroni explained.    By now it was lunchtime and, in the Senate's refreshment  bar,  it was Roberto Maroni's turn to answer the professor's charges.  "Despite everything," the interior minister said, "I am very  fond of Miglio, and I would rather leave it to him to say  spiteful things than say any myself, but his behavior is similar  to [former Senate speaker] Spadolini's after [current Senate  speaker] Scognamiglio was elected." In fact, according to  Maroni, Miglio wanted a ministry for himself: "I personally  followed all the negotiations with a view to forming the  government, and I can assure you that we had to choose between  accepting the Institutional Reforms Ministry without Miglio, or,  alternatively, renouncing the Institutional Reforms Ministry in  order to give Miglio another ministry, such as the higher  education portfolio. For strategic reasons, the League opted  for the first solution. Miglio would have preferred the latter."    Maroni went on to deny that the break-up between Miglio and  Bossi took place in December: "I can testify to the fact that,  three days before the negotiations for forming the government  came to a close, there was a meeting at which Miglio did nothing  but heap praise on Bossi."    Finally, in the evening, Bossi also joined the issue. "Poor  devil, it is sad to see a 76-year old man seeking fulfillment  through a portfolio.... But I understand him. He felt  excluded. One of these days I will go to have a talk with him in  the Senate." Bossi confirmed that the veto against Miglio came  from [National Alliance leader] Fini and [Prime Minister]  Berlusconi: "They had strong objections. I defended Miglio,  but I can understand Berlusconi's viewpoint. Clearly, if a  prime minister has someone in his cabinet who shoots his mouth  off like this, the government would fall three times a day."  Finally, as regards the illegal funding of the League: "Tell  me where the bank is. I wish I had the power...."</p>

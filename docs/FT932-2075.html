			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (6): Bank will test the market - CBK set for gradual reprivatisation NORWAY'S finance ministry intends to float a limited number of shares in Christiania Bank (CBK) in the autumn. The object of the exercise is to test the market to establish an indicative price level for CBK's shares ahead of gradual reprivatisation from 1994 when a limited number of shares are expected to be listed on the Oslo bourse. CBK's share capital has been wiped out by heavy losses - last year it had a negative return on equity of 98.3 per cent and a negative net return on assets of 1.1 per cent. As a result, the state was forced to recapitalise the bank with NKr1.9bn in core capital - of which NKr1bn was new share capital and NKr900m a subordinated convertible loan. In 1991, the state pumped NKr6.94bn into CBK while the guarantee fund of the commercial banks injected NKr920m. However, senior CBK executives have warned the government not to proceed with plans for reprivatisation without first spelling out its long-term strategy for state ownership of the banks. Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, finance minister, has stated publicly that the state intends to remain a long-term owner of the banks - and that he is planning further capacity cuts in the bank sector. 'We would like to stress it would be a big advantage, if not a necessity, for the government to make clear what it intends to do with its stake in the banks before it starts selling off shares,' senior CBK executives said recently. Improved first-quarter results, lower interest rates and a surge in demand for the few remaining bank shares traded on the Oslo bourse and in CBK's limited number of privately-held shares have encouraged the government to move on reprivatisation. On the Oslo bourse, the bank sub-index this year until the first week of June had increased by 88.84 per cent. By comparison, in the first quarter this year Oslo's all-share index rose by 20 per cent, while CBK's portfolio of listed shares increased in value by 24 per cent. But CBK bank executives believe reprivatisation may be premature and that the minority Labour government does not intend fully to relinquish control of the banks - and that this should be made clear to investors. UK-based Davis International Banking Consultants said in a study of Norwegian bank capacity: 'We believe that any future investors in Norwegian banks are going to demand a considerable cushion of surplus equity in order to protect them against unforeseen risks.' CBK's shareholders, like those of Den norske Bank and Fokus Bank, were forced to accept that a big portion of the bank's share capital had been wiped out and that the value of their shares had been written down to zero. This was despite CBK's efforts to win government support for maintaining a symbolic value of the shares. CBK says it now faces the twin tasks of boosting new loan volume while reducing the volume of non-performing loans. 'We need good loans to enhance growth and we need to reduce non-performing loans,' senior executives say. The bank has been through a big consolidation process: in the past two years it has reduced staff by 20 per cent and in this year's first quarter it cut another 147 jobs. Learning bitter lessons from its past mistakes, CBK has established a credit control committee to approve all loans above NKr40m while all loans of more than NKr10m must be reported to it. Last year, the control committee reviewed 1,000 loan applications above the NKr40m level. By the first quarter of this year, CBK's portfolio of gross non-performing loans was NKr11.588bn for which loan loss provisions of NKr5.879bn have been made. CBK also reckons it has a loans worth NKr4.88bn with high-risk exposure. In all, the bank has net loans of NKr70.849bn. On the bright side, in this year's first quarter, net non-performing loans reached their lowest level in three years, at NKr5.7bn. CBK says it faces potentially high losses from loans to the fishing sector which account for NKr8bn of the loan portfolio. It has loans of NKr3.2-3.5bn to fishing companies in Seattle which are struggling to make ends meet after the fishing season was halved to about 100 days a year. In the first quarter of this year the bank charged accounts with a NKr99m loss on loans to fishermen in the area. Meanwhile, Mr Finn Hvistendahl, Den norske Bank's chief executive, says DnB can also be reprivatised next year if the bank manages to bounce back to the black in 1993. He says profitability is within reach and that DnB is likely to follow a corresponding schedule to that of Christiania Bank, in which state-owned shares will be offered this year, followed by a rights issue of new shares in 1994. Mr Hvistendahl believes the government would not subscribe to the new shares of either CBK or DnB, thereby reducing its stake in the two banks to below 50 per cent.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Elf in FFr1.1bn deal with BNP Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company privatised earlier this year, yesterday said it would sell FFr1.1bn (Dollars 198m) worth of industrial investments to Banque Nationale de Paris, its principal bank. Elf will be paid in BNP shares, which will make the oil group the second largest investor in the bank with more than 4 per cent of its capital. Elf holds 1.86 per cent of BNP's shares - taken at BNP's privatisation last autumn. A joint statement said the deal reflected Elf's strategy of disposing of non-core assets and BNP's desire to strengthen its position in venture capital, where it holds investments worth about FFr15bn. The two companies are part of each other's noyau dur of long-term stable investors. Elf will sell the industrial assets held by Financiere Gamma, a subsidiary of CPIH, which in turn is a joint subsidiary of Elf and Elf Gabon, which groups the oil company's Gabon interests. The operation is expected to involve the issue of between 4m and 4.4m BNP shares. The assets involved are non-listed and most are venture capital investments. They include Marie Brizard, the liqueur company and France Elevage, the genetics and agricultural concern. Elf said none of the investments were strategic and did not include its participation in Bidermann, the troubled textiles group. Since taking over as chairman of Elf last year, Mr Philippe Jaffre has focused on the group's core activities of oil and gas, chemicals and healthcare.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Dzyublo] </F>   [Text] Moscow 21 May TASS -- Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov called for guarantees of the implementation of the  three-party agreement on the Crimea signed by Russia, Ukraine  and the United States.    Speaking on Russian television on Saturday [21 May], Meshkov  said that "we recognise our responsibility both to the people of  Ukraine and the people of Russia" for possible consequences that  the current developments may entail. He stressed that the  Crimea's "willingness to work things out" must be "supported and  guaranteed by all sides."    He described as "understandable" the situation when "the  most  acute problem of the Black Sea Fleet" based in the peninsula "is  being solved without the participation of the Republic of  Crimea." Meshkov emphasised that the problem "affects residents  of the Republic of Crimea" and their interests.    He confirmed his intention "to solve all disputes on the  basis of mutually beneficial and mutually acceptable terms."  Meshkov said that at first the Crimea and Ukraine must sign an  agreement in order to stabilise the situation and create  conditions for signing an agreement between Russia and Ukraine.    He stressed that this must be done in exactly this order,  not  vice versa. The president warned that the opposite may put the  Crimea outside the settlement process and have a negative impact  on the talks.</p>

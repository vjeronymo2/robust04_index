			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A short while ago we received via fax a copy of the  following open letter addressed today by the Social Democracy  Party of Romania [PDSR] to the chairmen of the PNTCD [National  Peasant Christian-Democratic Party], PD-FSN [Democratic  Party-National Salvation Front], UDMR [Democratic Union of  Hungarians in Romania], PL '93 [Liberal Party '93], PAC [Civic  Alliance Party], and PSDR [Romanian Social-Democratic Party]:    Being aware of the virtues of dialogue, I reiterate the  readiness of the Social Democracy Party of Romania, which I also  expressed in a letter I sent to you at the beginning of last  year, to initiate general discussions among our parties. Hoping  that you also agree to that idea, we are expecting your  suggestions regarding the date, agenda, and the representation  level of the delegations that would engage in those discussions.  Please accept my high esteem.    The letter is signed by PDSR Chairman Oliviu Gherman.</p>

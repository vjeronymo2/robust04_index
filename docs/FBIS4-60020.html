			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, chief of the Palestinian </F> negotiating delegation, by Sa'id Mu'addi in Gaza on 20 May --  recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, first of all many happy  returns on the 'Id and welcome to Gaza.    [Sha'th] I welcome you and wish you, too, many happy  returns.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, the visit is perhaps a surprise short  visit to the Gaza Strip? What is the purpose of this visit?    [Sha'th] First of all, I have come to see my homeland. This  is the first time I have entered Palestine since 1964. My last  visit to Gaza was in 1964. Therefore, this is a chance for me,  even for a few moments, to see this beloved homeland, Gaza, and  its skies and land, and these great people in Gaza. That's why  when the opportunity presented itself to see Gaza, I did not let  it pass.    Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] wanted to reassure  himself  about the situation. He gave me some money that is needed by  the police force in Gaza. Let us say that it is a small present  so things will begin in the proper perspective and then, God  willing, all necessary funds will flow when international  material assistance becomes available. We will also meet with  the brothers at brother Abu-'Ammar's request to see about, at  least, the preliminary and necessary needs after the first week  of our forces' arrival and the establishment of our authority in  preparation for the arrival of brother Abu-'Ammar and the  brothers in the command. God willing, I will be with them.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, how do you assess the  implementation on the ground of the agreement between the  Israeli and Palestinian side?    [Sha'th] With all sincerity, I see that matters are  proceeding far better than in the best of expectations. Of  course, I believe matters are going this well because our  Palestinian people, at least here in Gaza and in Jericho, want  this agreement to succed. There is complete popular cooperation  with the Palestinian police. They have adopted the police  force. Let me say that the people, with their generosity and  sincere national sense have adopted their soldiers and their  police force. They are doing all they can to enable them carry  out their duties as easily as possible. I have noticed, too,  that, in reality, there are no large problems concerning  coordination between the Palestinian police force and the  withdrawing Israeli forces. I believe the beginning of work is  positive on all levels. We hope we will be able to offer the  necessary support to complete the requirements for success.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, perhaps you do not know, but an  incident  took place at Erez junction. Two IDF soldiers were fired on and  killed. The perpetrators fled into the autonomy area in Gaza.    [Sha'th] No doubt, there will be incidents. However, what is  important is that the will should exist to overcome them and to  gradually prevent all acts of violence and move toward real  peace, which our people and the Israeli people undoubtedly need.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th from Gaza, thank you very much  and  many happy returns, and welcome.    [Sha'th] Thank you, and through you I send greetings to all  the sons of our people throughout our beloved Palestine on the  'Id and to our brothers in the Galilee, the Negev, Yafo, and  everywhere.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 12 Jun (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, State  Council vice premier and foreign minister, met today at the  Diaoyutai State Guesthouse with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa, who is now on a working visit to China. Qian Qichen  and Kakizawa exchanged views on bilateral relations and on the  issue of the Korean peninsula's nuclear problem.    Foreign Minister Kakizawa briefed Qian Qichen on Japan's  views concerning the current situation.    Qian Qichen pointed out concerning the Korean peninsula's  nuclear issue that the Chinese Government has always persisted  in the basic goals of promoting a nuclear-free Korean peninsula  and of maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula.  Because these two goals are in accord with the fundamental  interests of all the countries of Northeast Asia, they should  become the basic starting point for seeking a proper solution to  the current problem.    Qian Qichen pointed out that China is greatly concerned  about  the serious difficulties surrounding the Korean peninsula's  nuclear issue. We regret the action taken by the International  Atomic Energy Agency on 10 June to temporarily halt technical  assistance to [North] Korea and the consequences resulting from  that action. When faced with difficulties, it is particularly  necessary for the parties concerned to maintain calm and to  exercise restraint, not to simply close the door to dialogue,  and to do everything possible to leave room to maneuver and to  maintain the possibility of solving this problem through  dialogue. Sanctions will not help to solve problems and can  only sharpen contradictions and might lead to consequences that  no one wants to see. We call on the parties concerned to try  their best to start up the dialogue, to alleviate the  contradictions, and to seek ways for a proper solution to the  problem.</p>

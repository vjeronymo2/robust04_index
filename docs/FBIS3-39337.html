			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Miguel Gonzalez report: "Spain Rejects NATO Proposals That </F> It Take Part in Air Strikes in Bosnia"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- Spain has rejected the requests made  to it by NATO that it join the air force ready to intervene in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. In successive rounds of consultations  conducted by the secretary general and by the allied military  commands, the Spanish representatives have replied that Spain's  contribution to resolving the conflict is more than sufficient  for the present. Only if the air operations were to be  prolonged and it were necessary to relieve some of the aircraft  present in the area could the still valid offer of six F-18  fighter bombers once made by Spain be made good.    The latest of these unofficial approaches was made through  the military representatives to NATO a month ago, and the  response was negative, as on previous occasions.    Although in principle it was questioned whether the Spanish  Air Force could carry out "surgical strikes," military sources  state that the F-18 is the best fighter aircraft in service in  Europe, and that there are no technical or operational  objections to taking part in the operation if the government  gives its approval.    Nevertheless, with around 160 aircraft at his disposal,  Admiral Michael Boorda, chief of NATO's southern command, has  more than enough resources to eliminate the batteries besieging  Sarajevo if the United Nations authorizes strikes when the  ultimatum expires 21 February.    In addition to the United States, the UK, France, the  Netherlands, and Turkey have replied affirmatively to the  request to contribute aircraft to NATO's plans. Under these  conditions, Spanish participation is not deemed necessary, and  so its refusal has not caused annoyance in NATO.  <H5>  Blue Helmets' Safety </H5>   A different situation would arise if an escalation in the  conflict necessitated prolonging the air operations, and it were  necessary to relieve other allies' aircraft.    The Spanish Government once said that the offer of the six  F-18's at the Zaragoza base was confined to controlling the  airspace, but it seems unlikely that Spain could refuse, for  instance, to defend the UN troops when its own blue helmets are  under the NATO aircraft's protection.    The argument used by Spain for not taking part in the  mission  is that it is already contributing more than enough to resolving  the conflict with its 1,200 troops deployed on the scene, as  well as two frigates, a P-3 Orion aircraft, and a Civil Guard  patrol boat, which are monitoring the embargo on Serbia. This  is not being said explicitly, because other countries are in the  same situation, but the desire to preserve some neutrality in  order not to endanger the blue helmets also carries weight.    Spain even refused to send air traffic controllers to guide  the aircraft which are to protect the UN troops, for fear that  this could be interpreted as a hostile action by the warring  sides, and only did so in the wake of the other countries with  troops in the area. The protection afforded by these aircraft,  and, above all, NATO's threat to respond vigorously to any  aggression against the UN forces, is now the only effective  defense for the troops.

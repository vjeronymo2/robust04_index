			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamiz Deronjic from Brcko] </F>   [Excerpt] Another enemy tank -- the fourth one since the  outset of the massive chetnik offensive -- has been destroyed on  the Brcko front. After hours of shelling our positions this  morning, the Serbian aggressor early this afternoon made yet  another attempt to break through the defense lines with strong  armored and mechanized forces. With heavy artillery support,  the tank and infantry attack was carried out in two directions,  toward Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca and Boderiste-Vranovaca. The  fighters of the 108th Infantry Brigade and the 108th Motorized  Brigade responded well to this attack. About a dozen chetniks  were killed in infantry fighting and the fighters of the 108th  Brigade fired a precise shot and destroyed a chetnik tank with  the entire crew.    The fighters of the legendary 108th Motorized Brigade have  asked us to say that this was their way of expressing their  support for the defenders and citizens of Gorazde. They say:  We cannot rout the chetniks around Gorazde but, for Gorazde, we  will rout the chetniks here. [passage omitted]</p>

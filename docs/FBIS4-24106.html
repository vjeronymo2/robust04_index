			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Derek Keys by SABC </F> correspondent Leslie Mashokwe in Cape Town on the "Newsline"  program -- live]    [Text] [Mashokwe] Good evening, Mr. Keys, and welcome to  Newsline. Mr. Keys, what did you intend doing with this year's  budget?    [Keys] We really tried to do two main things. The first one  is to make sure that the Reconstruction and Development Program  [RDP] got what it needed to get under way, and that I think we  have managed to do. The second one was to make sure that we  did everything that we could to facilitate growth. Now that's  got two sides to it. First of all, we've got to make sure that  we've got macroeconomic stability, that we've got reasonable  inflation rates and interest rates, and so on. Secondly, we've  got to be sure that we remove any obstacles that there are in  the structure which hinder growth. That's why we took off the  import surcharge and changed the corporate tax.    [Mashokwe] In balancing that act between not spending too  much money and making sure that the RDP is implemented, how did  you manage to balance the books?    [Keys] We tried to do what was practical. I've worked a lot  with large organizations. When you take a large organization  and you want to turn it in direction, as far as what it's doing  is concerned, then one knows that making it move 3 percent a  year is the sort of term which you can manage reasonably easily.  Two percent a year on our level of consumption expenditure for  general government is 2.5 billion rands a year. So that's  really what determined the 2.5 billion. It also happens to be  the sort of sum that will allow Minister Without Portfolio Jay  Naidoo to really get under way.    [Mashokwe] But they are still saying that you did not give  any new money to the RDP. Instead, you took some money from  other departments, as if to say the RDP was a separate animal  that had to be fed with a few rands and cents in order to bring  better life to people.    [Keys] No, on the contrary, the RDP has to have priority.  The president has made this quite clear to the cabinet; he has  made it quite clear to the nation. And I'm perfectly convinced  that 2.5 billion is going to be an amount that takes a lot of  managing between now and the end of March next year. The year  after that, it's 5, the year after that it's 7.5, and so on,  assuming that we're able to keep everything in place. I'm  satisfied that as a spear- heading unit, that unit of Minister  Naidoo's will have all the funds that it needs.    [Mashokwe] But the sums that had been bandied around,  something like 89 billion for the RDP -- you say we should not  concern ourselves with those figures?    [Keys] That's right. It's a mistake. It's....    [Mashokwe, interrupting] How then will South Africans be  able  to get what they were promised?    [Keys] Well, they'll get it through this process which will  concentrate on using the funds that we're giving to the RDP  fund, to leverage other funds, to make various schemes possible.  For instance, the mortgage indemnity scheme, the mortgage  insurance scheme, which is going to make housing finance  available from the private sector to people who wouldn't qualify  for it now. That will require a trickle of funds, compared to  the funds that can be mobilized by putting such a scheme in  place. So I think we have to see the funds that have been put  under Minister Naidoo's command, we have to see them as, in a  sense, seed money, or leverage money, money that can get other  activities going.    [Mashokwe] But if one reads the spirit and letter of the  RDP,  it's almost like saying these are things that the previous  government should have done. Now the ANC was on that ticket,  saying: We promise you a million houses and all sorts of  things. But you're treating it as if the RDP is a separate  animal, with separate funds, and one has to ask the question, is  this an ANC government and an NP [National Party] budget? What  are we talking about?    [Keys] No, it's a budget of the government of national  unity,  I'm happy to say. No, there's nothing separate about it. As  you know, Minister Naidoo is right in the president's office, so  he's at the center of the entire government machine. He's a  member of the treasury committee, on which the other members are  myself and the two deputy presidents, which is the central  committee as far as allocation of spending and so on, and  changes in the allocation of spending are concerned. So his  activities and those of the machine are intermeshed to the  greatest possible extent, and one must remember that there are  many programs in the existing level of spending of government  departments which -- perhaps with a slight change of emphasis,  perhaps with a little modification here or there -- are  admirably suited to be part of the RDP program.    [Mashokwe] What does this budget mean to the ordinary South  Africans? It would appear there's nothing for the poor, for  instance. No relief for them.    [Keys] The poorer have to be helped, basically, on the  expenditure side of the budget, because you can't do much with  tax concessions for people who don't pay taxes. So poor  assistance has to come on the expenditure side. The RDP, of  course, is concerned with uplifting the poor, so that they're  right in the target areas as far as that's concerned. The  president in his speeches has already started that process  going, with feeding at schools, with free medical services, and  so on. So the poor have to look to what's being spent for  alleviation of their position.    [Mashokwe] We have 292 million for job creation. Is  government creating these funds, or are you creating a climate  conducive for spending?    [Keys] The 292 is really a hang-over from last year. You  remember the government last year started a program in  cooperation with the National Economic Forum, and the funds,  most of those funds, hadn't been allocated by the time the  change of government took place. So those funds were rolled  over into this year, and that 292 is really the funds which the  National Economic Forum has used as part of its program, which  it's now successfully allocated, and they will be spent this  year.    [Mashokwe] We also hear every year that a certain amount of  money is being put aside for use in a particular field, yet the  bureaucracy, the big bureaucracy that we have, the civil service  that we have, big as it is, does not seem to be able to deliver  the goods, as it were, to people. How are you going to do it  differently this time? Those people are still in place; the  structures are still intact.    [Keys] Yes. I don't think it's those people, as such, that  were the problem. In certain instances it may be, but I think  that the fundamental problem was that that kind of spending had  tremendous political overtones, at a time when the previous  government was in power. That ought to have changed now, and  I'm very much looking forward to seeing whether it has changed,  and the extent to which that now facilitates the delivery.    [Mashokwe] I'm still surprised that we heard nothing about,  you know, the much-publicized wish of the African National  Congress then, in wanting to make a smaller, more efficient  civil service. Instead, we seem to be having a bigger civil  service, with all nine provinces and all departments in those  areas.    [Keys] Yes. Don't forget that the nine provinces replace  16 other administrations which were there before, and they ought  to be very much more effective and very much better connected to  the center. All of their civil servants will be members of one  civil service organization. I think the whole thing is going to  be potentially much easier to control. But there will be  transitional problems, where you have the old administrations  which have to function for a while, where functions have to be  transferred, where there's a certain amount of hang-over in the  system, and so on. So short term, we're going to have problems,  but longer term, I think we're in a position to run a more  efficient ship.    [Mashokwe] I'm not minimizing the amount of passengers that  we had -- that's the bottom line -- we're still stuck with a big  infrastructure, a big bureaucracy. Nothing has changed.    [Keys] Yes, it's quite a big country, but the constitution,  you know, guarantees all the civil servants their positions and  their pensions, and everything else, which is a necessary step  when you go through a big change like this.    [Mashokwe] Let's talk about the transitional levy, 5  percent,  that I have to pay. One would ask a question like: Did this  government, the past government, not know that we were going to  go through a transitional period? Did you not have any  contingency plans? Why should we be taxed for a transformation  that was so necessary?    [Keys] Well, the transformation was necessary, but it cost  money. If we simply borrowed the money that it cost, then we  would run a bigger deficit than we ran last year, and we'd be  branded as spendthrifts.    [Mashokwe] But you knew you were going to go through a  transition, Mr. Keys. Was it not necessary to have made a  contingency plan then, rather than moving to a levy that is  going to carry into the next financial year?    [Keys] My contingency plan was the levy.    [Mashokwe] Okay, let's talk about issues like social  spending. You are saying you're going to level the playing  fields now -- no more blacks getting fewer pension pay-outs.  Does this mean that there won't be any increases for those who  were already on a particular benchmark in terms of their  payments, civil service payments, social spending?    [Keys] The social pension? You mean the old-age pension?  There is a proposal which has been approved by cabinet, but it's  got to be announced by the minister of welfare, dealing with the  improvement of those pensions.    [Mashokwe] Black people will get the same pensions like....    [Keys, interrupting] They already do, and they will in  future, of course, as well.    [Mashokwe] Okay. Let's talk about the other points that we  need to be looking at. What about the fact that you have not  announced any relief? You said there will be job creation for  292 million rands. Any relief for people in distress? No  contingency there as well?    [Keys] The people in distress are, as I say, on the spending  side of the budget. It has to be taken care of in the RDP  program. The president has already started that process.    [Mashokwe] What about the most contentious issue -- elderly  people are worried about the fact that they were not given free  medical attention. Is anything going to be done in that regard?    [Keys] Well, I think you will have to talk to the  responsible  minister as far as that's concerned.    [Mashokwe] But you hold the purse strings.    [Keys] Well, I don't hold the purse strings, in the sense  that everybody, the whole cabinet, understands and accepts that  what we spend has to come out of limited resources, and so we  now going through a process of reprioritizing different types of  expenditure, and this is something....[pauses] You can't go  through that process as a minister unless you know your  department rather well. So this will take a little while.    [Mashokwe] What about the nine provinces that we have? Are  you going to spend more money there? Are you going to spend  less money there, as opposed to the TBVC [Transkei,  Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei] states that we had in the  past?    [Keys] We're going to spend, overall, the same amount of  money. That's what keeping the level of consumption expenditure  in real terms means. But I hope it's going to be a more  effective system.    [Mashokwe] I'm still wanting to understand exactly how we're  going to say this budget benefits the ordinary person in the  street. You removed import surcharges, for instance. What does  it mean to me and you?    [Keys] The benefit to the man in the street in this budget  will have to come from the way in which government spends the  money that it is spending. It can't come in the income side.    [Mashokwe] Creating a climate for economic growth? Are we on  course?    [Keys] Yes, absolutely. That's why we've reduced the cost of  investment goods, and we've made it easier and profitable for  companies to keep their profits and reinvest them, rather than  declaring them as dividends.    [Mashokwe] Explain to me exactly what you meant when you  explained the tax on married wives. How are they going to  benefit?    [Keys] They'll benefit through not paying the levy,  fundamentally, and that will largely redress any disadvantage  that they have. Their disadvantage is a historical thing. It's  developed out of the fact that for generations, almost, there  was no such thing as separate tax for married women. They were  simply bundled into the income of their husbands and taxed as a  unit. A process then started, as a result of women's lib --  perfectly understandably. A process started to have separate  taxation, but in the course of that we've ended at a point where  they actually pay slightly higher tax than they ought to. Now  we've taken care of the situation in this year by exempting --  largely exempting -- them from the levy, unless they earn more  than 175,000 rands. Next year the matter will be taken care of  by the recommendations of the tax commission.    [Mashokwe] While speaking about tax, we notice that you have  reduced tax on companies again, yet tax on individuals is not  reduced.    [Keys] I haven't reduced tax overall on the corporate  sector.  We are taxing GEIS [General Export Incentive Scheme], we are  taxing dividends more heavily, and that's paid by the companies.  This is not a tax that's paid by the recipients. Those two  things balance out the lower corporate rates, so what we've  actually done is, within a fixed amount of income that we get  from the corporate sector, we've made a rearrangement which  induces growth to a greater extent than the previous arrangement.    [Mashokwe] But you know for a fact that South Africans are  complaining that they are heavily taxed, with the 5 percent levy  and the heavy tax that you have not reduced. How do you hope  that they are going to survive?    [Keys] Well, you know, one has to survive by giving a  certain  priority to the payments that need to be made, of which tax is  one. So one accepts that there's a certain amount of hardship  involved. We've done our best to make that very light, make the  burden very much lighter at the lower income levels than at the  higher income levels.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Minister, it's almost like the more you earn,  the more you get taxed, as if it's a sin to earn more in a  capitalist country, so to say. Where are we headed for?    [Keys] Almost every country's taxation system is  progressive;  the more you earn, the more you pay. That's based on the  principle of ability to pay and a certain amount of social  equity.    [Mashokwe] Talk about the new tax structure. We had the Mago  Commission, now another commission. Seemingly we're into a  business of commissions, and we the taxpayers foot the bill.    [Keys] This is a commission with a difference. To the extent  that it wants to make recommendations about changing the  taxation system, it has to do so by November this year, and that  report will be immediately published. It will be available for  comment by everybody who's interested, by every taxpayer, and  it's only in February of the next year that the government will  take the decisions on the recommendations, after it's had all  this comment.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Minister, thanks for your time, and thanks  for  talking to us.    [Keys] Thank you very much. I enjoyed it.</p>

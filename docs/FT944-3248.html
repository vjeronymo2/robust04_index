			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Chechnya action leads to rift in Russian military A rift among Russian top brass emerged yesterday as senior military officials criticised the government's effort to subdue the breakaway Chechen republic. General Alexander Lebed and General Boris Gromov, who commanded Soviet forces during the Afghan war, warned that the intervention in Chechnya might lead to a bloody and drawn-out guerrilla war. 'Step by step, the Afghan experience is being repeated in Chechnya,' said Gen Lebed, commander of Russian forces in Moldova. 'We risk getting involved in a war with the entire Moslem world.' He condemned the government for sending 'untrained kids' into the region. The criticism, when nine Russian soldiers have already died, highlights how the Chechen crisis is dividing Russian leaders. A strange alliance of liberal and communist politicians in the Russian parliament yesterday opposed the action. The Duma, lower house, passed a resolution describing the government's actions as 'unsatisfactory'. But it urged President Boris Yeltsin to disarm the Chechens and to 'restore legality' in the region, which declared its independence three years ago. Russian forces, aiming to encircle Grozny, the Chechen capital, are being impeded by swarms of civilians. The intervention appears to have dissolved internal political disputes in Chechnya, and other peoples of the volatile north Caucasus are rallying to aid their neighbours. Negotiations between Chechen and Russian representatives in the North Ossetian city of Vladikavkaz continued last night, but made no real progress. Itar-Tass news agency quoted Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister, as saying Russia would give Rbs 1,000bn in aid to Chechnya once the conflict ends. It was possible yesterday to drive into Grozny in spite of Russian claims of a blockade. The road from Nazran, capital of neighbouring Ingushetia, was crowded with nervous Russian troops and littered with the remains of a dozen burnt-out tanks and trucks. Crossing into Chechnya, there were few visible defences - only a few concrete blocks thrown across the road. Grizzled Chechen fighters carrying Kalashnikov rifles and Molotov cocktails walked around. At the village of Dovidenko, about 40km west of Grozny, several hundred Chechen civilians swarmed towards a column of Russian troops and pleaded with them to turn back. One woman screamed, 'Do not make another Afghanistan]' Another shouted: 'This is not a battle against the Chechens it is war against the Moslems.' A group of Chechen women was also sent to plead with the second Russian column advancing from the republic of Dagestan. The third column of Russian troops moved to within 5km of Grozny where reporters said they saw troops blow up a car with a family inside fearing they were trying to destroy a bridge.

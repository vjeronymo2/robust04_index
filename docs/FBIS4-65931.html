			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] Munich ARD Television Network in German  at 1958-2020 GMT on 25 May carries an interview with Social  Democratic Party [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Luc  Jochimsen and Nikolaus Brender on the outcome of the  presidential election and the SPD's political goals for the 16  October Bundestag election. Scharping outlines the changes in  domestic policy if the SPD were to win the majority and he were  to become next chancellor.    Asked by Luc Jochimsen whether he was still disappointed at  the outcome of the 23 May presidential election, Scharping says  that he is, "because there can be no doubt that Johannes Rau  would have been an excellent president for Germany." He adds,  however, that one "has to live with defeats" in politics. The  decision is legitimate, he says, and "like any upright democrat  we will loyally cooperate with the new president."    Nikolaus Brender confronts Scharping with an earlier  statement of his according to which the Free Democratic Party  [FDP] would no longer be needed after the next Bundestag  election, arguing that this was an indirect statement in favor  of a coalition between the SPD and the Greens after the  Bundestag election. Scharping replies: "No, on the contrary.  In the presidential election the FDP did what it did. Yet,  this does not mean that all doors have been closed." Scharping  believes that on the election night "the supply of coalition  partners will be greater than the demand, which reduces the  price, or to put it more politely, will make negotiations  easier." Scharping adds that "politically, things will change  for the better in Germany only when the SPD becomes the  strongest party; this is what we are concentrating on, while  everything else will have to be decided after 16 October."    Scharping then criticizes the economic situation in Germany  arguing that at the moment there is "a deficit of 5 million  competitive jobs, that many young families are looking for  affordable accommodation," and that "1 million children are  growing up in this country with the experience of parents being  on social welfare." Jochimsen argues that the CDU [Christian  Democratic Union] also wants to create more jobs and build more  apartments, but Scharping discards that, emphasizing that the  coalition is cutting social benefits and funds for social  housing. He says that "Helmut Kohl's government has  dramatically reduced the funds for active labor market policy,"  thus having cut "an additional 700,000 jobs."    The SPD chairman is asked how he would finance his social  program. Scharping argues that raising taxes is unimaginative,  considering that "taxes jumped up dramatically in the past four  years" anyway, with the main burden having been put on employed  people. "What we want is to shift funds around in the budget  but not raise the quota of taxes and rates, because this quota  is indeed high enough." Funds have to be increased for "more  economic growth, more demand, and more investments," since  "without these three elements we will not be able to create new  jobs" and will "not be competitive in the future." Scharping  does not go into detail but says that high-income earners, "the  top 20 percent of the income pyramid" would have to pay higher  taxes. He reiterates the importance of "creating growth,"  because otherwise it would not be able to create jobs or  consolidate the state finances. "Some 2,000 billion German  marks [DM] in public debts, or DM65,000 for every German" are  the absolute limit.    Jochimsen argues that she does not have the impression that  people really feel it is time for a change, and she makes  reference to U.S. President Clinton's election campaign.  Scharping stresses that the Bundestag election campaign has not  started yet but says that "I agree it is time for a change." He  says that "it is a great challenge" to modernize the economy,  seek social justice, and pursue a consistent environmental  policy. "I am absolutely convinced" that this change will take  place in Germany. He says that the SPD is currently standing at  39 percent in surveys, and in the European election on 12 June  we will see whether the SPD will manage to "convince and  mobilize more and more people, and to make it clear that in this  country we need more solidarity, more shared responsibility, and  less egotism," which "as I would say, has spread terribly under  the Kohl government."    Brender asks why the voters should want to change the  government, considering that the economy is beginning to  recover, a fact that could reduce the SPD's chances. Scharping  asserts that the SPD's chances "have so far not decreased and  will not decrease." He argues that as far as growing demand  from abroad is concerned, Germany is currently "reaping the  fruits of a better economic policy in other countries."  Scharping says that Germany needs "a new founding era," "new  enterprises, new investments," and a "dynamic development of the  domestic economy." He says he is sorry that the economic  situation does not look too good at the moment, adding that "I  am happy about any improvement." However, "if the number of  unemployed grows by 500,000 this year, one can hardly speak of  economic upswing." He notes that "we are still a long way from  recovery for everybody, and, I fear that with the policy that  has been pursued so far we will not get recovery for all."    Mrs. Jochimsen refers to surveys that predict an increase  in support for the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] in the  new laender and asks Rudolf Scharping why he is shying away from  confrontation with the PDS. Scharping argues that he is not,  noting that "for us the PDS is more than the normal political  opponent." He adds that he is taking people in eastern Germany  and their concerns "very seriously." "I go there a lot and talk  to many people, and I do not just go there to turn a lever and  open a new plant." He emphasizes that people in the new laender  must also be aware that "each vote for the PDS may be  understandable" as a result of the developments and  disappointments of the past three years, "but democracy does not  live on democracy or rage, but on the resolve to change things,"  and "anybody who votes for the PDS will strengthen the current  situation and weaken the chances for change." Without wanting  to discredit the party's supporters, Scharping maintains that  the PDS is the "direct successor to the old Socialist Unity  Party of Germany [SED], and has directly taken over the former  SED cadres, the former assets, and many other things, and even  the old policies."    Returning to the tax issue, Scharping points out that  "German  unification is currently financed basically by debts and by  contributions to social security," rejecting that German  unification be merely financed by employed people; self-employed  people, such as dentists, politicians, and public servants, he  says, must also contribute. Scharping says that considering the  significant social cuts under the current government, the SPD  would "not agree to any further reduction in social benefits."    Scharping speaks out in favor of "stronger direct  participation" of the citizens in the political decisionmaking  process, such as referendums and petitions for referendums. He  says that this issue will be brought up in the SPD's election  campaign, and criticizes the coalition government for  obstructing any SPD suggestions in this direction. Scharping  says that in his state, Rhineland-Palatinate, mayors would be  elected directly in the future.    In conclusion, Scharping announces the SPD's motto for the  future: "A just, tolerant, and peaceful Germany."</p>

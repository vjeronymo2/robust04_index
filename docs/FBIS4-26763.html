			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Guard Against Formalism and Showy </F> Style of Work--More on Putting Things Into Practice"]    [Text] When expounding the question of putting things into  practice, Chairman Jiang Zemin emphatically stressed guarding  against formalism and a showy style of work. This important  instruction is of very great, immediate significance.    Approaching things realistically and guarding against  formalism and a showy style of work is a Marxist principle and  also a fine tradition of our party and Army. In recent years,  the Military Commission as well as the General Staff  Headquarters, the General Political Department, and the General  Logistics Department have repeatedly stressed this issue. Party  committees and leading organs at all levels have implemented  relevant instructions of the Military Commission and the General  Departments. Various tasks have been implemented satisfactorily  on the whole. Nevertheless, in the leadership work of a small  number of units there are still the problems of formalism and a  showy style of work. Consequently, some tasks failed to be  fully implemented in grass-roots units.    So-called formalism refers to a metaphysical viewpoint,  method, or style of work which onesidedly concentrates on form  to the neglect of substance. It is characterized by separation  of form and substance, preference for form over substance, and  hankering for superficial spectaculars to the neglect of  practical results. A so- called showy style of work refers to  cutting oneself off from the masses, losing contact with  reality, doing work superficially, and having an unsound style  of work. Not only will formalism and a showy style of work  corrupt social values, tarnish the image of cadres, and dampen  the enthusiasm of the masses, but they will also make the  party's principles and policies stay at meetings, on papers or  in mouths, and prevent them from being genuinely implemented to  the letter. In an essay, "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing" in  those years, Comrade Mao Zedong incisively analyzed and sharply  criticized formalism of various forms and regarded them as the  archenemy of the working class and the Communist Party and as a  sign of impurity in party spirit. As far as formalism and a  showy style of work in the Army are concerned, we should all the  more have a profound understanding of their harmfulness. In  peacetime, they can seriously hamper the enhancement of our  combat capability, and in wartime, they can exact a price in  blood from us. At present, we should meet the needs of the  macro-climate of developing a socialist market economy and of  the military strategic principles of the new period. The task  of accomplishing the general objective of building a modern,  regular, and revolutionary army is very arduous. As new  developments and problems are emerging one after another, we  should work steadily and make solid progress. On no account  should we indulge in a showy style of work in this regard. We  should approach elimination of formalism and a showy style of  work from a political height and eliminate them as an  "archenemy."    When its comes to the harmfulness of formalism and a showy  style of work, many people bitterly hate them, but in practice,  never will they be bored with them. The main reason for this  state of affairs is the way their thinking does mischief,  namely, hankering after fame and gain, fearing hardship, and  trying to please the public by claptrap rather than by solid  work. To eliminate formalism and a showy style of work, we  should correct our guiding thinking on work. The purpose of our  work is to promote army building and reform and enhance the  combat capability of the troops. Proceeding from this purpose,  we should hold ourselves responsible for both the higher and  lower levels and on no account should we seek fame and gain and  do anything that is pleasant to the eye but is of no use. We  should have a strong sense of revolutionary cause and do solid  work. We should have an ideological level of being willing to  be lonely and not being burdened with fame and gain and a drive  of not stopping until the true state of affairs is clear and  practical results are achieved. Not only should leading organs  at all levels be the first to set a good example but they should  also dare to express, with a clear-cut stand and in clear and  unequivocal terms, their views to their subordinates on what to  encourage and what to oppose so that those who do solid work  will genuinely be looked up to and those who indulge in  formalism and a showy style of work will draw no benefit  therefrom.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Formalism is also  bureaucratism." Facts have proven that formalism and  bureaucratism are linked together. The latter encourages the  former, and the former conceals the latter. In studying the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  leaders at all levels should change their leadership style, make  a priority of linking theory with practical work to do a good  job of carrying our work in a down- to-earth manner, and exert  efforts to solve this problem. We should energetically conduct  investigations and study, try our best to conduct fewer  upper-level activities, frequently go down to the troops and the  grass-roots units, take measures to carry out work in light of  the actual needs of the troops, and attach special importance to  carrying out regular and basic work in a down-to-earth manner.  Approaching things realistically and guarding against formalism  and a showy style of work is a rudimentary requirement and also  a very high standard. Whether this goal can be achieved or not  is a test for the comprehensive quality of leading organs and  cadres. We should have a good mental state and a sense of  mission and high responsibility for army building, rouse  ourselves for vigorous efforts to make the country prosperous,  do solid work with perseverance, and make persistent efforts to  strive to implement the party's principles and policies and the  Military Commission's decisions under the guidance of the theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>

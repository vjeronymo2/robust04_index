			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / How To Spend It: Designs on your purse ANYONE WHO wants to dispel mid-winter gloom after the January sales should head for London's Montpelier Street, where Bonhams is mounting its second Decorative Arts Today selling exhibition. From January 25 to February 7, Bonhams is offering a rare opportunity to see under one roof the work of leading British designer-makers - no fewer than 140 of them this year. Most is for the home: furniture, lighting, rugs, wall-hangings, glass, ceramics, tableware, silver and beautifully bound books, but it also includes jewellery. When Bonhams decided to sell exciting new work in this way last year, the gamble paid off. Paul Whitfield, deputy chairman, said: 'First in at the door was the chairman of another leading London auction house - last out was Mick Jagger, who had bought 18 works.' This year's exhibition promises to be richer, bigger and even more diverse. As soon as work is sold, it is replaced by another piece by the same designer. All exhibits have been designed and made in the 1990s and, after last year's success, most of the designers have created work specifically for the exhibition. For instance, Senior Carmichael has made a backgammon table in American cherry, with a concealed playing surface and holding coloured sycamore stones and leather shakers and dice (Pounds 3,500), and two matching chairs (Pounds 985 each). Glen Hinton has made a hall table in carved wood, patinated copper and laminated glass (Pounds 1,800), Martin Grierson an elegant drop-leaf table in ripple sycamore with ebony stringing and six chairs (Pounds 7,750), while Bob Crooks is showing his first glass chandelier (Pounds 1,860) and Alan Caiger-Smith his one-off pieces - sadly the last chance to buy his new work in London, because his Aldermaston Pottery closes in May. All the designers were encouraged to produce objects that are practical as well as decorative. Dining tables and chairs, coffee tables, mirrors, side tables, lamps, screens, candlesticks and coffee cups are among the objects featured. Architect Jack Schneider has designed a striking dressing table, in burl poplar and zebrano veneer and lacquered MDF, with a large, round bevelled mirror (Pounds 3,560), while John Whittle has made an unusual bedroom wardrobe, incorporating blue ash veneer (Pounds 1,005). The exhibition sets out to show the wealth of design talent and craftsmanship in Britain today. It also illustrates the great diversity of styles. There is finely crafted wood-based furniture deriving from the Arts and Crafts Movement by designers such as Alan Peters, Ashley Cartwright, Jeremy Broun and Richard Williams; sculptural, minimalist furniture by Ron Arad, whose surprisingly comfortable steel chair has a flexible, woven, polished steel tug which rolls up to form a foot rest; Danny Lane's dramatic two-metre glass table with six legs; painted furniture by Tony Isseyegh showing the Bloomsbury Group's influence; and more eclectic and flamboyant styles, from Regency-inspired metal work by Adrian Reynolds to a Baroque-influenced candlestick by Felicity Evans. The price range is from Pounds 15 to more than Pounds 12,000. Collectors' items such as John Makepeace's library chair carved in burr elm with pivoted leather lecturns for reading and writing (Pounds 11,850), an exquisitely made treasure chest by Robert Ingham (Pounds 3,100) and a delicate cloissonne enamelled egg box (Pounds 1,360) by Maureen Edgar should not deter less well-heeled prospective buyers. There are wooden bangles from Pounds 15 by Hayley Smith, wooden bowls by Bert Marsh from Pounds 25 (turned wood is an increasingly accessible collectable for those of modest means - a piece by another exhibitor, Steve Howlett, was recently bought for the Sainsbury Collection) and silver rings with bright artificial stones by Tina Engell from Pounds 100. There are also hand-printed and painted cushions by Neil Bottle from Pounds 75, ties from Pounds 32, colourful anodised aluminium plates and bowls by Patricia Hamilton from Pounds 35, sensuous coloured jugs by Marianne Buus from Pounds 90 and ceramics from Pounds 40 by Chris Carter (the Sainsbury Collection has bought some of his work, too) and Sarah Perry (who was taught by Lucie Rie and Hans Coper). The designers were asked to keep their prices low and many have produced some particularly good buys. Bev and Mark Houlding, who make fantastic painted and lacquered screens, have offered to make an edition of four screens, painted on one side only, for Pounds 2,000, half their usual price. Camilla Meddings, one of a number of young designers using old gilding and lacquering techniques in a contemporary manner, is exhibiting a mirror (Pounds 140) which depicts Artemis and Apollo, using tarnished copper and gold leaf. There is exceedingly good value in wallhangings from established designers including Noel Dyrenforth, the leading contemporary British batik exponent (Pounds 350), and the much respected weaver, Peter Collingwood, whose linen and steel hanging costs only Pounds 220. Also, a Richard La Trobe Bateman child's highchair in cleft ash is going for only Pounds 395] Some reasonably priced bound books are being exhibited. Jan Lindsay produces bookbindings with blank pages so that you can create your own book; the bookbindings (Pounds 390), made from oak boards with white goatskin thongs, are based on early 12th and 13th century manuscripts. For anyone considering commissioning contemporary furniture in 1993, Decorative Arts Today provides an opportunity to compare the work of more than 60 furniture designers. Bonhams will happily make the introductions. Apart from the well-known names mentioned above, Fred Baier, Ronald Carter, Rupert Williamson, Toby Winteringham, Mark Brazier Jones and Tom Dixon are exhibiting, as well as many unknown recent graduates. Peta Levi is curator of the Decorative Arts Today exhibition; weekdays 11am to 6pm; weekends midday to 6pm.</p>

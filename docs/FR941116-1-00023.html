The revisions consist of amendments to Regulation No. 7, ``Regulation To Control Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds.'' In its review of the September 27, 1989 State submittal, EPA identified several areas where the regulation still did not meet EPA requirements. On August 30, 1990, the State submitted additional revisions to Regulation No. 7 to address these deficiencies. This  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  action applies to both of these submittals. The amendments were made to conform Regulation No. 7 to federal requirements, and to improve the clarity and enforceability of the regulation. EPA's approval will serve to make the revisions federally enforceable and was requested by the State of Colorado.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before December 16, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments should be addressed to: Douglas M.

The State is utilizing this authority of the CAA to update and revise existing regulations which are a part of the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 3, 1978, EPA designated the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area as nonattainment for the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone (43 FR 8976). This designation was reaffirmed by EPA on November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56694) pursuant to section 107(d)(1) of the CAA, as amended in 1990. Furthermore, since the Denver-Boulder area had not shown a violation of the ozone standard during the three-year period from January 1, 1987 to December 31, 1989, the Denver-Boulder area was classified as a ``transitional'' ozone nonattainment area under section 185A of the amended Act. In order to meet the Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements of the CAA, transitional areas must correct any RACT deficiencies regarding enforceability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current Colorado Ozone SIP was approved by EPA in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 12, 1983 (48 FR 55284). The SIP contains Regulation No. 7 (Reg 7), which applies RACT to stationary sources of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). Reg 7 was adopted to meet the requirements of Section 172(b)(2) and (3) of the 1977 CAA (concerning the application of RACT to stationary sources. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) However, the approved Ozone SIP did not rely on the emissions reduction credit that Reg 7 would produce in order to demonstrate attainment; rather, the SIP relied only on mobile source controls in order to demonstrate attainment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The requirement to apply RACT to existing stationary sources of VOC emissions was carried forth under the amended Act in section 172(c)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During 1987 and 1988, EPA Region VIII conducted a review of Reg 7 for consistency with the Control Techniques Guidelines documents (CTGs) and regulatory guidance, for enforceability and for clarity. The CTGs, which are guidance documents issued by EPA, set forth measures that are presumptively RACT for specific categories of sources that emit VOCs. A substantial number of deficiencies were identified in Reg 7. In 1987, EPA published a proposed policy document that included, among other things, an interpretation of the RACT requirements as they applied to VOC nonattainment areas (52 FR 45044, November 24, 1987, Post-87 Policy). On May 25, 1988, EPA published a guidance document entitled ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of the November 24, 1987  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice'' (the ``Blue Book''). A review of Reg 7 against these documents uncovered additional deficiencies in the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of Colorado that the Carbon Monoxide (CO) SIPs for Colorado Springs and Fort Collins were inadequate to achieve the CO NAAQS. In that letter, EPA also notified the Governor that the Ozone SIP had significant deficiencies in design and implementation, and requested that these deficiencies be remedied. EPA did not make a formal call for a revised Ozone SIP in the May 1988 letter, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  even though the Denver-Boulder area was, and continues to be, designated nonattainment for ozone. The reason for this decision was that no violations of the ozone NAAQS had been recorded in the nonattainment area for the previous three years. However, EPA indicated that the deficiencies, if uncorrected, could jeopardize the area's ability to obtain eventual redesignation as an attainment area for ozone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the pre-amended Act, EPA had the authority under section 110(a)(2)(H) to issue a ``SIP Call'' requiring a State to correct deficiencies in an existing SIP. Section 110(a)(2)(H) was not modified by the 1990 Amendments. In addition, the amended Act contains new section 110(k)(5) which also provides authority for a SIP Call.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. 1989 SIP Revision Submittal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a letter dated September 27, 1989, the Governor of Colorado submitted revisions to Reg 7 to partially address EPA's concerns with the Ozone SIP. A detailed description of the specific revisions to the regulation is contained in the Docket for this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with General Milan Gvero, deputy chief </F> of the general staff of the Srpska republic army, by Slobodan  Jankovic; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Jankovic] Mr. General, are there any new results  in the investigation concerning the perpetrators of the massacre  in Sarajevo?    [Gvero] We do not have any new results, except what has  already been said in connection with this obviously staged  massacre by the Muslims. As you know, the representatives of  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] were also unable to say anything  more specific, because, really, they have nothing new to say.  If they did have something to say this time, it appears this  would have to be only in terms of an explanation and  clarification that the Serbian side is not involved in this in  any way.    [Jankovic] How do you explain the refusal by both the Muslim  side and General Ramsey for you to set up a joint commission of  experts?    [Gvero] The reason for this most probably lies in the fact  that the Muslims think that the analyses of an impartial  commission would prove that they staged the incident. This is  why they did not accept it. When the news of the massacre was  first aired, we were in the airport building and immediately  suggested that a joint commission be set up. They rejected it  15 minutes later. They obviously hold the view that the  findings of an impartial commission would not support them and  are therefore rejecting it.    [Jankovic] Mr. General, what does such a bloody move -- the  shelling of civilians causing worldwide indignation -- mean from  a military point of view?    [Gvero] I am sure that this primarily means the prolongation  of the Muslim war option, their lack of readiness to make steps  toward peace, and the encouragement of their belief that they  can solve something with war, by prolonging the war, probably  counting on some encouragement and support from outside.    There is not a single rational reason as to why they would  do  this, why civilians would be killed by those who are supposed to  be protecting them, not killing them. However, when one thinks  about it, one can see that they have support for such a course  of action in Alija's Islamic Declaration, which clearly states  that as far as a religious war is concerned, such as the one  they are waging now, sacrifices are not important and neither  are the numbers nor the quality.</p>

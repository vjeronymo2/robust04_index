			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Argentina in Dollars 2bn privatisation ARGENTINA today will carry out its largest privatisation to date when it sells off Gas del Estado, its state-owned gas company, for more than Dollars 2bn. The government is expecting bids from consortia comprising companies ranging from British Gas to a clutch of regional North American operators, all allied with local companies. Each consortium is competing for control of one of 10 independent business units which will make up the privatised and deregulated gas industry. Argentina has already sold the national airline, telephone network, manufacturing companies, plus part of its electricity industry and railway system. Next year, it will begin privatising YPF, the oil company, valued at Dollars 8bn. The 10 gas units include two transmission companies and eight local distribution companies, the largest valued at over Dollars 1bn and the smallest at under Dollars 50m. Each unit will be awarded to the consortium with the largest offer - in cash or debt instruments - over the minimum cash price. Together, the 10 units' minimum price totals Dollars 680m. The successful bidders will also have to take on Dollars 947m in short and long-term debt and promise to invest at least Dollars 550m in the companies over five years. The government is selling 60 to 90 per cent of each unit, and will later float its shares, averaging about 20 per cent in the companies, on local and international equity markets, while the rest will be held in trust for employees. An independent regulator will oversee the industry and enforce competition between companies.</p>

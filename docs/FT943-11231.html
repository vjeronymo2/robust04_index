			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Longer Sunday pub hours considered The government is considering proposals to allow pubs and bars in England and Wales to open all day on Sunday and to end the restrictions on opening hours for off-licences. The proposals could be announced by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, in a green paper due to be published this autumn. According to Whitehall officials, a draft of the green paper suggests that public houses should no longer have to close on Sundays between 3pm and 7pm. The green paper also proposes that pub closing times on Fridays and Saturdays should be extended by one hour to midnight. Ministers may also introduce a system of dual licensing for publicans and their premises which would simplify the transfer of a public house to a new landlord.</p>

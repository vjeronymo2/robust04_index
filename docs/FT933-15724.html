			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Companies confident on Azeri deal WESTERN OIL companies hoping for contracts from the exploitation of the massive reserves of the Caspian Sea are increasingly confident that the new government of Azerbaijan will be persuaded to retain the same general course as the previous one, and that contracts worth ultimately up to Dollars 12bn should be signed in the autumn. Some oil men in Baku believe that Mr Sabit Bagirov, the head of the state oil company Socar, who had apparently resigned more than a week ago, will remain in his post after all. 'Bagirov has learned a lot about how to deal with the oil companies and he's an honest man,' said Mr Oguz Capan, president of the Attila Dogan corporation of Turkey, the first company to sign a contract for the exploitation of on-shore reserves 100 km south of Baku. 'I think he'll stay.' About 4.5bn barrels of reserves have been proved or estimated in the Azeri part of the Caspian and more is expected. Investment of between Dollars 9bn and Dollars 12bn will go into the field. The oil companies, which include Amoco, BP, Pennzoil and Statoil, had agreed in principle with the populist government of Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, before it was replaced recently by hardliners, to unify their approach to the field However, the new leadership this week reassured senior company officials that it wished to continue co-operation with them.</p>

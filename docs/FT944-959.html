			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): US revival underpins bourse recovery The absence of a US interest rate rise, even with a subsequent fall in the Dow overnight, seemed to lay the foundations of yesterday's bourse recovery, writes Our Markets Staff. In the afternoon, Wall Street's revival took the process further. FRANKFURT looked tentative on the session with a Dax index rise of 6.73 to 2,086.66; but at the end of the afternoon the Ibis-indicated Dax was 15.34 higher at 2,095.50. Turnover eased from DM4.5bn to DM4.4bn. Chemicals led shares upward, Bayer ending the afternoon DM8 higher at DM361.50, and Hoechst rising even faster with a gain of DM8.40 to DM828. There was talk of small fund buying of the sector and, late in the day, of Hoechst's planned price rises for technical fibres. Mr Shaw Bridges, European chemicals specialist at Merrill Lynch in London, said that the industry had seen good increases in physical sales volume, and was now moving into a period of better pricing. Hoechst had experienced disappointing profit margins for a long time; it had also been relatively late in restructuring its operations, with the cost-cutting that this entailed, but analysts now seemed to believe that the process was well under way. PARIS caught the tail of Wall Street's opening rally and the CAC-40 index accelerated 16.17 to 1,940.89. Smith New Court put a buy note out on Valeo, up FFr8.50 at FFr248.50, and made a case for the car components manufacturer's being the target of a takeover bid. It argued that: the company was relatively small; its major shareholder, the holding company, Cerus, remained in bad financial shape and 'would not be in a position to defend Valeo if a raider attacked'; the company would be net cash positive by the end of next year, and by 1996 the cash pile could amount to more than FFr3bn. 'Clearly, the cash could be attractive to a raider,' added the broker. Bollore Technologies, the diversified industrial group, added FFr7.80 to FFr447.00 as it confirmed reports that it was negotiating the sale of 11 ships for around FFr800m. If successful, the sale would cut the group's debt to some FFr4bn. MILAN stood aloof from the drama unfolding in parliament and the market continued to rally for a sixth consecutive day, with the weak lira again providing the catalyst for foreign equity investors. The Comit index rose 11.15 or 1.8 per cent to L624.06 on the view that, one way or another, the government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi was about to fall. The index has bounced by 7.4 per cent from its year's low on December 13. Foreign investors have been attracted by expectations that the government would be replaced by a so-called institutional government, headed by a non-partisan prime minister from outside parliament, which would quickly bring an end to the political uncertainty. Mr John Stewart at InterEuropa in Milan, warned, however that foreign markets were probably over-optimistic about how quickly an institutional government might be formed. He added that domestic investors thought that fresh elections were more likely. Among blue chips, Fiat rose L125 or 2.1 per cent to L5,974 as the company reiterated that it had recorded 'an extraordinary turnaround' in 1994. Stet rose L123 to L4,563 after announcing that consolidated net profit for 1994 would be around L2,000bn, up from L1,530bn last year. ZURICH saw the SMI index 21.4 higher at 2,636.1 in relatively active trading. Roche certificates extended Tuesday's solid gain, closing SFr110 higher at SFr6,300, benefiting from the relatively strong dollar. Among second liners, Ems-Chemie rose SFr100 to SFr3,930 as SBC issued warrants on the share. MADRID's equity market mirrored weakness in the peseta and in domestic bonds, shaken by a further high level arrest in connection with vigilante attacks on the Basque separatist group, Eta. The general index fell another 1.87 to 291.59, threatening the 1994 low of 288.65. Some relief from the gloom came from the planned introduction to the Ibex-35 index of leading stocks, from January 2, of the paper group, Empresa Nacional de Celulosa (Ence), and the fashion retailer, Cortefiel, whose shares rose Pta30 to Pta3,195 and Pta40 to Pta3,995 respectively. But the departing stocks, Aguas de Barcelona and the builder, Huarte, fell by more than the newcomers rose, with drops of Pta75 to Pta2,465 and Pta30 to Pta1,330. AMSTERDAM moved firmly ahead although trading activity remained relatively muted. The AEX index added 2.71 to 413.35, just below its session best. VNU, up Fl 2.70 at Fl 178.80, announced after the close of business that it was acquiring a UK information company, Calyx. Among the multinationals there was a gain of Fl 3.30 in Unilever to Fl 202.20 as investors applauded its recent reorganisation announcement.

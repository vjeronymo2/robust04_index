			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROBBER KILLS MAN AT TELLER MACHINE  </P> <P> A man was shot to death in a struggle with an armed robber moments after he  made a withdrawal from an automatic teller machine at a Northridge savings and  loan, Los Angeles police said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Aflam Hafham, 29, of Canoga Park was fatally shot at 8:45 p.m. Tuesday in the  Coast Savings parking lot at Nordhoff Street and Tampa Avenue, across from the  Northridge Fashion Center shopping mall, said Detective Jack Dillard.  </P> <P> Dillard said Hafham and two friends, whom he would not identify, drove into the  parking lot, and Hafham got out of the car and walked to the automatic teller  machine at the side of the bank building.  </P> <P> After making a withdrawal from the machine, which is under an outdoor light and  in view of Nordhoff, Hafham was stopped as he walked to his car by an armed man  who demanded his money, Dillard said.  </P> <P> Meantime, another man approached Hafham's car, pointed a gun at Hafham's  friends and demanded their wallets, Dillard said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Struggled With Robber  </P> <P> Hafham struggled with the man robbing him and was shot twice in the upper body,  police said. After Hafham was shot, his friends turned over their wallets to  the two gunmen, who fled on foot, police said. The two friends were not  injured.  </P> <P> Hafham was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where he was pronounced  dead.  </P> <P> Police refused to say how much money was taken in the robbery. They said they  did not have clear descriptions of the suspects but were attempting to  determine if other ATM robberies may have been the work of the two gunmen.  </P> <P> "There have been several others, but we don't know if they are related,"  Dillard said.  </P> <P> Police would not say how many ATM robberies have occurred in the area in recent  weeks, but one detective pointed out that the crimes are "very prevalent  nowadays" because customers are easily accessible to robbers.  </P></p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / People: Alexander declares independence from the Big Six July 4, US Independence Day, will see freedom from the shackles of a Big Six accountancy firm for John Alexander, who is joining the corporate recovery department of accountants Pannell Kerr Forster. His move is something of a coup for the smaller firm. Alexander, now a general insolvency partner with KPMG Peat Marwick specialising in liquidation and bankruptcy work, will be a senior partner with Pannell in London. 'This is a tremendous opportunity to spread my wings and develop something,' he says. 'It partly reflects a frustration for many people who feel the institut-ionalisation of being in a larger firm for too long,' he says. 'There is also a feeling (of frustration) when earnings are being heavily diluted by the weaker areas of general accountancy practice,' he adds. He says Pannell needs a 'name' to help bring in business from the banks. 'I am dyed-in-the-wool Big Six,' he says. 'I hope we will be able to provide a Big Six product at significantly lower costs. There is also the greater immediacy of partner involvement.' He says there is no current plan for him to become head of insolvency at the firm, although he says the current head, who is based in Manchester, acknowledges the post should be in London. Alexander joined Thomson McLintock in 1971, joined the insolvency department in 1974, became a partner in 1984 and stayed with the firm after the merger with Peat Marwick in 1987. His past work has included the Levitt Group, Rosehaugh, and trustee in bankruptcy to musician Eric Woolfson, who wrote the musical Freudiana. He said he had been looking around for some time for a new challenge, while Pannell had been trying to find ways to strengthen its insolvency department for about 18 months.</p>

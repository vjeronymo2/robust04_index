			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Arts: The Glory of Gershwin When Larry Adler used to hang out with George Gershwin, the two men were summoned by the vampish French actress Simone Simon to have dinner with her. Both besotted, they failed to understand how their glamorous companion could be so cruel as to make them compete in front of her - until her ulterior motive became clear: 'She just wanted to hear us play together.' Adler, opening a week of concerts celebrating his old friend's music, declined to reveal the extent of his disappointment, but Simon surely got the best deal. There is a strong symbiosis between Gershwin's luscious melodies and the warm, expressive playing of Adler, celebrating his 80th birthday with a truly unlikely excursion into the pop charts with his 'The Glory of Gershwin'. What most of the artists on that compilation found, however, is that the effortless sweep of the music is not as easily achieved as it sounds; very few singers can handle the delicate and always-humorous phrasing demanded by 'S'wonderful' or 'Fascinating Rhythm' while also coping with the much more intense requirements of Porgy and Bess. At the Jazz Cafe, Issy van Randwyck showed complete control of the former art, while her partner Clive Rowe excelled at the latter, particularly in a powerful 'There's a Boat Dat's Leavin' Soon for New York'. When the two got together, as in a joyful 'I Got Rhythm', there was enough energy and theatre to put aside reservations over technique. Adler himself beamed, cajoled and basked his way through the highly enjoyable evening. He saved himself for a rousing Rhapsody in Blue, in which his duet with a 'ghost' of Gershwin at the piano was genuinely affecting. No wonder so many of those dinner dates ended up a trois. Larry Adler: 'The Glory of Gershwin' at the Jazz Cafe until August 20.</p>

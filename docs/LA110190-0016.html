			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S.-CHINA TRADE  </P> <P> China's trade surplus with the U.S. will shoot up to as high as $10 billion  this year, but the Bush Administration continues to grant it the  most-favored-nation status. Even if this is not ridiculous, this will certainly  hold the seed of new friction in Washington-Beijing relations.  </P> <P> It is true the U.S. needs China's help during the Persian Gulf crisis, but the  help should be motivated by the love of peace, not the love of money.  </P> <P> If Saddam Hussein had no Scud and Silkworm missiles, what do people need to  fear of him? Remember: Russia and China were the suppliers of these weapons.  Have Russia and China shown a whit of regret for arming Saddam Hussein? If not,  neither of them are qualified to be most-favored nations of the U.S.  </P> <P> THOMAS C. CHEN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

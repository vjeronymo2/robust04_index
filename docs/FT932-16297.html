			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Millions of dollars and nothing to spend it on - A United Nations fund in crisis ORIGINALLY conceived as a central loans fund for commodity accords with buffer stocks, the United Nations Common Fund for Commodities faces a serious identity crisis. The Amsterdam-based organisation, set up in 1989, is sitting on millions of dollars it cannot use, as, one by one, the few remaining commodity agreements with economic clauses have fallen by the wayside. At the same time, the financing of commodity development projects, the fund's secondary function, has been painfully slow to get off the ground. The 105 members have put up Dollars 140m in cash and promissory notes for its first account which, under the 1980 agreement governing fund operations, can only be used to lend for buffer stock operations. The interest on this money - just over Dollars 7m last year - finances the Dollars 3m-Dollars 4m annual budget of the 25-strong secretariat, with the surplus going into a special reserve. Even before the fund was set up, it was clear that in the foreseeable future it would have little use for the first account. The collapse of the tin accord in the mid-1980s, and a steady downward trend in real commodity prices stoked by oversupply, had already dampened enthusiasm for market intervention to boost prices. In the past few weeks, the latest attempts to renegotiate price stabilisation agreements for coffee and cocoa have failed, and the rubber accord, the only commodity pact that still has an operational buffer stock, looks like going the same way. This situation has led to calls by some fund members for first-account funds to be returned unless a good use can be found for them. Meanwhile, Australia has left the organisation and Canada will follow later this year. (The US, though a signatory, never ratified the Common Fund accord.) Last year the organisation established a working group to advise on future options, in particular on shifting first-account resources to the fund's second account, which finances small-scale research, development, marketing and diversification projects. However, the group's interim report shows that relatively little can be done without a lengthy renegotiation of the 1980 agreement - one reason why it rejected an unofficial proposal by a World Bank staffer to use first-account money for commodity hedging schemes. 'The fund is imprisoned by an agreement drafted over 20 years ago, since when the whole commodities situation has changed,' says a working group member. An executive board meeting last week (March 29-31) proposed that member states that had not yet allocated all their allotted shares in the fund should allocate the remainder to the second account for project loans. But it postponed a decision on using surplus interest on first-account funds for a revolving fund to finance project preparation costs until the need was established. The second account, which has so far received Dollars 73m in voluntary government contributions, is not currently constrained by lack of cash. Since 1989, to the irritation of many members, the fund has approved only 11 projects worth about Dollars 9.3m in total. Officials blame the slow start mainly on the inexperience of international commodity bodies in drawing up suitable project proposals. The fund will shortly publish a project preparation manual showing how it should be done, with an emphasis on projects to help the least developed countries. In the meantime, approvals have risen from just one in 1991 to five in 1992 and perhaps 10-12 this year, including five projects authorised by the executive board at its last meeting. This is all a far cry from the fund's original purpose - but some developing countries have not written it off yet. 'The fund may seem a bit irrelevant at the moment - but with the whole world economic system in turmoil who knows what will be the situation in five years' time?' muses one third world delegate.</p>

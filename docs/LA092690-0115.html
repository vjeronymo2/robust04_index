			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILKEN ACCUSED OF BRIBERY, MORE INSIDER TRADING  </P> <P> Michael Milken's defense lawyers revealed Tuesday that the former junk bond  wizard has been accused by prosecutors of committing many crimes beyond the six  he pleaded guilty to, including previously undisclosed acts of bribing  officials of mutual funds, obstruction of justice and insider trading.  </P> <P> The government allegations evidently were contained in a 200-page  pre-sentencing memorandum supplied to U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood in New  York. An edited version of that document had been scheduled to be made public  Tuesday but was withheld at least until today because the judge was still  reviewing it.  </P> <P> However, Milken's lawyers released edited versions of their own pre-sentencing  memorandum, as well as a detailed rebuttal of the still-confidential government  document. These defense documents contain the first official details of the  alleged additional crimes.  </P> <P> Milken, 44, former head of the Beverly Hills-based junk bond department of  Drexel Burnham Lambert, is due to be sentenced Monday on the charges of  conspiracy, securities fraud and mail fraud he pleaded guilty to in April. He  faces a maximum of 28 years in prison.  </P> <P> Under his plea agreement, Milken cannot be prosecuted for any of the additional  crimes the government now says he committed. Prosecutors, however, presented  the judge with the new allegations in the hope that she will take them into  account in deciding Milken's sentence.  </P> <P> The prosecution document evidently includes new allegations that Milken and his  associates obstructed justice by deliberately destroying documents and planning  a cover-up in 1986, immediately after they became aware that former stock  speculator Ivan F. Boesky had agreed to plead guilty to an insider  trading-related offense and was cooperating with prosecutors.  </P> <P> Arthur L. Liman, Milken's lead defense lawyer, asserted in the defense  documents that these charges are false.  </P> <P> Liman also denied government allegations that Milken in effect bribed managers  of mutual funds to buy securities of dubious value from Drexel for their funds,  by allowing the managers to invest personally in highly lucrative deals. The  government apparently asserted that such investment opportunities included  participation in the acquisition of Storer Communications in December, 1985, by  the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.  </P> <P> The new allegations that seemed to draw the greatest indignation from the  Milken camp, however, were the insider trading allegations, including at least  one instance in which Milken allegedly profited personally.  </P> <P> Milken resigned from Drexel in June, 1989, and the once powerful investment  bank collapsed into bankruptcy proceedings in February, 1990.  </P> <P> Liman asked in his court papers that the judge ignore the new allegations. He  said it is not the court's role "to resolve scores of contested claims" that  were dropped when Milken agreed to plead guilty to six counts. Although the  indictment included some insider trading charges, it did not include  allegations of obstruction of justice or bribing mutual fund officials. Liman  provided a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal of the new government allegations.  </P> <P> And he asserted that the government document seemed intended to appeal unfairly  to the public and pressure the court. "The document's factual presentations are  grossly distorted," Liman stated.  </P> <P> The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan has said it will not comment at least  until its memorandum is released.  </P> <P> The defense memo says Milken's crimes were aberrations in an otherwise  exemplary life. Liman wrote: "Although inexcusable, Michael's offenses . . .  were neither venal nor motivated by greed. He did not personally profit by  them."  </P> <P> Milken's lawyers asked that he be sentenced only to probation and a community  service project that would be supervised by the Los Angeles Police Department.  Milken already has agreed to pay $600 million in penalties.  </P> <P> In a letter to Wood, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, has recommended  that because of Milken's unusual talents society would best be served if he was  allowed to run a program to benefit inner-city children.  </P> <P> However, the defense said the government has asked the judge to impose a  substantial prison sentence, possibly a provisional sentence that could be  reduced later if Milken cooperates fully with the government. Milken has agreed  to do so after his sentencing.  </P> <P> On the prosecution allegations of insider trading, the defense documents reveal  that prosecutors have asserted that Milken personally profited in 1983 from  advance knowledge that Caesar's World Inc. was about to carry out a major  recapitalization. The government evidently has maintained that Milken's  profit-sharing retirement account acquired $3 million of Caesar's World bonds  based on knowledge that their value was about to soar.  </P> <P> Milken has long contended that his transgressions never included anything as  serious as insider trading. And his lawyers took pains last spring to point out  that the charges Milken pleaded guilty to do not include insider trading.  </P> <P> Some of the other insider trading allegations in the government's memo were  previously disclosed in the indictment of Milken that was withdrawn when he  agreed to plead guilty. These include trading in the securities of  entertainment companies Viacom Inc. and Lorimar. Others apparently had not been  disclosed previously, including trades in securities of Republic Airlines and  in dealings with Boesky.  </P> <P> In page after page of their own documents, the defense lawyers rebut the  charges, providing detailed explanations of why the trading was not based on  inside knowledge. They say the government's own witnesses have testified before  a grand jury that the trading was entirely normal and proper.  </P> <P> And Liman charged that the government's documents "omitted almost all evidence  exculpatory or favorable to Mr. Milken, including objective facts and even  specific testimony by the government's own cooperators . . . . "  </P> <P> It is by no means clear yet whether the judge will take any of the new  government allegations into account when she imposes sentence. Prosecutors have  asked the judge to hold hearings on the additional allegations to determine if  there is sufficient evidence to back them up. If the judge decides to do that,  it could delay sentencing for months. Milken's lawyers oppose such a move,  however. The judge is expected to rule on the issue before Monday.  </P> <P> In a similar case, involving Robert M. Freeman, a former stock speculator at  the investment banking firm Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. who pleaded guilty to a  single insider trading-related count, a judge refused to hold such hearings and  said he ignored prosecutors' allegations of additional crimes.  </P></p>

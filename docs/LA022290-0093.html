			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: TEMPLE CITY;  </P> <P> REINFORCEMENT EXTENSIONS  </P> <P> Property owners who face deadlines for reinforcing masonry buildings to make  them meet earthquake safety standards may appeal to the city for extensions,  the City Council decided Tuesday.  </P> <P> To help owners with the cost of adding reinforcements, the city also will  explore ways of offering financial help, such as low-interest loans.  </P> <P> Councilman Tom Breazeal, who dissented in the 4-1 vote, said appeals would be  approved arbitrarily unless guidelines are set. He said extensions should be  granted only if the property has been vacant, if major changes have been made  or if there has been damage.  </P></p>

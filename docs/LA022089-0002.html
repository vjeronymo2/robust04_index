			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A new Sri Lankan group calling itself the "Black Cats" executed 20 Sinhalese in  the first major violence since election results were announced last week,  military officials said. The victims were members of the People's Liberation  Front, an ultranationalist Sinhalese militant group that opposes the  Sinhalese-dominated government's attempts to grant limited autonomy to minority  Tamils. At least 1,000 people, including 14 candidates for the legislature,  were killed during the five-week election campaign that ended Wednesday. Most  of the deaths were blamed on the People's Liberation Front.  </P></p>

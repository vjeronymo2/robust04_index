			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Commenting on the 21 January remarks by a North  Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman carried by the North Korean  Central News Agency, ROK Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun has said  that "it is not time to express our clear-cut position on North  Korea's attitude." He also said: "The statement by a Foreign  Ministry spokesman was intended, in part, to make the  negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] difficult and, in another part, to pacify  people at home."    He also said: "Given North Korea's attitude toward  negotiations with the United States, the statement must have  been intended for domestic consumption." He added that the  "government will closely monitor the negotiations between North  Korea and the IAEA."</p>

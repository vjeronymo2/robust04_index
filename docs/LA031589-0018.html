			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SEVERAL S.D. COUNTY SCHOOLS PULL APPLES FROM STUDENT MENUS  </P> <P> Several San Diego County elementary-school districts and one unified school  district have stopped serving apples to their students after a recent report  that a chemical sometimes applied to the fruit to delay ripening can cause  cancer, authorities said Tuesday.  </P> <P> South Bay Union Elementary, Bonsall Union Elementary, Cajon Valley Union  Elementary, Dehesa Elementary and Encinitas Union Elementary school districts  all said they would take apples, apple sauce and apple juice off their school  lunch menus until they receive assurances from suppliers or government agencies  that the apples are safe to eat.  </P> <P> "We are maintaining (apple juice) in storage. We are not serving it and we're  not buying any more," said David H. West, superintendent of the Borrego Springs  Unified School District, which has also put a hold on the fruit. "There seems  to be some question about it, and we'll let somebody who knows more about it  than we do give us some advice first."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fruit Pulled Elsewhere  </P> <P> Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second-largest, and the San  Francisco Unified School District stopped selling and serving apples last week.  </P> <P> In San Diego, school officials stressed they were not banning the fruit, but  were taking precautions until further information is available. Others said  they had not been told by the U. S. Department of Agriculture, which runs a  commodity program providing many schools with fruit, to take the fruit off the  menus.  </P> <P> Some officials said the public overreacted to last  </P> <P> month's report by the nonprofit, Washington-based Natural Resources Defense  Council.  </P> <P> "We have secured documentation from our produce company . . . that all their  apples come from orchards that do not use Alar," a brand name for the chemical  daminozide used to control ripening, said Jane Boehrer, food services director  for the San Diego Unified School District.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Farm Bureau of San Diego County said Alar is used on 5%  of the apple crop in the country, and that those apples are designated for  export.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fear About Public Alarm  </P> <P> "I understand the concern for food safety, and that the schools have a  responsibility to get all the information they need for an educated decision .  . . but we hope that this kind of action doesn't alarm the public into thinking  fresh fruits and vegetables are not safe for consumption," said Farm Bureau  spokeswoman Wendy Benz.  </P> <P> Mary Beth Lang, a spokeswoman for the Washington state Department of Food and  Agriculture, said that, "of 100 fresh apple samples that our department pulled  from different Washington state growers, only seven showed any traces of Alar.  The highest level we found was 1.4 parts per million, and the (Environmental  Protection Agency) allows 20 parts per million."  </P> <P> Washington state produces 40% of the nation's apples, Lang said.  </P> <P> At Cajon Valley Union Elementary school district, Linda Patzold, director of  child nutrition, said the commercial distributor who sells apples to the  district had assured her that the growers they buy the fruit from do not use  Alar. Nevertheless, she said she will await further testing results from the  EPA, the state Department of Health Services and other government agencies.  </P></p>

But some found they had been fired because  of a spate of attacks on Jews to avenge the police killing of 20 Arabs on  Jerusalem's Temple Mount. Eight Arabs were wounded by army gunfire during  clashes in the West Bank village of Dura, near Hebron, as the army allowed  Palestinians back into Israel, Arab sources said.  </P></p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Risk and Reward: Recovery hopes spur launch of new derivatives WILL 1993 be the year when the UK economy finally picks itself up off the floor? That question helped to stimulate the launch of two new equity derivative products last week. The early signs suggest, though, that it will take time for these products to make themselves as familiar a part of the investment landscape as, say, the futures contract on the FT-SE 100 index. Last week's instruments, from Smith New Court and Warburg Securities, are based on the FT-SE Mid 250 index, which comprises the tier of companies just below the top 100. These companies will outperform larger ones as the economy recovers, the theory runs: they derive a far higher proportion of their profits from the UK. Sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism, and the belief that the lower interest rates that followed would rekindle economic growth in the UK, has brought outperformance from Mid 250 stocks. On October 12 last year, when it was launched, the new index stood at 2,403.0, 155.9 points below the FT-SE 100. By the end of last week it had risen to above 2,900, 133 points up on the index of larger companies. The big question for the derivatives providers, though, is how many investors are actively following the Mid 250. Any which have reorganised their investments to match the indices would find index-based derivatives a natural way to make rapid changes to their asset allocations, without needing to buy or sell the less-liquid second-tier stocks. Early institutional reaction seems positive, though it is difficult to find institutions that plan to trade Mid 250 futures. Will Smith's contract eventually be superseded by a similar product on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange? The idea is at the top of Liffe's agenda, though there are no immediate plans to create a new contract. Together with the London Stock Exchange, Liffe is examining the use of the Mid 250 among investors to assess likely demand, an exercise that seems likely to continue for some time. Even if the Mid 250 is taken up, it could be unsuited to an exchange-traded future. Few securities houses trade enough stocks in the index to allow them to trade between the futures and cash markets. Smith reckons it is the only one to trade all 250, though Warburg's 244 stocks give it a close enough replication of the index. Also, locals are unlikely to be attracted to the contract unless they think it will generate enough liquidity to allow them to trade in and out with ease. It could therefore prove difficult to build enough liquidity to make the contract a success. Warburg, meanwhile, last week produced an exchange-traded derivative based on the Mid 250 in an attempt to appeal to those investors prevented by their trust deeds from dealing in off-exchange instruments. The spate of innovation in UK equity derivatives has not been limited to the Mid 250. Smith also launched futures on five sector indices last week, including banks, oils and water companies. OTC derivatives based on particular sectors have been used in the past, though only as one-off exercises. Salomon, for instance, successfully promoted a series of call warrants based on water stocks ahead of the UK general election last year, playing on the politically sensitive nature of the stocks. In the end, water companies outperformed the FT-A All-Share index by 33 per cent last year.</p>

The measures include an exhaustive review of the baggage of  all the travelers entering the city by land or air. The  municipality will also establish an emergency telephone service  to protect citizens in case of attacks.    "It is not a matter of militarizing the metropolis or  frightening the citizens. These are only measures to prevent  attacks such as those that have taken place in neighboring  cities," Regent (Mayor) Manuel Aguilera Gomez stated.    He warned that officials who check baggage will not be  allowed to violate the people's right to free movement "because  we cannot allow individual guarantees to be trampled upon due to  a transitory situation."    In addition, police surveillance will be reinforced at  schools, places of public assembly and recreation, public  transportation centers, sewage an potable water treatment  plants, and electricity plants    The mayor commented that approximately 20 bomb threats had  been received at several government offices, private firms, and  newspaper offices between Friday and Saturday, all of which  turned out to be false alarms.    EL NACIONAL has reported that the Judicial Police took 90  Chiapas residents into custody for questioning. The people  arrived in Mexico City on Sunday, supposedly under contract by a  firm. The police released them 16 hours later.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson Yesterday's Pounds 500m eurobond from Hanson is a reminder that the government is not alone in seeking to tap overseas demand for fixed rate sterling paper. Together with the Pounds 650m of similar issues launched by other British companies since the election, it suggests an accelerating switch away from bank debt and into stable long-term bond finance. The trend already carries significance for the broader economy. It involves amounts large enough to distort the figures for bank lending to the private sector. Add back bond finance, and credit demand appears less anaemic than the M4 data suggest. The more immediate problem for finance directors, however, remains that of deciding when fixed rates have fallen far enough to make refinancing worthwhile. The size of the Hanson issue suggests certainty: the fact that it is over only five years suggests the reverse. The situation may be complicated by the absence of a long-term credit rating from either Moody's or Standard &amp; Poor's, but Hanson could reasonably have expected to obtain a longer maturity on a smaller issue. That would have left more room for additional refinancing at even lower rates if, as investors believe, yields are set to drop in the coming months. Perhaps the company still feels it has plenty of scope, given its almost Pounds 4bn in medium-term bank borrowing. However, yesterday's issue locks it for five years into a borrowing cost of over 10 per cent. It is hard to see the point of going all out for quantity on those terms, apart from the satisfaction of producing the largest fixed-rate corporate eurobond on record.</p>

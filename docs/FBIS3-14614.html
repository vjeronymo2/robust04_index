			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Gulf Support for </F> Egyptian-Syrian Mediation in Yemen"]    [Text] Damascus -- Political sources have revealed to  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Syria and Egypt intend to play an  important part in resolving the Yemeni crisis. They said that  the foreign ministers of Syria, Egypt, and Yemen, who are now in  Cairo to attend the Arab League Council's meeting, will, after  the Arab League meetings, hold talks to redefine the framework  for future action. Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih held a closed meeting in Damascus  last Thursday. They discussed Yemeni developments and ways of  ending the disputes and restoring stability to the state of  unity. It was not known what agreement was reached by the two  presidents and there was no indication of their future plans.    Yemeni sources, however, have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that,  during his visit to Damascus, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  tried to "break the ice" between him and Syria and to regain  Syria's trust after the position he took during the Gulf war.  His closed meeting with President al-Asad lasted one and a half  hours. The talks were frank and in depth.    Yemeni opposition sources said that President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih realized the terrible mistake he made when supporting  Saddam Husayn during the invasion and the Gulf war, and he has  been trying to restore confidence and understanding with the  states which supported Kuwait. They added that none of the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] members attended the Syrian-Yemeni  meetings despite the official announcement -- according to the  list sent from Yemen -- that YSP Political Bureau Member and  Fish Resources Minister Fadl Muhsin would be a member of the  Yemeni delegation. The sources said that the Syrian move  coincided with a similar Egyptian move on Yemen, with Gulf  support based on confidence in these two states and the fact  that neither has any ambitions in Yemen. President Hafiz al-Asad  might invite President Salih, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid,  and other leaders to Damascus for a dialogue to end the crisis.  Al-Bid had himself expressed support for such a move. Syria  and Egypt are expected to uphold the Pledge and Accord Document  and act as a third-party witness to that.    Diplomatic sources believe that Syria and Egypt might, with  Arab League approval, send military forces to Yemen in the event  of a threat of a military explosion and partition there. They  add that the Yemeni parties would be well advised to take this  matter into consideration and show commitment to stability in  Yemen. They sources also say that President al-Asad has so far  been focusing on restoring trust between the Yemeni parties and  finding common grounds for understanding among them on the way  to ending the crisis.</p>

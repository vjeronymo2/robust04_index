			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Germany, Japan under pressure over economies: US calls for worldwide action to end recession THE US yesterday renewed its pressure on Japan and Germany to boost their economies as a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said unemployment in the industrial world was reaching 'alarming' levels. Warning that 'the world cannot depend on growth in the United States to pull it out of recession', Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, urged Japan to increase its fiscal stimulus. He also called for 'further substantial reductions' of European interest rates to promote faster growth. This thinly veiled call on the Bundesbank to reduce its interest rates was backed by the European Commission. Mr Henning Christophersen, commissioner for economic affairs, said it was important to have further reductions in short and long term European rates: 'Something has been done, but it is not enough.' Speaking on the first day of the OECD's annual ministerial meeting in Paris, Mr Christophersen said the level of real interest rates was 'still very high' in Europe. But the problem was not just confined to Germany. All European Community states could do more, he said. However, there was little sign that either Germany or Japan would take note of these demands. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, made no mention of interest rates in his speech. Instead, he painted a slightly more optimistic picture of economic trends than the OECD, claiming that Germany's economy would contract this year by 1 per cent compared with the OECD's latest forecast of a 1.9 per cent decline. In Bonn, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, firmly rejected calls for swifter and more drastic cuts in German interest rates, but also left the way open for further gradual reductions. Addressing a bankers' conference on the eve of the Bundesbank's council meeting to decide its rate policy, Mr Schlesinger said calls for 'further, faster, helter-skelter interest rate cuts' to revive Germany's economy 'do not tally with our view'. 'At the same time, the current level of interest rates on the money market is no dogma for us; we must continually explore what is possible, what would do the economy good, without arousing inflationary tendencies or expectations by adopting too steep a path.' Mr Hajime Funada, Japan's economic planning minister, reassured the OECD meeting that recovery in Japan was starting. The Japanese government believed it should be given time to implement its fiscal expansion packages before embarking on further measures. Mr Funada also rejected a US call for setting targets to reduce Japan's large current account surplus. Mr Christophersen gave a bleak assessment of Europe's ability to stop the rise in unemployment in the EC and European Free Trade Area countries towards 23m by the end of next year. He said the EC economy would contract this year and achieve only very modest growth in 1994. But Europe needed growth of between 3 per cent and 3.5 per cent to halt the rise in unemployment and this could not be achieved before 1995.

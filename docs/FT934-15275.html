			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Greater powers are in prospect for the European Parliament THE German ruling on the Maastricht treaty clears the way for small, but potentially significant changes in how the European Community does business, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. Treaty ratification will increase the powers of the European Parliament, and deepen co-operation between governments on drugs, immigration and crime. It also lays the groundwork for greater co-operation on foreign policy, and provides for a move to a single currency by 1999 at the latest. Some of these changes look incremental; others such as the move to European economic and monetary union look problematic. But, as one long-serving EC diplomat in Brussels said: 'The powers are there in the treaty. It depends on whether the politicians are prepared to use them.' The obvious winner among EC institutions is the parliament. Under Article 189b, it gains the right of 'co-decision' on legislation, to be shared with the council of ministers. This does not extend to core issues such as foreign policy and judicial co-operation, rather to mundane matters such as the internal market. A senior EC official predicts that the legislative struggle between EC ministers and parliament will resemble bargaining between House and Senate in the US, with the European Commission playing the broker. The parliament will exert greater scrutiny over the Commission, starting from January 1, 1995. On this date, both bodies will begin five-year terms. Other important changes include: More qualified majority voting in social policy legislation. Britain has a treaty opt-out, but remains involved in discussions. The right of EC citizens to vote or stand as a candidate in local and European parliament elections. Accelerated devolution of power to national and local levels under the principle of 'subsidiarity'. Establishment of 'joint actions' in foreign and security policy. This does not mean the EC will be sending combat troops to ex-Yugoslavia, but should lead to less reactive diplomacy. Creation of a committee of the regions. Only four states have so far put forward a list of members, and some senior EC officials worry about bureaucratic confusion over its role. Lastly, the EC will be known in future as the European Union, but not apparently in all its future guises. Top lawyers in Brussels are studying variations. The safe bet is that the British, who remain worried about federal connotations, will stick to the 'Community' - or even better, the 'Common Market'.</p>

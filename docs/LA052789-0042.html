			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILL NEVER RUN AGAIN, MONDALE SAYS  </P> <P> Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale said Friday that he will not enter the  1990 race for a U.S. Senate seat in Minnesota and will not seek elective office  in the future.  </P> <P> "I believe it's time for other candidates to step forward," said Mondale, a  former senator who was the Democratic Party's presidential nominee in 1984. "It  was a very difficult choice for us."  </P> <P> Mondale, 61, said he has enjoyed his life out of political office and has seen  too many colleagues stay in the Senate for too long. He was considering running  against two-term incumbent Rudy Boschwitz, a Republican.  </P> <P> "I'm at peace with myself," Mondale said. "We took a lot of time making this  decision, and it's a basic one. It's a lot easier deciding when to get into  politics as opposed to when to leave."  </P> <P> Mondale said he had decided two days ago, after seeking advice from numerous  friends and associates, to end his political career.  </P></p>

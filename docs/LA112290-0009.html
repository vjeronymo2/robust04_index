			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT PRICE GULF FREEDOM?;  </P> <P> OIL-STATE ALLIES SHOULD PAY DEPLOYMENT COSTS  </P> <P> Hat in one hand and begging bowl in the other, the United States is again about  to begin knocking on doors to solicit international financial support for its  operations in the Persian Gulf. Like last September's initial fund-raising  drive, this exercise in cajolery and supplication seems likely to prove an  embarrassing and even a humiliating experience. That the undertaking is also --  or should be -- wholly unnecessary is self-evident.  </P> <P> There's no question about which countries ought to bear the heaviest economic  costs for the effort to contain Saddam Hussein's aggressive ambitions: Those  that benefit most are most properly responsible for footing the bill. That  means Saudi Arabia and the now exiled government of Kuwait above all others. To  a lesser extent it means the smaller oil-producing gulf states whose freedom of  action and even political independence are imperiled if Iraq's hegemonic aims  aren't checked. And it means Japan and other countries that rely so heavily on  imported oil.  </P> <P> Every country, of course, gains when aggression is thwarted because every  country is better off in a safer and more decent world. That is the political  and moral principle underlying the military intervention by the United States  and other countries. But the question of control of oil resources and the  fixing of future oil prices -- a question vital to the world's economic  security and development -- also looms large in the rationale for intervention.  Keeping the vast oil deposits of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia out of Iraq's hands is  another key reason for intervention.  </P> <P> Because the United States intervened there's a good chance that the ruling  royal government of Kuwait can in time get its country back, and the ruling  royal family of Saudi Arabia can keep its country from being lost. Rescuing  countries for the families that effectively own them is no small thing. It  deserves much more than a reluctant or ungenerous response.  </P> <P> Kuwait and Saudi Arabia can easily afford to pay for their own protection. At  last estimate Kuwait's rulers had about $100 billion invested overseas, safely  out of Iraq's reach. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has profited hugely from the rise  in world oil prices -- about $10 a barrel -- that followed the Aug. 2 invasion  of Kuwait. To make up for embargoed Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, Saudi Arabia has  boosted its own production to 8.5 million barrels a day, as Western countries  requested. But that turns out to be worth about $22 billion a year just in  windfall profits for the Saudis, plus another unexpected $85 million a day or  so from higher production.  </P> <P> Washington shouldn't hesitate to bluntly insist that the gulf's oil-producing  states pay most of the deployment costs the United States faces in the coming  year. It is their territory, their resources and the lives of their rulers and  people that the intervention aims to protect. What's owed, in short, is a debt  of honor that ought to be quickly and voluntarily paid so that the United  States can be spared the uncomfortable and even absurd task of asking rich  governments to meet their obligations.  </P></p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Axa slips 28% to FFr2.4bn but increases dividend AXA, France's second largest insurance company which last summer emerged as a significant shareholder in The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the US, saw its net profits fall in 1991 by 28 per cent to FFr2.4bn (Dollars 426.2m) from FFr3.35bn in 1990. The group, chaired by Mr Claude Bebear, attributed the reduction in profits to lower capital gains on sales of investments by the Axa holding company. In spite of the decline in profits the board proposed a slight increase in the dividend to FFr22 for the year to end-December, from FFr21. Axa is among the first of the big French insurance groups to announce its 1991 figures. Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the state-controlled company which is the largest player in the French insurance market, will report today, followed on Monday by Groupes des Assurances Nationales (GAN), another state-controlled company. The announcement of the fall in Axa's profits comes at a sensitive time for the French insurance sector, which is preparing for the proposed partial privatisation of the state-controlled groups - including UAP and GAN - probably later this year. Axa was affected in 1991 not only by the fall in capital gains - which helped to cut the contribution from the holding company from FFr1.8bn to FFr1.1bn - but also from the poor performances of its property leasing businesses and Compagnie Financiere Paribas. Property leasing was hit by the general slowdown in the real estate market. Paribas, one of France's most prestigious banking groups, recently reported its first ever loss - of FFr184m - after being forced in 1991 to make hefty provisions of FFr2.8bn. Axa mustered a modest increase in insurance profits from FFr1.21bn to FFr1.35bn, chiefly due to a strong performance from its reinsurance activities which swung from a loss of FFr70m into a profit of FFr152m.</p>

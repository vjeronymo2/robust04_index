			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Imperial Tobacco lifts Imasco IMASCO, the financial services, tobacco products and retailing group in which BAT of the UK is the major shareholder, posted a 5 per cent gain in first-quarter profit to CDollars 66.5m (USDollars 52.7m), or 50 cents a share, although revenues eased 3 per cent to CDollars 2.3bn. The biggest contribution came from Imperial Tobacco, with operating earnings up 7 per cent to CDollars 99m from a year earlier. But tobacco products revenues were off because of lower domestic cigarette sales. Canada Trust, the financial services arm, recorded operating profit of CDollars 59.2m, down 30 per cent because of the slack economy and the weak property market. Drug store retailing made an operating profit of CDollars 19.1m, up 2 per cent. Dofasco, Canada's biggest steel maker, lost CDollars 12.5m, or 24 cents a share, in the first quarter, against a loss of CDollars 17.6m, or 31 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 520m, compared with CDollars 461m, with a 14 per cent gain in shipments to 852,000 tonnes. However, Prices continued to be weak but Dofasco said they had strengthened in April on sheet and galvanised products.</p>

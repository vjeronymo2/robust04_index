			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 13 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia  Friday reiterated its call for tougher action by the United  Nations to protect its peacekeeping personnel following death of  a Malaysian UN military observer in a Serb attack in  Bosnia-Herzegovina on Thursday.    Defence Minister Najib Tun Razak said: We have repeatedly  requested the UN to take more firm measures in the Bosnian issue  not only because of the increasing number of fatal casualties  among UN peacekeepers but also because of the deaths of hundreds  of thousands of Bosnians.    Bosnia is a dangerous and chaotic place and incidents can  happen anywhere at any time and our personnel are always at risk.    He was speaking at a press conference where he gave details  of the death of Mejar [Major] Ariffin Zakaria, 33, who was  killed by Serb mortar fire while on duty Thursday.    Najib said stronger action by the UN was needed because the  situation could deteriorate further in the future.</p>

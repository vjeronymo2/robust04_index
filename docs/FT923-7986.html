			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Arts: She Stoops to Conquer GUNS were not only banging away on the grouse moors on the Glorious Twelfth. Chichester's exuberant new staging of She Stoops to Conquer, which opened that evening, has shooting, birds falling dead from above, birds exploding in clouds of feathers, a splendidly docile dog and an equally docile ferret. It also has a marvellously robust play, ideal for Chichester, whose audience responded with wave upon wave of laughter and rounds of applause after several strong exit lines. There are many reasons why Goldsmith's 1771 comedy is so strong, but, if there is one that makes it a classic, it is the character of the younger Charles Marlow. Relaxed with working-class women to the point of debauchery but terrified of the refined women of his own class, he still epitomises the inhibitions of a certain type of Englishman. He is too shy even to look at Kate Hardcastle, the girl his father intends him to marry; but when she fools him into thinking she is a serving-wench, he looks, pursues and is conquered. Add to that Goldsmith's vigour of language, an array of vivid characters, and the ingenious farce ingredient whereby Marlow thinks he is staying, not with his prospective in-laws but in an inn (and treats Mr Hardcastle like the innkeeper in scene after scene) and you have a perfect comedy. It takes well to the difficult Chichester stage. David Walker's designs bring each of the many changes of scene prettily to life, and Peter Wood's direction injects everything with gusto and panache. Wood has assembled from his richly talented cast performances that are excellent within a charm-school, flash-eyes-and-teeth kind of way. Energy is high, diction and projection first-rate. Denis Quilley is a warm hail-fellow-well-met Hardcastle, slightly too suave; Jean Boht a game, silly, bossy and amiable Mrs Hardcastle who (despite a wandering accent) underplays the character's delicious social affectations. As their niece Constance, Leonie Mellinger gives the most captivating, and objective, playing in the cast. Iain Glen has everything to be an ideal Marlow - with the looks, voice, and manner (though he bows poorly) of a half-repressed rake. He even emphasises, interestingly, the note of disdain in the role. But, like most of the cast, he is always projecting his own awareness of what a charming comic character he is presenting. His way of raising his brows and batting his eyelids at the audience in mock-innocence could not be prettier. Likewise, the bright smiles of the nasal Tom Hollander, as his pal Hastings, are winning in a predictable, Georgette Heyer, manner. As Kate Hardcastle, Susannah Harker has Burne-Jones beauty, doe-like eyes and appealing animation. She is not, however, witty - her remark 'he is good enough, for a man' tumbles by the wayside - and her voice is never as individual as her cheekbones and profile lead you to hope. The bright-eyed Jonathon Morris is too cute and smart to convince for a moment as her half-brother Tony Lumpkin. But, like the rest of the cast, he is a natural stage animal. An excess of stage business during several scenes sometimes suggests that Wood does not always trust his play or players to keep the audience amused; but he is wrong. One brilliant scene follows another, and you are taken unawares by the lines. How about this one: 'I vow, since inoculating began, there's no such thing as a plain woman.' Goldsmith rules.

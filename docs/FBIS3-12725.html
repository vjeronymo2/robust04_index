The United States also thinks  that Israel must disarm the settlers and supply them with light  weapons for self-defense only.    These issues were scheduled to be raised in the preparatory  talks of Nabil Sha'th with Dennis Ross, U.S. peace talks  coordinator, and Martin Indyk, a member of the National Security  Council, before Sha'th's meeting with U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher this afternoon.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / World Trade News: Russia-Turkey debt talks fail TURKISH and Russian trade officials have failed to agree terms on settling an outstanding debt owed by the former Soviet Union, throwing into jeopardy a multi-million-dollar gas agreement, John Murray Brown writes from Ankara. In talks in Ankara last week, the sides were unable to agree the repayment of an estimated Dollars 350m (Pounds 200m). This amount represents credits extended by Turkey's Eximbank to support Turkish companies in the former Soviet Union, on the back of a 25-year gas protocol signed in 1984. Russia argues that some of the credit lines were extended for contracts with the other republics. Today it is unclear who assumes these obligations.</p>

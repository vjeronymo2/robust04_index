			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Tories who want a five-year-plan: Dominic Lawson unearths a strange phenomenon; loyal Conservatives who oppose the free market 'I THINK . . . ' said the caller to the Radio Programme Call Nick Ross, rather optimistically. 'I think,' the voice eventually continued,' that we need a centrally planned economy.' 'Aha]' said Ross, on the ball as ever, 'I take it you are a Labour Party supporter'. 'Certainly not,' replied the caller, indignantly, 'I'm a Conservative voter.' Later in the programme, which, naturally, had chosen the pit closure programme as its topic of the week, a fully-fledged member of the Conservative Party called in. It was another woman who thinks. This one thought it was a disgrace that we were importing 'cheap coal from foreign countries like Columbia' instead of using more expensive British coal. 'But that is the way markets work' replied Ross, a paragon of patience. 'You are in favour of free markets, aren't you?' 'Not if it means importing cheap foreign coal,' the Conservative Party member shot back. One begins to see in what way the Conservative Government has lost touch with its supporters. It has failed to recognise that its own people are socialists under the skin. And who can blame John Major or Michael Heseltine for such a monumental miscalculation? Certainly not I, who can still see the brown stain on the carpet where I spluttered the contents of a cup of tea while listening to Nick Ross's interlocutors. But, as Samuel Brittan pointed out in an outstanding article in Thursday's Financial Times, it is not just confused Conservative countrywomen who are suddenly seeking some sort of state-rigged plan of national salvation. 'Most dispiriting of all,' he wrote, 'judging by the FT letters column, is the number of businessmen who expect economic leadership from Government, as if the UK were a single concern managed by a Whitehall Gosplan. When will they take a lesson from their Italian counterparts and look for salvation at their own hands?' It is particularly astonishing that the problems of the coal mining industry should have led businessmen and Conservative MPs (frequently the same thing) to call for a National Strategy For Energy. It is precisely such a strategy which has got the coal industry into such a terminal mess. The strategy was that at least 20 per cent of Britain's generating capacity should be nuclear, never mind the price. And whereas the loss making coal mines on Heseltine's incredible disappearing hit list are said by the President of the Board of Trade (based on some very fishy mathematics) to be costing Pounds 100m pounds a year, the nuclear electricity generating industry cost Britain's taxpayers almost Pounds 1.3bn pounds last year. Without 'A National Energy Strategy' this would never have happened, and most likely there would have been more miners and fewer nuclear engineers in employment. But now industrial five year plans - what Samuel Brittan calls the 'snake cures for depression' - are back in fashion. The Independent newspaper, purveyor of snake oil cures to the gentry, has come up with a 'a ten point plan for national recovery'. (Why is it always ten? Perhaps we need only nine points. Or maybe we could do with 11.) Naturally the Independent says that the Government must (point number two): 'push ahead with major road and rail projects' and (point number three) 'revive the housing market'. The costs of these measures are not specified, although it seems likely that the Government will find it very difficult to fund through the markets even its existing expenditure plans, involving the borrowing next year of Pounds 45bn pounds. No, Mr Brittan is right, our businesses must look to themselves for economic salvation and success. Here is my three point plan. One: shopkeepers to offer better service, and to encourage their assistants to match Continental standards of helpfulness and interest. Two: all businesses to ensure that their company's telephones are answered promptly and efficiently, and above all, abandon the practice of funnelling canned music down the ears of would-be customers. Three: all businesses to ask their customers 'is there any way in which our product or our service could be improved' rather than wait to be told that they have lost the contract. I have a feeling that this strategy, if applied, could stimulate the economy without adding to the burden of the national debt. At the very least it should diminish the national gloom. Perhaps I should suggest it to Nick Ross. Dominic Lawson is Editor of The Spectator.</p>

			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Package holiday companies cut prices Thomson, Owners Abroad and Airtours - are cutting the costs of summer holidays next year in an attempt to stimulate sales in the recession-hit market, Philip Rawstorne writes. Thomson, the largest operator, is reducing the prices of more than 1m holidays by Pounds 50m across a range of European and US resorts. Bookings for summer 1993 are 10 per cent down at present and there is no sign of the recession ending, according to the company. Savings of up to Pounds 400 for a family of four are available in the company's latest brochures, with guarantees of no surcharges. Owners Abroad has made substantial reductions in its Enterprise, Falcon, Martyn and Sunmed breaks. Enterprise holidays begin at Pounds 89 and there are thousands of free child places. A family of four can save up to Pounds 426. Falcon's Florida programme has free child offers for the first time, and there are savings of up to Pounds 105 a person in Martyn's Greece and Cyprus programmes.</p>

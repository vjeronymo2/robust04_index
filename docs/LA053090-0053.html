			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTDOORS;  </P> <P> STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS;  </P> <P> L.A. RIVER COULD BECOME VITAL SOURCE OF RECREATION, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SAY  </P> <P> As the setting sun sprays streamers of gold on the water, Red Cross boating  instructor Denis Schure slides his 15-foot canoe into a Class 1 stream.  Barreling downriver, Schure sees a mallard beat its wings before flying noisily  out of a willow thicket. Overcome by the scene, Schure momentarily forgets that  he is rolling on the . . . Los Angeles River.  </P> <P> "Isn't this hard to believe?" he says.  </P> <P> Hard indeed. The L.A. River isn't known as a nature lover's paradise. Most  Angelenos regard it as nothing more than a junk-strewn sewer that meanders  under smog-choked freeways. There is also widespread conjecture about the  precise contents of the water -- when there actually is any water -- but  officials do concede this: It won't kill you.  </P> <P> As his canoe slices through the dark effluent, Schure is worried less about  drinking the water than riding on it. His unauthorized canoe trip --  technically, he is trespassing -- is intended to demonstrate the viability of  the river for water sports. Contrary to the river's image, he says, "It's  feasible to have a satisfactory" boating experience on parts of the  51-mile-long man-made drainage channel.  </P> <P> Schure and other environmentalists are currently engaged in a three-way battle  to determine the future of the river. They are backing a recent proposal by  Mayor Tom Bradley to open the river for recreation and turn its concrete banks  into tree-lined public parks. Bradley has appointed a task force to come up  with a plan.  </P> <P> On the opposite shore is Assemblyman Richard Katz, who wants to convert the  river to an alternative freeway. He has a $100,000 grant from the L.A. County  Transportation Commission to study the possibility.  </P> <P> Adrift in the middle of these warring forces is the Army Corps of Engineers,  which built the river in the 1930s to control flooding. The engineers don't  much like anyone tampering with their ditch -- if anything, they say, it needs  upgrading -- and probably will have the final say on any project.  </P> <P> It will take years of political and legal wrangling before any plan gets the  green light. In the meantime, says Schure, an adviser with the mayor's task  force, why not test the river's recreational potential right now, for very  little money? Certain stretches of the river, he says, need nothing more than  cosmetic improvements to resemble a real river once again. And there's a  mile-long section in the Sepulveda Basin that can easily be dammed, he says,  and turned into a lake.  </P> <P> "All this could happen right away if we got official approval," says Schure, a  45-year-old graphic designer who works for the city's Department of Planning  and lives in Highland Park.  </P> <P> Paddling under the Los Feliz Bridge, Schure is floating perhaps the prettiest  part of the river -- the six miles or so between the Burbank end of Griffith  Park and Dodger Stadium called "Frogtown." While most of the L.A. River is  covered over by concrete -- about three million barrels -- the Army engineers  had to leave Frogtown alone because of high levels of ground water. Today, the  water runs deeper (two to three feet) and swifter (3 m.p.h.) than most people  realize, even in times of drought. White boulders placed in the river by the  engineers create riffles and atmosphere.  </P> <P> "It's not the Kern, but it's still amazing, considering we're right in the  middle of the city," Schure says.  </P> <P> Because of the drought, surging water has been a rarity in recent years,  allowing vegetation to gain a firm foothold in the sandy bottom of Frogtown.  Willows, sycamores and even palms, 15 to 20 feet high in some spots, are here  to stay. The trees provide cover for thousands of migrating birds and are home  to great blue heron and snowy egrets. And with the rushing current, it's almost  difficult to hear the rumbling Golden State Freeway, which runs parallel to the  river through most of Frogtown.  </P> <P> While nature has treated Frogtown well, man has violated it. Broken glass,  Styrofoam cups, high-tension wires and huge graffiti tableaux are everywhere,  painful reminders that the river runs through an urban wilderness. Debris --  tossed in the water upstream or discharged through some of the river's 700  unregulated storm drains -- get caught up in the vegetation. Barbed wire keeps  the public out.  </P> <P> But man, Schure says, can also undo the damage. Frogtown -- as well as the  Sepulveda Basin, which also has a sandy bottom -- could be cleaned by volunteer  workers. "Controls for access and safety could be put in place quickly," he  says, adding a warning: "But right now, it's totally inappropriate for kids to  be on the river."  </P> <P> Schure also says there is no shortage of volunteers. He belongs to several  environmental groups, including Friends of the L.A. River, a five-year-old  organization that has been spearheading the river-greening movement.  </P> <P> "We look at it as a living river," says filmmaker Lewis MacAdams, a founder the  Friends. "Much of it has been neglected for so long. And it's an aberration  that people hate a river."  </P> <P> Last Earth Day, the Friends held the "first annual L.A. River Regatta" in  conjunction with the Sierra Club and the San Francisco-based Friends of the  River. A flotilla of dinghies, canoes and rafts floated from Riverside Drive in  Burbank to Griffith Park. Participating were more than 200 people, including  State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), an advocate of using the river for  recreation.  </P> <P> Before being issued a permit by the city, organizers of the regatta had to  obtain $1 million in liability insurance. And that's another problem in putting  people on the river: Who's responsible if they drown or become sick by  accidentally ingesting the water? The answer is somewhat murky, although it  will probably become clearer as studies are done and hearings are held.  </P> <P> The river begins in the southwest San Fernando Valley where Bell and Calabasas  creeks converge. Runoff from mountains, including 5,000-foot Mt. Lukens above  Verdugo Hills, also contributes to the flow and gives the river what Schure  calls "a respectable vertical drop." But except when it rains, the bulk of the  river's water in the Valley comes from the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in  the Sepulveda Basin. The plant releases 40 million gallons a day, a quantity  that will double in a year, increasing the current.  </P> <P> Critics of the recreation plan point out the dangers to boaters of  flash-flooding brought on by a heavy rainstorm. Even Schure concedes, "If it  rains, the river is a deadly place to be." But major flooding is rare.  According to a spokesperson for the Department of Water and Power, the last  major flash flood occurred in 1980; at one location on the river, the channel  was at 88% of capacity, the water level reached 17 feet and the flow hit 17  m.p.h.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't want to go down the river in a flood," MacAdams says, "but most of  the time, the river is pretty benign."  </P> <P> As the sun slips behind a mountain in Griffith Park, Schure finishes his river  trip and portages his canoe over the concrete embankment to his car. He shakes  his head. "Like a lot of people," he says, "I've been driving across the L.A.  River for years, wondering, What are the possibilities (for recreation)?  </P> <P> "Now, I see that it's very possible."  </P></p>

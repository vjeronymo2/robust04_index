			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Letter: Jobs follow education in Europe Sir, Your article on shift work in Europe ('Cost constraints prompt a continental shift', August 25) did not tell the full story. LSI Logic's choice of Germany was wrong from the start: 21-shift working is abnormal there and shift premiums high. In France and the UK, continuous working is accepted. And in the UK, 21-shift premiums are lower. There are limits. In France shift workers may not work overtime. In the UK, union pressure has meant a move from four shift teams for continuous working to five or six - bearable costs in capital-intensive industries. So LSI could have found European locations to rival the US, if not Asia. It probably excluded the UK for lacking a 'highly skilled workforce'.

[passage omitted]    However, unlike Lithuanian President Brazauskas and Romanian  Foreign Minister Melescanu, Polish Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak openly stated that Poland is not really happy with the  partnership. "We can accept it if we are certain that Poland  will ultimately be able to become a full member," said Pawlak.    On this issue, the prime minister sees eye to eye with  Polish  President Lech Walesa, who only went along with the NATO  proposal after being subjected to heavy U.S. pressure but  subsequently let it be known that, in his view, it can in no way  be said to meet Polish demands. Poland, probably to a greater  extent than its neighbors, fears a resurgence of Russian  imperialism that would threaten its borders. Poland had counted  on receiving adequate protection against any threat from the  East in the form of security guarantees from NATO. However, a  badly disillusioned Warsaw is now having to face up to the fact  that NATO is not prepared to give these guarantees. [passage  omitted]    Consequently, Warsaw has no option but to take the long road  to accession, and the only one leading in that direction is the  Partnership for Peace. NATO has already let it be known that  Poland and the other Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic,  Hungary, and Slovakia) could find themselves placed on a faster  track, enabling them to gain full membership before the  Romanians or the Bulgarians. However, no one is daring to say so  openly so as not to create new dividing lines in Europe.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Arts: Barclays New Stages It is more fun to chew on what Graeme Miller's latest piece means to say than to sit through it, and in that sense it is not a true work of art. Miller makes multi-media performance art; and his last major work, A Girl Skipping, set images dancing so vividly in the mind that they then kept adding up to fresh meanings afterwards - but the core pleasure, of course, came in watching it. Not so with The Desire Paths, his new 90-minute piece, which begins well but then gets bogged down in repetitious culs-de-sac of nonsense. There are five people onstage, stuck in a room together and surrounded by drear images of modern urban desolation, all ready for a magical adventure; and they get set to depart through the door in the wall. You think of Alice, and of the kids in stories by EM Nesbit, Enid Blyton, CS Lewis. So far, so good. Then - ironic stroke - the door will not open. Here is Miller's one masterstroke. There is no escape route, no path into magic, only the modern world and the human will. It's as if The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe suddenly turned out to have no lion and no witch. Again and again, we see different treatments of the same central image - the door that will not open. These five people - often so childlike - keep breaking up into separate couples, trios, solos; and nonsense is their escapism, whether by prattling away in methodical madness or by crawling around the room like kids playing games. And, as their fantasies do lead them somewhere, the room does start to change. Soon we note how many of their fantasy paths lead to talk of the underworld, and so we think of the paths of life that lead to death. And we note how asexual is these 'children's' existence; one big kiss at the end stands in startling relief to all that has gone before. Meanings, meanings. And vivid, sure performances. But Miller's piece keeps going round and round in drab, irritating loops. Too often, it takes a different route only to end up by making the same point: the locked door, the bomb, the soulless cityscape. The Desire Paths occurs currently, as part of the Barclays New Stages Festival, in the Royal Court's main house. Meanwhile, in the Theatre Upstairs, the two-man Man Act is presenting Call Blue Jane, a collaboration with writer Deborah Levy. This is pop sociology tarted up as performance art. Two men in city suits talk competitively to each other about the art of the deal, sex, wives, children, society. They talk in minimalist cyclical patterns; they pose, gesture, or dance in stern, masculine ways; and keep asking each other the same questions. As they talk and move through the encompassing mist, they reveal the paucity of their thought, their incidental misogyny, and their dreadful vulnerability. They need tenderness but keep rejecting it . . . Yes, well, you know what city men are. No, I can't recommend Call Blue Jane as a work of art - but, since I'm curious how its portrayal of city gents goes down with FT readers, I draw it to your attention, with the approving comment that it lasts less than 50 minutes. Both The Desire Paths and Call Blue Jane continue at the Royal Court until June 19</p>

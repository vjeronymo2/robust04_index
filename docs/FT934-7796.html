			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Siemens launches agreed bid for Teleco Cavi SHARES in Teleco Cavi, the Italian maker of power and telecommunications cables, were suspended yesterday after Siemens of Germany launched an agreed takeover bid. Siemens is spending L104bn (Dollars 62.5m) to buy control of GCR, the family holding company which owns just over 50 per cent of Teleco Cavi's ordinary shares. Almost 70 per cent of GCR is owned by the founding Bruni family, which is selling its entire stake. The remainder is held by BICC, the UK industrial group, and Fornara, an Italian industrial holding company. Siemens will have to launch a public tender offer for the remaining Teleco Cavi stock, in line with new Italian stock exchange rules. However, the German group said it intended to maintain the company's stock-exchange listing. Siemens said the purchase was part of a strategy to consolidate its position in the rapidly changing European cables business. Teleco Cavi, which is based in the Abruzzo region of southern Italy, made group net profits of L256bn last year on sales of L256bn.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Fashion: Through the looking glass - This year's prime Ascot accessory could well be a raincoat. But, whatever the weather, Avril Groom knows the unwritten dress rules for the big occasion If your only experience of Ascot is distilled through the the lenses of the paparazzi you could be forgiven for thinking it an event of almost unparallelled vulgarity and excess. But those who go know that there always are wonderfully-dressed women at Ascot. They rarely attract the cameras, they wear quiet colours and flattering proportions and rigorously apply the 'less is more' rule - only the simplest, plainest outfit can take a real statement of a hat. If they break the Ascot rules, they do it so elegantly that no-one notices for the dress rules are unwritten, not engraved on tablets of stone. According to Laura Thompson-Royds, of the Royal Enclosure office, women should wear 'formal day dress with a hat covering the crown of the head' and 'formal' is the keyword. Trousers are discouraged but not banned if part of a suit. One of last year's most successful outfits was a plain, cream, crepe suit with wide, soft trousers that balanced a big straw platter hat scattered with flowers. On short skirts the discretionary rules are frankly ageist. The young and lithe-limbed would not and should not get away with it; the pudgy over-40s probably would (and should) not, on the valid grounds of suitability. In the late 1980s an Ascot uniform evolved, of tailored jackets, straight skirts, bright colours and gilt buttons. It persisted right up until last year when only a few brave souls put an elegant toe into the misty waters of longline chiffon and soft ruffles. This year the change is writ large in mainstream fashion and getting it right at Ascot - that is looking both soft and formal - requires some thought. There are two main options. One, in spite of its suspect status, is the trouser suit as the easy alternative to both the long, soft skirt (hard to make look formal) and this year's very short length. The other is the short skirt in its new soft form. Both need careful accessorising to achieve the right degree of formality. Trouser suits smack of casual or working clothes unless they are in a drape-like, luxurious fabric such as crepe, heavy silk or a high-quality viscose mix. A tailored jacket, short or long, and wide trousers is the dressiest option. Hats with trousers are tricky. A simple, panama-based style looks too sporty while a confection of veils and bows is too fussy. Patricia Underwood, the New York-based British designer whose simple, hand-stitched styles in soft, pliable straw (available from Browns and Harvey Nichols) are famed for their flattering effect, says the hat must always be 'clothing driven.' So choose the outfit first. 'With trousers I would suggest a brim that turns up to keep the eyeline up, and a structured style to go with the tailoring. It should be simple but adding self-coloured silk flowers makes it dressier,' she says. A top hat is one natural partner for trousers, but choose a lightweight style with a feminine trim to avoid the drag artiste look. Dressy shoes for trousers are not easy. Heels can look graceful with wide trousers but stilettoes are inappropriate. Gucci's new block-heeled loafer with squared-off toe gets it right. The new short skirt, a youthful A-line, looks most formal not as a skirt at all but as a dress with matching jacket or coat - a look long overdue for a comeback. Shapes vary from Ben de Lisi's bias-cut soft fluted version to Catherine Walker's svelte line. Dead straight skirts look dated but the less fullness there is the less likely you are to emulate the woman who failed to interest the photographers until the wind lifted her huge hat and her full skirt skywards and simultaneously every shutter clicked. Hardy Amies, an old hand at dressing chilly English occasions, puts short puffed sleeves on a pretty dress in lightweight tweed, but the sleeveless or slip dress is a hot favourite which can slide over a silk T-shirt or would pass muster alone on a hot day whereas an off-the-shoulder style would not. This year's prime Ascot accessory could well be a raincoat and Aquascutum have caught the dressy mood with swingy styles in silk or microfibre and fondant shades. Only a pessimist chooses her hat to match her raincoat: for a dress and jacket, says Patricia Underwood, 'check the shoulderline carefully as some of the new shapes are cut very narrowly and need a smaller hat. A see-through brim goes with the feeling of lightness.' Philip Treacy's banana-straw hats fulfil this brief, some seeming to defy gravity. But even an Ascot hat, says Patricia, 'should be useful as well as looking good.' This is true of the whole outfit. For Ascot also read weddings, garden parties, school speech days and big summer occasions. If the outfit you are considering will not pay its way at all of those, then I am afraid it is back to the drawing board.</p>

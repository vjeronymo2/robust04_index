			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Books: Life more revealing than literature - A strange state of affairs GERTRUDE AND ALICE by Diana Souhami Pandora/HarperCollins Pounds 19.99, 300 pages 'I DON'T like the family Stein', rhymed a pre-war wag. 'There's Gert and there's Ep and there's Ein.' Each Stein attacked a chosen medium with revolutionary fervour and changed it utterly. But the long-term influence of Gert - on English prose  - is the most dubious of their achievements. Gertrude's innovative speciality, the circular sentence - 'Rose is a rose is a rose' - has, it is true, become one of the trademarks of post-modernist literature; but today's exponents put much more intellectual muscle behind it than is found in her verbal marking-time. A phrase such as Beckett's 'Imagination dead imagine', repeated several times in the work of which it is the title, is not merely an incantation, it precisely reconstructs a state of mind. In this double-biography, Diana Souhami is concerned with the life of Gertrude Stein and that of her inseparable companion Alice Toklas, rather than any fresh appraisal of Stein's work. Most of it is nowadays little read even by students. The loyal Virago did their best with two Stein re-prints in the 1980s but not to much avail. What remains fascinating is the personality of a woman whose literary effrontery caused her for a while to be compared with Joyce. Souhami describes the only occasion the two writers met. It was in Paris in the 1930s and it was very brief. On being introduced Gertrude said: 'After all these years.' Joyce replied, 'Yes and our names are always linked together.' Gertrude followed this with, 'We live in the same arrondissement'. And at that point the conversation petered out. Ezra Pound was rather more forthcoming. He went to dinner with Gertrude and Alice in their flat at 27 rue de Fleurus, and enjoyed Alice's superb cooking. Unfortunately when discussing TS Eliot, or maybe it was Japanese prints, he became over-excited and broke the back of a chair. 'Ez is fine,' said Gertude later, 'but I can't afford to have him in the house'. For his part Pound did not think all that much of her work. As he wrote to Wyndham Lewis in 1935, '. . . feel all this flow of conSquishousness Gertie/Jimmie stuff has about FLOWED long enuff'. Gertie was a great rejecter of people. She quarrelled and eventually broke completely with most of her relations including her brother Leo. Like his more famous sister, Leo was an eccentric, an expatriate and an early patron of Picasso. Her rejects among her former-proteges included many of 'the lost generation' - that label was borrowed by Gertrude from a French friend. It was Alice's job to tell affronted callers that Miss Stein regrets she is not at home today nor will she be in future. Happily Gertrude's friendship with Man Ray lasted long enough for him to do several portraits of her and one of her white poodle, Basket. Cecil Beaton then took over. She was strangely, massively photogenic. Hemingway, a protege until he began to make good, remembered Gertrude, in A Moveable Feast, as being 'very big but not tall and . . . heavily built like a peasant woman. She had beautiful eyes and a strong German-Jewish face . . . her lovely thick, alive, immigrant hair which she wore put up in the same way she had probably worn it at college.' And he describes Alice as having 'a very pleasant voice . . . small, very dark, with her hair cut like Joan of Arc . . . a very hooked nose. She was working on a piece of needlepoint when we first met them and she worked on this and saw to the food and drink and talked to my wife'. Picasso just about lasted the course as a close friend, as did that much inferior painter Gertrude later patronised heavily, the English artist Francis Rose. Another gifted chum was Virgil Thomson. He composed the music for Gertrude's opera Four Saints in Three Acts. The work contains a sentence 'Pigeons on the grass alas' which has since found its way into the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. With an all-black cast, and choreographed by Frederick Ashton, this curious opera was seen by many of the famous when performed in New York in 1934. Both Gertrude and her lover Alice came from Jewish-American families settled in the West. The attraction between them was instant, the bond life-long. Gertrude had had a previous love-affair with a woman called May Bookstaver, a fact she concealed from Alice. The pattern of slave (Alice) and mistress (Gertrude) was soon firmly established but we watch the balance of dependence gradually swing in Alice's favour; she had no easy task ministering to Gertrude's imperious needs and whims. Yet you cannot but admire Gertrude's brute courage as much as Alice's power of endurance. They operated a private ambulance, distributing medical supplies to hospitals throughout France, in the latter part of the first war, and in the second they lived right through the Occupation in their country house at Bilignin in Haute-Savoie. Gertrude somehow succeeded at long-range in preserving the Picassos in the flat in Paris from being plundered by the Gestapo. Most of Gertrude's literary works, including her ecstatic accounts of her love-making, were so inaccessible to the ordinary reader that no commercial publisher would risk bringing them out. She had to sell a painting or two to finance publication. It was only when Gertrude wrote more comprehensibly in her book on Picasso and above all in the The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (Gertrude identifying publicly with Alice) and its sequel Everybody's Autobiography that she became a best-seller. That led to the two ladies making a triumphal tour of America before the second war. Gertrude died suddenly in 1946 aged 72. Alice became overnight the classically protective author's widow. More paintings were sold so that all Gertrude's unpublished work could be printed, a project heroically undertaken by Yale University and the writer Carl Van Vetchen. He had been a close friend and as 'Papa Woojums' had learnt to speak the baby-language Gertrude used with Alice at times of endearment. Alice had problems implementing this publishing project; she in her turn quarrelled with the Steins, her co-beneficiaries. But she was by no means finished. She struggled on bravely with Basket the Second for companionship. She made some new friends and in her old age converted to Catholicism. Then she wrote a highly successful cook-book, and eventually in 1967, just short of her 90th birthday, was reunited with Gertrude in Pere Lachaise where they both now lie in a joint tomb. The strange story of this long lesbian love-affair has been thoroughly well told in this book - one that is much easier to read than any by Gertrude Stein.</p>

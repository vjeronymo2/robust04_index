			<p>BFN     [Text] Alain Juppe, the RPR [Rally for the Republic]  secretary general, believes that "there is no such thing as a  magic solution to the unemployment problem" and advocates  "simple measures" adopted by parliament rather than through a  referendum, as was proposed by Philippe Seguin. In his  editorial in the RPR weekly NATION MAGAZINE, the foreign  minister states that "it is up to the political authorities to  define simple measures, but which would constitute a real change  with regard to the attitudes of the social partners, and to have  them voted by parliament."</p>

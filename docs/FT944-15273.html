			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Rolling contracts Mr Tom Buffett's five-year rolling contract at Automated Security Holdings provides a good test for the whole 'roller' concept. This is a case of manifest failure: ASH's share price has underperformed the market by 77 per cent since the start of 1990. Defenders of rollers say they do not necessarily reward failure as boards can insist on a reduced pay-off if performance is poor. ASH now has the chance to show whether that is so.</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Miners set to back US pit deal Members of the United Mine Workers of America look set to ratify an agreement this week to end the seven-month US coal strike. The nation's biggest coal companies and union leadership agreed on a new five-year contract in Washington last week. Both sides have won concessions, although the prolonged strike was costly for all parties, and particularly for the midwestern coal industry, which is in a long decline, industry analysts say. The union appears to have achieved some guarantees that union miners will be hired when coal companies or their subsidiaries open new mines, said Mr Rafael Villagran, a Lehman Brothers analyst. He said the companies gained more flexible work rules, including the right to schedule seven-day weeks and in some cases 10-hour days. 'The settlement will certainly be taken positively by investors,' said Mr Villagran, 'and it should make the UMWA a little stronger. Their representation in the industry has been dropping, and they needed to stop that. This could help.' Less than half of the coal in the US is mined by union workers. The union risked the strike to gain job security for its members and, to some extent, a future for itself. Its strategy, a selective strike which targeted companies with the toughest bargaining positions, split three coal producers from the employers' group. The strike settlement, however, does not change a fundamental shift away from the high-sulphur coal mined in the Illinois basin, where the union is most active.</p>

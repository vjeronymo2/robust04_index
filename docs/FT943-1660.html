			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / New White House spokesman Mr Mike McCurry, chief State Department spokesman, is being moved to the same position in the White House to try to improve relations with the media and to get over President Bill Clinton's policy messages more effectively. The move is one of the personnel shifts being orchestrated by Mr Leon Panetta, the chief of staff. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the present spokeswoman, is being given what is described as 'broader responsibilities' but will be replaced as the regular daily briefer by Mr McCurry. Mr Mark Gearan, the overall communications director, is also to be given a new job, as yet unspecified, on Mr Panetta's staff. Press relations have been a thorn in the White House flesh ever since Mr Clinton took office. Initially they were handled by Mr George Stephanopoulos, but only with much friction with the press corps. He was shifted to a far more influential position as counsellor to the president in the summer of last year, but even his activities are now to be subject to greater control by Mr Panetta. Ms Myers is personally well liked by the press, but she has never been a member of the inner policy-making team, thus reducing her effectiveness. Mr McCurry, on the other hand, has established a close working relationship with all the senior echelons of the state department, including Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, in the year he has been on the job. His light touch has also made him popular with diplomatic correspondents. Observer, page 21</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (2): From the catwalk to the sidewalk - The designers' outrageous images have been interpreted by the high street stores. Avril Groom gives a guide on what is fit to be worn / In the shops Have you steeled yourself for diaphanous mini-petticoats, St Trinian-style gymslips, white shrouds or hipster trousers drooping to almost indecent levels? Such images dominated the media after the spring catwalk shows last October and they were quite enough to make even the clothes-conscious renounce fashion for the foreseeable future. But fear not. The clothes which have arrived in the shops are surprisingly wearable. Two factors govern the shake-out between catwalk and clothes-rail. One is that, on the principle of using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut, designers put outrageous versions of their ideas on the catwalk in order to make fashion as a whole evolve by a whisker. Back at their showrooms, where the real business with buyers is done, the clothes look much more normal. The other is that the percentage of women who wear designer clothes is small and the real importance lies in the way the mass market accepts and interprets such ideas. With instant communications, fashion is now a global village and everyone, from couturier to chainstore, is thinking on the same lines. The shows give the high street both confirmation of its choices and added inspiration. The fashion-forward end of the high street is often accused of ripping off the creators. Yet few top designers mind - Karl Lagerfeld, for instance, believes imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. The young and experimental, unworried by the finer points of wearability, certainly imitate - they dress to shock in style straight off the catwalk, and good luck to them. Hold-up stockings and ankle-socks are already established in the nation's nightclubs. The more mature and circumspect find it easier to wear the wider fashion industry's interpretations: companies translate ideas to their own identity and rarely admit a direct debt to a designer. But, in modified form, the origins are plain to see. Not everything takes off - the customer still has the final say. So here are the catwalk inspirations for spring. Watch the rails in your high street to separate the front runners from the potential turkeys, with help from our brief notes on who backs what. The tiny dress Schoolgirl-style from Dolce e Gabbana, Anna Sui and even Valentino. But as Marks and Spencer points out, a summer basic. By itself, a sun-dress; or layer it over a T-shirt; or, as Kookai suggests, over a long version. With popsox and DMs, for teenagers. With lace-topped hold-ups by Aristoc, in the bedroom. The A-line mini In 15-inch hipster form, thanks to Chanel, Versace and Donna Karan. Top Shop has gone as far as a 13-inch bum-freezer but even Marks and Spencer is trying 16 inches. Next has a more grown-up version 'with a smart jacket, which is how the over-25s will wear it', as do Monix and Warehouse. Softer pleated styles at French Connection, Warehouse and Agnes B. Homespun naturals Armani's and Calvin Klein's rough textured linens are everywhere. You will be bored with beige before summer starts. The unstructured trouser suit, collarless shirts, and layered oatmeal knits are topically 'green' and good for the size 12-plus majority. Pyjamas Drawstring pants from Ralph Lauren, Issey Miyake and others are the best option for non-mini wearers. These could be worn with bare midriffs - most shops do crop-tops for the firm of tum - but are easier with a loose shirt and man's vest or a long, unstructured jacket. White From Miyake's airy silks to Montana's crisp, fluttery-pointed shirts, everyone has white. Whistles has an all-white silk collection of easy pieces. Next includes easy tailoring in white and more feminine styles mixed with denim, a la Gaultier. And it is mixed practically with black at Marks and Spencer. Metallics Part of the deconstructionists' credo of using unexpected fabrics during the day, has been made mainstream by Donna Karan and John Rocha. Silver leather from Whistles and Oasis is softer in other fabrics - textured metallic knits from Episode and Oasis, lurex and marl at Jigsaw, soft gold suits at Monix, shiny silk at French Connection. Neo-punk This encompasses safety pins at Versace, bondage at Chanel, vests and leather at Helmut Lang and Yohji Yamamoto, and is mixed with the ethnic look and jewellery at Gaultier, the season's most uplifting collection. This is more talked about than copied but is strong at the youth end. Jigsaw have clean-lined hipster jeans and crinkled georgette tops. Some see it as important for next winter. You have been warned. Layers Originated by Ann Demeulemeester, Martin Margiela and Rifat Ozbek, the secret is mixing textures, styles and lengths. Top Shop call it 'attitude' dressing, with unexpectedly individual mixes such as sports tops and floral skirts. Principles and Episode do sophisticated colour-mixes of simple, fluid pieces. Grecian nights From Chloe, Gigli and Comme des Garcons, comes the newest in evening wear, draped, wrapped, high-waisted and bound with ribbon ties, sometimes one-shouldered, and with banded, ringleted hair to match. Monix, Next and Top Shop have halter-necked and draped styles, very short or very long, mainly in white or black. Ethnics Gigli, Lacroix, Betty Jackson and Gaultier mix print, stripe and plain, often with tunics, long jackets or bandeaus over narrow pants or long sarongs. Wearable versions in linen and cheesecloth from French Connection, spicy silks at Principles, Indian prints at Top Shop, spicy linens and stripes at Jigsaw, crinkle and linen at M&amp;S.</p>

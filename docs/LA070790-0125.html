			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WILD FREEWAY CHASE, GUNFIGHT ENDS IN ARREST  </P> <P> A man suspected of beating a taxicab driver and stealing his cab was wounded in  a gun battle with police Friday morning after shooting at law enforcement  authorities during a harrowing chase on the crowded San Diego Freeway, police  said.  </P> <P> The chase ended when the suspect sped over a center divider on a congested  Laguna Hills intersection, blowing out two tires, and then fled into a deep  ravine, where he hid behind a clump of trees and continued to shoot at  officers.  </P> <P> Miraculously, law enforcement officials said, no one except the suspect was  injured during the 25-mile chase or the subsequent 10:30 a.m. shoot-out in the  ravine at Moulton Parkway and Laguna Hills Drive.  </P> <P> "Luck was definitely on our side," Irvine Police Lt. Vic Thies said. "This guy  fired so indiscriminately, it was extremely fortunate that no one else was  hit."  </P> <P> Irvine police identified the suspect as Ronald K. Trotter, 29, of Stanton. A  single shotgun blast, fired by an Orange County sheriff's deputy, hit Trotter,  said Irvine Lt. Mike White.  </P> <P> Trotter was listed in critical condition at Mission Hospital Regional Medical  Center after undergoing surgery Friday afternoon, hospital spokeswoman Nancy  Gasho said.  </P> <P> Also injured was the taxicab driver, who fought with Trotter and tried to wrest  the gun from him before the cab was stolen.  </P> <P> "I was frightened that he would kill me and I was mad," said the cabdriver,  Valery Yakubov. "I held the (suspect's) gun with one hand and hit him with the  other. I hit him and he hit me. I hit him in his face over and over. . . .  There was blood everywhere."  </P> <P> The gun fired once during the struggle, but Yakubov was not hit. He said the  suspect then pointed the gun at him and possibly pulled the trigger again, but  the gun jammed. Yakubov then escaped.  </P> <P> Police described Trotter as a muscular man who wore a black hat, jacket and  pants.  </P> <P> This was the fifth officer-involved shooting in Orange County this year. A  sixth shooting involving Orange County officers occurred in Los Angeles County  last month when a Fullerton narcotics officer and a drug suspect were killed in  a shoot-out during an undercover operation in Downey.  </P> <P> The Orange County district attorney's office is investigating Friday's shooting  because it involved law enforcement authorities.  </P> <P> Friday's shooting ended a half-hour car chase at speeds of up to 75 m.p.h. that  took the suspect, Irvine police, California Highway Patrol, Orange County  sheriff's deputies and an Anaheim police helicopter on a journey from Irvine to  the South County community near the Laguna Hills Mall.  </P> <P> The incident began shortly before 10 a.m., when Yakubov, 29, of Anaheim, was  called to pick up a customer at John Wayne Airport, said Coast Yellow Cab  Cooperative operations manager Thom Pelk.  </P> <P> After picking up his fare, Pelk said, Yakubov drove the man to at least two and  possibly three locations, Pelk said.  </P> <P> "We don't know what those addresses are, but after two or three times of doing  this, he (the suspect) pulled a gun on the cabbie," Pelk said.  </P> <P> At the intersection of Morse and Von Karmann avenues, the two got into a  scuffle. The suspect then pulled out a .45-caliber automatic handgun and  pointed it at Yakubov's head, Pelk said.  </P> <P> Yakubov did not radio for help.  </P> <P> "I imagine he was in a rather precarious position with a gun pointed at him,"  Pelk said.  </P> <P> During the fight, the cabdriver grabbed for the gun, which fired. The bullet  missed Yakubov, but he sustained gunpowder burns to his arm. Yakubov, a  Ukrainian immigrant who has worked for the cab company for two months, was  taken to Healthcare Medical Center of Tustin, where he was admitted overnight  for a broken rib and facial cuts suffered in the scuffle.  </P> <P> After leaving Yakubov on the street, Trotter then headed for the congested San  Diego Freeway, police said.  </P> <P> Minutes later, Irvine police officers spotted the taxi traveling southbound on  the freeway near Irvine Center Drive, Thies said. Two Irvine police squad cars  followed the suspect as he sped southbound, whipping past slower cars on the  congested freeway. Within minutes, California Highway Patrol cars joined the  chase.  </P> <P> When the pursuit reached El Toro Road, the suspect began firing his gun out the  driver's window, missing police and other drivers, Thies said.  </P> <P> Lyle Edwards, 52, of Mission Viejo was on the freeway when he spotted the  lights of at least four squad cars flashing in his rear-view mirror.  </P> <P> Then he noticed a yellow taxicab "whip by on the left. He wasn't more than two  cars in front of me," Edwards said.  </P> <P> "I said, 'My gosh, they (police) are chasing this guy,' " Edwards said. At that  point, Edwards was startled by what sounded like an explosion.  </P> <P> "I saw his rear window shatter and explode," Edwards said. "I couldn't believe  it. Nobody could. It happened so quickly and everybody (drivers) just tried to  get out of the way."  </P> <P> The suspect finally got off the freeway at Avery Parkway and led the growing  number of pursuing squad cars through several Laguna Hills neighborhoods.  Meanwhile, an Anaheim police helicopter had been called in to keep an eye on  the suspect from the sky.  </P> <P> James Jones, 28, of Anaheim, said he was waiting for the light to change at the  intersection of Moulton Parkway and Laguna Hills Drive when he saw the taxicab  careening down the street toward him at about 60 m.p.h.  </P> <P> "He was coming right at me," said Jones.  </P> <P> As the cab reached the intersection, it sped over the center divider in an  attempt to make a left turn on Laguna Hills Drive. While airborne, the rear  tires exploded.  </P> <P> The suspect skidded to a stop, jumped out and fled into a deep ravine covered  with high brush and trees.  </P> <P> "The taxi was still rolling," Jones said.  </P> <P> As the Anaheim police helicopter circled the area, an officer using a  loudspeaker warned the suspect to throw down his weapon. More than a dozen  squad cars from Irvine and the Sheriff's Department converged and blocked off  the intersection.  </P> <P> "Cops were piling out of their cars with lots of weapons," said witness Debbi  Barton, who was also in her car at the intersection.  </P> <P> Moments later, as police closed in, the suspect reportedly began firing again  from behind a clump of trees.  </P> <P> At least one sheriff's deputy returned the fire, but "none of our officers  fired," Irvine's Lt. White said.  </P> <P> Staff writers Davan Maharaj and Wendy Paulson contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Ford adds Mystique to its Dollars 6bn global ambitions - The company's attempt to repeat its European success in the US Ford Motor's Dollars 6bn programme to create a 'global car' - one that can be sold successfully around the world - reaches an important test tomorrow when a US version of the vehicle is officially unveiled at the New York Automobile Show. The global car, some six years in the making, was introduced first in Europe, where it went on sale last year under the name Mondeo. It was a big hit. The Mondeo was named 1994 European car of the year by a panel of motoring journalists and has been the best-selling vehicle in its class each month since the launch. The question now is whether Ford can repeat this success in the far more crowded and competitive US car market, where the global car will be known as the Ford Contour (the version being launched in New York) and the Mercury Mystique, and will square up against strong selling mid-sized vehicles such as the Nissan Altima and Pontiac Grand Am. A lot may be riding on the answer. For if the Contour is successful, it may encourage Ford to repeat its global vehicle experiment - shrugging off criticism in the motor industry about the high cost and long time spent developing the vehicle. While the car is rather conservatively styled, many analysts think it will sell well. Mr Christopher Cedergren, of the Auto Pacific consultancy, says the Contour offers good 'drive-ability,' refined fitments and should be attractively priced. 'I think it will do fine. Ford might even need to put extra capacity in place.' The company is planning to sell around 300,000 units a year in North America, from plants in Kansas City, Missouri and Cuautitlan, Mexico, on top of some 400,000 in Europe. In all, it aims to sell nearly 800,000 a year in 59 countries around the world. Whatever the outcome, Ford is hailing the global car programme as an important step in its transformation from a multi-national - one which is in many markets around the world, but serves them independently - into a globally integrated business, making the best use of its resources on a worldwide basis. Traditionally, the world's leading car manufacturers have made a vehicle for one particular market - the US, Japan or Europe - and if the vehicle has been successfully sold abroad, it has been later modified to cope with differing tastes and government-imposed safety and emission standards. Many companies have toyed with the idea of building a global car because in theory it promises some big savings: manufacturers do not have to duplicate design and engineering for different markets, while the larger volume brings economies of scale. None, however, has gone so far as Ford. Ford of Europe was primarily responsible for the basic engineering of the car and integrating its components and sub-systems. Its new V6 engine and automatic transmission were engineered in the US, which also provided air conditioning expertise. The design originated from four design centres - one in Italy, one in Germany and two in the US. This international co-operation imposed huge logistical problems, solved by the establishment of a complex video-conferencing system and by the purchase of a Cray super-computer, which allowed engineers on either side of the Atlantic to work on drawings simultaneously. Around 90 per cent of the parts of the vehicle that the driver does not see  -such as the underbody, suspension and powertrain - are common to both the European and US versions, although significant changes were made to the visible parts to cope with differing European and American tastes. Mr John Oldfield, the Briton who was project manager for the programme, says 'each car has more features to satisfy customers than if it had been designed only for one market'. Ford says another benefit of the project has been a big improvement in its global sourcing of parts. The project has only 227 suppliers, compared with over 700 for the Tempo and Topaz models which it replaces in the US, and Ford signed long-term supply contracts early in the Mondeo/Contour programme. Mr Oldfield says the experience so far 'gives us a lot of confidence that (the theoretical) cost reductions from global programmes are real'. The start-up of production in Kansas City is also proceeding more smoothly than previous launches, since Ford is drawing on the experience of 38 engineers, brought over from Europe, who were involved in the Mondeo start-up there. However, the six years spent developing the car is long by world standards. Ford normally aims to get new vehicles on the street in 24 to 48 months. The company says this was due to the steep learning curve on the Mondeo and its next world car will be developed much more rapidly. Motor industry critics also point out that this experience has come at a very high price. The Dollars 6bn bill is roughly double what Ford spent in the mid-1980s developing its Taurus car, arguably the most successful US car of the past decade. Chrysler spent only Dollars 1.6bn developing its popular new line of LH vehicles. They question whether Ford can make money on the Mondeo/Contour. Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman, insists that 'whatever else this programme does for us, you can rest assured that it will earn us profits. Real, fully accounted profits. Anything you hear to the contrary is probably just wishful thinking on the part of our competition.' Mr Trotman also points out that Ford is getting more for its money than the three new models - for example, two new engines and transmissions which will be used in other vehicles, new air conditioning expertise and an improved global communications network. 'But our investment is in much more than hardware,' he adds. 'We've been buying a new way of doing business for the long term.' And he insists Ford will build another world car - with another mid-sized vehicle the most likely candidate - although he declines to say when or what. Even so, he reckons it will take Ford another 10 years to 'complete all we have to do' to become a truly global manufacturer. But he is no doubt hoping that it will still put it many years ahead of its rivals.</p>

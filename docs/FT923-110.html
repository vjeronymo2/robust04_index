			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Hershey may launch counter bid for Freia Marabou HERSHEY Foods, the big US chocolates producer, is considering a counter bid for Freia Marabou, the Norwegian confectionery group which yesterday agreed to a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 870m) takeover offer from the US Philip Morris group. Hershey is Freia Marabou's second biggest shareholder with an 18.6 per cent stake, acquired in May this year for NKr1.16bn (Pounds 113.8m) from Orkla, the Norwegian diversified foods group. The Philip Morris bid has to be accepted by shareholders, who have been called to an extraordinary general assembly on October 9. The offer has to win two-thirds backing by Freia's shareholders to amend the company's articles of association to allow the takeover. Philip Morris also needs approval by Norway's energy and industry minister, Mr Finn Kristensen, who said he will consider the sale on the basis of the buyer's plans for the company. Mr Richard Zimmerman, Hershey chief executive, said yesterday in Oslo that his company last weekend made an unconditional offer to acquire Freia Marabou for Dollars 1.3bn. Mr Zimmerman said Hershey's bid still held but the company was considering several options to gain control of Freia Marabou and has invited Orkla to co-operate in a joint solution to acquire the company. 'We contacted Orkla on Monday indicating our intention to explore opportunities to work together in the pursuit of Freia Marabou. They expressed interest in continuing these discussions,' Mr Zimmerman said.</p>

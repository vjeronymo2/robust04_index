Journalists who visited an EZLN camp for the first time have  reported that the EZLN leader known as "Major Mario" has  announced that the EZLN Indian Clandestine Committee will answer  very soon the government concerning its dialogue proposals.    "Major Mario" has denied the EZLN is attempting to establish  socialism, but he insisted that the Indians and peasants will  struggle for the fulfillment of the 10 points of their program:  democracy, jobs, fraud-free elections, independence, land for  peasants, jobs [as received], housing, health, justice and  education.    The Zapatista leader said the war will not end until these  demands are met, and the EZLN will not disarm, because, he said,  "we would rather die fighting with dignity than from cholera and  measles and repressed by landowners;" we want freedom, the right  to express ourselves, democracy, and true peace.    "Major Mario" assured that the EZLN has respected the truce,  but the Army has continued to attack, and the EZLN rebels have  orders to defend themselves and have only responded to the  attacks.    Concerning rapprochement with Manuel Camacho, commissioner  for peace and reconciliation, "Major Mario" has said this  decision must be made by "Commander Marcos;" he added that the  rebels are Mexicans and natives of Chiapas who acknowledge  Mexico's flag and national anthem.    In response to a question on war casualties, the Zapatista  rebel denounced that the Army murdered civilians, dressed them  as Zapatistas and blamed the EZLN for their murder. "Major  Mario" said the Army is no longer dealing with unarmed peasants.    "Major Mario" said the uprising was decided by the  Clandestine Committee after seeking out every legal path,  finding no results. The government has destroyed Article 27 of  the Constitution, and the North American Free Trade Agreement  will only foster poverty.</p>

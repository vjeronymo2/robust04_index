			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / World Trade News: Gatt's successor to be given real clout - The likely workings of the World Trade Organisation The World Trade Organisation that succeeds the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year will be a bigger beast but in most respects a similar animal to its predecessor. If negotiations with the Swiss government go well, the WTO will be comfortably ensconced in Gatt's existing Egyptianate building by Lake Geneva. The present staff will stay - though there will be some new faces. Transformation of Gatt from an interim, albeit long-standing, secretariat to a fully fledged international organisation represents a useful legal 'tidying-up' of its anomalous position. The WTO will continue to operate, as Gatt does, on the basis of consensus and mutual agreement between member governments. The differences, however, are crucial. The WTO will have stronger, clearer rules applying to virtually all areas of world trade, from agriculture to accountancy. Even more important, those rules will be enforced by a semi-judicial disputes procedure which will no longer allow countries to block findings against them. All those wanting to join the WTO must accept the results of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks in their entirety. A general council of WTO members will have subsidiary bodies responsible for trade in goods, services and intellectual property. But the organisation's top decision-taking forum will be a two-yearly ministerial meeting - an attempt to give the organisation more political clout in capitals and a higher profile internationally. Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, has made no secret of his desire to reclaim for the WTO the role assigned to the stillborn International Trade Organisation in global economic policy-making. The ITO, negotiated in 1948, was intended to operate as an equal alongside the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank when these institutions were set up after the war. After the US Congress refused to ratify the ITO, the Gatt remained as a contractual arrangement between governments, serviced by the secretariat to the ITO interim committee. Not everyone shares Mr Sutherland's lofty ambitions for the WTO. Some fear they will encourage UN-style waffle rather than action. 'The great advantage of Gatt is that people go there to negotiate, not to talk,' says a senior European trade official. By common consent, however, the WTO's credibility as an effective fair-trade policeman will stand or fall on the success of its new dispute settlement system. In a radical departure from previous practice, independent panel reports will be automatically adopted by the WTO unless there is a consensus to reject them. Complained-against countries may appeal to a permanent appellate body but its verdict will be binding. If offenders then fail to comply with panel recommendations, trading partners will have the right to compensation or, in the last resort, to impose (commensurate) trade sanctions. Every stage of the procedure is subject to strict time limits. The US, which has loudly voiced its frustrations with the present system, has high hopes of the new one. 'The new system. . . will work and it will work fast,' Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, told Congress in January. He noted approvingly that there will also be the possibility of cross-retaliation - the raising of tariffs, say, for a breach of the intellectual property rules. However, the new system will also substantially diminish the scope for unilateral US action, a key objective of the EU and developing countries in the Uruguay Round talks. WTO members are obliged to use multilateral disputes settlement wherever available. And since WTO rules will extend to services and intellectual property as well as goods, most disputes will fall within its jurisdiction. Some trade officials have predicted a wave of test cases, especially in relation to the new accord on intellectual property rights - but Gatt is not expecting a big permanent increase in the present workload. About a dozen disputes are going through panel procedures. Nevertheless, Gatt says it will need more lawyers, especially to service the appellate body, and there will have to be extra staff to cope with the WTO's work on services and intellectual property rights. Though the final word on the WTO's expansion will rest with member governments, who will have to approve an increase in the present SFr94m (Pounds 45m) annual budget, Gatt expects to add 40-50 professionals to the 180 it currently employs within its 400-strong staff. Gatt officials point out that the WTO will remain tiny by the standards of other international organisations. The World Bank, with a budget of SFr1.8bn, employs 3,700 professionals. The IMF has 1,300 professionals and a budget of SFr477m. Even the Paris-based OECD, which has no executive functions, employs 1,100 professionals with a budget of SFr350m. 'When you consider that the Uruguay Round agreement is going to generate up to Dollars 270bn (Pounds 182bn) annually in extra world income in the goods area alone, the WTO represents a pretty good return on investment,' says one top official, half-seriously.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: No Captain Bligh, but a builder of real teams Sir, In the wake of so much criticism of the media in the past year, I have had the opportunity to follow recent press coverage of myself with fairly good humour. But I feel perhaps I ought to reply to John van Maurik's letter (February 3), in which he likens me to the Captain Bligh, another gentleman whom history has proven was wrongly maligned. It surprises me that a man in van Maurik's position of commercial reality should be so naive as to believe that this film would be any more than a means of grabbing high viewing figures to sell advertising space on Channel 4. Why else would a 10-person film crew come 700 miles up here to film me, when it is so much cheaper to film him in action in Bromley? Does van Maurik believe, for one minute, that Patricia Morison, in researching for 27.25 column inches of space in the FT, would waste just five minutes checking her facts with me? Does it matter in the slightest, that she should make a hard factual error such as stating 'Rockwater had asked for an extra tough course, for which it paid Pounds 25,000', when the actual cost was Pounds 10,560? Why bother? Why let the facts get in the way of a good story? My experience of life has led me to believe in the largely untapped power of the human spirit. I believe it is people who make success, rather than systems. My courses are designed to build real teams. When I sat the Rockwater team featured in the programme around a table, before their chief executive, 50 miles from the railway, then it was up to him: real team-building, real business. But there was not enough action in this; it threatened to diminish those much more vital, viewing figures. Finally, I would ask van Maurik to spell my name correctly -  little slips could have cost me my life so many times over the years. And, after all, it was just a small slip which recently allowed the people of tiny Wales to defeat the systems of gigantic England. John Ridgway, Ardmore, Rhiconich, By Lairg, Sutherland IV27 4RB</p>

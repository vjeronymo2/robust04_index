			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Arts: Tonight - Lola Blau Georg Kreisler (b. 1922), the Viennese song-writer, performer and playwright, was one of the lucky ones. He managed to leave Austria (with his family) in 1938, worked in Hollywood and New York, and only returned to Vienna in 1955. Though he had grown so accustomed to writing in English that he found it hard to resume his native tongue, it was back home in Vienna, that he began to enjoy the greatest success of his career; and, according to the Old Red Lion's programme note, he's still at it. The heroine of his show, Tonight: Lola Blau, is a chanteuse, but otherwise her career is his. She is a Jew who manages to escape from Europe with her career intact, enjoys success in America, and then returns to Vienna. Kreisler, in telling her story, tries to highlight a few aspects of the society around her - the importance of her entertainment to the poor as well as the rich, and the anti-Semitism that survives in postwar Austria. It is, however, alarming to find how lightweight, how passive, Lola Blau's story is. She just happens to escape from Austria, she just happens to become a star, she just happens to go back home. The only thing of which she expresses real need is to make it as a performer; and then to keep on making it. Sure, she passes social comment now and then; but she spends more time commenting on the vicissitudes of a stage career than on life outside the theatre. Refuge, life and limb register less strongly with her than stardom. And Kreisler conceives her role more as a tour de force, song upon song upon song upon song, than as a character. This British premiere has the benefit of an uncannily first-rate translation by Don White, with all the songs in stylish rhymes, witty words and virtuoso metres (can the German original have been this good?), a highly accomplished performance of the central role by Esther Zchieschow (an actress from what was 'East Germany' performing in English for the first time with exceptional assurance), and fluent direction by Phil Young. But Zchieschow does no more to round out Lola than Kreisler. She rattles off this huge, wordy, song-and-dance role with impressive concentration; but her Lola is not a star (just very accomplished), not a personality (just a commentator). There is more authority in Darryl Goodwin's performance of three small roles; and he also plays in the excellent stage band. It is easy to enjoy each passing feature of this show - but its heart is hollow. At the Old Red Lion, London EC1 (071) 837 7816 until September 4; at the Old Fire Station, Oxford (0865) 79494, September 13-27</p>

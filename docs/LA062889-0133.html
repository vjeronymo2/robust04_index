			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NRC CHIEF FAULTS NUCLEAR INDUSTRY AS UNCOOPERATIVE  </P> <P> The nuclear industry has not cooperated with the federal government in  tightening maintenance rules for nuclear power plants, the outgoing head of the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission said today.  </P> <P> "The nuclear industry should have been more cooperative with us and they were  not," said Lando Zech, who steps down as NRC chairman Friday after a three-year  term.  </P> <P> Zech said the state of the nuclear industry as a whole is healthy, but added  that he was "somewhat disappointed" to have made little progress on tightening  maintenance standards.  </P> <P> Zech said the nuclear industry, which has not applied to build a new nuclear  plant in 11 years, faces an uncertain future.  </P> <P> "Nuclear power supplies 20% of U.S. electricity needs safely now, but it's  impossible to say where we're going," Zech said. "I have no crystal ball."  </P> <P> Zech will be replaced by NRC Commissioner Kenneth Carr.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi's "Other Worlds: A Grand Tour of the Solar System"  certainly interests us. We have a strong suspicion that we're from outer space,  since not a day goes by that someone doesn't ask: "What planet are you from?"  The program will include images sent back by U.S., Soviet and European  spacecraft, and the latest information from telescopes on Earth and in space.  </P> <P> And Fraknoi, who's executive director of the Astronomical Society of the  Pacific, promises his discussion of the subject won't even contain a syllable  of NASAspeak. Just plain, everyday language about the rings of Saturn,  Jupiter's stormy moon Io, asteroids, the search for Planet X and more. It will  be held Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in Room 2160E of the Dickson Art Center  at UCLA. Fees vary. For information call (213) 825-7093. Klaatu, barada, nikto.  R.D.  </P></p>

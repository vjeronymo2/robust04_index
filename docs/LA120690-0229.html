			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> DESOTELL GETS NO KICK FROM ALL-LEAGUE PICK  </P> <P> Ribet Academy's football coach took exception recently to what he perceived to  be a bad call, only this time the referees weren't the bad guys.  </P> <P> Ric Desotell could not hide his displeasure with his Heritage League  counterparts' decision to leave Ribet kicker Kate Stoll off the all-league  team.  </P> <P> Stoll was selected all-league last season when she scored five points on  conversion kicks for the Fighting Frogs, who compete in the Southern Section's  Eight-Man Small Schools Division.  </P> <P> This season, Stoll increased her production by scoring six points.  </P> <P> Ribet was the only team in the Heritage League that attempted conversion kicks  and field goals, Desotell said, and Stoll, a senior, was the only kicker in the  league who scored any points.  </P> <P> All of that would seem to make Stoll a shoo-in for postseason honors.  </P> <P> But Stoll was left off both the first and second all-league teams.  </P> <P> "The other kickers just made it for their kickoffs," Desotell said. "I found  that astounding."  </P> <P> Nine in a row: The Glendale College football team closed out its season by  running over Citrus' top-rated defense during a 23-16 victory in the Southern  California Bowl last weekend.  </P> <P> Glendale, which won nine consecutive games to finish 9-2, gained 437 yards  against a defense that had been allowing only 227.2 yards a game.  </P> <P> Tailback Bobby Webster gained 142 yards in 30 carries and scored the go-ahead  touchdown on a two-yard run with 1 minute 11 seconds left.  </P> <P> The Vaqueros rushed for more than 300 yards against the Owls (8-3), who were  surrendering 90.2 rushing yards a game.  </P> <P> Glendale went undefeated after opening the season with losses to Pasadena and  Bakersfield.  </P> <P> "The great thing about it is they never stepped backward," Glendale Coach Jon  Cicuto said. "Coming in (to the bowl game) with a two-week layoff, I was  concerned our timing would be off, but they played hard and pretty  disciplined."  </P> <P> Forty Vaquero players will return next season. Off-season weight-training  workouts will begin next week.  </P> <P> "We have a pretty decent nucleus coming back but the key to our success will be  their work ethic in the off-season," Cicuto said.  </P> <P> Onward and upward: Several Glendale players will make recruiting trips to  four-year schools this weekend, Cicuto said.  </P> <P> Wide receiver David Nattoli and kicker Martin Boskovich will visit Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Wide receiver Cotie McMahon and tight end Greg Thompson are scheduled to fly to  Utah State and defensive back Derrick Mitchell and defensive lineman Keith  Poche are headed for Northern Arizona.  </P> <P> Offensive linemen Keith Moffet and Travis Peterson will visit San Jose State  next weekend.  </P> <P> Still hot: Former Franklin High quarterback Santiago Alvarez did not miss a  beat when he stepped up to the junior college level this season.  </P> <P> Alvarez, The Times' Glendale back of the year last season when he passed for a  state record 4,015 yards and 54 touchdowns, was the starting quarterback for  East Los Angeles College this season.  </P> <P> Alvarez was selected offensive player of the year in the Foothill Conference  after passing for 2,419 yards and 19 touchdowns for the Huskies, who finished  3-7.  </P> <P> Fast start: The La Canada High boys' basketball team got off to a strong start  by winning the Saugus tournament last weekend.  </P> <P> Sophomore center Richard Mandeville scored a game-high 19 points as the  Spartans defeated Camarillo, 63-54, for the championship.  </P> <P> Guard Jeff Lord averaged 22 points a game in the tournament and was named most  valuable player.  </P> <P> Awards time: The Glendale College men's basketball team won the consolation  championship of the Antelope Valley tournament last Friday to improve to 5-3.  </P> <P> Kelly Crosby scored 18 points for the Vaqueros and Enoch Mack added 15 points  and eight rebounds.  </P></p>

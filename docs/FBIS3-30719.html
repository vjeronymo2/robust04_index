Tudor's Slander"]    [Text] Messrs. Presidents, I feel most uncomfortable that  I have to draw your attention again to a fact that is absolutely  unqualifiable, but, given its profound implications on the  stability, functioning, and cohesion of the military institution  of our country, I am compelled to choose this way of notifying  you of it and finding a potential solution to this embarrassing  conflict.    As you know, for more than two months, I have become the  target of malicious attacks, expressed in an uncivilized  language. As you most probably have realized, I am talking  about the press campaign launched by Senator Corneliu Vadim  Tudor [Greater Romania Party president], in two publications  that he is sponsoring, the ROMANIA MARE [Greater Romania] and  the POLITICA.    The goal of these actions is obviously to distort the image  made about my person and to destroy the public credibility of  the minister of national defense. For this goal the entire  arsenal of disinformation technology has been made use of,  starting with lies and misinterpretations, and ending with  hilarious denigratory associations of ideas. In fact, it is no  secret that this was the major weapon that the sponsor of the  two publications -- who nowadays is not embarrassed to sign his  works with the title of SENATOR OF BUCHAREST [preceding three  words in capitals] -- used relentlessly for his own political  ascent.    As far as I am concerned, as a constant supporter of the  idea  of the political equidistance of the army, I should be  completely indifferent to the way in which he chooses to build  his own career. However, I cannot remain indifferent when these  perfidious attacks are directed against the person of the  minister of national defense because the implications are much  more serious. These types of actions are aimed at destroying  the element of TRUST IN OUR LEADERS, which is vital for the  military institution.    Therefore, Messrs. Presidents, I feel compelled to ask you  to  agree and be kind enough to convene the meeting of the  Commissions in charge of defense, public order, and national  security of the two chambers of the parliament, because I wish  to present these commissions with the necessary explanations for  the insinuations and slander directed against me.    I am requesting this because the core of the problem is the  fact that, respecting the provisions of the country's laws and  the military rules, I am "guilty" of not having satisfied an  absolutely unjustified claim or pressure of the senator;  however, such an act would have meant a serious violation of  certain rules stipulated in the Statute of Military Cadres and  the procedure of granting promotions to certain functions and  ranks in the Army.    With all the explanations I gave to Mr. Corneliu Vadim  Tudor,  in his capacity as senator -- although for two months I have  kept confidential that personal request, in order to avoid a  public scandal -- he continued the attack against my person, the  goal of his actions being to discredit me and to destroy the  image that our society, and not only that, has made about me  ever since I became the head of the Ministry of National Defense.    Taking into consideration that one of the first denigratory  articles that was published after 1 January 1994, was signed as  Senator of Bucharest, I addressed to the president of the Senate  an open letter requesting that the Legal Commission in charge of  appointments, discipline, immunity, and validations should be  notified about the attitude of Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor.    Given all the aforementioned considerations, including those  regarding the importance of the position of the ministry whose  head I am, I express my hope and my complete confidence that my  request will be adequately dealt with.    As far as my person is concerned, I am at the disposal of  the  commissions at any time their meeting is convened. I must also  mention that I also informed the president of Romania, the  Romanian Government, and the Supreme Military Council of the  Army about Vadim Tudor's actions.    Messrs. Presidents, please accept my profound respect for  the  constitutional institutions over which you preside and for you  personally.    Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu, Minister of National  Defense</p>

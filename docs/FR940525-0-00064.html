This rule establishes a limited entry program for the Hawaii longline fishery for pelagic species. The rule also includes broad framework procedures for more efficient administration of the fishery. The action is intended to improve the management of the longline fishery based in Hawaii to achieve optimum yield and prevent overfishing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  0001 hours Hawaii time, June 24, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Copies of the combined Amendment 7/Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS)/Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) are available from Ms. Kitty Simonds, Executive Director, Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), 1164 Bishop Street, suite 1405, Honolulu, HI 96813.

Conditions are now very different. The longline fishery based in Hawaii now consists of 167 vessels up to 101 ft (30.8 m) in length and targets swordfish, tuna, and other management unit species. Vessels often travel up to 2,000 miles (3,219 km) from port.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to the rapid growth of this fishery, concern was raised about the potential and actual impact of the expanded fishery on the status of some fish stocks, the impact of increased longline catches on other fisheries, and interactions between longline fishing and protected species such as Hawaiian monk seals and sea turtles. This led to establishment in April 1991 of a 3-year moratorium on new entry to the Hawaii longline fishery. Amendment 7 to the FMP establishes a new limited entry program for the Hawaii-based longline fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The limited entry program requires permits that will be freely transferable. Permit owners may upgrade their vessels or transfer their permits for registration with other vessels provided the newly designated vessel is no longer than 101 ft (30.8 m) in length as measured in accordance with the rule. Initial permit issuance decisions are made by the Fisheries Management Division, Southwest Region, NMFS. The program includes provision for appeals of permit decisions to the Regional Director, Southwest Region, NMFS (Regional Director). The rule includes broad framework procedures for subsequent adjustment of the conservation and management measures for the pelagics fisheries to provide for more efficient administration of the fisheries. Three species of fish are added to the management unit. The rule also makes several technical changes to the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A proposed rule to implement Amendment 7 to the FMP was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 24, 1994 (59 FR 9050). The proposed rule (1) described in detail the concerns being addressed by the Council and actions taken by the Council and Secretary to address those concerns, (2) summarized the measures proposed in Amendment 7 and the objectives of the amendment, and (3) indicated the reasons for other regulatory changes proposed. Those discussions will not be repeated here. After consideration of public comment on the Amendment and the proposed rule, Amendment 7 was approved; this final rule implements that amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule is consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), which requires that final rules be published not less than 30 days before they become effective. In the period between publication of the final rule and the effective date, NMFS will advise moratorium permit holders of the need to submit applications and supporting information in a timely manner so that new limited entry permits can be issued by the effective date of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments and Responses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments were received from, or on behalf of, 46 fishery participants, workers in support industries, and other interested parties. Most (40) favored approval of the amendment and the proposed rule. Four commenters recommended disapproval or partial disapproval of the amendment. Two commenters submitted technical comments concerning the language of the permit eligibility criteria. In the proposed rule, NMFS specifically invited comment on the adequacy of the proposed rule and complementary actions taken by the Council and NMFS to ensure that the take of sea turtles in the longline fishery would not be excessive. One set of comments was received in response. Summaries of comments and NMFS responses are provided below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1): Comments favoring the amendment were received from 40 people. Most of these were on petitions from workers in the longline fishery or support industries. The signers supported Amendment 7 because they felt it would provide stability, promote conservation, and provide vessel owners with flexibility needed to make sound business decisions. In addition, separate letters were received from seven permit holders supporting the amendment. They felt it would prevent overfishing and adverse impacts on other fisheries, would provide needed flexibility to vessel owners to make business decisions, and would maintain substantial economic benefits to the fishery participants and support industries. All commenters supporting the Amendment noted that existing area closures would be retained so that there should be no adverse effects on other fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1): None needed, Amendment 7 has been approved and is being implemented by this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2): One individual (an owner of several of the larger longline vessels with permits) recommended that the amendment be disapproved because the fishery is already showing signs of economic difficulty, with longer trips, smaller fish, and less profit. In the commenter's view, allowing further vessel upgrades would exacerbate the economic difficulties. The amendment also was criticized for allowing upgrading of smaller vessels while prohibiting upgrading of larger vessels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

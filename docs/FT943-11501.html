			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Mitsubishi may rescue trust bank Mitsubishi Bank, one of Japan's largest commercial banks, is considering measures to rescue Nippon Trust Bank, according to industry sources. The proposals under consideration are thought to include a takeover of the troubled trust bank. Mitsubishi currently owns 5 per cent of Nippon Trust, the maximum permitted by law, but in the last few years it has strengthened its links and last year installed one of its senior managing directors, Mr Tomoaki Hirano, as Nippon Trust's president. Nippon Trust is the smallest and weakest of the country's seven trust banks. The collapse of the Japanese property market in recent years has left it with a bad debt mountain. In the year to March its disclosed non-performing loans rose by 79 per cent, to Y131bn (Dollars 1.3bn), the largest increase among all Japan's leading banks. However, this figure does not include restructured loans, on which interest has been cut sharply to keep borrowers afloat. Analysts estimate the actual total of non-performing loans could be closer to Y190bn, more than 10 per cent of Nippon Trust's loan book. These non-performing assets represent 90 per cent of the trust bank's tier one capital. Worse still, unlike most Japanese banks it is unable to cover its potential loan losses by sales of equity holdings. Mr David Threadgold, banking analyst at BZW in Tokyo, estimates that the bank may have as little as Y30bn in such hidden equity gains, well short of its bad debt total. 'Without outside intervention, Nippon Trust has no obvious way to free itself from its overwhelming problem loans,' said Mr Threadgold. By contrast Mitsubishi Bank is one of the strongest of the country's 11 'city' (commercial) banks. It has estimated problem loans of just 3.6 per cent of total loans. Officials at Mitsubishi Bank and Nippon Trust yesterday denied that takeover plans had been agreed. However, industry sources said that Nippon Trust needed at least Y100bn in financial support. A takeover by Mitsubishi Bank would present a conundrum for the regulators, since it could breach ministry of finance (MoF) rules on the ownership of trust banks. Last year the MoF for the first time allowed city banks to establish trust bank subsidiaries. But the new rules prevent city banks from operating some of the most profitable elements of trust banking business, such as pension funds and loan trusts. The rules are designed to protect trust banks' key activities from incursions by the larger banks. If the MoF refused to allow Mitsubishi Bank to run the full range of trust banking activities, the merger would lose its appeal for the city bank, which might also then be reluctant to keep the bank afloat with loans. However, if the MoF allowed a full merger, other trust banks could be expected to object. The MoF would not comment yesterday, but if it is presented with a merger plan, analysts were agreed that it would probably approve it. 'Faced with the unattractive alternative of allowing a bank to fail,' said Mr Mark Faulkner, banking analyst at SG Warburg, 'the MoF will almost certainly prefer to allow a merger'.</p>

			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At a glance): Mortgage lending shows 16 per cent increase Building societies pledged Pounds 3.21bn in new mortgage lending last month, 16 per cent up on April. However, the Building Societies Association said that the figure was still below the Pounds 4.07bn lent in May last year. It warned that the increase in loan agreements did not show that a revival in the housing market was necessarily on the way. Mark Boleat, director-general of the association, said: 'The rise in net new commitments is encouraging. However, it is a small rise and the figures do not yet suggest a significant upturn in activity.' Last month was also poor for savings, with net receipts at Pounds 179m, down from Pounds 212m in April.</p>

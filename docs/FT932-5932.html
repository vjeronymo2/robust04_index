			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Shorter settlement period finds favour with firms THE EUROBOND market is preparing to move from a standard settlement period of seven days to one of two or three days for most trades. This followed a proposal by the board of the International Securities Market Association at its annual meeting on Friday in Copenhagen which found support among member firms of the Eurobond market's trade association. Mr John Dowsett, deputy chairman of ISMA's market practices committee, said the switch will not pose technological problems, since the settlement date on trades had never been automated. This is because in practice there is considerable variation in the time taken to settle Eurobonds. Many London-based houses already settle a large proportion of trades in two days, to tie in with the standard settlement period for many domestic government markets, money market instruments and foreign exchange transactions. The changeover is expected to generate savings for banks and securities houses and clearing houses. With shorter settlement banks will need to hold less capital in order to meet regulatory requirements. Shorter settlement will help reduce the level of systemic risk (the risk that the inability of one institution to meet its obligations when due will cause other institutions to fail) counterparty risk and market risk (by reducing the period of exposure to the client and the market). The number of failed trades should fall. According to ISMA members, some clients do not instruct the clearing systems until one or two days before settlement is due, so that any discrepancies do not come to light until the settlement date. 'With all my years in the business I have yet to make money from a trade dispute,' Mr Dowsett said. The only obvious losers will be the individual retail investors who like to hold physical certificates. These investors were once the bedrock of the Eurobond market, but the process of institutionalisation in the past 10 years means that this type of investor, commonly referred to in the market as 'the Belgian dentist', is now a dwindling force for most banks and securities houses. The pattern of investment in Switzerland, where many individual investors once bought small amounts of Eurobonds, has changed dramatically. In the past few years, most large Swiss banks have split their retail and institutional placement more strictly and are now channelling investors with relatively small amounts of savings into collective investments. The reason is simple: as bid/offer spreads in the Eurobond market declined, large banks and trading houses became unwilling to deal in small sizes. Only in Belgium and Luxembourg does pure retail business still represent a substantial portion of the market. However, representatives of Belgian banks at the ISMA meeting were placated by assurances that they would still be able to settle trades with retail investors on a seven-day basis. ISMA will now set up a taskforce to address the issue, consisting of regulators, fund managers, global custodians, and the two Eurobond clearing houses, Euroclear and Cedel, as well as ISMA representatives. The changeover could be as much as three years away, but 'a realistic timescale should allow implementation by January 1995,' said Mr Dowsett, who presented the proposal to ISMA member firms at the meeting. Before Friday's meeting, Mr John Langton, ISMA's chief executive, had warned: 'I believe that the change to shorter settlement periods will take place. Domestic markets are already moving to shorter cycles and I am convinced that if we do not drive the change in the international markets ourselves, then we will be driven by forces we are unable to influence.' Also at the ISMA meeting, the ISMA board announced a joint venture with the Amsterdam Stock Exchange (ASE), in the form of a new link between the two markets. A mutual line facility will allow direct confirmation of trades via TRAX, ISMA's trade-matching system, and access to bid-offer prices from the interdealer broker (IDB) in Amsterdam, which quotes prices in the market. In addition, the ASE will promote the use of Trax in The Netherlands for cross-border transactions. 'Because the (Dutch) market is such a liberal one, without restrictions on movement of capital into or out of the country, it makes an ideal environment for cross-border trading,' said Mr Roy Lambert, managing director of ISMA.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / IG Metall clouds Bonn's hopes for solidarity pact THE leadership of IG Metall, Germany's most influential trade union, yesterday refused further discussion of engineering employers' proposals to renegotiate pay deals in the east or revise agreements on shorter working hours in the west. The decision, taken at a board meeting, will cloud hopes for an historic 'solidarity pact' between government, employers and unions aimed at helping economic recovery in the former East Germany. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the engineering union president, said that if employers or government truly wanted to stop de-industrialisation in the east they should not argue with the union over pay restrictions. 'They must instead work with IG Metall to change economic and finance policy,' he said. If employers wanted to renegotiate existing pay and hours deals they would have to approach regional union branches. But, he stressed, 'IG Metall is not prepared to accept cuts in east German agreements'. Under existing deals, basic wages for mechanical and electrical engineers in the east are due to rise to match those in the west by April 1994. The working week in western Germany, now 37 hours, will be cut by an hour next year and fall to 35 hours in 1995. Employers in most industries, backed by the government, argue that a fundamental change of direction in pay and conditions agreements is essential if the east is to build firm economic foundations and if western industry is to remain competitive. Mr Steinkuhler recently raised expectations for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's proposed solidarity pact with a conditional offer to accept pay settlements for the next five years which covered only increases in inflation. However, the outright rejection of the employers' proposals on eastern pay and western hours demonstrates that union resistance to the establishment concept of 'solidarity' remains unaltered. IG Metall, with 4m members, traditionally sets the broad outlines of German union policy. West German inflation in October was revised down to 3.7 per cent from a provisional 3.8 per cent, according to the Federal Statistics Office. Output from German electrical and electronics factories fell by a real 4.3 per cent in the first nine months of this year, the ZVEI industry association said yesterday. Almost 20,000 jobs were lost, a record 50,000 workers were on short-time during October, and capacity utilisation fell from 84.5 per cent in January to less than 83 per cent. The industry could expect only a slight improvement next year, depending on recovery in export markets and tighter controls over costs.</p>

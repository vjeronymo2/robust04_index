			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Deutsche Bank Embarrassing though the Schneider affair is for Deutsche Bank, it is difficult to justify any serious impact on its share price. Yesterday the bank admitted the need for a few hundred million D-Marks in provisions. But provisions in 1993 were DM3.3bn and Deutsche warned in its final results statement that they would again be high this year. The Schneider failure does not materially alter expectations. Nor does it appear to signal a general deterioration of property market conditions which might engender further bankruptcies. Harder to quantify is the effect on the bank's image. There have been striking lapses of management in both the Schneider and the Metallgesellschaft cases. It will be awkward for Deutsche if either problem necessitates resignations at a senior level. Yet here again it is difficult to see financial implications. Arguably Deutsche's tarnished image might accelerate its disengagement from industry so that it would eventually face more competition in its home market. But that is a long term process and one that was already under way. There is thus every chance that Deutsche's shares will make up more of the ground lost since the Schneider affair broke. Whether they can manage a period of sustained out-performance is another matter, given the market's predilection for cyclical industrial stocks over interest-sensitive financials. That is a much weightier matter now the recovery looms and interest rates approach their floor.</p>

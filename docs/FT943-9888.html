			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / NKK sheds 1,300 jobs by transferring staff NKK, the loss-making Japanese steelmaker, announced yesterday it was shedding a further 1,300 jobs, but its workforce had no overt reason for despair. Japan's disavowal of compulsory redundancies means the cuts are to be made, apart from those who wish to retire, by transferring staff to affiliates or customers. When they get there, they will remain NKK employees and, their company assures them, will continue to draw their present salaries. They comprise technical workers and white-collar staff who, an NKK official said last night, need not worry about being forced into an inappropriate job. 'Accountants will be sent to accounting departments,' he averred. If the main disruption to their lives will be that the beige-clad office to which they bring their bento (lunchbox) each day is not the one they have previously known, their experience will be better than most have encountered. NKK stands to benefit from the secondment only because of the existence of a system, administered by the government but funded by the private sector, which for 20 years has helped smooth the paths of companies which fall on hard times. The employment adjustment subsidy scheme is due to pay out a record Y112.7bn (Pounds 727m) this year to employers in designated industries where sales have dropped from a year earlier. This allows them to take from the offshoot to which a worker is seconded whatever modest salary contribution is agreed, while a central pool pays the larger company up to two-thirds of the wage bill for staff members it has transferred. Hundreds of thousands of Japanese workers have been asked by their employers in the past two recession-hit years to bid farewell to colleagues with whom they have shared their midday rations of cold-rice-in-cardboard, and to learn the two-hour route to a different train station. The reach of the programme has been extended as the domestic economic downturn endures. It now covers more than a quarter of industrial categories recognised by the labour ministry, and the overall payout is more than 100 times the level of three years ago. Most employees who have undergone a transfer to a company with which their employer has a business relationship, however close, appear to find it less than edifying. A survey of 335 large and small companies, released last year, suggested that seven out of 10 secondees departed with no guarantee they would be able to return to their former workplace once conditions improved. At least eight in 10 such workers encountered poorer conditions, such as longer hours and a reduction in paid holidays, and fewer than a third were compensated for this by the parent company. A Kawasaki Steel executive has been quoted in Tokyo as saying: 'In general, affiliates don't have room to accept workers from their parent companies. We cannot count on them.' Nor, once they are sent there, can the new staff. One young computer scientist with a master's degree from the prestigious Tokyo University, who was hired by a steelmaker because it wanted to diversify into high technology, now finds himself unproductively pushing paper at a distant offshoot. He wryly recites his designated task: improving efficiency for the group.</p>

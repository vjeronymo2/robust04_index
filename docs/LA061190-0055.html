			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL WILL OPEN LIAISON OFFICE IN CHINA  </P> <P> Israel plans to open its first liaison office in Beijing this week as a  diplomatic beachhead, ending decades of estrangement with China, which  traditionally has supported Israel's enemies.  </P> <P> The office, operated by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities at a  foreign-managed hotel in downtown Beijing, will technically serve as a  clearinghouse for academic exchange between the two countries and will not have  official government status.  </P> <P> Israel and China have no diplomatic relations and are unlikely to establish  official ties in the foreseeable future. Beijing maintains strong political and  military ties with Arab nations and has steadfastly supported the Palestinian  cause.  </P> <P> Yet the liaison office, staffed by two Israeli science academy experts,  represents a watershed in a relationship that has been developing quietly in  recent years.  </P> <P> China's immediate interest is obtaining trade and technology from Israel.  </P></p>

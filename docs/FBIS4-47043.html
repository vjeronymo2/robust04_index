			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Denisov: "A. Sobchak to the Securities </F> Market: 'Regulate Yourselves!' A Regional Securities Commission  Has Been Created in St. Petersburg"]    [Text] Directive No. 317-R on the creation of the  Securities Commission under the St. Petersburg Government was  issued by Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak. According to this document,  the main purpose of the new organ will be to develop a system of  measures for regulating the securities market in St. Petersburg.  First Deputy Chairman of the Government Aleksandr Kudrin was  appointed chairman of the commission.    The commission includes professional participants in the  stock market and representatives of organs of executive power:  the Government of St. Petersburg, the Antimonopoly Committee,  the Main Administration of the Central Bank for St. Petersburg,  and the Committee on Administration of Property. The  participation of a representative of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service is also being discussed. But,  according to unofficial information, the Federal  Counterintelligence Service itself is unwilling to establish  this contact.    The Securities Commission will work in sections, each  handling "its own" segment of the stock market. General  leadership will be provided by a board that will include an  equal number of representatives of state organs and stock market  professionals.    The commission has been assigned the status of an advisory  organ, but its authority is fairly broad: It has the right to  organize inspections and bring in independent auditors; send  materials to law enforcement organs for investigation; and  publish prescriptions that are mandatory for execution by organs  of executive power.    The last shows how serious the need is for a normal,  civilized stock market. And not just in the northern capital.  Will others follow the St. Petersburg mayor who has made such a  radical decision? Or will St. Petersburg be a "separate" oasis  of civilization?    The commission is now in its organizational period. Its  structure, personnel, rights, and responsibilities are being  clarified. We suggest that readers of MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI be  kept informed of the work of the new organ.</p>

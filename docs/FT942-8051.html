			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Early cut likely in Commons hours A drastic reduction in the number of hours that parliament sits could be implemented within months amid signs that government and opposition business managers are set to make progress in talks on the issue. Concern over the heavy Commons workload on MPs, highlighted by the recent death of John Smith, the Labour leader, has injected an urgency into the approach of Conservative and Labour business managers towards the issue of restricting the Commons timetable. The issue will be discussed later this week at a meeting led by Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the House, and Mr Nick Brown, his acting counterpart, for Labour. Measures being considered include the conclusion of more Commons business by 10pm, the introduction of Wednesday morning sittings and the allocation of 10 free Fridays per year in which MPs could visit their constituencies. The government side will claim at this week's meeting that the measures could be introduced quickly through the Commons' standing orders rather than primary legislation. Labour business managers have also said they may be willing to give way on several demands from the government which are essential to any agreement for reducing the length of sittings. A senior Labour MP said the party would view favourably the request that more bills should be informally timetabled so that votes could be taken after a specified period. 'There is a willingness on our part to make reasonable arrangements,' he said. Progress could also be made to ensure that more bills are subjected to detailed examination in standing committees rather than on the floor of the Commons. Labour's front bench may find an agreement hard to sell to backbenchers after a row earlier this year over the guillotining of bills arising from the Budget. Labour introduced a period of non-co-operation with Tory whips in protest at the move. However, the government is keen to get an agreement on the Commons timetable, partly because it needs to improve the efficiency with which bills are considered. According to ministers, the amount of legislation proposed by Whitehall departments for next year's session is already three times greater than the parliamentary time available, and an agreement with Labour might allow more bills to be considered. Ministers are concerned that several bills due to be considered in the 1994-95 session - including the pensions bill - will weigh heavily on Commons time.</p>

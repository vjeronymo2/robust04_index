Two first class pilots from Holguin Airbase died in this  accident. They are: Major Sinecio Landa Lopez, married, and  father of two children, and Major Jose Borrego Pajon, also  married, who left a pregnant wife.    Both pilots are graduates from our aviation school in Pinar  del Rio in 1985 and 1986. They were 36 years old, militants of  the Cuban Communist Party, and both fulfilled internationalist  missions in Angola.    The Minfar has conveyed condolences to all relatives of  these  two courageous pilots who died in the fulfillment of their tasks.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ukolov, including statement by FITUR </F> Chairman Mikhail Shmakov, under the rubric "FITUR Position":  "Champagne for Three... The Skeptics Will Say `It Was That  Close'"]    [Text] Finally! After many assemblies and much  debate, members of the Russian Trilateral Commission signed the  General Agreement Between the All-Russian Trade Union and  Employer Associations and the Russian Federation Government for  1994. A cheerful atmosphere prevailed in the well-known building  at Old Square; in what has become a tradition, champagne was  served (for the third time).    Actually, there are enough reasons to be cautious in  evaluating the events, apart from the desire to malign and  "cloud." First, this fundamental document in the life of our  society was too long in coming. Given that it overflows with  phrases such as "prepare proposals" and "develop drafts," when  is its effect to be expected? Second, it is known that pickets  are posted in front of the White House continuously,  simultaneously with the meeting of the RTK [Russian Trilateral  Commission]: Nuclear industry workers take over from miners;  yesterday, textile industry personnel joined in, and  today--students. We must admit that there is a measure of  discord in this. Will the discord weaken or disappear? The  feeling is that the RTK aspires to this.    FITUR [Federation of the Independent Trade Unions of Russia]  Chairman Mikhail Shmakov, head of the trade union delegation  within the commission, stated this for RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA readers:    "The very fact that an agreement was signed is  positive: As the economic crisis continues to worsen and  passions in our society are seething, a step is being taken that  makes confrontation less likely and safeguards peace in our  house.    "Furthermore, we succeeded in incorporating into the  text of the General Agreement a sufficiently large number of the  proposals by trade unions which are designed to protect the  material interests of the working people. I will say right away  that this is not all we wanted, but rather the maximum of what  was possible in reaching a compromise. In particular, a  provision is included that did not exist before: Decisions to  use foreign labor in Russia will only be made with the findings  of associations of trade unions and employers taken into account.    "This is the wording of one of our main demands: 'A set  of measures shall be taken to provide coordinated regulation,  including by the state, and control over prices (rates) for  energy resources, individual socially significant foodstuffs  (regulated at the regional level), principal types of medicinal  preparations and drugs, the services of passenger and freight  transportation, communications, municipal and other services to  the population, and products (goods, services) of monopoly  enterprises.'    "The General Agreement includes a new section  concerning obligations of the parties with regard to social  security and social insurance which provides protection measures  for millions of working people: procedures for payment of  temporary disability benefits, preservation of the technical and  legal inspectorate of trade unions, as well as their certified  physicians, provision of reduced-price sanatorium vouchers for  low-income categories, and so on.    "We did not succeed in pushing through the demand to  bring the size of the minimum wage to 70 percent of the  subsistence minimum by the end of the year. (In the last  agreement, "to 50 percent" was laid down, but actually this  remained merely a benign wish.)    "However, as I see it, the main point is that  representatives of all the three parties are now proceeding in  the common direction--toward comprehensive cooperation."    Let us knock on wood at this point. At the same time, let us  recall (inappropriately?): "He is blessed who is a believer...."    Oh, I nearly forgot! As the first item, the RTK heard a  presentation by Deputy Minister of Railways I. Besedin  concerning a raise in railway rates. Valeriy Ochekurov (Trade  Union of Forest Rangers) asked him a question: "Can you bring  down prices for tickets following our discussion here, or have  we missed the train?" Besedin just threw up his hands, and  everybody felt somewhat awkward because of their tactless  colleague.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, May 4 (AFP) -- Hardline Palestinian groups  opposed to the Middle East peace process condemned the  Palestinian self-rule accord signed in Cairo Wednesday [4 May]  and vowed to continue the armed stuggle against Israel.    Damascus-based Palestinian groups described PLO chairman  Yasir 'Arafat as a "traitor" who had "sold out" the Palestinian  cause by signing the accord with Israel to launch self-rule in  the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    Meanwhile, Palestinian refugees voiced anger and bitterness,  saying the agreement ignored them, as it only provided for  limited self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.    The PLO's main rival in the occupied territories, the  Islamic  Resistance Movement, Hamas, said in a statement here the  Palestinian people were "not bound" by the agreement, and Hamas  would "continue struggling until all the occupiers leave the  occupied territories."    Palestinians in Lebanon's largest refugee camp, 'Ayn  al-Hulwah, set tyres ablaze and distributed leaflets denouncing  'Arafat as a traitor.    The Cairo signing marked "the downfall of the traitor  ('Arafat) and we all know the fate of traitors," said the  leaflets, signed by 10 Syrian-backed Palestinian groups.    Most of Lebanon's refugees came from areas that became part  of Israeli territory in 1948 and were not included in the deal.    In Syria's biggest refugee camp, al-Yarmuk near Damascus,  Bassam Raja, 35, asked "where is Palestine?" in the deal.    "'Arafat is just a paper president," he said. "I am a  stateless man whose dreams of return have been shattered."    In Jordan, home to most of the Palestinian refugees after  the  1967 war, the opinions among Palestinians were less hostile but  still marked by reservations.    "The deal is doomed to failure as it does not satisfy the  Palestinian aspiration for an independent state," said officials  in the al-Husayn camp in Amman, where 12,000 refugees live.    Amman newspapers however expressed hopes that the agreement  would mark a new era in Arab history.    Al-Dustur said the deal was "a turning point for the  Palestinians, who have paid a heavy price to recover their  legitimate national rights."    However, in Damascus al-Ba'th, the newspaper of Syria's  ruling party, condemned the deal, saying it "turns Gaza and  Jericho into a Zionist protectorate."    Syria, which boycotted the signing ceremony in Cairo, says  the agreement is a "separate deal" that violates Arab solidarity.    In Libya, the official news agency JANA said the agreement  was "an illusion," and again called on Arabs to "destroy the  imperialist and racist entity," a reference to Israel.</p>

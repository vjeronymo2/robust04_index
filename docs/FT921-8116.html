			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Damages claim is validly assigned LINDEN GARDEN TRUST LTD v LENESTA SLUDGE DISPOSALS LTD AND OTHERS ST MARTINS PROPERTY CORPORATION LTD AND ANOTHER v SIR ROBERT McALPINE &amp; SONS LTD Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Nourse, Lord Justice Staughton and Sir Michael Kerr): February 13 1992 A PROHIBITION on assignment by an employer of 'this contract' without the contractor's consent under the JCT form of building contract invalidates assignment of the benefit of the contract without consent, but does not prevent assignment of non-personal rights arising under the contract, including accrued rights to substantial damages for defective work. The assignee can therefore claim for causes of action arising before assignment, including those in respect of which the assignee himself suffered loss after assignment, irrespective of whether the assignor transferred his proprietary interest in the premises before assigning his rights under the contract. But if the assignment is ineffective in that no assignable rights have accrued by assignment date, the assignor is entitled to damages as against the contractor for loss incurred by the need to indemnify the assignee for expenses paid in respect of the contractor's breach. The Court of Appeal so held when allowing consecutive appeals from decisions by Judge John Lloyd QC and Judge Bowsher QC respectively, on preliminary issues in actions by Linden Garden Trust Ltd against building contractors Lenesta Sludge Disposals Ltd, Mc Laughlin &amp; Harvey plc and Ashwell Construction Co Ltd; and by St Martins Property Corporation Ltd against contractors Sir Robert McAlpine &amp; Sons Ltd. An appeal by the second plaintiffs in the second action, St Martins Property Investments Ltd, was dismissed. LORD JUSTICE STAUGHTON said that in both the Linden and the St Martins cases, building works were carried out under a contract with somebody who had a proprietary interest in the building when the contract was made. The original employers transferred their interest in the building to others, and also purported to assign the building contracts. The contracts, on standard Joint Contracts Tribunal (JCT) forms, contained a term in clause 17 that the employers would not assign 'this contract' without the contractor's consent. Consent was never obtained. In the Linden case only Linden as assignees sued. In the St Martins case both the assignors (Corporation) and the assignees (Investments) were plaintiffs. In both cases preliminary issues were tried. In the Linden case Judge John Lloyd QC held that Linden as assignee was entitled to recover damages for loss incurred by the assignors prior to assignment, but not for loss incurred by Linden subsequent to assignment. In the St Martins case Judge Bowsher QC held there was no valid assignment of the benefit of the contract; and that neither the assignor nor assignee had a valid claim for damages, other than nominal damages. The plaintiffs in both cases appealed. It was necessary to distinguish between novation, assignment and sub-contracting. (a) Novation was the process by which a contract between A and B was transformed into a contract between A and C. It could only be achieved by agreement between all three. (b) Assignment was the transfer from B to C of the benefit of obligations A owed to B. (c) Subcontracting had been called vicarious performance. In clause 17 'assign this contract' prohibited vicarious performance without consent, but did not prohibit assignment by the employers of the benefit of the contract, or part of it. Where a plaintiff's initial loss had subsequently been made good by someone other than himself, the general rule was that he could recover only nominal damages. But there were exceptions. In the case of damage to a building which was later sold, there was no rule of law that the damages must necessarily be nominal. In the Linden case the assignors had an accrued cause of action against contractors for Pounds 22,205 by assignment date on January 14 1987. That claim was validly assigned. Further breaches were later discovered, giving rise to Pounds 236,000 loss. The assignors acquired a cause of action in respect of those defects dating from 1980 and 1985. After assignment Linden became entitled to enforce the claim. It was immaterial that it subsequently incurred the expense of remedial work. In the St Martins case, on March 25 1976, when Corporation executed an assignment in favour of Investments, there was no existing cause of action. Corporation, by the assignment, transferred to Investments the contractual right to have the building properly constructed. Investments could sue for breach. On the hypothesis that Investment's claim failed, it seemed to have been fairly within the contractors' contemplation that if they failed to construct the building properly that would cause loss to Corporation. By that route, substantial damages would be recovered by Corporation. It made no practical difference which of the two companies succeeded, and since Lord Justice Nourse and Sir Michael Kerr considered it was Corporation's appeal which should succeed, his Lordship did not dissent from an order to that effect. SIR MICHAEL KERR said to speak of 'assigning a contract' was strictly a misnomer since contractual obligations could not be assigned in the sense of parting with the burden of performance, without the other party's consent. An 'assignment of a contract' could only take place as a novation. Assignment of a right to call for performance of an obligation was permissible in relation to a non-personal contract which contained no prohibition against assignment. Building contracts might or might not be personal. In the present case the question was conclusively resolved by express provision precluding assignment of 'this contract' without consent. The benefit of the contracts in the sense of right to call for performance was therefore not assignable. However, on their true construction, the contracts did not preclude assignment of benefits arising under the contracts. There was no reason why prohibition against assignment of 'this contract' should preclude assignment of damages claims. In the Linden case the breaches took place before assignment. The prohibition against assignment did not prevent assignment of the accrued claim for damages. To that extent the assignment was effective. It made no difference that the assignors had transferred the premises before assigning their rights under the contract. They retained their rights against the defendants and could assign them later. There was no problem about Linden's right to recover Pounds 22,205 spent by the assignors in remedying the original breach. But Linden were also prima facie entitled to recover Pounds 236,000 they themselves spent in remedying other breaches committed prior to assignment. Linden's appeal should be allowed. In the St Martins case at time of assignment no breach had accrued and no cause of action had vested in Corporation. Corporation therefore had nothing to assign other than the benefit of the contract, ie, the right to have the contract performed or - loosely speaking - the contract itself. The express prohibition against assignment precluded such assignment without consent. The assignment was invalid. Investment's appeal should be dismissed. Corporation remained the contracting party vis-a-vis the contractors, with their rights unimpaired. But, it was said, they could only recover nominal damages. That was not correct. Corporation had suffered loss because they were liable to indemnify Investments for Pounds 850,000 spent by Investments in remedying the damage caused by the contractors' breach. If the breach had not occurred no loss would have been suffered by anyone. Corporation's appeal was allowed. LORD JUSTICE NOURSE agreed with Lord Justice Staughton, but on the one point of difference, relating to validity of the St Martins assignment, he agreed with Sir Michael Kerr. For Linden: Anthony Speaight (Jaques &amp; Lewis). For McLaughlin: Justin Fenwick (Masons). For Ashwell: Ellis Meyer (Portner and Jaskel). For Corporation and Investments: Humphrey Lloyd QC and David Westcott (Stephenson Harwood). For McAlpine: Richard Fernyhough QC and Marcus Taverner (Glovers). Lenesta Sludge were not represented.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> FUND TO HELP MAN WHO LOST HIS FEET  </P> <P> Friends of a man whose feet were severed in a train accident in Simi Valley are  establishing a $10,000 medical fund to buy artificial limbs.  </P> <P> Don Swanson, a friend of accident victim Steven Frye Jr., said the  23-year-old's medical insurance does not cover the cost of special limbs that  would allow Frye to continue athletics.  </P> <P> Frye has been recovering from injuries he suffered Sept. 4 when he was struck  by a Southern Pacific Railroad train while bicycling in the Santa Susana tunnel  near Simi Valley.  </P> <P> Before the accident, Frye worked in the accounting department of Farmers  Insurance and is planning to return after his recovery, Susie Frye, his  stepmother, said.  </P> <P> Frye has already undergone extensive surgery and faces more, Swanson said.  Organizers have raised about $4,500 for the purchase of two flexible artificial  feet.  </P> <P> Friends will hold a benefit golf tournament Nov. 19 at Sunset Hills Country  Club in Thousand Oaks. Organizers are asking for $300 donations to participate  in the tournament and luncheon. Donors who do not intend to golf can donate  $225, with all the money going to the family.

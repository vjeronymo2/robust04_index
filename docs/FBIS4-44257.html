			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Hard Slog in Russia"] </F>   [Text] The government of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin is making  an unexpectedly valiant effort to stabilise the Russian economy.  But the effort could easily fail and does, in any case, still  fall far short of true stabilisation. If Mr Chernomyrdin is  indeed a man with whom the West can do business, it makes sense  to do the decisive business now. To wait may be to lose the  opportunity.    As former head of a large Soviet gas enterprise, Gasprom, Mr  Chernomyrdin has the political clout lacked by the younger  reformers, Mr Yegor Gaydar and Mr Boris Fedorov. What he lacked  was their understanding. But he does seem to have come a long  way, particularly for someone who proclaimed early this year  that the era of "market romanticism" was over. It was he, after  all, who wrote in the FT [FINANCIAl TIMES] last month that "it  is vitally important that every member of the Russian Government  fully understands that a strong ruble is the indispensable  condition for the revival of the Russian economy, and the  Russian state as a whole."    So far has the government come that Mr Michel Camdessus,  managing director of the International Monetary Fund, was  persuaded in March to advance the $1.5bn second tranche of the  systemic transformation facility. Negligible in itself, this  sum was an important sign of confidence in the Russian  Government. Nor has that confidence appeared misplaced.  Monetary policy has been tight, while inflation has been kept  down -- to just 6.8 per cent in May, following 10 per cent a  month between February and April.    Unfortunately, partly because of a 25 per cent decline in  industrial output since last year, government figures show tax  collection 15 per cent below budget in the first quarter. The  deficit has been kept under control mainly by non-payment of  spending obligations, measures that are neither desirable nor  sustainable in the long term. Meanwhile, there are strong  pressures for more spending from lobbies for the military, the  military- industrial complex, agricultural interests (strongly  represented in the Duma) and the northern territories.    The limited success so far may well not last. But it would  not be good enough, even if it were to. Output has already  fallen so far that successful stabilisation might bring a strong  turnround in the economy next year. But first there needs to be  not just a prolongation of the present long drawn out squeeze,  but a serious effort to break inflationary expectations.    What is needed, in fact, is true stabilisation. That could  be achieved through a programme to peg the exchange rate,  combined with elimination of inflationary financing of the  budget deficit. More funding would be needed than is now  available. Much of it could be raised domestically, some in  higher domestic revenue and some in domestic borrowing, but a  precondition would be more Western finance. Some 4-5 per cent  of Russian gross domestic product in external assistance, for  two or three years, might do the trick. The bill for the West  would be perhaps $14bn a year.    Judged by aid budgets this is a large sum. Judged by the  more relevant standard of military spending, it is small. What  needs to be understood is that Russia is not merely an aid  problem. Stabilising its economy offers probably the most  significant current opportunity to make the world a better  place. Mr Chernomyrdin's determination offers the West yet  another chance to help, but it may not last. While such an  opportunity may come again, it would be sheer folly for Western  leaders to act on that assumption.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo -- Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf said  yesterday that he might support Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos  Magalhaes' presidential candidacy, but only after advising that  he himself had not yet given up on his own candidacy. Maluf  imposed a condition for his possible support for the governor's  candidacy: that it result from a consensus between parties like  Magalhaes' PFL [Liberal Front Party], Maluf's PPR [Progressive  Renewal Party], and some other ticket.    He said: "Governor Antonio Carlos is a good candidate. I  could support him if he were the consensus candidate for the  PFL, the PPR, and the PP [Popular Party]. I am not a candidate  myself, but I have not renounced my candidacy."    In his opinion the main point is that the candidate for  president should be chosen by an alliance of several parties.  Maluf disclosed that for more than 3 months he has been talking  with leaders of several parties in an attempt to build such a  union. In addition to his own candidacy and to that of the  Bahia governor, Maluf includes the following leaders in the list  of possible PFL presidential candidates: ex-Minister Jorge  Bornhausen, Pernambuco Senator Marco Maciel, his fellow party  member and Para Senator Jarbas Passarinho, and PP President  Alvaro Dias.    He said: "If we can make a consensus decision in March, why  should we make it in February? In politics, agreements are  announced only after they have been reached."    Maluf said he liked the idea of PMDB [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party] Senator for Rio Grande do Sul Pedro Simon, the  government leader in the Senate, making an alliance between the  PMDB, PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], PDT [Democratic  Labor Party], and PTB [Brazilian Labor Party]. He disagrees,  however, that the objective of the coalition should be to find a  candidate to oppose the candidacy of PT [Workers Party]  President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva.    "It should be an alliance for Brazil," he said.    As he usually does, however, Maluf did not lose the  opportunity to criticize Lula. He reiterated that the PT  candidate does not have enough experience to govern the country,  noting that he, Maluf, "would not vote even for his own brother  if he were to be a beginner at Planalto Palace."    Maluf did not spare criticism of Itamar Franco, either,  saying that the president "has neither a liking for nor devotion  to power," while complaining about the government's delay in  designating the new cabinet:    "We have been without a government for 60 days and, worst of  all, no one has realized this."    Maluf charged Itamar Franco with having no political will to  enforce an economic plan that can curb inflation. He said the  fiscal adjustment proposed by the government is not sufficient  for reducing the cost of living, and that the government must  cut spending.    "Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's main adversary  is the government itself," he said.</p>

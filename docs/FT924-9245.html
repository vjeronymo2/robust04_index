			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Letter: Competition essential A practice is developing among the water, electricity, telecommunications and gas companies which is having a significant effect on the construction and engineering consultancy services in the UK. These monopolies are buying small and medium-size contractors and consultancies and are carrying out an ever-increasing proportion of such work in-house. This is inefficient and the effects of it are passed on to the consumer, undetected by the watchdogs. I believe the utilities should be prohibited from acting as contractors and consultants for engineering services needed in the upgrading, modernisation and installation of their facilities. They should rely on a clear, defined procedure of open market competition. F Bizzari, managing director, Lilley International, PO Box 5242, Dubai, United Arab Emirates</p>

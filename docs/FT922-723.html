			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tension clouds Ulster talks SIR PATRICK Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, betrayed a growing tension yesterday between the UK and Irish Republic over the 'round table' talks on the province's future. He expressed 'disappointment' at the delaying of a meeting expected this week between the two governments. But Sir Patrick told MPs that the time was not yet right for separate negotiations planned between London and Dublin and Northern Ireland's Unionist and nationalist politicians - a series of meetings that Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, argues should have begun already. The two ministers have not spoken since Monday. The atmosphere of distrust may persuade Sir Patrick that early suspension of the talks process may offer the best way of ensuring it can be resumed later. The end of July has been set as the cut-off point. Unionists are putting an increasing emphasis on the meeting between the two governments - the 'third strand' of the talks process - where they hope Dublin's constitutional claim on Northern Ireland will be discussed. The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party fears that Sir Patrick is making too many concessions to the Unionists and reneging on his commitment to start talks on relations between north and south Ireland within weeks of the talks process beginning.</p>

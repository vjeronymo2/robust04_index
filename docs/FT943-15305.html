			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Arts: The haunting magic of a Russian masterpiece - Comedy and irony prevail in the National Theatre's new production of 'The Seagull' Chekhov has become a playwright whom other playwrights like to set in versions of their own, much as poets do with those of Racine. You can see or read Brian Friel's Chekhov, Trevor Griffiths's, David Mamet's, Ronald Harwood's, and (pre-eminently) Michael Frayn's, as you can see or read Robert Lowell's Racine, Douglas Dunn's, Richard Wilbur's, Craig Raine's. Recently, the National Theatre has started to give us Pam Gems's Chekhov: first in the 1992 Uncle Vanya, and now in The Seagull. (Her Chekhov career began in 1982, with The Cherry Orchard, for Leicester.) Like Griffiths and Mamet, she does not come to Chekhov by way of having learnt Russian, but by way of someone else's literal translation. She attends, in particular, to directness of speech; and to hell with precision. Where Constance Garnett (1920s) has Trigorin say 'And when I die my friends, passing by my grave, will say, 'Here lies Trigorin . . . '' and Frayn (1978) has '. . . and when I'm dead my friends will say as they pass my grave: 'There lies Trigorin . . .'', Gems has 'On my gravestone: 'Here lies Trigorin . . . '' Snappy, but not actually correct. Characterisation is vital, writes Gems, but would Arkadina really call Nina 'darling'? Arkadina is an actress, sure, but hers is not mere luvvy-speak. In Garnett, it is 'my dear', in Frayn 'my sweet': both of which catch nicely Arkadina's affectionate but distant condescension. Well, there is nothing so wrong with these details that a good production cannot correct. (The 1992 Vanya was first-rate.) The director on this occasion is John Caird. With excellent actors, he gives us a Seagull that is funny, truthful, interesting, but sometimes lightweight. There are details in the play that have not yet acquired enough impact - there seem to be too few pauses, too few moments when we are aware of life offstage - and too much happens on the stage's centre-line. His two most curiously ponderous strokes are to make the characters all walk around the stage, in separate orbits, before and after the action (which tells us 'All these different people - only think how Chekhov interconnects them]') and to spotlight, at the end, the stuffed seagull (which tells us 'Think About This Ambiguous Symbol Before You Leave'). But Chekhov was not a symbolist, and he is ironic about the way that his young characters Konstantin and Nina employ the symbolism of the seagull. Nonetheless, much in this Seagull is fresh. Caird makes it a play of impulsive women and weak men: Edward Petherbridge, marvellously playing Dorn as a quietly elegant spectator, is forever having people throw their arms round him; and there is a very revealing touch early on when Nina throws her arms round Konstantin's neck and kisses him - and, even though it is he who is in love with her, he is not assertive enough to hold her, and he keeps his hands hovering just off her waist. I have never been so constantly aware of the irony of the A-loves-B-who-loves-C-who-loves-D-who-loves-E (through to H) structure of this play, nor of the fact that Masha, in marrying a man she does not care for while loving another, is repeating her mother Polina's story. The most interestingly re-thought characterisation comes from Bill Nighy, who plays the writer Trigorin as a man of remarkable diffidence and restless nervousness. Almost too restless to keep one's mind on in Act Two, but revealing the character's passivity. Nina rushes at him, Arkadina engulfs him; he is their amorous pawn for a while - and then he retreats to his writer's notebook. Judi Dench plays the dominating Arkadina to brilliantly funny, absurd effect; and I love her daring in showing the character's most odious, selfish side from the very first. Her hilarious masterstroke comes in pulling Trigorin to the floor in Act Three and making love to him while praising his literary skills. 'Impossible to read you without delight,' she says, lying on top of him and covering him with kisses. The flattered author and the selfish seductress achieve their horizontal climax: whereupon she, the cat who got the cream, says slyly 'He's mine' - and he scribbles some more notes. Chekhov called it a comedy, and Dench helps him out wonderfully. (Just see her doing a little run across the stage like a 15-year-old and then turning to enjoy her effect on her audience. And watch her re-bandaging her son Konstantin's head: she makes the little practical issues, like the inconvenient placing of his hands and the scissors, unforgettably funny.) Those of us who, perhaps wrongly, love Chekhov as a master of tragicomedy may perhaps miss some of Arkadina's anguish - the violence of her changes of mood with her son Konstantin, and the despair with which she reclaims Trigorin. More crucially, we may find the anguish of Konstantin, who is played by Alex Cox, only intermittently absorbing here. Cox is half so interestingly Oedipal and intense that you wonder why the other half pales away. Helen McCrory, as Nina, never pales away for a moment. She is all impulsive radiance, and her every entrance sets the play's temperature jumping. But, again, the character's pain makes too little effect, and her rapid changes of thought in her near-delirium in Act Four are not arresting. I could not always believe in the moonlike starings of Rachel Power as Masha, but everything in Anna Calder-Marshall's account of her mother Polina is revealing. Most perfectly among the whole cast, she catches the compulsive self-contradictions of which Chekhov's characters are made: especially when she admires the flowers Nina has just given Dorn, suddenly insists he gives them to her, and then rips them apart. Norman Rodway's characterisation of Sorin is too stagey, but Robert Demeger has just the right gaucherie for Shamrayev. Opening night had its technical trauma, with two huge frame sets that hung perilously in mid-air, failing to ascend and descend for ten minutes. But John Gunter's decor offers us enough lovely realism without swarming detail. Dominic Muldowney's music consists mainly of a rather fine valse triste. In Act Four, Konstantin is heard playing this on the piano offstage; and Masha and Polina - daughter and mother briefly united in sympathy as unhappy wives and lovers - start to waltz, the vodka glasses still in their hands. Here is the true Chekhovian magic. No modern playwright is more haunting. In repertory at the Olivier Theatre</p>

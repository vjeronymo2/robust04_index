			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Ofgas is suspected as source of smear The search for the source of a smear campaign against Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of the gas regulator Ofgas, has shifted to the organisation itself. Suspicion that a disgruntled Ofgas official may be to blame comes after press reports alleging that Ms Spottiswoode was having an affair with Mr John Michell, a senior official of the Department of Trade and Industry who helped select her. The DTI investigated the allegations and said it had found no substance to support them. There was speculation this week about the source of the campaign to undermine Ms Spottiswoode in the run-up to her appearance on Wednesday before the Commons committee on the environment. Suspicion had fallen on those upset by her opposition to passing on to gas consumers the cost of conservation projects promoted by the Energy Savings Trust. There was also speculation that parts of the gas industry, including some 'old guard' elements of British Gas, could have been involved. But Ofgas officials now believe that the most damaging allegations are likely to have come from a member of the Ofgas staff. 'We are trying to find out who has been leaking all this stuff. It's really unfortunate but we think it's come from within Ofgas,' said one official. Ms Spottiswoode, who took over from Sir James McKinnon last November, has replaced his combative, adversarial approach to British Gas with a more measured line. Ofgas officials who were particularly close to Sir James are thought to be unhappy with the change in emphasis. They are also likely to have reacted badly to Ms Spottiswoode's now withdrawn allegation that Sir James acted illegally in implementing schemes connected to the trust. Ofgas officials say no formal inquiry is yet under way.</p>

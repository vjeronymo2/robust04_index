			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar slips lower The dollar fell back on foreign exchanges yesterday as the weekend G7 meeting failed to produce any statement supportive of the currency, writes Philip Gawith. The flip side of dollar weakness was D-Mark strength and the German currency finished stronger across the board. In London the dollar closed at DM1.6794 against the D-Mark from DM1.6947 on Friday. The D-Mark was helped by comments from a Bundesbank council member cautioning that German interest rates might not fall as fast as some countries wanted. Sterling also suffered at the hands of the stronger D-Mark, closing at DM2.5049 from DM2.517 on Friday. It was slightly firmer against the dollar, finishing at Dollars 1.4916 from Dollars 1.4853. The sterling index closed at 79.9, from 80. Although Japanese officials made clear at the G7 meeting that they were unhappy with the level of the yen, many analysts believe that the US administration is satisfied with the current exchange rate. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said some members of the Clinton administration appeared to believe that they had Japan on the ropes - 'that if you squeeze them so hard they have to open their markets finally.' He said it was arguable that Japanese economic recovery was not possible at the current exchange rate, while if the dollar fell below Y100, this was 'armageddon'. There was little market response yesterday to the confirmation of Mr Tsutomu Hata as the new prime minister. The yen finished at Y103.225 from Y103.650. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said this was because Mr Hata's premiership was unlikely to impact on economic policy or the trade dispute, nor resolve political uncertainty. Mr Chertkow, however, predicted that Mr Hata would try to placate the US by enshrining the 1994/5 budget cuts as permanent, while the Bank of Japan would support this fiscal stimulus by cutting rates again. He added that if the economy did not recover, Mr Hata's coalition government would be unlikely to survive. Mr Lyons said the yen/dollar rate might remain in the spotlight ahead of the golden week holiday which starts on Friday in Japan, and lasts most of the following week. The UBS analyst said the US/Japan trade dispute 'continues to cast a pall over the dollar generally.' Having fallen below DM1.6840 against the dollar the US currency is next expected to test the DM1.6650 level. A number of other factors weighed on the US currency. One, according to Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, was a delayed response to Friday's appointment of two new Fed board members. The market believes this will give the Fed a more doveish flavour, and hence slow the rate of monetary tightening. Another was the general firming of European interest rates. This is the result of more bullish economic forecasts emerging from Germany, which has encouraged a bearish tone in German interest rate markets. This was evident in the futures markets, with the June euromark contract settling three basis points lower at 94.72. The back-end contracts lost more ground, with the December 1995 contract losing 20 basis points. Traders stressed, however, that these movements in the longer contracts were deceptive as most of the trade was amongst locals. Lack of liquidity also made the contracts susceptible to manipulation. Weakness at the short end of the yield curve is also a spillover from the longer end, where sentiment in bund futures has soured. The fall in euromark futures was reflected in short sterling futures. The June contract finished six points down at 94.57. Markets are now discounting mid-year short term interest rates  1/2 of a percentage point higher than in January. The longer contracts dropped further, with the December future finishing 16 basis points worse at 93.78. In the money market, the Bank of England provided late assistance of about Pounds 225m. Earlier the Bank had provided Pounds 727m liquidity compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 950m. Overnight money traded in the 4 1/4 per cent-5 3/4 per cent range. Sterling was unaffected by the GDP and trade data released. Preliminary first quarter GDP growth was 0.7 per cent, quarter on quarter, in line with market estimates. The non-EU trade deficit for March was Pounds 675m, compared with February's revised Pounds 640m. The D-Mark finished higher across the board in Europe. It closed at L957.7 against the Italian lira, from L956.7, and Pta81.52 from Pta81.37 against the Spanish peseta. The French franc fell below its old ERM floor again to finish at FFr3.435 from FFr3.427. Analysts said market sentiment was turning against the franc owing to the Bank of France's tardy pace of monetary easing. The issue will acquire fresh relevance when new unemployment figures are released on Friday.</p>

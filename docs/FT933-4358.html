			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Not just a question of price - Guy de Jonquieres examines the demand for better value Branded consumer goods manufacturers would do better to meet shoppers' growing demands for better value for money by improving product quality and service, rather than simply cutting prices, according to the Henley Centre*, a UK market research company. The company says opinion surveys for the latest edition of Frontiers, its annual study of European consumer markets, have found that while recession has made low price a more important issue for some consumers, for most it is still far from the overriding consideration. Indeed, in Britain, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, fewer consumers than two years ago said they always looked for the cheapest products. The only exception to the trend was Germany - particularly the eastern part of the country. However, European consumers are also becoming more insistent on getting what they pay for. Fewer than in 1989 - at the peak of the economic boom - said they believed that highest price equalled highest quality. This shift in perceptions was most pronounced in relation to cosmetics, and smallest in relation to wine, spirits and furniture. As these examples suggest, judgments on what constitutes good value differ widely, depending on the type of product in question. For instance, almost three quarters of consumers named lower prices as the best way of improving the value for money of clothing. But fewer than a third said the same of food, with twice as many saying what they most wanted were products containing more natural ingredients. But the Henley Centre says the biggest challenge confronting European consumer goods manufacturers in the value-conscious 1990s is the growing popularity of retailers' own-brand products. Increasingly, European consumers prefer supermarkets' own-brand lines not only because they are cheaper than manufacturer brands, but also because they are perceived to offer equal or superior quality. 'The key point is that the 'best' brands are now often the retailer ones,' the Henley Centre says. The most striking evidence of this trend is provided by a survey of customers of Albert Heijn, the leading Dutch supermarket, who were asked to compare the retailer's own-brand products with those of Nestle of Switzerland, the world's largest food manufacturer. On all the criteria chosen - which included trustworthiness, product innovation and packaging, as well as price - Albert Heijn was rated far ahead of Nestle. The retailer's biggest perceived advantage was in caring about its customers. The Henley Centre concludes consumer manufacturers need to respond to these challenges by working harder to improve the performance and functional qualities of products and relying less on pure imagery to sell them. They also need to find new ways to communicate directly with consumers which do not involve going through retailers. In particular, they should put more emphasis on loyalty programmes, after-sales support and service. *Henley Centre, 9 Bridewell Place, London EC4V 6AY. Tel: 071-353 9961.</p>

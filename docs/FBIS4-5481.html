			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "News 7" program] </F>   [Text] ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and Director  General Hans Blix of the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] secretly met today in a hotel near Narita Airport in  Tokyo, and discussed the issue of the DPRK's, or North Korea's,  nuclear facilities.    Foreign Minister Han landed at Narita Airport today, one day  earlier than the scheduled stopover for his week-long visit to  Russia, to meet Director General Blix, who had just arrived in  Tokyo to attend an international conference.    The meeting was not opened to the press in view of North  Korea's intensified criticism of the IAEA policies. The topics  for discussion at the meeting are unknown, but it is believed  that the two leaders discussed such issues as results of the  IAEA inspections in North Korea last month and possibilities of  North Korea's acceptance of the IAEA inspections in the future.    [Begin Blix recording] We talked about the need for the  IAEA's early completion of inspections in the regions resisting  them. [end recording]    Concerning the question of North Korea's nuclear development  program, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry is scheduled to  visit Japan and the ROK next week. Nations concerned including  Japan, have begun to move actively in preparation for the UN  Security Council session in early May.</p>

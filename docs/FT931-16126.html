			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Burton aims for more responsive organisation LESS THAN a year after taking over, Burton's chief executive has grasped the nettle and announced sweeping structural changes throughout the group's 10 trading divisions. Mr John Hoerner, the American who took over last February, launched a rationalisation programme involving the loss of nearly 2,000 full-time jobs, but the creation of up to 3,000 part-time ones. The programme - the result of a six-month review carried out in conjunction with PA Consulting Group - is likely to cost between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m, but achieve savings of a similar size this year. Analysts welcomed the changes. Mr Nick Hawkins, of Kleinwort Benson, said they were long overdue. 'The new management is taking an organisation which is heavily bureaucratic and making it more responsive to the market place. 'The important thing is that after dealing with operational issues last year they are now tackling the structural issues.' The group stressed that the programme was not just about redundancies, but included other organisational changes necessary to cut staff and management costs. These were higher as a percentage of turnover than in comparable retail companies. Staff employed in head office functions are to be reduced by 933 - roughly one in four. The shake-up includes the resignation of two board members. Mr Geoff Powell is replaced as operations director by Mr Graham White, and Mr John Davies is replaced as company secretary by Mr Ian Jackman. Burton said this reflected the 'top-to-bottom' nature of the changes. Mr Hoerner said buying and merchandising operations would be split into two separate functions. Reports that were previously prepared on an ad hoc basis would be computerised and standardised. Savings would also be achieved in the finance sector through computerisation and centralising accounting functions into centres in Leeds and Taunton. In the shops, about 1,000 full-time jobs will be lost. But up to 3,000 part-time jobs will be created. Mr Hoerner said most savings would be achieved by scheduling employees to work at the busiest shopping times, achieving better service at a lower percentage cost. Workers reducing their hours from, say, 36 to 28 a week, would receive a higher hourly rate that would go some way towards compensating them for the lost time.</p>

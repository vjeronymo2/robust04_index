			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Exchange acts to lift share liquidity THE LONDON Stock Exchange said that, from yesterday, trading prices for smaller stocks will be more widely disseminated in an effort to increase liquidity in less liquid issues. The trading prices are for about 160 shares with only one registered marketmaker or with no marketmaker and for which bargains must be transacted through matching offers posted on the Stock Exchange Alternative Trading Service (Seats). Marketmakers have increasingly withdrawn their services from smaller capitalised companies with shares traded on the exchange, greatly diminishing liquidity for investors. Since last November the exchange has been operating its Seats system with price transparency - the last price at which a share was traded - available only through its Topic screen. From yesterday the exchange is making bargains in less liquid stocks available to information vendors such as Reuters and Bloomberg at no additional charge. Those information providers already sell exchange share price information to users who do not have the Topic screen. The service should make access to price quotes available to investors outside the UK who would not normally have access to the Topic screen. The improved service was developed by the London Stock Exchange in conjunction with Andersen Consulting.</p>

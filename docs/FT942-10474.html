			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (9): Brooke Bond's lasting brew The changes in the Kenyan economy during the past two years have been good news for Brooke Bond Kenya, the Unilever subsidiary which produces tea, coffee and flowers within the country. 'The new financial regime within the government has done a superb job,' says Alan Wood, managing director. 'I can't think of anything more you could really ask for.' While political systems have come and gone - colonialism giving way to independence, Africanisation, single-party and now multi-party rule - the plantations now controlled by Brooke Bond in Kenya have remained, dating back as far as the 1920s. The company has three tea estates - the largest at Kericho covering 7,000 hectares - and altogether accounts for about 14 per cent of Kenyan tea production. It has a smaller operation - of about 500 hectares - under coffee cultivation. In addition, in the late 1970s it expanded into horticulture with the acquisition of Sulmac, which produces carnations, roses and other flowers at Lake Naivasha for export primarily to Western Europe. 'The European market has been able to absorb almost anything you send,' says Mr Wood. One of the biggest challenges facing the company in Kenya in the past has been inflation, which has been running at above 35 per cent a year. Until recently, the company has also had to cope with the effects of devaluation of the Kenyan shilling. 'Devaluation became a significant management challenge,' says Mr Wood. The effects were magnified because - like other exporters - the company had restrictions until recently on the amount of foreign currency it could retain. 'Your costs are instant, but there is a delay of some time between production and sale - we have a 33-day target - during which you can incur an exchange gain or loss,' he says. In response to inflation and currency problems, Brooke Bond and other businesses carried stock at what he calls 'fairly high levels' with working capital 'more than strictly appropriate'. The position has now eased, with companies allowed to retain their foreign earnings, a shift in the coffee auction prices from shillings to dollars, an apparent stabilisation in prices, and recently even a revaluation of the shilling against other currencies. As a result, the company had to develop treasury and cash management skills not previously required. 'We are dealing with a changing environment where we used to have a stable environment over the years,' says Mr Wood. 'We pay more attention now to where the cash is and how to use it to best advantage.' Other important changes brought by liberalisation that he highlights as significant are the relaxation on distributing dividends, the introduction of market exchange rates, the removing of import licences, and the abolition of price controls on commodities. He says that Brooke Bond does not plan additional investment in Kenya purely because of liberalisation, but stresses that in no way reflects the company's lack of commitment to the country. 'We have been here for 60 years, investing steadily throughout. We have confidence in the tea industry. Liberalisation has reaffirmed our commitment.' He says the company's main restriction has been acquiring new land for expansion. Consequently, its efforts have been focused on boosting yields and productivity through breeding programmes.</p>

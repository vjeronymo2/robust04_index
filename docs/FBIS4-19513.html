			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Erich Hauser report: "Kinkel Sees Symbol in Gorazde's </F> Fate"]    [Text] Luxembourg, 18 April -- The conference of the  European Union [EU] foreign ministers on Monday [18 April]  focused on the critical situation of the Bosnian Muslim enclave  of Gorazde. However, in anticipation of further news from  Gorazde, the beginning of the debate was postponed to the late  afternoon. Results were not available until the copy deadline  of this edition.    Before the beginning of the deliberations, in which EU  mediator Lord Owen also participated, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel said that political and psychological pressure on the  Serbs has to be increased. Gorazde has "become a symbol that  must show whether they (the Serbs -- FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU  editor's note) are really prepared to give in." Kinkel admitted  that there are also voices in the EU circle that want to  consider at least the withdrawal of the UN blue helmets from  Bosnia, while others, like Greek Foreign Minister Theodhoros  Papoulias, recommend the lifting of the sanctions that were  imposed against Serbia and Montenegro by the UN Security Council.    Kinkel had canceled on his own initiative the planned  "presentation" of Hans Koschnick, EU administrator designate for  the City of Mostar, in the EU Council of Ministers. Kinkel said  that he had realized that no time would be left for Koschnick's  presentation because of the topical problems. During their  meeting in Ioannina, the 12 had already accepted the former  mayor of Bremen for the later establishment of a Serbian-Bosnian  administration in Mostar at the proposal of Germany.    Originally, the debate on the situation in Gorazde should  have started during the ministers' lunch. However, instead, the  situation in Algeria was discussed. Here possible effects of an  increase in the Islamic fundamentalists' power on the  neighboring countries had played a role, Kinkel said. EU  Commission President Jacques Delors presented a report on  possible steps for Algeria's economic support.</p>

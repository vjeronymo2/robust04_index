			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, June 4 (XINHUA) -- A freight train  carrying 300 tons of goods left the new customs depot here for  Hong Kong at 10 A.M. on Tuesday [31 May], marking the formal  opening of the new inland customs post.    Shijiazhuang is the capital of Hebei Province in north  China.  The new customs depot includes two warehouses and a whole range  of services regarding imports and exports, commodity inspection  and quarantine.    Customs officials said that goods passed by the depot will  travel direct in sealed railway trucks and containers to their  customers in Russia, Hong Kong, Macao and South-East Asian  nations, without needing to go through other Chinese customs  formalities further along their route.    Goods on their way to Russia, north and East Europe via the  Euro- Asian Continental Rail Bridge can also clear their custom  formalities at the depot, said the officials.    It is understood that the opening of the facility will  greatly help Hebei Province's 400 state-owned firms and 4,300  joint ventures with direct import and export businesses.    The officials believe that some enterprises in the  neighbouring Shanxi and Henan Provinces will also choose to  export their goods via the new customs depot.</p>

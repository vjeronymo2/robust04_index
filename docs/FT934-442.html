			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Travel: The bloody path to Colombia's Lost City - Nick Skinner ventures where even the conquistadors feared to tread Grave robbers who pioneered the route to Ciudad Perdida, Colombia's Lost City, called, it the 'Green Hell.' They hated the swarms of biting flies, venomous snakes and daily torrential downpours. Following their footsteps through the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, it is not hard to see what they meant. The sierra, the highest coastal mountain range in the world, rises to a height of nearly 19,000ft just 26 miles from the Caribbean near the port of Santa Marta. Thick rainforest covers the wet northern slopes where the ancient Tairona civilisation built Ciudad Perdida. Unless you can use a helicopter, fighting your way through is the only way to see the city. The mountains are scarred with deep valleys that make travel, even on foot, extremely hard. When we were not scrambling up one muddy path or sliding down the next, the incessant afternoon rains ensured we were ankle-deep in a quagmire. The intense tropical heat and high humidity made almost every step feel like a major achievement. So impenetrable is the sierra that even the iron men of the Spanish conquest scarcely ventured in, allowing life for an estimated 11,000 Kogui Indian inhabitants to continue virtually unchanged. The Kogui possess probably the best preserved pre-Colombian culture outside the Amazon, and still maintain a rigid theocracy. For them the sierra is the Heart of the World, a protective wall of jungle cutting them off from the 20th century. The fertile but inhospitable mountain fortress has allowed them to maintain their independence while other tribes suffered centuries of persecution at the hands of the conquistadors. The Kogui claim to be the direct descendants of the Tairona, some of the best goldsmiths of ancient America, who began work on the Lost City around 600AD. The city had grown to a metropolis of 2,000 people by the time it was abandoned after the conquest, and the ruins remained hidden in thick jungle until grave robbers arrived in 1975. The robbers kept the find a secret until feuding led to a murder at the site. The authorities were called in and Ciudad Perdida, the largest archaeological find in the Americas this century, was flung violently back on the map. It is fitting for a country so steeped in bloody history that one of its greatest archaeological treasures should have been unearthed amid murder and theft. Equally fitting is that one of the two routes to the city was until recently a drug route. Both paths, the 80-mile round trip taken by the grave robbers and the drug runners' 50-mile short cut, are fast becoming as much of an attraction as the Lost City itself. We took the shorter route, which required five rather than six days' walking. The first night was spent at one of the impoverished peasant farms en route and the other nights in hammocks hung from simple jungle shelters. The hammocks were surprisingly comfortable, and we rocked to sleep to the music of night insects as fireflies flashed in the trees. At first light our guides woke us to a usually inedible breakfast of arepas  -fried maize flour patties - before leading us through rainforest in which creepers and air plants hung from giant trees while the mass of emerald green undergrowth was broken here and there with passion fruit, banana and coffee trees. Battling through this botanical wonderland for seven hours a day is hard work. But there can be few rewards more welcome than emerging from the forest, sweating and aching, to plunge into one of the cool rivers which cross the path. The rivers crash down from the glacial heights of the sierra to the Caribbean through a series of spectacular rapids and waterfalls. Strewn with granite boulders, they could have been in Scotland were it not for the overhanging creepers and dense vegetation. High above in the forest canopy birds kept up a constant chorus, tantalisingly hidden in the foliage; below, huge butterflies and deadly (but thankfully shy) coral snakes were seen. It was with relief that we arrived at the icy waters of the Rio Buritaca, unscathed except for insect bites, to start the final crossing to Ciudad Perdida. Across the swirling waist-deep water the moss-covered steps leading to the city appeared as if from nowhere, only to disappear again up the thickly-forested slope. The 1,260 steps to the city are treacherous, many having been washed away by centuries of tropical rain. The stairway was a tough final endurance test. But just as our legs told us we could go no further, the path widened into the broad ceremonial staircase which leads through the heart of the city. The thatched wooden homes of the Tairona have long gone. All that remains is the vast series of circular terraces on which they once stood. The site, 3,600ft above sea level, is criss-crossed by a network of tiny paths which can still be followed for miles into the jungle. On a high ridge in the centre of the city stand the majestic platforms once used for public meetings and ceremonies; now, helicopters occasionally land on them. Jungle presses in from all sides and still covers most of the city. Even in those parts which have been cleared, the tallest trees remain, an eerie reminder of the jungle's supremacy over man's work. Archaeologists have found few clues about life in the city or why the Tairona left. Even the city's original name is a mystery. But it is believed to have been abandoned in the early colonial period following battles with the Spaniards and the spread of European disease. Researchers have found little gold, and the grave robbers who have long since sold their finds are no longer keen to discuss them. The only other people who may know - the Kogui - are also keeping quiet. They are a deeply private people who just about tolerate walkers but do not want to discuss their history. To them, archaeologists are no better than grave robbers: both groups defile the tombs of their ancestors. Dressed in coarse cotton smocks, they walk the paths of the sierra regarding modern man as their younger brother, spiritually immature with little respect for the environment or history of their mountains. Sitting high on a ceremonial terrace watching a toucan flit from tree to tree it is easy to see why the Kogui want to preserve their isolated world. While biting black sand-flies left bleeding wounds and the steep jungle paths tested our endurance, the view from Ciudad Perdida was of a pure, natural world of bright birds and waterfalls, as fresh as the day the Tairona left. Nick Skinner travelled independently to Bogota from where he flew with Avianca to Santa Marta. He found a guide through the city's tourist information office, and bought a package that included guiding, food and portering of everything except clothes and personal belongings. Helicopter tours with Aviatur can be booked through travel agents or at the airport.</p>

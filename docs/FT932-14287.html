			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mayhew begins Ulster meetings NORTHERN Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew yesterday began a fresh round of exploratory discussions to try to restart all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland. He had a one-hour meeting with Alliance party leader Dr John Alderdice at Stormont Castle. Unionist leaders Mr James Molyneaux, the Rev Ian Paisley, and Mr John Hume of the SDLP are expected to have similar meetings later. Sir Patrick is planning new proposals which he hopes could form the basis for fresh dialogue between leaders of the constitutional parties. The last round of talks broke up without agreement last November.</p>

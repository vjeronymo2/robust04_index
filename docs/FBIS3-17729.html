"My peace-making initiative -- to meet with Ingush President  Ruslan Aushev on 2 April -- aims at finding ways to reach peace  and accord between the peoples of the two Republics and work out  principles and mechanisms of implementation of the presidential  decree `on the procedure for returning refugees and displaced  persons to the places of their permanent residence in the  Republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia,'" Galazov said.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Galazov said that there has  been no official response from Ingushetia so far. Meanwhile,  North Ossetian Government and parliament have set up a working  group to hold talks with the Ingush side in the city of Terek on  29 March to decide on the venue of the summit meeting, its  agenda and composition of the official delegations. The working  group is headed by Vice-Prime Minister Georgiy Dzhigkayev.    Galazov confirmed that the Ossetian side had thoroughly  studied the package of documents concerning the mechanism of  implementation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decree on  refugees. The documents lay a legal foundation for normalising  relations between the two nations and restoring peace and accord  in the region.    Galazov stressed that the situation in the zone of the state  of emergency remains complex, but is controlled by the Russian  peace-keeping troops and North Ossetian law enforcement bodies.</p>

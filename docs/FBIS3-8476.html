They are going to propose that this city in southern  Bosnia-Herzegovina be included into the Bosnian Croat state,  while the Moslems would get one of the Mostar municipalities,  i.e. the section mostly Moslem-populated before the war.    TANJUG learned that an E.U. mission, made up of high-ranking  Greek, German and Belgian officials, is due to arrive in Mostar  in the next few days, with a view to determining the  possibilities of the establishment and implementation of the  E.U. protectorate.    The Serbs residing in Mostar have been excluded from the  division. Before the war broke out in April 1992, 24,000 Serbs  lived in Mostar, accounting for one-third of the population.  44,000 Moslems, 43,000 Croats and 12,000 residents, who declared  themselves as Yugoslavs, have lived in Mostar at that time. The  E.U. protectorate would ensure the return of the Serbs, who have  been forced to leave the city under Moslem-Croat pressure. Over  45,000 Serbs have been expelled from Mostar and the Neretva  valley and nearly all of their homes, churches, monasteries and  cemeteries have been plundered, and burned and torn down. Since  early 1993, fierce Moslem-Croat clashes have been taking place  in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, during which the  city of Mostar has been completely destroyed.    Under strong pressure from the United States,  representatives  of the Bosnian Moslems and Croats along with Croatian  representatives signed in Washington on March 1 a preliminary  agreement on setting up a bi-national federation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would subsequently enter into a  confederation with Croatia, but the hostilities have never  ceased.</p>

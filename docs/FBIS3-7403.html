			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Japan, the European Union, and other members of the  OECD shipbuilding committee have recently urged Korea to  reconsider its plan to expand shipbuilding facilities, citing a  renewed global "overcapacity," officials at the Ministry of  Trade, Industry and Energy said yesterday.    The demand was aired to the Korean delegation during the  latest March 14-18 negotiations under the auspices of the  Council Working Party 6 of the Organization of Economic  Cooperation and Development, which wound up without any  agreement.    The EU and Japan, in a joint statement to the full session  of  the OECD group March 17, voiced deep concern that the negative  consequences of a renewed "overcapacity following the Korean  government's decision to remove a temporary ban on capacity  expansion by Korean shipbuilders."    "An increase in capacity of Korean shipbuilders, which would  in no way be justified by the reality of the market, would  seriously undermine the purpose of the Revised General Guideline  for Government Policies in the shipbuilding industry and the  shipbuilding agreement currently under negotiation to aim at  ensuring a balanced market for a return to normal competitive  conditions," said the statement made available here.    It recalled that "such an increase existed in the 1970s and  1980s where, at a time of deep crisis, when a majority of  producing countries were reducing substantially their  capacities, important new capacities were installed in Korea."    In another statement to the shipbuilding session, the United  States called for Korea to clarify its intention to neither  contribute to the planned expansion nor extricate the industry  from any difficulties that expansion may cause in future.    The Korean delegation explained to the member countries that  Korea's shipbuilding rationalization program, introduced in  1989, expired at the end of 1993 as scheduled, but not the  Korean government's lifting of restraints on facility expansion  by Korean shipbuilders as claimed by other members, according to  the ministry officials.    Korean delegates said the Korean government is now promoting  deregulation and market-opening measures, and it is now finding  it difficult to take any action against private investment  plans, they said.    Explaining the negotiations to reporters, a ministry  official  said Korea promised to the participating member countries that  the Korean government would not provide any financial support in  honor of the multilateral shipbuilding regime of the OECD and it  could not bail out any Korean shipbuilders even if they suffered  financial difficulties caused by their expansion plan.    An estimation, made by Japan and the EU, that the global  shipbuilding supply will exceed demand by 7 million to 9 million  gross tons to 26 million gross tons in 1995, has yet to be  verified, however, he said.    The official said local shipbuilders appear to be following  overblown expansion plans because of local rivalry, adding that  the government would work out countermeasures after a  cooling-off period it said is needed to cool down competition  among them.    The ministry will ask local shipbuilders to refrain from  excessive competition and inform them that the government will  not take any relief measures in favor of ailing companies, he  said.</p>

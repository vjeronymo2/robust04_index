			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (10): Where success breeds success - The banking sector's health At first glance, banks in the Czech Republic radiate good health. Three of the largest, Komercni, Obchodni and Investnici, recently broke the emerging markets equivalent of the four-minute mile. They raised or are raising syndicated loans inter- nationally at less than one percentage point over the London interbank rate: much less, at a spread of 65-70 basis points. These low borrowing rates owe much to the international reputation of the Czech economy. But the banking system itself takes some of the credit. The Czech Republic dealt early with the overhang of bad loans. From 1991 on, banks hived off bad loans into a new institution, Konsolidacni Banka. They cleaned up their balance sheets before the problem overwhelmed them. The central bank said their capital should exceed 6.25 per cent of assets by the end of 1993 and the banks have met the target. Czech banks are in confident mood. Komercni and Invest- nici, corporate bankers, and the savings institution Ceska Sporitelna began with specialist roles but each is invading the others' patches with gusto. Komercni has completed an energetic expansion of its branch network and Investnici has bought into one by taking over Postovni, the post office bank. Sporitelna is seeking to build a leading capital markets business on its cheap funding base. They follow less the example of the Anglo-Saxon lenders and more the powerful universal banks of neighbouring Germany. Their fund management companies have also grown through voucher privatisation and have made the banks indirect investors, as well as lenders. Influence on the board through seats held by fund management companies has safeguarded banks' lending relationships, some believe. Mr Alex Angell of brokers Wood &amp; Co says: 'That's why you see so little capital markets and corporate finance activity in this market. Czech banks want to keep the business for themselves.' Banks have shown strong results at the operating level. The government has pursued a deliberate policy of tolerance for high margins. The spread between borrowing and deposit rates, while falling, still stands at 6 per cent. Nor has this implicit subsidy all been frittered away on irresponsible lending. Better lending discipline is demonstrated by one key statistic: new loans after the revolution make up 90 per cent of Komercni's portfolio but only 20 per cent of bad loans. It sounds too good to all be true in a region where bank failures and bail-outs have been endemic. Even if big banks' bad debts are well covered now, they could easily deteriorate. One westerner who has worked closely with a large Czech bank says: 'Success is always measured in terms of bigness or being first with a product. I keep telling them: our job is to make money, we are not a utility. 'There is no credit culture that pervades the bank. There is still no deterrent to making bad loans. You don't get fired if it happens.' Ownership of stakes in borrowing companies can also be a source of potential problems. 'Banks are wearing two hats here. They obviously take a dim view of getting tough on clients when they are share- holders,' says a western investment banker. Nor does a shareholding always stave off competition for lending business. Suitors surround CEZ, the electricity utility. And Komercni, for instance, lost the Czech tobacco company as a client when it was taken over by Philip Morris. Citicorp was the beneficiary. Margins are also coming under pressure as western banks make inroads into the Czech corporate market. The Czech banking policy has been expensive. Mr Ales Barabas, board member of Zivnotenska Banka, says: 'The government is pumping money into the banks, don't worry. It is just that here it is not public.' The foundation of Konsol- idacni was in itself a pre-emptive bail-out. The Czech government's liberal distribution of guarantees on corporate loans also reduces banks' need to provision and boosts capital. Three small banks nevertheless failed earlier this year. Agrobanka, the fifth largest bank, applied international standards to its accounts and discovered that provisions had wiped out its capital in 1993. Further bank failures are a distinct possibility. 'My guess is that there is a much larger hit looming than has been acknowledged,' says one western adviser. The Czech National Bank classified loans more rigorously than ever before for its September data and found that 35 per cent are bad, compared with 22 per cent as measured before. When the Hungarian authorities conducted their first in-depth analysis of banks' portfolios they found that the two largest commercial banks had nega- tive capital equivalent to about 8 per cent of assets and were technically insolvent. The Czech National Bank refuses to give adjusted figures for capital adequacy. Mr Ota Kaftan, head of supervision at the central bank, says only: 'It is not a catastrophe.' The large banks claim they have already moved over to international accounting and so the change in calculation does not apply to them. Komercni says it made the shift in 1992 and now has met the Basle recommendation of 8 per cent capital adequacy. But other, smaller banks face a brutal realisation that full provisioning will totally exhaust their capital. Even Mr Kaftan admits: 'There could be some banks in the system which could have negative capital adequacy.' Leading banks stand to gain from a flight of deposits to quality that a further wave of bank failures would prompt. But those which lend on the interbank market such as Ceska Sporitelna will be hit. Wood &amp; Co says Sporitelna suffered an estimated Kc4bn loan loss to the three small banks that have already gone bankrupt. Three more banks are considered at risk and Price Waterhouse, Sporitelna's auditor, has commented that Ks4bn worth of provisions may not be adequate. Despite the prospect of further loan losses and a tightening of capital adequacy calculations, Mr Kaftan is adamant that the Czech banking sector will reach the 8 per cent ratio by the time the country applies to join the European Union in 1996. So far, Czech banks have proved able to restore their capital through rights issues on the Czech stock market and issuance of subordinated debt. Komercni raised Kc8bn in March and Ceska Sporitelna Kc7bn in September. Mr Ales Barabas, board member of Zivnotenska Banka responsible for the bank's investment fund, says: 'To be honest, I'm surprised that the rights issues are running so well. I personally would not participate.' But success breeds success, and as long as Czech banks can keep up the appearance of solidity they should be able to fund themselves out of crisis. Ultimately, it is all a matter of confidence.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FOREIGN RESERVES (USDOLLARS BN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Dec 31     Mar 31     Jun 30     Sep 30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Official reserves    3,871.8    4,565.6    5,170.4    5,416.6 Gross reserves       6,244.6    6,873.3    7,656.0    7,803.7 Liabilities          1,841.0    1,669.2    1,362.2      943.5 Net international   reserves           4,403.5    5,204.1    6,293.9    6,860.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Oct 30*   Nov 30*    Dec 1*    Dec 2*    Dec 5*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Official reserves    5,661.6   5,819.0   5,793.0   5,727.5   5,723.0 Gross reserves       8,473.6   8,432.7   8,438.9   8,329.5   8,295.9 Liabilities          1,192.3   1,009.6   1,106.8   1,052.9   1,058.5 Net international   reserves           7,281.3   7,423.1   7,332.1   7,276.6   7,237.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * estimate  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Czech National Bank  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

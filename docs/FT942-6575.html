			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Unity ticket urged for Labour poll A joint ticket of Mr Tony Blair and Mrs Margaret Becket was being promoted within the Labour party yesterday as three potential candidates for the leadership outlined their vision for a future Labour government. The latest opinion poll shows overwhelming support for Mr Blair, shadow home secretary, to become leader and for Mrs Beckett to retain the deputy leadership. While colleagues close to Mr Blair say he may decide not to nominate a running mate, pressure is building within the party for the two front-runners to join forces in the interests of 'party unity'. One centrist Labour MP said: 'Mr Blair and Mrs Beckett may not have spoken about the idea of forming a joint ticket but that does not mean they should not run in tandem in the interests of the party.' The poll, compiled by BBC 1's On The Record programme, included all three elements of the electoral college of MPs and MEPs, levy-paying trade unionists and constituency party members. It showed Mr Blair with 48 per cent against 17 per cent for Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor. More than 40 per cent want Ms Beckett to continue as deputy leader. Of those who do not, only 14 per cent support her nearest rival, Mr John Prescott, the party's employment spokesman. Although the contest is not due to start until after the European elections on June 9, a number of Labour MPs and advisers were privately arguing that Mr Blair and Mrs Beckett were looking unbeatable. However, friends of Mr Brown dismissed talk of a Blair/Beckett bandwagon, pointing out that only last week leadership speculation at Westminster had linked Mr Brown with Mrs Beckett. They also dismissed reports that Mr Brown was thinking of withdrawing from the contest. Mr Brown yesterday used a European election campaign rally to call for 'a fairness agenda' in his vision for a Labour government. He said: 'It is time for a new war on poverty, an assault on inequality and an attack on the unfairness that disfigures our society, in the interests not only of social cohesion but economic efficiency.' He also called for fair taxes, fair wages and childcare to prevent women from having to choose between their children and their jobs. Labour last night announced a shortlist of three candidates for the Monklands East seat of John Smith, its late leader. The final choice will be made at a selection meeting on Thursday. The three shortlisted candidates are: Ms Helen Liddell, a former secretary of the Labour party in Scotland; Mr Tom McCabe, leader of Hamilton district council; and Mr Ian Smart, a former member of Labour's Scottish executive.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / UN to discuss war in Yemen The United Nations Security Council will tomorrow discuss Yemen's month-old civil war following a joint appeal from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Though the outcome of the meeting remains uncertain, the fact it has been called appears to serve south Yemeni political interests. Indeed, the appeal from the six nations now suggests implicit recognition for the new southern government in spite of objections from northern leader General Ali Abdullah Saleh. Support from the six Arab nations follows intensive diplomatic efforts by the south over the past month and is widely viewed as a political coup for the break-away state. Shortly after the start of hostilities on April 27, Gen Saleh and other northern leaders warned the international community against attempts at mediating, saying it would amount to meddling in Yemen's domestic politics. Those warnings were repeated last week when Saudi Arabia initiated the current proposals. Supported by his political allies in the fundamentalist Islah party, Gen Saleh claims to represent constitutional legitimacy in the country and has vowed to crush what he calls rebellion by the southerners. He is unlikely to heed any international objections, especially if he entertains hopes of a military victory. The prospects of such a northern victory, though, appear less likely with each passing day. To win the war Gen Saleh had to capture Aden and other key regions of the south. A month ago, he boasted of easy victories. But northern troops attempting to enter Aden have met with stiff resistance and advanced only to 60km from the city. Lacking any air cover, Gen Saleh's troops approaching Aden from the north have been exposed to relentless bombing and strafing by southern jets while those approaching from the east and west have come under heavy naval bombardment from southern ships. Stalled in efforts to reach the southern capital, Gen Saleh last week opened a new front to the east, aiming to capture the oil fields of the Wadi Hadhramaut, some 700km north-east of Aden. But southern leaders were unruffled by the new northern thrust, saying that Gen Saleh was over-extending his forces and making them easy prey to counter-attack.</p>

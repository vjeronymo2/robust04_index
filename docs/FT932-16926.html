			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hong Kong disposal for Faupel Trading Faupel Trading Group, the USM-quoted textile importer, has sold Oriental Finzel to its management for HKDollars 1 and the sale of certain intellectual property rights for HKDollars 60,000 (Pounds 5,000). These amounts will be added to the repayment of an intercompany loan account which will total HKDollars 449,044. This sum will be capitalised as zero coupon preference shares in Finzel which will be redeemed at par in 12 monthly instalments. Finzel, acquired by Faupel in 1990, is based in Hong Kong and trades in electrical and electronic components. The disposal will result in an extraordinary charge of Pounds 233,000 in Faupel's accounts for the year to March 31 1993. There will also be a Pounds 637,000 charge for goodwill previously written off to reserves. Faupel said it was unlikely to maintain profits for the year, but intends to recommend an unchanged final dividend.</p>

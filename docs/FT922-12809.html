			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Smith cautious as he outlines his battle plan: The race to lead Labour MR JOHN SMITH was in characteristically circumspect mood as he launched his bid yesterday for the Labour party leadership. The man who has built his standing in the party  - and his popularity with the voters - on a reputation for dispassionate sobriety was not about to break the habit of a lifetime. So instead of a brave new world, the shadow chancellor offered the serried ranks of the press some cautious pointers to the direction in which he would take the party. Labour would be pro-European, realistic in its economic policy, relevant in its social aspirations, and committed to constitutional reform. It would be gradualist. He might almost have said conservative. But the phrase that crept in most frequently when he was quizzed on the details of his policies  - particularly towards the role of the trade unions  - was that these were matters which required 'most careful consideration'. It was an uncomfortable performance. He had the demeanour of a man who knows he is going to win but is aware the manner of his victory could make for a difficult future. Denying that the trade union barons had 'stitched up' the succession to Mr Neil Kinnock, he emphasised he wanted the widest possible debate among party members, Westminster colleagues and affiliated trade unions before the leadership contest. He was happy to see the date of the contest put back to allow time for every constituency party to ballot its membership and for affiliated organisations to consult widely among their membership. It took just a few hours for one of the trade union barons to undermine Mr Smith's effort to ensure the democratic legitimacy of his candidature when Britain's second-biggest union, the AEU engineering union, immediately endorsed him as its preferred candidate. Mr Bill Jordan, the union president, brushed aside the commitment to the 'wider democracy' offered by Mr Smith with the comment that he did not want to 'waste time and money on a ballot of members'. The response from Mr Smith's opponents was predictable. No wonder, they said, the shadow chancellor had refused at his press conference to offer any commitment to get rid of the trade union block vote. That was less than fair. If Mr Smith was determined not to set in concrete his prescription for electoral success, his outlook is hardly shrouded in mystery. He is committed to devolution both for Scotland and Wales and for the English regions. Yesterday he backed the introduction of a 'Bill of Rights'. He is not prepared yet to put on the record his support for electoral reform at Westminster but is moving inexorably in that direction. Mr Robin Cook and Mr Jack Cunningham, his two campaign managers, are among the most committed in the shadow cabinet to proportional representation. For all his reticence yesterday, Mr Smith also believes there is no long-term future for the trade union block vote in shaping Labour's policies.  ---------------------------------------------------------- Born 1938 at Ardrishaig, Argyll Educated: Dunoon Grammar School; Glasgow University Previous occupation:  advocate First elected MP: 1970 Constituency:  Monklands East, Lanarkshire Shadow chancellor since 1987  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Letter: No fooling with this increased charge Sir, How appropriate that your leader, 'Local councils', appeared on April Fool's Day. The London borough of Haringey informed me the previous day that my council tax bill for 1993-94 is Pounds 1048.05. In 1992-93 the community charge for my wife and myself, the only residents at the address below, totalled Pounds 767.84. The increase is Pounds 270.21 - which is considerably more than the maximum weekly figure Pounds 3.50 given by your writer. Neither my wife nor I would grudge paying more in order to improve the educational and library services as well as seeing that there is, for a change, adequate resources made available for care in the community. James Mitchell, 31 The Chine, London N10 3PX</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL DELAYS ACTION ON WARNER RIDGE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Planning Commission on Thursday delayed action on a staff  report recommending that development on Warner Ridge not be limited to  single-family houses.  </P> <P> The commission delayed action until Dec. 13 because the staff report, signed by  Planning Department Director Ken Topping, was very hastily prepared and  therefore technically inadequate, commission President Bill Luddy said.  </P> <P> But Luddy said he doubted that Topping would return with different advice in  December. Topping, who did not attend the meeting, recommended against approval  of a proposal advocated by Councilwoman Joy Picus, who wants no commercial  development on the 21.5-acre site in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> The Picus-backed revision would make the Warner Ridge community plan compatible  with the zoning adopted by the council in January. The zoning calls for  residential housing, but the current community plan permits commercial  development.  </P> <P> Accompanying Topping's recommendation was a supplemental environmental impact  report estimating that only 65 houses could be built on the site if it were  developed to the maximum under Picus' plan and if the site were exempted from  the city's slope density formula -- a provision designed to reduce the number  of units that can be built on steeper lots. Without a slope density exemption,  only 17 houses would be permitted, the report says.  </P></p>

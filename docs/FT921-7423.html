			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris rally survives profit-taking after bullish week THE FASHION for cyclicals and the trend on Wall Street continued to support most senior bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS closed a bullish week with some light profit-taking in some of the cyclical stocks which have led the rally, but strategists said the market was still heading higher. The CAC 40 index rose 11.15 to 1,962.37, its best close since July 27, 1990, and up 5.2 per cent on the week. Turnover was estimated at FFr4.3bn, very high for a Friday, but dealers said that it also reflected position-squaring at the end of the February trading account yesterday. Among the larger stocks, Saint-Gobain fell FFr5 to FFr533 on profit-taking, while Euro Disney soared FFr4.10 or 2.8 per cent to FFr153 with a heavy 2.1m shares traded on news that it would replace Perrier in the CAC 40 index from March 19. Perrier and Exor were both suspended yesterday amid speculation that BSN might launch a counter bid for Exor. One of the day's losers was Total which fell FFr7 to FFr253 on reports of heavy US selling. FRANKFURT hit an 18-month closing high ahead of the expiry of DTB options contracts. The DAX index closed 14.45 higher at 1,717.63 its highest since August 16, 1990, and up 2.5 per cent on the week. Volume rose from DM7.4bn to DM8.6bn but some traders put this down to options-associated business. The more broadly-based FAZ index, less subject to DTB influences, closed just 1.5 per cent higher on the week after a 2.61 rise to 696.66 yesterday, and some of the big blue chips were easing back in London afternoon trading. BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen rose DM4.50 to DM556, DM6 to DM752 and DM4.50 to DM451.30 on the session, but they were all quoted around DM2 lower in London after hours. In the morning, German January car production was reported down 7 per cent compared with a year earlier. The argument remained for export profits, and the strength of the dollar. This also applied to engineers and steel/engineering combines, where MAN put on DM5.50 to DM370.50, Mannesmann DM5.60 to DM284.50. AMSTERDAM closed mostly firmer but off its highs in lively trading dominated by yesterday's expiry of February options and futures series. The CBS Tendency index closed up 0.7 at 126.1, up 3.5 per cent on the week, in extremely heavy turnover of Fl 1.07bn. ZURICH featured cyclicals again as the SPI index rose 3.1 to 1,133.7, 1.4 per cent up on the week. Brown Boveri and Holderbank bearers rose SFr50 to SFr3,610, and SFr100 to SFr4,820 respectively. MADRID faltered on the Telefonica pension fund furore. The telecommunications stock, which makes up nearly 10 per cent of the general index, fell Pta85 to PTa1,095 and the index itself by 2.09 to 258.95, hardly changed on the week. BRUSSELS ended higher in moderate trading. The Bel-20 index rose 8.55 to 1,182.54, up 2.1 per cent on the week. SGB rose BFr35 or 1.6 per cent to BFr2,215 on higher-than-average volume of 20,100 shares. STOCKHOLM combined the fashion for cyclicals with a 4 per cent drop in insurers, and the Affarsvarlden General index emerged only 2.2 higher at 931.6 for a fall of 0.8 per cent on the week. Dealers said the insurers' decline was tied to sharply higher loan losses at the Gota banking group, in which the insurer, Trygg Hansa, holds a 40 per cent stake. Trygg Hansa B fell SKr3 to SKr88. COPENHAGEN rose on strength in banks and insurers, writes Hilary Barnes. Danske Bank closed DKr5 higher at DKr335, up DKr18 since Monday, after reversing recent Nordic banking trends with a DKr1.33bn net profit for 1991 against a DKr1.17bn loss in 1990. The Unidanmark banking group, after a loss earlier in the week, recovered to close DKr8 higher at DKr218. Turnover was a moderate DKr231m, and the CSE index rose 1.44 to 352.53, almost unchanged on the week, with the bank index up by 3.38 to 227.39 and insurance by 6.48 to 723.43. OSLO closed mostly lower, with Norsk Hydro losing NKr3.5 to NKr136.5 after reporting a record net loss for 1991 on Thursday. The all-share index fell 1.83 to 414.39 in low turnover of NKr145.6m. ISTANBUL dropped in quiet trading to its second consecutive 1992 low. The 75-share index closed at 3,985.51, down 8.05, for a loss of 9.9 per cent on the week. VIENNA's ATX index rose 14.11 to 1,093.69, barely missing a new all-year high, for a rise of 2.5 per cent on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 21  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm    2 pm    3 pm    close 1153.23  1153.02  1153.45  1155.73  1156.46 1157.29 1154.91 1154.51  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1157.68    Day's Low  1152.32  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Feb 20    Feb 19   Feb 18    Feb 17    Feb 14 1149.62   1140.09  1143.83   1135.65   1130.78  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

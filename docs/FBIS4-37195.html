			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza, 19 Jun (MENA) -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the  Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli Liaison  Committee, has announced that it has agreed in principle to  begin negotiations on the establishment of autonomy over the  remainder of the West Bank on Monday, 27 June.    After meeting for two hours today with Major General Amnon  Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation to the Liaison Committee,  Sha'th said that they agreed to hold the meetings alternately in  Gaza and Jerusalem.    Sha'th pointed out that the date of each of these meetings  will be set after consultation with Maj. Gen. Shahaq.    Sha'th added that he and Shahaq also discussed problems  connected to the application of autonomy such as travel permits  for the Palestinians and resuming the talks about Palestinian  detainees in Israeli jails. He explained that Israel has so far  released only 1,200 detainees out of a total of 5,000 who should  have been released in line with the agreement between the two  sides. He said negotiations over the release of the others will  be conducted during the next meeting with Shahaq.    Sha'th said he will meet in the near future with Israeli  Police Affairs Minister Moshe Shahal to discuss the conditions  of the detainees who have not yet been released.    The Palestinian official reported that Israel has approved  the entry of the families of the Palestinian police, totaling  50,000 people, and also approved the return of 72 other  Palestinian families who until now have been residing in Rafah's  Egyptian sector. They will move to the village of Tall  al-Sultan in the Gaza Strip.    Amnon Shahaq announced that Dr. Sha'th does not intend to  visit Jerusalem tomorrow because he will be occupied elsewhere.    Sha'th has asked that the number of Palestinian workers who  work inside Israel be increased. Israel formerly suspended the  work permits of approximately 130,000 workers, except 10,000  workers from Gaza.</p>

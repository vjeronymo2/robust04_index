			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Willis questions pit reprieves AS MANY as six of the 12 pits reprieved by the government's coal white paper are soon to close, Mr Norman Willis, general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said yesterday. On the eve of today's Commons debate on coal Mr Willis used a letter to Mr John Major to accuse the government of failing to address 'the fundamental issues of the market' and to predict that over the next 18 months 38 pits would close. The letter came as National Power, the largest electricity generator, confirmed that it would not consider additional coal purchases until the autumn. British Coal has already negotiated to sell 40m tonnes of coal to the main electricity generators this year but needs to increase sales by a further 15m tonnes a year if the future of the 12 pits is to be secured. In today's debate on a Labour motion urging the government to adopt recommendations put forward by a cross-party committee of MPs in January, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, is expected to renew his recent attack on the coal white paper as a 'fraud'. At least one Conservative MP has served notice of an intention to vote against the government or to abstain. Labour's motion criticises the government for encouraging the belief that its white paper would reprieve 12 pits and widen the market for their coal by providing a subsidy for their output. It notes that 'within three months of its publication two of those pits have already closed'. The confirmation of National Power's position on additional coal purchases came in a memorandum sent last week to Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, the Conservative MP for Batley &amp; Spen, a prominent coal rebel. The company said it had 'no commercial need' for further coal at present and would in any case have nowhere to put the additional supplies. It said it had nearly 20m tonnes of coal at power station sites and additional supplies would not be burnt for 'some considerable time'. It said it would 'reconsider the question of possible additional purchases in the autumn'.</p>

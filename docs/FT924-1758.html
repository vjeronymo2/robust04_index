			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Survey of The Baltic Basin States (2): Investment badly needed - St Petersburg is still Russia's window on the west THREE centuries after it was founded by Peter the Great, the port city of St Petersburg is looking for a new lease of life as Russia's window on the West. The collapse of the Soviet Union, allocating other key ports on the Baltic and the Black Sea to other states, has reasserted its role as Russia's main maritime gateway to the West. But the port itself is badly in need of reorganisation and investment to meet the challenges of a newly-opened Baltic Sea. As often the case in Russia, grand ideas still outnumber actual projects and funds to redress matters. 'Everything is still at the stage of conversations,' says Mr Anatoly Bilichenko, the deputy director of the city's trade port. Mr Vladimir Fedoseyev, an official from the St Petersburg mayor's office, sketched ambitious plans to create a 'free entrepreneurial zone' on the basis of an expanded port. Despite the government's known scepticism about tax concessions for specific areas to become free economic zones, he claims that Moscow is 'on the verge' of giving the project the go-ahead. The idea is to develop the present port so it reaches annual capacity of 20m tonnes by the year 2000. Meanwhile, both St Petersburg's state-owned Baltic Shipping Company and private entrepreneurs are vying to set up a brand new super-port outside the city. Rejecting this project as 'a typical example of. . . Communist-style gigantism,' Mr Bilichenko says any new money should be invested in re-equipping and developing his port - and foreign assistance available so far has focused on just that. 'We have always been Russia's most universal port both in terms of cargo and onward transport facilities,' he says. He points to infrastructure including comprehensive air, rail and road links from the port, itself a 15 minute drive from the centre of St Petersburg. Unlike more specialised ports elsewhere, St Petersburg port handles almost everything except oil - a sore subject given local environmentalists' opposition to talk of building an oil terminal which would help make up for export-handling capacity lost elsewhere. But St Petersburg still has a long way to go to fulfil its potential, let alone handle its present tasks. Ships loaded with scarce supplies of sugar recently had to wait weeks to be unloaded and this year Mr Bilichenko had to turn down 4-5m tonnes of business exceeding the port's annual capacity of 13m tonnes. But he believes that relatively small amounts of money - Dollars 50m to Dollars 60m - would be enough to buy spare parts and new loading equipment to quickly expand capacity by at least 1.5-2m tonnes. The main problem is a lack of finance. While most of the port's customers are Russian ships which pay for port services in roubles, virtually all the equipment and spare parts needed by the port can be bought only with precious hard currency in the West. 'It so happened that these things were not produced by our enterprises,' Mr Bilichenko says somewhat ruefully, referring to the priority given by state industrial planners to defence production under seven decades of Communist rule. Russia is now trying to switch part of its defence industry - some of it concentrated in St Petersburg itself - to civilian uses, but this is a process requiring time and huge amounts of capital which have so far not materialised. Recognising its importance to Russia (including its role in distributing western humanitarian aid and food imports), the World Bank has promised the port Dollars 10m out of a Dollars 350m loan to Russia for infrastructure improvements. Tenders for the purchase of some of the equipment the port needs are to be held imminently, according to World Bank officials. The European Community is also pitching in with Dollars 4m in technical assistance to help reorganise the port. Mr Bilichenko says the port itself can raise Dollars 5m to spend on new equipment. He also hopes, apparently without much conviction, to attract rich shareholders when the port is turned into a joint-stock company as part of the government's privatisation plans. With 51 per cent of shares to be sold to its 6,000 employees, another 30 per cent will be offered to outside investors. Meanwhile, one of Russia's new entrepreneurs wants to build the country's first private port. Mr Ilya Baskin, who recently launched a satellite containing advertising material on Russian companies and aimed at the United States, says he has already obtained all the necessary permits from various local authorities to lease a site 100km out of town for a new port. He claims to have defeated a rival scheme by the Baltic Shipping Company to build a 180m tonne port on the same site at the fantastic cost of Dollars 19bn. Mr Baskin claims it will take him two to three years to set up a port with capacity of 30m tonnes and that he already has the money to start work.</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Pressure on dollar AFTER last week's poorer than expected payroll figure, the focus of many participants in foreign exchange markets will again be on the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate, writes James Blitz. Although there is little in the way of US data over the next few days, Friday's payroll figure is likely to cast a shadow over the dollar over the next few weeks. It tends to be seen as an important indicator of the data in the forthcoming month. With the August figure turning out to be a drop of 39,000 on the month compared to expectations of a rise of 144,000, the scope for continuing disappointment in the US economic recovery may be high. Expectations of a cut in official German interest rates at Thursday's council meeting of the Bundesbank could also be disappointed. The Bundesbank may be encouraged to ease policy because of the strength of the D-Mark against the dollar. Last month, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president-elect, said a strong D-Mark would not be in the interest of German exporters. However, data for M3 monetary growth last month - when the Bundesbank intervened in currency markets to try to keep the ERM together - have not yet been released, and are expected to be well above target range. Mounting evidence that the recession in Germany has bottomed out may also stay the Bundesbank's hand. This may also be the week when fund managers analyse the currency weightings in their portfolios for the autumn - and the evidence is that they are heavily overweight in the dollar at a time when it has a strong downside. According to some analysts, fund managers would have to shed 10 per cent of their dollar holdings to get a neutral position.</p>

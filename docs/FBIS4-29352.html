			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- The Agency of Natural  Resources and Energy has instructed Tokyo Electric Power Co. to  thoroughly investigate last month's accident at one of the  company's nuclear reactors in Fukushima Prefecture, agency  officials said Friday [17 June].    The agency, part of the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry, suspects the metal fittings holding down jet pumps in  Japan's boiling-water reactors may be defective after it learned  that the fittings had been replaced in the early 1980s to  prevent just such an accident.    Operations at the Fukushima No. 2 power plant's  1,100-megawatt third reactor were closed down on May 30 when  part of a metal fitting on one of the 20 jet pumps that regulate  power output fell off.    Concern about the fittings 14 years ago, following a similar  accident at a U.S. nuclear power facility, led Tokyo Electric  Power to change the fittings on all its boiling-water reactors  as a preventive measure.    According to the agency, the accident at an Illinois nuclear  power plant in February 1980 was attributed to stress and  corrosion around the holes for bolts that hold the jet pumps in  place.    The power company replaced all the fittings in its reactors  with a new type that was supposedly more resistant to stress and  corrosion. The exchange operation was completed in 1984.    Since then, there have been no reports of any accidents  related to the fittings, but the effects of stress and corrosion  have been found at the Fukushima No. 1 power plant's first  reactor and at the Hamaoka power plant's first reactor in  Shizuoka Prefecture.    The Fukushima reactor, currently under investigation, was  under construction at the time of the exchange operations and  was installed with the newer-style fittings.    The same Fukushima reactor experienced trouble with its  circulating-water pump in January 1989 and at that time, the jet  pumps were removed from the reactor.    The agency suggested that the trouble with the metal  fittings  on the jet pumps may be related to the 1989 incident, but added  that if trouble exists with the newer-style fittings, it may  have to order the fittings on the boiling-water reactors be  changed again.    The majority of Japan's nuclear power reactors are of the  boiling-water type. An exception is the "Monju" reactor in  Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture along the coast of the Sea of Japan.  It is a plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactor, which has become  the cornerstone of Japan's energy policies for the future.</p>

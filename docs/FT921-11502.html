			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Solvay shares tumble on news of 40% profits fall SHARES in Solvay, Belgium's largest chemicals group, fell 4 per cent yesterday after the company announced a 40 per cent drop in group profits for 1991, excluding extraordinary items. Capital expenditure, research and development spending and general overheads will either be cut or frozen in an attempt to offset recessionary pressures, but Solvay warned that 1992 was unlikely to be a better year for the company. Solvay - one of the world's top 20 chemicals groups and headed by Baron Daniel Janssen - will publish formal annual figures in April, but yesterday's statement indicated they would show full-year net profits of just under BFr13bn (Dollars 398m), including some BFr2bn of extraordinary gains, against BFr15.9bn in 1990. Stripping out all extraordinary items, Solvay's profits apparently dropped from BFr17.8bn to less than BFr11bn in 1991 - only just over half the equivalent profits figure for 1989. The group's dividend - which was increased for 1990 despite a fall in earnings - will not be announced until April, but a spokesman pointed out that Solvay had repeatedly said it would not cut its payout. 'I'm sure that statement is valid today, but there is still one quarter to run between now and when the decision has to be taken,' he added. The group heralded a fall in 1991 profits last September, but the Belgian market was still disappointed by the news and the shares lost BFr500 to close at BFr12,100 yesterday. Brussels brokers were pessimistic about the immediate future. Solvay was hit by a fierce downturn in its plastics activities during the second half of last year. Sales slumped following increased competition from east European imports of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and the division barely broke even. The group's core alkalis sector had also suffered 'significantly lower' profits. Overall sales volume slipped by 3 per cent, but Solvay said consolidated turnover was 'close to' the 1990 figure of BFr255bn. Cash-flow was down by 3 per cent, or 16 per cent before extraordinary gains.</p>

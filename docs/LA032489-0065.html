			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC ELECTIONS: TRICKY PROCESS;  </P> <P> RESULTS OF STUDENT SENATE VOTE DUE TODAY; CHICANERY LIVES ON  </P> <P> Hanh Cao was angry. Her roommate was frightened. They had just learned that a  right-wing student group called Young Americans for Freedom spiced up a press  conference by proclaiming, "Death to Hanh!"  </P> <P> Who is Hanh Cao and what is her crime?  </P> <P> She is a USC student. She is in charge of the student body elections.  </P> <P> Plainly, campus politics at USC are not for the timid. The death ditty -- just  a joke, the YAFers say -- is only one episode in what ranks as a vintage year  on a campus where political chicanery is something of a tradition.  </P> <P> Such second-drawer Watergate figures as Ronald Zeigler, Dwight Chapin, Gordon  Strachan and Donald Segretti learned a few tricks here. Assemblyman Patrick  Nolan (R-Glendale), now a subject of an FBI probe of alleged Capitol  corruption, was not merely a Trojan, he was once Tommy Trojan, riding Traveler  in the Rose Parade to the strains of "Conquest." Nolan was also, as a student,  a YAF leader.  </P> <P> This time, the power struggle essentially features the reigning Student Senate  against a coalition of YAFers and other conservatives bent on takeover. Win or  lose, conservatives say, their campaign is another sign of the growing  conservatism on the nation's campuses.  </P> <P> Today, student officials are expected to announce the results of what has been  the nastiest election in many years. Or rather, the nastiest two elections. The  first election, two weeks ago, was voided amid charges of ballot-box stuffing.  Some students admitted to a student judicial council they had voted more than  once.  </P> <P> YAFers, in turn, suggest this was an election Ferdinand Marcos would have  loved. The Senate, they say, conspired to cheat them out of victory in the  first election. (Those allegedly tainted ballots, for the record, were never  counted.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Don't Care  </P> <P> Before the drama becomes overwhelming, however, it is well to remember most USC  students don't give a hoot about campus politics. More than 15,900  undergraduates are eligible to vote; about 2,000 are expected to bother.  </P> <P> Such apathy is bemoaned by student politicos. After all, they point out, the  32-member Student Senate -- half graduate, half undergraduate -- controls  nearly $1 million a year, funding some campus groups and disappointing others.  It has pushed for such popular student causes as increased campus security,  extended library hours and improved parking facilities, with mixed results.  </P> <P> This Senate has also tried to have a voice in what is sometimes called The Real  World. It has attempted, unsuccessfully, to pressure USC's Board of Trustees to  withdraw investments from corporations that do business with South Africa. Part  of the idea, says Senate President Phil Clement, is to change USC's image from  the "University of Spoiled Children" to the "University of Social  Consciousness."  </P> <P> But "this divestment thing," as conservative undergraduate Brad Walters put it,  became a touchstone for campus conservatives. A coalition formed that includes  several present and former members of Phi Delta Theta fraternity, in addition  to the YAFers. The conservatives put together a full slate of 16 undergraduate  candidates and at least one graduate candidate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Like Presidential Campaign  </P> <P> Andrew Segal, past president of the "Phi Delts" who is expected to graduate in  June, assumed a leadership role and entered the race for a graduate seat.  Inspired by a class taught by well-known Los Angeles political consultant  Joseph Cerrell, Segal developed a game plan he called "a microcosm of the  presidential election."  </P> <P> Just as the Bush people turned that election into a referendum on liberalism,  the student conservatives made their contest a referendum on the Senate,  arguing that it is too liberal to represent USC's student body. In addition to  divestment, they attacked Senate "junkets" and funding for a gay and lesbian  students group.  </P> <P> Student senators counterattacked, labeling YAF as extremist. "I've been quoted  as saying YAF is half a step left of the skinheads, and I do believe that,"  Clements said recently. The Student Senate, on the other hand, is a mix of  liberals, moderates and conservatives that fairly reflects USC's student body,  he says.  </P> <P> YAF President Ken Dubberly, 21, concedes that his group has an image problem --  so much so that he has left references to YAF off some campaign advertisements.  Dubberly insists the USC chapter, which claims 75 members, is part of the  conservative mainstream.  </P> <P> "People call us racist, but we're not," he said. "People call us Nazis, but I  don't think those people know the meaning of fascism."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Campaign Irregularities  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, some conservative candidates were accused of campaign  irregularities. Under the election rules, the 16 undergraduate seats are  divided among four constituencies: four seats representing the Greeks, four  representing residence halls, four for students who live off-campus in the  immediate ZIP code area and four for commuter students.  </P> <P> Five conservatives, including Segal, were disqualified for running for seats  for which they did not qualify. Later, some were reinstated -- but only as  write-in candidates. "I was railroaded," Segal said.  </P> <P> Then came the first elections, from March 6 to March 10. More than 2,300  students voted, the most in years, but there were numerous charges of  ballot-box stuffing -- students were able to enter the voting area more than  once because lax poll watchers did not cross off their names the first time  they voted.  </P> <P> Finally, the student Judicial Council wiped out the election and ordered  stricter guidelines for a replacement contest. Candidate eligibility rules were  clarified, and the manager of the first election -- a conservative -- was  stripped of his duties. In stepped Hanh Cao, a member of the Judicial Council  who had run elections in the past.  </P> <P> Clement denies YAF allegations that student government leaders conspired  against conservatives, noting that he and other senators had argued to let the  first election stand.  </P> <P> "They say the rules were designed to keep them out," he said. "Well, they're  the ones who are breaking the rules. The rules were designed to keep out the  people who break the rules."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tactics Tame Now  </P> <P> Cerrell, the influential political science instructor, sees USC's current  electoral troubles as tame compared to the "shenanigans" of yore. When he  attended USC in the 1950s, he once hired a stripper named "Patti Waggin" to  drum up support for his candidate among the fraternities. Even so, "my guy  lost," Cerrell said.  </P> <P> More recently, troubles in the 1971 student election prompted the USC  administration to abolish the old government system and develop a new one.  Clement maintains that political life has been relatively clean over the last  few years, especially when contrasted with other campuses. At student  leadership conferences, Clement says, politicians from other schools sometimes  boast about how they've rigged the elections.  </P> <P> Although the conservatives accuse Clement and other senators of rigging this  one, they at times have proved to be their own worst enemy. Such was the case  at the press conference held last weekend to denounce the senate's handling of  the election -- marred when at least one YAFer proclaimed, "Death to Hanh."  </P> <P> Questioned on campus this week, the group's leaders initially disavowed any  knowledge of such statements. "It's stupid to call for someone's death. We're  not right-wing death squads roaming the campus," said YAFer Wayne Bowen.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Joke  </P> <P> Later, however, Segal offered another version of the press conference after  complaining that published reports blew it out of proportion. What really  happened, he said, was that the guys were getting their picture taken, and  instead of saying "cheese," somebody said, "Death to Hanh." Just a joke, he  stressed. Others confirmed this account.  </P> <P> That is the version that Hanh Cao accepts.  </P> <P> " 'Death to Hanh' . . . that's what makes them smile," the election  commissioner said. "Right now I want to treat it like it never happened and  just do the elections and get it over with. . . .  </P> <P> "Hopefully, I won't have to deal with these people again."  </P></p>

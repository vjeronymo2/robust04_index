			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CHANG HEATS UP, WEARS DOWN SAMPRAS  </P> <P> Eighteen-year-old Californians Michael Chang and Pete Sampras battled for three  hours under a scorching midday sun Saturday before Chang prevailed, 3-6, 7-6  (7-5), 7-5, in the semifinals of the Players International tournament at  Toronto.  </P> <P> Chang, winner of the 1989 French Open, hasn't won a regular men's tour event.  In today's final, he will face fourth-seeded Jay Berger, who endured 90-degree  temperatures to outlast unseeded Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland in the other  semifinal, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2.  </P> <P> "The French Open added pressure on me to perform and this summer, I don't have  that pressure," said Chang, who has also had to overcome a hip injury.  </P> <P> The fifth-seeded Sampras said he blew the match in the last two sets.  </P> <P> "I should have won," said Sampras, who made 35 unforced errors to Chang's 17,  the most critical in the third set.  </P> <P> Chang won a second-set tiebreaker with the help of a "lucky" backhand return of  an overhead smash, but Sampras regained the momentum with a break in the second  game of the third set and took a 3-0 lead.  </P> <P> Chang held serve for 3-1 and held a break point on Sampras in the fifth game.  When Sampras missed a backhand volley, Chang had a vital service break.  </P> <P> "Till then, I thought I was pretty much gone," Chang said. "I didn't have a  whole lot of chances to break him and when I did, he came up with that huge  serve of his."  </P> <P> Sampras, a first-time winner in Philadelphia earlier this year, called the shot  "stupid."  </P> <P> "It took the air right out of me," he said. "I didn't know where I was on the  court."  </P> <P> Zina Garrison and Jennifer Capriati posted straight-set victories as the United  States advanced to the final for the 19th time in the 28th Federation Cup.  </P> <P> The defending champion and top-seeded Americans beat third-seeded Austria, 3-0,  and will meet the fourth-seeded Soviet Union, a 2-1 winner over second-seeded  Spain in the other semifinal match at Norcross, Ga.  </P> <P> The Soviets took advantage of an injury to Spain's No. 1 player, Arantxa  Sanchez-Vicario, who retired in the second set of her singles match with a  twisted ankle.  </P> <P> Garrison, ranked fifth in the world, defeated Judith Wiesner, 6-3, 6-4, to  clinch the victory for the U.S., after Capriati beat Barbara Paulus, 6-3, 6-4.  </P></p>

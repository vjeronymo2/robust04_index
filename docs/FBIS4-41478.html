			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS -- The Federation Council on  Friday issued an address to the parliaments of the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) member-states in  connection with the passage of a citizenship law by the Latvian  Sejm.    The Sejm passed the law "in defiance of numerous protests by  the international public and without reckoning with the  recommendations of the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and a number  of international experts", the address pointed out. Thereby,  the Latvian authorities "ignored the universally recognised  standards in the field of human rights," the Council stated.    The Russian parliamentarians, the address said, cannot  remain  indifferent to the position of the members of national  minorities restricted in their right to receive Latvian  citizenship. In this connection they believe that Latvia's  further destiny, the ensurance of its genuine, not imaginary,  national security and the possibility of the creation of a  democratic law-governed state will in many respects depend on  the world community's and, first of all, CSCE states' and  parliaments' stand on the issue, the address pointed out.    The Federation Council called on them "to uphold the  principles of humanism that are being asserted in Europe and to  prevent Latvia from slipping down to an aggressive nationalism  and the emergence of a seat of tension in the Baltic region".</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Gilbert Gobin: "Is the European Union Facing </F> a Hidden Crisis?"]    [Text] "Better a crisis than a bad compromise," Jacques  Delors said last week about the institutional arguments dividing  the 12 members of the European Union (EU) on the consequences of  its enlargement to include Austria and the Scandinavian  countries. The European capitals, including London, ended up  giving the green light to the compromise concocted last weekend  by the foreign ministers. But is it a good compromise? And will  it allow crisis to be avoided both in the EU and the United  Kingdom? This is far from sure.    Certainly, by choosing to tone down the dispute which has  been agitating them for several weeks, the EU governments are  indicating that the enlargement process can continue according  to the planned time schedule. Two and one-half months away from  the European elections, that could be interpreted as a sign of  confidence in the future, addressed to public opinion. And in  the perspective of the referendums which are to be organized in  the new member countries, it could cover over the poor  impression left by their indecision.    But before reaching that point, they must manage to convince  the European Parliament (EP) that the modifications are  acceptable. And it is far from certain that the MEPs will be as  conciliatory as the ministers themselves. After all, warnings  have been fired off from all quarters in recent weeks, far  exceeding nationalities and political families. The compromise,  proposed in Ioannina on Sunday [27 March] by the Greek  presidency and backed yesterday by the EU governments, allows  for the blocking minority to be adapted arithmetically from 23  (out of 76) to 27 (out of 90 votes) after the enlargement to 16  members, as 10 countries were demanding. But, in order to  answer the opposition from the British and Spanish, a vote of  between 23 and 26 could nevertheless allow negotiations to be  continued for a "reasonable period." What is this period and  how can it be defined? The question is unanswered and will  certainly be controversial.    Even if the principles of the supporters of a federal Europe  have been apparently safeguarded, it is no less true that the  rot has set in. That, to use the expression of the Commission  president, the solution contains a real danger of creating  "negative jurisprudence" which could have implications for the  more fundamental institutional reform which will take place in  1996. And that there has been an increase in the threat of  Community decisionmaking procedures being diluted. Even if  crisis does not break out today, it could well emerge in the  near future.    And, while we are waiting, it is far from certain that John  Major will manage on his side to overcome his domestic problems.  By choosing in the end to follow the most European-minded of  his cabinet, the British prime minister managed to avoid any  break with the continent. But now he is going to have to save  his head, which has had a price put on it by the Eurosceptics in  his party who are speaking only in terms of "surrender" and  "capitulation." That will certainly not be the easiest part.</p>

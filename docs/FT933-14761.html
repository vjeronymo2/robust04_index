			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: 8 MPs wrote to ministers on Nadir SIR Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, yesterday disclosed that eight MPs  -more than previously thought - had made representations to ministers about the case of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive former chairman of Polly Peck. But he dismissed demands to name all the MPs concerned. Of the eight, Sir Nicholas said, four had written or spoken to him or to his predecessor, Sir Patrick Mayhew, in the past two years. In a written parliamentary reply, Sir Nicholas explained the figure had risen to eight with the inclusion of letters written by two MPs to the then home secretary. So far, Mr Michael Mates, the ex-Northern Ireland minister who resigned over the affair, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, Mr Peter Lloyd, Home Office minister, and Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary and Mr Nadir's MP, have been identified as having contacted the attorney-general over the case.</p>

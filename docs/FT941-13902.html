			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Motoring: Mercedes aims for youth market and misses First, a cautionary tale. There was an old and much respected current affairs magazine. New copies were read in the libraries of London clubs and England's great houses and in first-class train and aircraft seats everywhere. And old ones in doctors' and dentists' waiting rooms. A few years ago the publishers decided its readers were getting old. We must, they said, make our magazine appeal to the affluent young. So they changed its editorial approach and waited for the subscriptions to roll in. Nothing happened. So what does this have to do with a motoring column? Substitute Mercedes-Benz for magazine and a picture emerges. Until recently, Mercedes-Benz was seen by financially successful people as the world's most desirable car. Heads of state and captains of industry rode in big ones. Smaller cars with the three pointed star were the choice of mainly middle-aged businessmen - and their wives. They still are. But for several years younger potential customers have looked elsewhere, feeling they were not yet old enough to drive a Mercedes. They went for BMW and Audi instead. (It is a problem Honda and Volvo are familiar with.) So, when it was time for the best-selling 190 to be replaced by the new C-Class, Mercedes-Benz saw its chance. It knew what to do. Make the styling curvier; use more powerful, multi-valve engines; improve the handling; and liven up the paint colours and interior trim. Has it done the trick? Are the affluent and trendy deserting their BMW 3-Series and 5-Series, their Audi 80s and 100s? It is early days. The new compact Mercedes is selling well. But if BMW and Audi are worried about their customers being seduced by the C-Class, it has not started to show. From a little over Pounds 18,000 on the road, it is not cheap, though neither is it extravagantly expensive. But it will hold its value. Number crunchers at fleet management companies forecast that three years motoring in a C-180 will cost less per mile than in a comparable Ford Mondeo or Rover 600. I dipped into the C-Class collection some months ago in Germany. More recently, I got to know a C-180 well during a week spent driving one in Britain. The three-pointed star I always find reassuring to drive behind was much less obvious than it had been on the 190 because the bonnet swept down so steeply. There was more space inside. The boot was even bigger. The driving position was familiar. The 1.8-litre, 16-valve engine - slightly more muscular than the old 190 E's 2-litre - was unexpectedly vocal during hard acceleration but nearly silent when cruising on a motorway. The C-180 handled neatly, rode as though it were a bigger car and was everything one expects of a Mercedes-Benz. Except, that is, for the interior. Mercedes-Benz offers the C-Class in four versions - Classic, Esprit, Elegance and Sport. Differences are mainly in trim level; Classic is the entry model, Esprit has lowered suspension and a folding back seat; Elegance, a powered sunroof and windows; and Sport, alloy wheels and stiffer springs. Never mind the names. You can have a 1.8, 2.0 or 2.2-litre four-cylinder or 2.8-litre in-line six-cylinder petrol engine, or four or five cylinder diesels of 2.1 and 2.5-litres capacity, with any trim. I drove a C-180 Elegance. I should have known it was the luxury version from the touches of polished wood veneer. But the interior ambience was otherwise strictly fleet model Vauxhall Cavalier. The disagreeably patterned fawn cloth trim may have youth appeal, though I doubt it. It certainly has none for me. All I can say in mitigation is that some of the other C-Class cars I drove in Germany plumbed greater aesthetic depths. They were trimmed in cloth that looked like surplus stock from a cheap-furniture factory. Standard colours of the C-Class include primrose yellow and baby blue; shades I suppose the naff interiors deserve. But how can they do this to my favourite car? Do they really think this lapse of good taste will be a turn-on for the under-30s? And finally, can anyone please tell me what is the German for: 'don't throw the baby away with the bathwater'. Without a rethink at Stuttgart, I fear that is what Mercedes-Benz just might do.</p>

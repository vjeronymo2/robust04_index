			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Haughey faces fresh row over phone tapping THE IRISH government was thrown into crisis last night following allegations by Mr Sean Doherty, a former justice minister, that Prime Minister Charles Haughey was fully informed of a 1982 phone-tapping affair. Mr Doherty, who is speaker of the Senate, the upper house, announced that he would be presenting his resignation today, amid signs that it would be accepted. The affair, which involved the tapping of two journalists' telephones in an effort to trace cabinet leaks, led to the sacking of Mr Doherty. Mr Haughey said at the time he would not countenance such actions by his justice minister and that it was an abuse of power. The fresh charges have been denied by a spokesman for the prime minister, who claimed they were at variance with the truth. At a news conference in Dublin last night, Mr Doherty said he had taken the blame 'to protect Mr Haughey' but he had decided to speak out now as a new phone-tapping bill was about to be presented to parliament. He said if he continued to protect Mr Haughey, 'I would have to lie to the Senate. I have never lied to the Senate and I will not do so now. 'I wish to reiterate this in specific terms,' he added. 'Mr Haughey retained all but one of the tapes I gave him, and at no stage indicated disapproval of the action that had been taken.' Mr Des O'Malley, leader of the Progressive Democrat party, the junior partner in the coalition government, said last night that Mr Doherty's claims raised serious concerns as they directly contradicted what Mr Haughey had said on the incident. Mr O'Malley said last year that if any further scandals were to shake the government he would have to reconsider his party's future in the coalition. The affair is likely to revive the leadership fight within Mr Haughey's Fianna Fail party. He narrowly survived a vote of no confidence in the parliament last November following a series of scandals involving state-run companies.</p>

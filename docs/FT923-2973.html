			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Letter: Encouraging the smart insiders and a lottery Sir, If legislation is to ban private meetings between investors and companies, information flow to the market will slow down and pricing inaccuracies will result. Real inside information is then very valuable and tempting to act upon. As consummate insiders, directors should not deal in their companies' shares at all, under the Treasury's logic. Insider trading is perhaps best curbed by improving transparency for analysts and investors, to reflect business value consistently in market price. Shareholders also need regular access to directors to evaluate their progress, if the Cadbury code is to be enacted. The Treasury's proposals will have the perverse effect of encouraging smart insiders who can cover their tracks. Markets will become less price-efficient, hopes for corporate accountability and governance dashed, the honest majority worse off. And why should capitalist acts between consenting adults in private be banned in a free society? How this government has changed its spots since associating with liberal marketeers in its earlier terms] Edmond Jackson, Chenies, Butlers Dene Road, Woldingham, Surrey CR3 7HH</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nissan slips into red for first time JAPAN'S biggest car manufacturers came under severe pressure last year as domestic demand remained weak and overseas earnings were hit by the strong yen. Nissan, Japan's second largest carmaker, reported parent pre-tax losses of Y26.3bn (Dollars 239.1m) for the year ended March, compared with profits of Y87.8bn previously. The company recorded its first ever net loss, at Y15.1bn, compared with a profit of Y54.2bn. Non-consolidated sales fell 8.7 per cent to Y3,896bn. The dividend is being halved to Y7 a share. Nissan blamed difficult trading on the steep decline in domestic demand for vehicles and the sharp appreciation of the yen. Last year domestic sales fall 17 per cent in unit terms and 18 per cent in value. Export sales, on the other hand, were up 4.2 per cent, largely as a result of an increase in sales of parts and components for overseas production. On a consolidated basis, sales were down 3.4 per cent to Y6,198bn, leading to pre-tax losses of Y108bn and net losses of Y56bn. There was a Y45bn write-off in Australia. In the current year, Nissan is projecting domestic vehicle sales of 1.2m units and overseas sales of 76,000 units. As a result, sales are expected to rise to Y4,000bn this year. Nissan is looking to break even both at the pre-tax and net-profits level. Pre-tax losses of Y40bn in the first half are expected to be reversed in the second half as a result of an improved trading climate and Y150bn in additional revenues stemming from higher prices and streamlining. The outlook from Mazda, Japan's fifth largest carmaker, is less optimistic. Mazda yesterday warned it would not be profitable this year following a steep fall in profits in 1992. The company saw a 5 per cent decline in non-consolidated sales to Y2,191bn, while pre-tax profits plunged 68 per cent to Y6.2bn. Net profits were 71 per cent down to Y2.6bn. Mazda, which is 24.5 per cent owned by Ford of the US, said it was also under pressure from high depreciation costs. Total factory unit sales declined 11 per cent for passenger cars and 22 per cent for commercial vehicles. The biggest setback came in the domestic market where unit sales were 16 per cent down, compared with a 7 per cent decline in overseas markets. Mazda's performance was disappointing even given the overall weakness of the Japanese car market last year, which declined 7.4 per cent in unit terms, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. Mitsubishi Motors reported a 8 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, to Y46.6bn, in spite of a 2.4 per cent increase in sales to Y2,615.9bn. While Mitsubishi saw a 67 per cent increase in sales of passenger cars, it suffered a 20 per cent fall in sales of mini-cars and double-digit declines in sales of trucks. The company forecasts a 1 per cent increase in volumes this year, a slight increase in sales to Y2,630bn, and an increase to Y48.5bn in pre-tax profits.</p>

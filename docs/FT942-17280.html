			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Sinn Fein lobbies as ceasefire begins A 72-hour IRA ceasefire came into effect at midnight last night as Sinn Fein leaders prepared to travel to London to deliver to Mr John Major a letter calling for a positive response to the republican initiative. Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein's national chairman, is today expected to use a London press conference to repeat calls for the British government to open direct talks with republican leaders aimed at providing 'clarification' of the Downing Street peace declaration. But there was still no sign last night that the IRA's gesture had succeeded in exposing differences between the British and Irish governments. London and Dublin have consistently criticised the ceasefire as inadequate and made clear their frustration at the IRA's refusal to declare a permanent end to violence. As Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, departed yesterday on an 11-day visit to North America, Downing Street rebuffed a call from Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, for a representative to be sent to meet republican leaders. Downing Street rejected Mr Hume's suggestion for a senior Tory backbencher to be appointed as go-between. It said: 'The situation remains the same. We are not going to get involved in anything like this.' The rejection came as Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, sought to increase pressure on the government by making it clear that Mr Hume's idea for an intermediary would meet its demand for direct talks. Sir Patrick said he would use his trip to welcome the strong support shown for the Downing Street declaration in both Canada and the United States and to reaffirm the government's determination to eliminate terrorism.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] We begin the home news segment of this cast with the  return to Libreville yesterday morning of Father Paul Mba  Abessole, leader of the National Lumberjacks Rally, from Paris  where he stayed for more than a month following the disturbances  in which nine people died in Libreville in February. The  opposition leader left Libreville for Paris on 8 March --  officially, to take a rest and to contact friends -- after four  days of violence in several Libreville districts from 21-24  February during which nine people, including two soldiers, were  killed. The government had then held Father Paul Mba Abessole  and his supporters responsible for the disturbances which broke  out when workers embarked on a general strike called by the  pro-opposition General Confederation of Free Labor Unions.  Father Paul Mba Abessole, who was welcomed at the airport by  over 100 supporters, made no statement on arrival.</p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOTT OSTLER: RARE PAIR STEPS FORWARD FOR UCLA  </P> <P> Half of UCLA's front court is built like a rock and has the touch of a  blacksmith.  </P> <P> The other half is built like a bread stick and has the touch of a diamond  cutter.  </P> <P> Between them, Trevor Wilson and Don MacLean can do pretty much anything you  might want your front court to do.  </P> <P> Score? Sunday, in an important Pacific 10 game against Oregon State at Pauley  Pavilion, they each had 26.  </P> <P> Rebound? Wilson grabbed 14 Sunday, MacLean 8.  </P> <P> Run? Wilson is a very quick 6-foot-8, MacLean a real smooth 6-10.  </P> <P> Play defense? When they put their minds to it.  </P> <P> Best of all, they're in sync, as dissimilar yet as well matched as Hap-pea and  Pea-wee, those pea-soup making twins.  </P> <P> That's because Wilson and Maclean have worn one another out on the basketball  court for many years.  </P> <P> "First time I saw Don was when he was in the sixth grade and I was in the  eighth grade," says Wilson, who is now a junior.  </P> <P> They were playing on opposing teams in the American Roundball Corporation, a  youth league in the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> They were both big, both very good, and within a couple of years they became  regular workout partners, even though Wilson lived in Sherman Oaks and MacLean  in the Simi Valley.  </P> <P> When MacLean was going into the ninth grade and was deciding to get serious  about basketball, he and Wilson worked out one-on-one, or two-on-two, every  weekend, workouts that continued for two years, then resumed last summer.  </P> <P> "He prepared me for high school," MacLean said. "He prepared me for this  season, too."  </P> <P> What more can you ask out of your power forward? Wilson not only rebounds  better than anyone in the conference, but he also has helped groom one of the  nation's two or three finest freshman basketball players.  </P> <P> MacLean might not even be a Bruin if it weren't for Wilson.  </P> <P> "I talked to him (during recruiting) about the possibility of us playing beside  each other," Wilson says. "We complement each other, we know where the other  one will be. But there were a lot of things going on at UCLA (Walt Hazzard  fired and Jim Harrick hired), so I couldn't tell him to come into a program  where I wasn't sure about the coaching situation."  </P> <P> Was Wilson's presence a factor in MacLean's decision to become a Bruin?  </P> <P> "It was one of the advantages," MacLean said.  </P> <P> In a way, MacLean coming to UCLA was a disadvantage to Wilson. His buddy, the  freshman, has overshadowed Trevor somewhat. MacLean is the phenom, the gifted  scorer with the beautiful touch.  </P> <P> But Wilson doesn't seem to mind sharing the spotlight. He and MacLean are  roommates, and Wilson is MacLean's biggest booster.  </P> <P> Trevor is proud of MacLean's un-timid style of play, proud that MacLean has  developed somewhat of a reputation as a woofer, a smart-mouth freshman.  </P> <P> "When they try to push him around or talk about him because he's a freshman, he  comes right back at them," Wilson said. "He's gotten a lot better, he fights  back now, he doesn't like to be pushed around."  </P> <P> Neither does Wilson, who despite the acclaim for MacLean and for senior guard  Pooh Richardson, might be the key Bruin on a team that has an outside shot at  the conference title.  </P> <P> The Pooh-led fast break most often starts with a Trevor Wilson rebound, and  he's second on the team in scoring, 18.7 to MacLean's 19.6.  </P> <P> "Trevor is just a great athlete," Jim Harrick said. "He has great quickness for  a forward, and when he consistently hits his medium-range jump shot, he'll be  ready (for the National Basketball Assn.)"  </P> <P> Right now he's definitely ready for the Pac-10. His 26 points Sunday were a  career high.  </P> <P> "I've had to pick up the intensity the last few games," Wilson said. "You have  to go all out, make a consistent effort. When people are pushing you, you push  back. It's hard to explain, but (Harrick) said I wasn't aggressive enough. I  watch film all the time, and I agree with him."  </P> <P> An aggressive Wilson is impressive. Sunday he scored seven of UCLA's first nine  points, then tossed an assist to MacLean. Trevor threw down at least three  dunks in the game, including one where he started to jam two-handed, changed  his mind in midair and swooped in for a right-hander.  </P> <P> Wilson is one of those guys who can intimidate the other team just by strolling  onto the court to jump center. He's a dedicated off-season weightlifter who  looks as strong as he plays.  </P> <P> He has helped push MacLean into weightlifting, although on MacLean the effects  of the iron are less obvious.  </P> <P> Separately, they have impressive skills. Together, they can be unstoppable.  </P> <P> The UCLA assembly line cranks out forwards one after another, fine-tuned and  NBA-ready. Sidney Wicks, Curtis Rowe, Keith Wilkes, Dave Meyers, Marques  Johnson, David Greenwood, Kiki Vandeweghe, people like that.  </P> <P> The team of Wilson &amp; MacLean, playground buddies from way back, could wind  up as good as any two the Bruins ever put on the floor.  </P></p>

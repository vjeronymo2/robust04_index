			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / US 'to use force' if Cedras stays The US will forcibly remove Haitian military leader Lieut-Gen Raoul Cedras and members of his de facto government if they do not leave office by October 15th, US government and military officials said yesterday, Reuter reports. Lieut-Gen Hugh Shelton, head of the US forces, said that Gen Cedras 'understands that as of the 15th he's out of here, and we'll be the ones to push him out if he doesn't leave voluntarily.' Senior US officials in Haiti also said President Emile Jonassaint and ministers of his de facto government would also be removed by US troops if they do not depart by that date. Earlier US officials had assured Congress that they expected American forces to leave Haiti by February 1996 at the latest. 'We fully expect that the entire operation in all of its phases will be over by February 1996, which is the date specified in the relevant UN resolution,' defence undersecretary Walter Slocombe told a hearing of the House of Representatives armed services committee. 'We are very conscious of the risk of getting sucked into things that seem like good ideas at the time that get us deeper and deeper in,' Mr Slocombe said. 'And we are going to resist that temptation.' The White House said President Clinton wanted to withdraw the US troops as soon as possible, but was pleased Congress had not demanded it by a certain date in a resolution passed on Thursday calling for a quick pullout. 'I think the president is obviously gratified that they did not include a certain date for removing the troops,' White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers said. The Senate and House voted on Thursday to approve a non-binding resolution urging a prompt, orderly pullout of US forces, but did not set a date. The Senate resolution also chided the president for not seeking congressional authorisation for the September 19 military intervention in Haiti. Ms Myers said it was 'no secret' that many lawmakers had wanted Mr Clinton to ask for congressional approval prior to the intervention, and that he had a 'longstanding disagreement' with Capitol Hill on the subject.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARTER ISSUE AGAIN BODES AN OCEANSIDE DONNYBROOK  </P> <P> Despite the illusion of political tranquility, Oceanside's latest plunge into  possibly becoming a charter city is rife with suspicions that are building  toward an open conflict.  </P> <P> A special citizens' commission is drafting a charter proposal with reforms  aimed at spreading political power throughout the city and, in the process,  helping minority candidates run for the City Council.  </P> <P> Specifically, the commission wants to switch from the existing system in which  the council's five members are chosen at large in citywide elections. Instead,  there would be a seven-member council, with the two additional members and a  full-time mayor being elected at large and four members being chosen from  special council districts.  </P> <P> "The big question is control of the city," said Brian Graham, the commission  chairman who points out that three current council members live near each  other. "We don't have true representation of the governed when most of the  council is from the same area.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of people who feel disenfranchised," he said, arguing that  carving out council districts would draw greater political participation from  all parts of the city.  </P> <P> Three council members live in the Fire Mountain area.  </P> <P> But there's a segment of Oceanside that thinks Graham's exhortations about  democracy ring hollow. They suspect that a new political system is a coy  attempt to keep a pro-growth majority on the council and make anti-development  candidates more vulnerable to attack.  </P> <P> "The movement to get this charter only surfaced when slow growth became a real  contender," said Nancy York, a local lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for the  council two years ago. "They're afraid a slow-growth majority will get on the  council."  </P> <P> The commission's recent public hearings have raised only scant visible interest  and debate. Seven people went to one session and 12 to another. But, York said,  "There will be organized opposition to this. No question."  </P> <P> It won't be the first time.  </P> <P> In 1986, Oceanside had a bruising fight over changing from a general-law city  to a charter city, the difference being that the latter form of government has  somewhat more authority over its affairs.  </P> <P> When the dust settled, the charter proposal, which involved establishing  council districts and beefing-up the city staff, was bluntly defeated by an  opposition vote of 61%.  </P> <P> Backers of that charter attempt maintain that the voters were largely soured by  the expense of creating new bureaucratic positions, but foes say there was also  much skepticism over dropping at-large elections and going to council  districts.  </P> <P> At any rate, the city is again exploring taking a new charter proposal before  the voters, perhaps as early as the June ballot. The debate so far has been  low-key, nobody wanting to do battle, at least until the commission finishes  drafting its plan. But nobody expects the peace to last.  </P> <P> "All the people against it in '86 are still against it. They don't want to come  out too early," said York.  </P> <P> "Oceanside has a history of taking its politics seriously," Councilwoman Lucy  Chavez said, remembering "two to three recalls and some of the rottenest  campaigns that ever were."  </P> <P> The rumblings so far on the charter issue suggest the city's tradition will  continue.  </P> <P> As Graham sees it, the commission's main work is to craft a plan that would  make local government more open. The plan's centerpiece would be enlarging the  council by two members, electing a full-time mayor with a $34,000 annual salary  (that's $10,000 more than the mayor is paid now), and establishing districts.  </P> <P> Graham, who beside leading the charter commission is also president of the  Oceanside Merchants Assn., claims that the changes would encourage minorities  to seek office and limit the influence of big campaign contributions from  developers.  </P> <P> Of Oceanside's 1988 population of 125,000 people, 61% were white, 21% Hispanic,  8% black and 5% Asian or other.  </P> <P> "Minorities in this city are shamefully under-represented" politically because  of the cost of campaigning and feeling there's little chance of getting  elected, Graham said.  </P> <P> It costs $10,000 to $15,000 to win a council seat, he said, adding "that's not  representative politics, that's big bucks." Graham says the remedy is to create  districts, including some that contain a significant minority population and  therefore a natural constituency for minority candidates.  </P> <P> Graham reasons that small election districts would reduce the influence of  special interests, on the theory that district candidates wouldn't have to  depend on large campaign war chests like citywide candidates do. However,  campaign spending reports in the city of San Diego showed that new  district-only elections did not reduce campaign spending.  </P> <P> "We're unstacking the deck," he said. "Right now, the only way to win a seat on  the council is big bucks from developers. If you go to district representation,  we break that power."  </P> <P> He said the commission hasn't decided yet who would draw up the election  districts, but he emphasized the need for objectivity.  </P> <P> But York contends that minority representation is a phony issue and argues that  there has been no problem getting minorities elected. She points to the current  council as an example.  </P> <P> "You've got an Hispanic (Chavez) on the council, women on the council, senior  citizens on the council, and two members with Native American blood," she said.  </P> <P> Another veteran foe of a charter, Harriett Bledsoe, who was active in the No on  Charter Committee in 1986, disagrees with Graham that creating council  districts would stem the power of special-interest campaign contributions.  </P> <P> If anything, Bledsoe argued, pro-growth forces might find it easier to defeat  candidates in small districts. "They can target an area and pour money in. A  person without a lot of money doesn't stand a chance," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RELATED STORY, A1  </P></p>

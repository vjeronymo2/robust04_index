			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Cookery: Guess who's coming to dinner . . . IT WAS TO have been a simple yet greedy feast a deux: asparagus to start, followed by wild salmon tails dressed with an olive oil variation on beurre noir, then soft goat's cheese with oatcakes or soda bread, and fresh cherries and apricots to finish. But it was not to be. Friends turned up unexpectedly and stayed to dinner. The thought of such impromptu entertaining sometimes seems daunting but, in practice, many cooks rather enjoy the challenge - occasionally. Sudden demands on resourcefulness can stimulate good ideas providing, of course, that there is a store cupboard worthy of the name on which to to fall back and that the refrigerator contains something other than the mouldy remains of a tin of tomatoes. On this occasion, I teamed the olives and capers with a few hard-boiled eggs for hors d'oeuvres. The asparagus and salmon then combined to make a ritzy, yet fresh-tasting, version of kedgeree, which went down so well that I have made it several times since. The cheese course and dessert ingredients were telescoped similarly, this time following an idea gleaned from food and gardening writer Lynda Brown. Wrap 1-1 1/2 oz mounds of soft goat's cheese in vine leaves that have been blanched and painted all over with olive oil. Grill the parcels gently until the contents are warm and the leafy surfaces begin to brown. Serve with a fresh apricot sauce made by stewing until tender some skinned and chopped ripe apricots, with a few tablespoons of water and vanilla sugar to taste. Partner the pud with chilled dessert wine. SALMON AND ASPARAGUS KEDGEREE (serves 4-5) Flecked generously with flavoursome goodies, this is a pretty dish: pink, green and white. The rice could be increased to 10 oz without any hint of meanness. The asparagus is cooked as I like it (neither fashionable semi-raw nor old-fashioned limp) but timing can be altered to taste. Ingredients: 2 salmon tail fillets weighing about 5 oz each; 12 oz asparagus; 8-9 oz basmati rice; 1 1/2 pt fish stock; about 3 oz butter; a bunch of flat leaf parsley; wedges of lemon for serving. Method: Soak the rice in cold water for 10 minutes or so. Wash, trim and scrape the asparagus. Cut it obliquely into 1 1/2 -inch lengths. Set the tips aside and put the rest into a steamer basket. Oil lightly the base of a second steamer basket, lay the fish in it skin side down, and season with salt and pepper. Bring the stock to the boil and stir in the soaked and drained rice. Cover and cook at a fast simmer for about seven minutes. Then, stack the steamer baskets over the rice and continue cooking for about eight minutes more. Put the asparagus basket immediately over the rice (the stalks will need about eight minutes, the tips about half that time so add them later) and place the salmon basket on the top of the pile, where the steam will be gentler so the cooking process is slower. This means that all three ingredients should be ready more or less simultaneously - the rice tender, the asparagus not collapsing but retaining a litle crunch, the salmon moist and just cooked through - but it is best to check progress by looking and tasting now and then. Adjust the flame, alter timings and re-stack the steamer baskets as necessary. Lift out the salmon as soon as it is cooked and lay it skin side up in a serving dish in which you have melted the butter. Strip off the skin and flake the flesh into the butter. Add a good grinding of black pepper, mix in the rice drained of the stock, and 5-6 tablespoons chopped parsley. Fold in the asparagus, check for salt and serve with wedges of lemon. SALMON WITH OLIVES AND CAPERS This recipe, which uses the same amount of fish as the kedgeree, makes an almost-instant main course for two people. Although the salmon is cooked to the same degree as in the kedgeree, the steaming process is quicker here because the fish basket is placed directly over boiling liquid. Ingredients: 2 salmon tail fillets weighing about 5 oz each; 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil; 1 tablespoon black olives (preferably tiny whole Nicoise olives, or stoned and sliced kalamata); 1 tablespoon chopped capers; 1 tablespoon chopped parsley; 1 lime. Lay the fish skin side down in a lightly-oiled steamer basket. Season with salt and pepper and steam over boiling water until it is just cooked through, about four minutes. Make the sauce while the fish rests. Heat the oil gently until hot and fruity. Draw the pan away from the flame and add a good seasoning of freshly-squeezed lime juice. Swirl to mix and stir in the olives, capers and parsley. Spoon the sauce over the salmon and serve garnished with wedges of lime.</p>

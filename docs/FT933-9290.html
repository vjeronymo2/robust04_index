			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: General Accident Since General Accident started to increase UK premium rates ahead of other composite insurers, it has consistently been furthest down the road towards underwriting profitability. Its solvency ratio of 47 per cent is now comfortable, but the company can still not afford to sacrifice underwriting profits in pursuit of market share. If that makes GA a leading indicator of UK insurers' resolve to make a decent return on underwriting, yesterday's interim figures contain a warning for the sector. Modest second-quarter underwriting profits are encouraging from personal motor and home insurance business and - were it not for the IRA bombing campaign in the City - from commercial property. Higher premiums and tighter underwriting standards are having the desired effect. But GA can see no room for additional rate rises in its more profitable lines of business. That leaves scope for perhaps another year of rising underwriting profits as the most recent price increases work through. By this time next year, though, competition may already be eroding those gains. With its business in the US, Canada and Europe still losing money at an underwriting level, there is scope for recovery elsewhere. Like other insurers GA also points to its investment return in addition to the underwriting result to give a measure of total performance. The recent rally in the sector has certainly been driven by expectations of investment gains from rising stock and bond markets. But insurance companies cannot expect to trade at much of a premium to net assets unless they add value to those assets by consistently making profits from insurance.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Kuchma seeks to bridge divisions Ukraine's president-elect, Mr Leonid Kuchma, yesterday sought to unite his divided nation and affirm his commitment to Ukrainian independence and economic reform. In his first public appearance since his victory at the polls, an ebullient Mr Kuchma said: 'I have never suggested that Ukraine should return to the Russian empire.' Pointedly, he spoke only in Ukrainian, even in response to questions addressed to him in Russian. 'I will work only for the benefit of independent, sovereign Ukraine,' he said. Mr Kuchma also held out the hope that the contested Crimea peninsula - the most dangerous flashpoint in Ukrainian-Russian relations and the most serious challenge to the integrity of the Ukrainian state - will be appeased with his electoral victory. 'Crimea has voted for Ukraine,' he said, alluding to the region's overwhelming support for his candidacy in Sunday's poll. He made encouraging promises to potential western investors and welcomed the Group of Seven industrialised nations' offer of Dollars 4bn in aid to Ukraine if it begins market reforms, but he refused to commit himself on the controversial issue of the country's nuclear status. 'I will refer to the nuclear question in the future, but first we must analyse it in greater detail,' he said, in answer to a question as to whether Ukraine will sign the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty, which expires this year. Mr Kuchma said his priority would be to act on his campaign promise to revive the economy, beginning with changes to Ukraine's punitive taxation policies and its fixed exchange rate system which often makes exporting unprofitable. 'The more we tax the less money we get in the state budget,' he said. 'The current taxation system is killing business. If we stop doing that I am confident that more money will flow into the government's coffers.' Before implementing his economic programme, Mr Kuchma must assert his control over Ukraine's government, thrown into confusion by the unexpected defeat of President Leonid Kravchuk. The president-elect struck an initially conciliatory tone, promising that there would be 'no witch hunt'. He also said he had met Mr Vitalii Masol, the prime minister, and was prepared, for the time being, to work with him, although there would soon be changes in the cabinet. Behind the placatory phrases, however, were signs that once he has established himself in office, Mr Kuchma intends to rule Ukraine with a strong hand. 'I did not take power in order to give it away,' he told reporters.</p>

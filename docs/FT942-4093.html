			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Float values VCI at Pounds 58.3m VCI, one of the UK's largest independent publishers of videos and pre-recorded music, has decided to go ahead with its planned flotation despite current market uncertainties and less than overwhelming appetite for new issues. The issue price of 150p capitalises VCI at about Pounds 58.3m, a shade below the Pounds 60m value hoped for. The float, designed to raise a net Pounds 28m for the company, mainly to pay off debt from a management buy-out in 1989, has been fully underwritten by Samuel Montagu with James Capel as broker. VCI, which pioneered the sell-through video market, selling rather than renting video cassettes, has rights to more than 1,000 titles in both video and music - including Thomas the Tank Engine, Sooty and Mr Bean. It is also about to move into personal computer software with games and educational titles. In 1993 VCI made operating profits of Pounds 5.9m before exceptional items on turnover of Pounds 59.8m. In 1992 operating profit fell from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 2.3m largely because of problems at Strand Magnetics, its manufacturing arm now disposed of and write-offs on childrens' programming following the entry of Disney into the market. At the issue price the historic price earnings multiple is 13.3 times based on pro forma earnings per share of 11.3p for 1993. The notional gross dividend yield at 150p is 4.6 per cent representing a notional dividend cover of 2.1 times. Mr Stephen Ayres, chief executive of VCI, said the group's overall share of the UK video sell-through market was 12.5 per cent for the five months to end-May. The decision to go ahead was helped by the fact that most of the significant video companies are part of large media groups and that the sell-through video market is continuing to expand. VCI, as a holder of rights, seems reasonably well poised to be involved whichever way technology takes the 'multi-media revolution'. The offer closes on June 17, with dealings due on June 23.</p>

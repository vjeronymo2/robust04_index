			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Trade and the World Economy (29): World Trade Organisation leadership The three offical candidates for leadership of the new World Trade Organisation, the grander and more powerful body which is due to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade at the beginning of next year. They are: Carlos Salinas, president of Mexico; Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister; and Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade minister. A decision is expected in late autumn on who should fill the post. However, establishment of the WTO - and the starting date for implementing the Uruguay Round - may have to be delayed if leading economic powers, including the US, the EU and Japan, have not ratified the agreement by the end of this year. Unlike the Gatt, the WTO will be a formal legal entity, with stronger powers to settle trade disputes and a wider remit, covering areas such as agriculture, textiles and trade in services. However, it also faces many challenges. As well as holding countries to their Uruguay Round commitments, it must seek to draft global rules in many new areas, at a time when accelerating changes and tensions in the structure of the global economy are testing consensus between Gatt members.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : PROSECUTORS MOVE TO DROP FINES OF BLUE  LINE RIDERS  </P> <P> Prosecutors on Wednesday took steps to dismiss the $90 fines levied against  four senior citizens who were ejected from a Blue Line commuter train because  of a 20-cent mistake on their transfers.  </P> <P> The move came after widespread news reports about the fines.  </P> <P> Thomas Romeyan, assistant head deputy of the district attorney's Compton  office, said the dismissal would be sought "in the interest of justice."  </P> <P> Willard Zahn and three others were charged with fare evasion after the Nov. 19  incident on the new rail line. The four boarded a bus in Long Beach and asked  for transfers to the Blue Line.  </P> <P> After they boarded the train, a sheriff's deputy checked their transfers and  discovered they had been given 5-cent tickets for transferring between buses,  rather than 10-cent transfers for switching to the Blue Line.  </P> <P> Deputies removed the four from the train and issued citations carrying $90  fines for each of them.  </P></p>

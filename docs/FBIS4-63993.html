			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>   [Text] Yuriy Dubinin, who led the Russian delegation at the  recent talks with Ukraine, has no doubt that the issues  connected with dividing the Black Sea Fleet which remain  unresolved "will necessarily be thrashed out."    As he told INTERFAX on Thursday, the talks between the  Russian prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and his Ukrainian  counterpart, Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, held in Moscow recently "cannot  be qualified as useless." "The premiers and the two  delegations did a lot of work and resolved virtually all the  questions relating to the implementation of instructions issued  by the presidents of Russia and Ukraine on April 15. A  resolution has been drafted. There are only a few elements that  need to be additionally studied and settled," he said.    The diplomat refrained from divulging the essence of the  "elements that still need to be settled" and the agreements  already reached. "We agreed with our Ukrainian partners that  none of us will reveal the details of our future accords or  allow `leakages'," he said.    Nevertheless Dubinin said that only a few issues remain to  be  settled. 10 to 12 days were allotted for this, he confirmed.  "We hope that after that an agreement will be signed," he noted.    According to Dubinin, the proposed agreement will be signed  by the two countries' prime ministers. "This might take place in  Moscow. After all the site of the next meeting is not of  paramount importance," he said.    When asked whether the latest frictions between Ukraine and  the Crimea were under discussion in Moscow, Dubinin said: "I  heard not a single word about those problems."</p>

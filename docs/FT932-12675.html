			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: 'Outsider' to add drive to IBM - The new broom at Big Blue's data storage arm INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is cutting its corporate apron strings and has appointed an 'outsider' as chief executive to accelerate the transformation of its Dollars 6.1bn data storage products operation. The aim is to turn the division into an aggressive competitor in the booming computer disk drive market. Last week IBM, known in the industry as 'Big Blue', established Adstar, its data storage products division, as a 'totally independent' subsidiary. The company also announced the appointment of Mr Ed Zschau, founder of Systems Industries, a Silicon Valley data storage company and a former Republican congressman, as Adstar chairman and chief executive. Adstar has become a testbed for IBM's strategies to return its key businesses to profitability by blending entrepreneurial spirit and vision with the scale, technology and manufacturing resources of its established operations. Mr Zschau has been charged with speeding up the transformation of Adstar from a predominantly in-house supplier of data storage systems for IBM mainframe computers into a leader in high-growth and emerging data storage markets, said Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM vice-chairman. Mr Zschau's appointment follows that of Mr Louis Gerstner, former chairman of RJR Nabisco, who took over on April 1 as chairman and chief executive of IBM. The changes at Adstar were in the pipeline before Mr Gerstner's arrival, but he 'enthusiastically endorsed' the plans, said Mr Kuehler. Adstar, which for the past year has been an 'independent business unit', will win even greater autonomy as a wholly-owned subsidiary, he said. However, IBM has no plans to sell off all or part of Adstar, he said. 'Adstar is one of our most profitable entities. We want to keep it.' In 1992, the first year for which Adstar's financial results were reported separately, it recorded net earnings of Dollars 247m before a Dollars 512m restructuring charge. However, more than 90 per cent of Adstar's sales last year were 'intra-company', and its flagship products address the shrinking market for data storage systems that work with IBM's mainframe comp-uters. Still, Adstar remains the world's largest manufacturer of computer data storage products, and over the past 40 years it has claimed numerous technology breakthroughs, including the invention of the 'Winchester' disk drive, the forerunner of today's personal computer 'hard drive'. Yet, like IBM as a whole, Adstar faces technology trends that could undermine its business. Standard, low-cost disk drives used in personal computers are becoming the building blocks for high volume data storage systems for use with mainframe computers, replacing the proprietary systems that Adstar manufactures. Price competition has forced Adstar to retrench. Last month, it closed its manufacturing operations in Rochester, Minnesota, with the first compulsory lay-offs in IBM history. The cuts also affected three European plants, including IBM's manufacturing operations in Havant in the UK, and one plant in South America. All have been designated as 'industrial business centres' by IBM and have to find new customers if they are to remain in operation. 'We have to refocus investments where the growth opportunities lie - in disk drives for workstations and personal computers, as well as non-information technology applications of data storage,' said Mr Kuehler. The latter may represent Adstar's biggest opportunity. 'We forecast a market that is five to 10 times bigger than today's Dollars 50bn data storage market,' says Mr Ray AbuZayyad, an IBM veteran who has served as general manager of Adstar for the past three years and who was named president of the sub-sidiary last week. Adstar must find ways to exploit the changes underway in the data storage market, Mr Zschau maintains. New applications of computing in the home and in the car - such as video telephones, home information services, cable television 'movies on demand', and maps and on-line traffic information for the driver - will all require data storage products, he predicts. Adstar will 'skate where the puck is going to be, not where it is,' adds Mr Zschau, using an ice-hockey metaphor. Adstar also aims to sell 'components' of data storage technology - including semiconductor chips, software programs or other elements of data storage - that could be licensed to other disk drive manufacturers. IBM's competitors in the disk drive market may be more willing to buy from IBM now that Adstar is an independent subsidiary, Mr Kuehler suggests. For its part, Adstar will no longer have any qualms about trying to market its products to IBM competitors in the personal computer, workstation or other computer market segments. 'I don't know the things I'm not supposed to do, and I don't want anyone to tell me,' says Mr Zschau. This, he suggests, is the advantage of being an 'outsider'.</p>

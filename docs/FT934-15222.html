			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Radio 5 plans are condemned THE INDEPENDENT radio industry yesterday attacked the BBC's plans to replace Radio 5 with a news and sport format, saying it would limit the choice available to those applying for the third national commercial licence, to be based mainly on speech. Mr Stewart Francis, chairman of the AIRC, the industry trade body, said: 'News and sport was the last great format.' He added that the BBC should have to make 'promises of performance', and stick to them. His comments came as the BBC set out its evidence for its belief that sport and news can co-exist on the new Pounds 30m national radio network which will replace Radio 5 next April. Mr Phil Harding, taskforce leader for the new network, provided the research evidence that sunk the concept of a 24-hour news network on Radio 4 longwave and instead persuaded the BBC governors to go for the new network - its motto is 'first and live'. Mr Harding, a former editor of Radio 4's Today programme, told of the detailed plans drawn up to demonstrate how the new network would have coped with the evening of September 21. The evening combined a heavy football programme with President Boris Yeltsin dissolving the Russian parliament. The new network would have managed to 'cover' the events in Moscow, handle 60 minutes of the Huddersfield v Arsenal match while still being no more than 2 minutes away from announcing all 65 goals scored that evening. The new BBC news and sport service will be broadcast on medium wave 909 and 693, and will cost Pounds 30.2m a year to run, compared with Radio 5's cost of Pounds 23.7m. About 75 jobs will be lost at Radio 5, although all of those involved will be interviewed for jobs resulting from the new service. Children's programmes will be the main losers in the shake-up. About 200 hours of stories and drama are broadcast for children each year on Radio 4. This is being reduced to 75 hours. Primary schools programmes will move to Radio 3 FM in the afternoons, youth programmes will move to Radio 1, and Open University coverage will go to Radio 4 longwave.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (6): Monterrey captures entrepreneurial spirit THE CITY of Monterrey in north-eastern Mexico, 200 kilometres from the border with Texas, has long been known for its entrepreneurial spirit. Sitting beneath the bone-dry mountains of the Sierra Madre, Monterrey - with its freeways and fast food stores - often appears to have more in common with the United States than with Mexico City. Close though it is to the US, Monterrey cannot insulate itself from the Mexican economy. Its companies are feeling the effects of slow growth which has brought an end to the boom times in Mexico's third largest city, at least for now. The companies face further challenges from the North American Free Trade Agreement, if it comes about. If Monterrey's corporations cannot handle the competition from the north, there seems little chance for most of the rest of corporate Mexico. The descendants of the founders of Monterrey's industrial base are still prominent on the boards of the companies: members of the Garza family are chairmen at Femsa and Alfa, the Sadas at Vitro and the Trevinos and Zambranos elsewhere. Their companies are often conglomerates - built up when Mexico's economy was closed to the outside world and when expanding into other businesses was the only wayto grow. The opening of the Mexican economy has forced on many of them a different business strategy. Many have shed peripheral businesses to concentrate on one sector. Others still seem reluctant to sell or cede control of any businesses, defying the conventional management wisdom that success stems from specialisation. In the past few years, some of Monterrey's families have diversified further particularly into the financial sector, buying banks in privatisations. Monterrey's companies are nonetheless probably better known outside Mexico than ever. Many are pushing into new markets; others are raising capital internationally.</p>

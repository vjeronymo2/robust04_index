			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): New issues UK investors applying for shares in BSkyB, the satellite broadcasting group, will be able to specify a price level beyond which they do not want to go, writes David Blackwell. Applications will be based on the amount of money people want to invest, rather than on the number of shares, as the price will not be decided until December 8 - the day dealings start. The minimum investment is Pounds 500. Yesterday, the group launched its UK retail offer of 36.4m shares, part of the global offer of 343m. They will be priced somewhere between 233p and 268p, and the allocations will be decided after the offer closes on December 6. The price range gives the group a valuation between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 4.6bn. Twelve share shops where investors can register have been established at various high street banks and institutions. There will also be application forms in the national press. Earlier this week, the flotation of Telewest Communications indicated strong interest by investors in broadcasting - the offer was six times subscribed. The shares were priced at 182p on Wednesday, valuing the group at Pounds 1.8bn. Telewest, a 50-50 joint venture between TCI of Denver, the largest US cable operator, and US West, the regional telephone company, will be the first UK cable company to join the London Stock Exchange. Dealing is expected to begin in London and the Nasdaq exchange in New York on Wednesday. Research Machines, a supplier of computers and computer software to schools and colleges, said on Thursday that it was coming to the market not to raise money but to raise its profile. The group, relatively unknown outside the UK education market, is making a placing likely to value it at about Pounds 30m. On Monday, Samax, which is developing mines in Africa, postponed its float until early next year. It had planned to raise Pounds 16m by the end of this month via a placing by stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Laing, on terms that would have valued the company at about Pounds 50m. Samax blamed adverse conditions in the new issues market.</p>

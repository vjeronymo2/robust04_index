			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Spring sets out coalition terms Ireland's parliament yesterday adjourned after failing to elect a new prime minister, paving the way for a week of intensive horse-trading as political parties search for a fresh coalition government. Mr Dick Spring, Labour party leader, set out tough new conditions for Labour to go back into partnership with Fianna Fail, Ireland's largest party, following last week's break-up of the 22-month coalition and the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds as prime minister. He is calling for a new freedom of information law, an easing of the rules on cabinet confidentiality, more accountability on judicial appointments and a review of official secrets legislation. He also wants recent ministerial pay rises rescinded. The Labour leader's 'strategy for renewal', unveiled to the parliamentary party over the weekend, is partly a response to last week's crisis when Mr Reynolds misled parliament over the attorney-general's role in the controversial case of a paedophile priest's extradition. Mr Spring has struck a popular chord on many of the issues. The question of cabinet confidentiality has already been challenged unsuccessfully in the supreme court when, during the beef tribunal, Mr Reynolds was accused of selective cabinet document leaks in the investigation into the misuse of official export credits in the beef industry in 1991. The Labour proposals are broadly in line with ideas outlined by Mr Bertie Ahern, the new Fianna Fail leader, on Saturday. Opinion remains divided within Labour ranks about whether to join forces again with Fianna Fail, with many of the latter's ministers implicated in Labour eyes in the extradition case. Moreover, many Fianna Fail MPs are still bitter about Mr Reynolds' downfall. One issue of contention could be Northern Ireland policy, where Mr Spring is keen not to be sidelined as he was by Mr Reynolds. Mr Spring may have to look for a partnership with the conservative Fine Gael and one of the smaller parties, which could be more problematic given Mr Spring's personal difficulties with Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader.</p>

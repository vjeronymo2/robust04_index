			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- The head of the largest  party in the ruling coalition reiterated opposition Tuesdayto  proposed legislation to deal with emergencies that could stem  from North Korea's refusal to fully open its nuclear facilities  for inspection.    "We have to make utmost efforts within the constraints of  the  pacifist Constitution," said Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the  Social Democratic Party, who spoke to reporters at a Tokyo hotel.    Murayama's remarks followed disagreement Monday during talks  among representatives of the coalition parties over Japan's  stance toward North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons  development program.    During the talks, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of core  coalition party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], proposed  establishing domestic legislation in preparation for a possible  naval blockade of North Korea.    Ozawa reportedly told the meeting, "Unless Japan prepares  its  domestic laws beforehand for a quick response to the situation  such as a naval blockade, Japan would not be able to do anything  at a time of contingency."    The SDP opposed the legislation, saying it would contravene  Japan's longtime constitutional interpretation that it is not  allowed to commit its military for collective military action,  even to defend its security.    Murayama also told reporters, "It is a prerequisite to make  utmost efforts through negotiations (with North Korea) to  prevent such a contingency from breaking out."    Meanwhile, Murayama called on other coalition partners to  speed up the process of naming a successor to outgoing Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    "We have to launch a new government as quickly as possible  and we must conduct preparations to call a parliamentary  election to name the new head of government tomorrow," he said.    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is head of Shinseito, has  emerged as the most likely replacement for Hosokawa, who  announced on April 8 that he will step down over an alleged  financial scandal and delays in Diet deliberations on the fiscal  1994 budget.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Books: Homely view of the Bard - Fiction MRS SHAKESPEARE by Robert Nye Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 216 pages A DOUBLE LIFE by Frederic Raphael Orion Pounds 14.99, 374 pages EINSTEIN'S DREAMS by Alan Lightman Bloomsbury Pounds 11.99, 179 pages SHAKESPEARE wrote in a sonnet full of ironic rudery: 'My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun.' With hair like black wire and dun-coloured skin, she even seemed, poor woman, to have halitosis. Husbandly rather than lover-like frankness? Robert Nye thinks so. Anne Hathaway, eight years the elder and no match for her husband's London life, is the Dark Lady of the sonnets, according to Mrs Shakespeare. The Stratford boy married in a hurry at 19, had three children before he was of age and two years later bolted to make his fortune. He made it and in the end came home, but in the meantime left Anne with a one-parent family and the in-laws. When she comes to write about him, he has been dead seven years and she still has no notion of his greatness or even his fame; as for his immortality, the thought of it never crosses her mind. Yes, he did better than might have been expected, but in a raffish world and a dubious cause: the theatre and poetry. Poetry is not for her, any more than the theatre is: 'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?' her husband asks. 'No thanks]' says she. And yet, though she has never read him ('I read my Bible'), she loves the memory of him - his slyboots ways and bad teeth; their long separations and their week of offbeat sex on her single visit to London; his thinning hair, his passion for sugar. Sir Smile, the dirty devil, the crafty crow, my bad husband, as full of secrets as a cow's tail is full of burrs, the magpie man, the darling: all these he may be and her tenderness is oblique. But as the everyday jottings of a woman who has lived, unaware of it, close to genius, Mrs Shakespeare beguiles and persuades. It is winning, too, and amazingly easy to read, since almost every sentence is given a new line of its own, and so it comes out like small barks of monologue, all sharp commonsense and funny, unexpected and touching no-nonsense. A Double Life, a straightforward, well-tailored novel, with chapters alternating between past and present, is a hard grind by comparison. Doze a moment and you may miss a vital clue, for this is a psychological detection. Who is the narrator and what the dickens is he up to? Dickensian only in its proliferation of plots and characters, the novel lacks humour and humanity, although Mrs Shakespeare might have seen it as weirdly clever and desperately observant. Over-observant, indeed. Nothing happens or is noted without dangling suppositions and improbable subtleties about which, the characters all being coldly watched by an unsympathetic narrator, it is hard to care. Guy de Roumegouse is a French diplomat with good credentials from his Resistance days and a notable lack of chums in the present. Nobody seems to like him and it is soon clear why: he is unlikeable. For no very clear reason he always does what he doesn't want to do and says what he doesn't mean, marrying two women he neither loves nor wants, the first a bitch called Berthe, the second a dim one-time nurse called Maureen. Prostitutes, one of whom, perhaps ironically named Pia, is murdered with his wife's coat in her room, feature importantly on the edge of his life. Frederic Raphael's writing is so tight-packed it demands a response of warmth and interest which this novel makes it hard to give. Paradox is his main stylistic weapon or weakness, a see-saw of syntax and opinion balanced between this and that, the double life of the title in action. It is strictly realistic, nonetheless; and realism that does not convince defeats its own end: you can see, even appreciate, every detail, yet fail to find the spirit, the inner life. A relief, after so thick a pudding, to come across something as endearingly short, airy and irrational as Einstein's Dreams, which is described in a rather far-fetched way as fiction. A series of short essays on the theme of time, it is teasing, stimulating and remote from direct experience, yet set firmly in particular times and places (1905, the year in which Einstein was working out his relativity theory; and Switzerland). Sometimes it goes too far over the temporal top and reminds one too clearly that it is fantasy, but mainly it keeps within the limits of what seems like straight-faced discussion and makes one grateful for the grace of its writing; indeed, it seems the sort of book to hoard and treasure for bleak times and empty spaces. Salman Rushdie was reminded by it of Calvino's Invisible Cities. A good comparison: both have the same sweet unreason.</p>

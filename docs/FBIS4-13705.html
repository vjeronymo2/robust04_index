			<p>BFN     [Text] Colonel Mustafa al-Karrubi, member of the Libyan  leadership council, was received today by President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani, to whom he presented a written message from  the Libyan leader, Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi.    Conveying Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's warm greetings to our  country's president, Mr. Karrubi said the aim of his trip to  Iran is to find ways of deepening fraternal relations between  Iran and Libya and to activate the joint commission in order to  increase the volume of economic and trade exchanges between the  two countries.    He reported on the political and economic situation in Libya  and said: The political and economic sanctions imposed on Libya  by some Western countries are unjust and violate international  law.    For his part, Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed gratitude for the  Libyan leader's friendly message. He said relations and  cooperation between the two countries is at a good level and  emphasized the need to expand them.    Referring to the political and economic pressure of world  arrogance against independence-seeking countries, the president  said the path of independence and refusal to surrender to the  bullying which dominates the international order is filled with  difficulties but leads to desirable results.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani also emphasized the need for a peaceful  and just solution, through international organizations, to the  existing differences between Libya and some Western countries.</p>

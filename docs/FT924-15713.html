			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (10): KLM Royal Dutch Airlines - Company Snapshot In a difficult year for the airline industry and the onset of price wars over the Atlantic, KLM reported a 72 per cent decline in first-quarter net profit in mid-August, due partly to a widening of losses at NorthWest Airlines, the US carrier in which it owns a substantial minority stake. Other factors behind the downturn were higher interest charges and the absence of book profits on the sale of aircraft. KLM is in the midst of a cost-cutting programme, but productivity of its workforce improved by 14 per cent, compared with the first quarter last year, says the company. In the UK, KLM is based at Hatton Cross, Heathrow Airport: it has 670 staff at 10 UK sites. Human resources systems: Percom for personnel, recruitment, organisation charting, training administration; Smart Systems for time recording and rostering; SPA Plan for pensions; Saville and Holdsworth for interviewing and psychometric testing; Lotus for spreadsheets (1-2-3) and desk-top publishing (Freelance); Percom and Multimate for word processing; Carapay bureau for payroll. The systems run on a Novell network linking IBM personal computers. System cost: Pounds 100,000.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by J. Tibor Keri on statements made to him by </F> Attila Zsigmond, Hungarian Democratic Forum deputy and chairman  of the parliament's Cultural Committee: "Media Law Possible by  Spring"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Attila Zsigmond (MDF [Hungarian  Democratic Forum]) rejected opposition suggestions that passage  of the media law is not in the government's interest. He  announced that the government coalition indeed wanted and still  wants the law to be created and that the government has a role  to play in ending the parliament's negligence, which violates  the Constitution. He added that the irregular situation that has  developed in the media is not advantageous to anyone.    The chairman of the Cultural Committee said that the  experts'  draft of the media law is finished and that the ministries are  now holding discussions on it to resolve their differences.  Until conciliation is achieved, the draft cannot be submitted to  the National Assembly. The chairman of the Cultural Committee  asserted that he is confident that the government's  recommendation will build on those elements of the draft law on  which a consensus developed previously. He does not see any  chance, however, for changing the so-called appointment law,  which this parliament passed, or for "upgrading" the role of the  Radio and Television Office.    According to Attila Zsigmond, if everything goes well,  committee debate on the media draft law will start in February,  and resolution of differences among the parties will be able to  proceed concurrently. Zsigmond would particularly like to urge  the latter. If political agreement can be reached, work on the  law can speed up significantly, he added. In that case, the  media law can be passed by the middle of April, the chairman of  the Cultural Committee emphasized.    Zsigmond also asserted that a clean campaign does not depend  on passage of the media law. What is absolutely necessary is a  neutral stance on the part of journalists and honesty on the  part of the political participants in the campaign. He added  that now even those people who previously paid only lip service  to passing the media law want it passed. Countless problems  could have been avoided with television and radio if the media  law had been passed before, he pointed out. [passage omitted]</p>

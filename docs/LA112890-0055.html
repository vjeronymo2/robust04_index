			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURGEON DRAWS JAIL TERM, $1-MILLION FINE FOR THEFT  </P> <P> A Coronado heart surgeon was sentenced to six months in jail, fined $1 million  and placed on five years' probation after pleading guilty Tuesday to the theft  of 70 rare coins from a prestigious Manhattan coin society.  </P> <P> Dr. Juan Suros XII appeared in a New York City courtroom and pleaded guilty to  a count of grand larceny. The conviction is a felony and may jeopardize Suros'  California medical license.  </P> <P> Officials from the state Board of Medical Quality Assurance have said they will  investigate Suros' conduct. Earlier this month, a board official told The Times  that if disciplinary action is taken it could range from a public reprimand to  revocation of Suros' license.  </P> <P> Under a plea-bargain agreement with New York prosecutors, Suros, 49, will serve  his jail sentence at the Descanso honor camp in San Diego County begining Jan.  13.  </P> <P> The $1-million fine includes $160,000 in reparation to the American Numismatic  Society, the owner of the coins. The $1 million will be paid in yearly  installments of $200,000.  </P> <P> Suros and his New York attorney, Don Birnbaum, were not available for comment  and have declined interviews.  </P> <P> Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for the New York district attorney, said the jail  sentence and fine were required by New York law. The fine reflects the value of  the stolen coins, all of which were recovered.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Suros had argued that the value of the stolen coins was only  $50,000.  </P> <P> Angry officials at the numismatic society told prosecutors the theft of the  coins had caused them irreparable harm.  </P> <P> "In the course of his depredations, Suros created a mess that can never be  wholly untangled," chief curator William E. Metcalf said in a letter to  prosecutors. " . . . The damage to the society's good will is, by definition,  incalculable."  </P> <P> Suros was a member of the numismatic society when he was arrested on April 15,  1989, at the exclusive Harvard Club in Manhattan by New York City detectives. A  search of his briefcase revealed 13 stolen coins.  </P> <P> San Diego police found 57 stolen coins, most of them rare Spanish and Mexican  pieces, among a collection of 2,000 coins when they searched Suros' home and  office.  </P> <P> As a member and benefactor of the society, Suros was allowed to handle coin  trays when he visited the group's office. Police said curators began to notice  in February, 1989, that coins would disappear every time Suros handled the  trays.  </P> <P> Suros, who graduated from the University of Barcelona in Spain, also uses the  name Juan XII, Count of Besalu. He is board-certified in cardiovascular and  thoracic surgery and has an office in Chula Vista.  </P></p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Free-for-all unlikely on Sundays Partial deregulation of Sunday shopping will mean more stores opening on Sundays but is unlikely to lead to a free-for-all. It is likely to be mainly larger, out-of-town stores which open. With many leading grocery chains - including Sainsbury's, Tesco, Safeway, Asda and Gateway - already opening between one-third and three-quarters of their stores in defiance of the law, the overall number is not expected to increase significantly. The difference may be more marked in the stores sector. Marks and Spencer has refused to open any of its stores in England and Wales on Sundays, but said yesterday that it would be forced to open in some areas to avoid losing market share. John Lewis Partnership and Sears also said they would have to review their policy. If the Sunday trading bill becomes law next year it will leave one important anomaly. A store of slightly less than 280 sq m (about 3,000 sq ft) would be allowed to open freely, while a slightly larger one selling a similar range of goods would be restricted to six hours. All shops larger than 280 sq m will be allowed to open for a continuous period of up to six hours between 10am and 6pm. They must, however, observe certain rules, including notifying their local authority 14 days before they plan to open, and displaying their permitted opening times. There are maximum fines of Pounds 5,000 for failing to notify the authority and for trading longer than six hours, and of Pounds 500 for failing to display the opening hours. Some categories of outlet, such as pubs, petrol stations, and restaurants, are not restricted to six hours and can open at any time. Shops in Scotland, where Sunday trading is fully de-regulated, will continue to enjoy the right to open at any time.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT THE 12 BIGGEST STORE GROUPS SAY THEY WILL DO  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Group           Chains            Stores that        Plans                                   open now  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- J.

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (3): Timetable proved too tight - The G30 settlement targets were unrealistic THREE years ago the Group of 30, a Washington-based think tank, laid down a blueprint for national settlement systems in securities markets around the world. Its nine proposals were intended to galvanise thinking in financial centres across the globe, providing an international standard, and a timetable, against which local developments could be measured. And most of it had to be completed by the end of 1992. Three years on, the G30's targets look to have been hopelessly unrealistic. 'It was always too optimistic,' says Mr Dick Feehan, senior vice-president in London of Bankers Trust, one of the biggest global custodians. 'They expected things to happen too fast. I just think it's lost momentum.' The G30 is due in the coming weeks to produce its latest review of how far settlement arrangements in the main financial centres have come to meeting its targets. It is expected to show further significant advances from last year. However, as Mr Feehan suggests, there is still a long way to go. One of the biggest hurdles to be overcome is the move to settlement within three days of a trade taking place. In the US, there are profound doubts in many quarters about such a short settlement cycle, which is suited more to institutional than retail investors. And the UK does not even have a system of rolling settlement, let alone one that works on a three-day cycle. Despite the amount of work that still needs to be done, the G30 has few doubts that it was right to set the tight timetable it did. 'We recognised that the targets were ambitious,' says Mr Julian Gibbs of Barclays, a member of the working party that drew up the recommendations. 'But we realised that if we didn't put tight deadlines into our report, people would just delay their decision-making.' The soundness of the G30's proposals has not been dented by the fact its timetable has proved too ambitious, he adds. A recent endorsement by Iosco (the International Organisation of Securities Commissions) suggests the G30 was working along the right lines. Earlier this autumn, an Iosco report on settlement arrangements in emerging markets endorsed the G30 recommendations. Good intentions do not necessarily mean the ideas will ever see the light of day, of course. The appalling state of settlement arrangements in some developing markets has been exemplified this year by the securities scandal that has shaken India: ancient and decrepit settlement arrangements provided the opportunity for abuse when soaring activity in financial markets outstripped the capacity of the systems to cope with it. Scandals like that in India, and the need for emerging markets to compete for investment funds, are likely to prompt modernisation. But as international fund managers are only too well aware, good settlement is usually an afterthought in the opening up of domestic stockmarkets to international capital. The UK, meanwhile, remains one of the developed countries which is most behind in meeting the G30 recommendations. Clearing and settlement remains largely a manual process, making it prone to errors, and settlement still only takes place up to four weeks after a trade has happened. Despite this, there is a strong belief throughout the securities industry that London's settlement problems are about to be laid to rest. The Taurus project, which will see settlement first of all automated and then put on to a rolling basis, has entered its testing stages this autumn. A nagging fear that the whole project would eventually be shelved, after more than a decade of debate and planning, seems largely to have been laid to rest in recent weeks. For Mr John Watson, the project manager who has led the London Stock Exchange's Taurus development, it is a vindication of several years of effort. He denies that the project is running years late and over budget. 'We're now very much at the stage where I said we would be,' he says. And he adds that it took four years and around Pounds 80m to build Relit, the French system - roughly the same time and budget that Taurus's construction will have taken, if it is completed next autumn. Whether the UK is then ready to move quickly to three-day rolling settlement will depend on what happens in the next few months. Few big UK companies have yet asked their shareholders' permission to amend their articles of association, something that is necessary before they can move to a paperless system for recognising and transferring the ownership of shares. Most are due to hold their annual general meetings in the first part of next year, giving them the chance to make the switch. But if too few make the transition, it will be impossible for the Stock Exchange to move quickly to a shorter settlement period.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Observer: Filling the Italian job The selection of a new head of Confindustria, the Italian industrialists' confederation, has been turned into confusion following the withdrawal of the candidature of Fiat boss Cesare Romiti. The 68-year-old Romiti emerged as the unquestionable choice among Confindustria members to succeed Sergio Pininfarina, who has held this key job as chief spokesman for the private sector of Italian industry since 1988. But his candidature became a question of conflicting loyalties. Confindustria needs a prominent industrialist who can deal from a position of authority both with the government and with the unions. However, Romiti has also proved himself equally invaluable to Fiat's ruling Agnelli family. A tough, even authoritarian, manager, he helped steer the group through a bitter period of industrial strife in the 1970s. Although he has gathered around him a team of executives in their late 40s, his departure would have posed a big problem for the Fiat management at a time when the group, especially the automotive sector, is being squeezed by recession and increased international competition. Indeed, the refusal of Gianni Agnelli, the Fiat boss and one of the three 'wise men' selecting the next head of Confindustria, to release him underlines how much the group has come to depend upon him. This is all the more so when Gianni Agnelli, 70, is preparing for the succession of his younger brother, the 57-year-old Umberto.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / African peacekeeping force 'has moved nearer' President Francois Mitterrand claimed yesterday the idea of an inter-African peacekeeping force to intervene in future Rwanda-style crises had 'advanced' at the Franco-African summit in Biarritz, adding France would ask other European countries to join it in providing help. But not all the 35 African leaders present favoured or promised to take part in such a force, and most backers of the idea said it depended crucially on non-African assistance. 'This pan-African structure of 'blue helmets' will only be really operational if France and other friendly countries give us their logistic support,' President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo said. The French president stoutly defended his often-controversial Africa policy at a summit dominated by discussion of the Rwandan bloodshed and its consequences, but to which Paris had not invited Rwanda's new leaders. President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire was one of those who criticised France for excluding Rwanda, though the Zairean leader's own presence in France, which has denied him a visa for the past few years because of his human rights record at home, stirred a separate controversy. President Mitterrand vaunted France's record of economic help to Africa before and after last January's devaluation of the French African franc (CFA), and of security assistance, especially French troops' intervention in this summer's Rwandan civil war. Mr Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur want to avoid repeating France's painful exposure in its Operation Turquoise in Rwanda, at the start of which more than 2,000 French troops were joined only by 230 Senegalese. President Sylvestre Ntibantuganya of Burundi, which faces the same ethnic tensions as Rwanda, made clear he would prefer diplomatic help rather military intervention. The French president said the summit participants had agreed on 'certain general principles' that an African intervention force would be under 'collective command, acting under the aegis of the UN or the Organisation of African Unity'. But some leaders appeared divided on the issue of who should take part. President Omar Bongo of Gabon said Rwanda had given urgency to discussion of an African force, but talks should first take place among French-speaking countries. President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso said that discussing security in west Africa made no sense without English-speaking Nigeria or Ghana. French leaders are keen for the widest possible participation in an intervention force to avoid accusations of neo-colonialism. But Vice-President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, which along with Zimbabwe, Ethiopia and Eritrea was represented at the biennial summit for the first time, indicated his new government would not take part in any force, even though its army is the continent's most powerful. Mr Mitterrand, who said he hoped several European countries would join France in providing logistic support to an African force, is to meet Mr John Major, UK prime minister, in next week's Franco-British summit in Chartres. President Bongo said yesterday he had been one of the strongest opponents of the CFA devaluation, but now conceded it was necessary and was benefiting most of the 14 economies concerned. He urged Africa's creditors to forgive more of the continent's debts.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" by China editor Cary Huang] </F>   [Text] Beijing is moving to press the Hong Kong government  to change its newly formulated financial policy, which Chinese  researchers claim to be a plot to create a "bubble economy" that  will burst after 1997.    A research report suggests Beijing should urge the Hong Kong  government to clamp down on speculative activities in the real  estate market.    It proposes that the Chinese government should negotiate  with  the Hong Kong authorities to increase land supply and speed up  the redevelopment of land in urban areas, thus easing the short  supply of housing and cooling down the bubble economy created by  property speculation.    It says overheating in the property market has greatly  worsened Hong Kong's investment environment and undermined its  status as an international business centre.    Chinese sources said yesterday that the report, jointly  prepared by researchers from China-funded institutions and  enterprises in the territory concluded that the Hong Kong  government had amended its long-term financial policy to create  a bubble economy in the runup to 1997.    Last month's 1993-94 Budget report presented to the  Legislative Council by the Financial Secretary indicated a  policy change by the authorities, Chinese sources cited the  research findings as saying.    Following the breakdown of the 17-round marathon  Sino-British  talks over constitutional reform, the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office ordered local China-funded research institutions  to conduct an overall study into the Hong Kong government's  financial and economic policies in the later transitional period.    It was aimed at exposing any plot by the British to  undermine  Hong Kong's economy after its attempts in the political field  failed.    The report said the Hong Kong government had moved to  undermine the territory's financial basis by cutting its revenue  structure. It had narrowed the tax base by cutting corporate tax  from 17.5 per cent to 16.5 per cent and increasing the income  tax allowance.    It said the corporate tax of 17.5 per cent was the lowest in  the world as far as ratio was concerned, and the smallest in the  world regarding share of total government revenue.    The report said every government should depend for its  revenue mainly on direct taxation--corporate and personal income  tax--as both reflected the overall economic situation of a  community.    But the government had amended its financial policy to shift  its revenue sources from healthy economic growth to speculative  activities in property and stock markets.    "It sounds like repeating the experiences in South America  in  the 19th century," said a Chinese economic source referring to  the bubble economy created by colonists.    The Hong Kong government was to blame for the overheated  property market, and was the biggest speculator in the  territory. Through encouraging speculative activities on the  real estate market and receiving as much as 75 per cent of its  revenue from the sector, the government was capable of cutting a  healthy, substantial and steady revenue from other sectors.    The revenue structure was an apparent plot to undermine the  financial position of the future Special Administrative Region  government.</p>

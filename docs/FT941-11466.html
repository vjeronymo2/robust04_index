			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Pratt &amp; Whitney in JAL deal Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US yesterday clinched a Dollars 400m (Pounds 266.6m) engine order to power Japan Airlines' fleet of new Boeing 777 wide-bodied aircraft against fierce competition from its US rival General Electric and from Rolls-Royce of the UK. JAL's decision is a bitter blow for both the UK aero-engine maker and GE in the three-way battle to sell high thrust engines to power the new generation of wide-bodied aircraft expected to account for an increasing share of the world market during the next 10 years. P&amp;W, a subsidiary of the United Technologies conglomerate, conceded yesterday that the competition for the JAL order had been 'a nail biter', although the US company had been the favourite to win. The deal comes at a time when large engine and commercial aircraft orders continue to be scarce because of the financial problems of many airlines, and the three engine manufacturers are having to invest heavily in the development of engines with thrusts of more than 100,000 lbs. The battle for the 40 engines to power the 20 Boeing 777s ordered by JAL pitched P&amp;W's PW4084 engine against the GE90 and Rolls-Royce Trent 800. The win now gives P&amp;W 51 per cent of the market so far for 777 engines compared with 29 per cent for GE and 20 per cent for Rolls-Royce. The UK company yesterday admitted it was disappointed but said it had always regarded the competition as 'very difficult'. P&amp;W has now secured the engine market for all 777s ordered by Japanese carriers. Both All Nippon Airways and Japan Air System had already selected the PW4084 engine to power their 777s. This was one of the decisive factors in JAL's selection of the P&amp;W engine because the three Japanese carriers are seeking to reduce operating costs through a joint maintenance programme for their new aircraft and engines. The new Boeing 777 will be rolled out for the first time next April. The first aircraft is due to enter service next year with United Airlines of the US having P&amp;W engines. Rolls-Royce, which is investing about Pounds 400m in the development of the Trent, last week announced it had set a new world commercial engine power record by running its Trent 800 at 106,000 lbs of thrust. This topped the previous record set by the GE90 at 105,400 lbs of thrust. But the commercial success of the Trent has not matched the engine programme's technical achievements. Rolls-Royce has so far won orders and options for 100 Trent 800 engines to power Boeing 777 aircraft ordered by Cathay Pacific, Emirates and Thai International.</p>

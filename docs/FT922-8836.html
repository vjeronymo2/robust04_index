			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Arts: Tippett's Fifth Quartet - Music The Lindsay Quartet's recital on Saturday was originally planned to launch the Sheffield Chamber Music Festival for 1992. But the group's leader Peter Cropper was taken seriously ill several months ago, and the bulk of the festival (focusing on British works) has had to be postponed until next year. Happily, though, Cropper's recovery allowed the first concert at least to take place, and with it the first performance of Michael Tippett's Fifth Quartet, commissioned by the Lindsay for the occasion. The whole programme had been shaped around the premiere. It was introduced by a Fanfare to welcome Sir Michael Tippett by Christopher Brown, 87 bars woven out of Tippettian fragments and quotations from Purcell, together with three of Purcell's string fantasias, played with exquisite poise and intensity. Then there were two fascinating revivals of quartets by Tippett's teachers at the Royal College of Music during the 1930s - R. O. Morris's three Canzoni ricertati were dry, over long exercises in imitative counterpoint (Tippett observed after the performance that perhaps he should have given Morris some lessons) but Charles Wood's Third String Quartet was a likeable piece of late romanticism, with firm feet in the quartet language of Brahms and Dvorak, and a sweet tooth for morsels of Irish folk song. The Lindsay played both magnificently, with a confidence and grasp of idiom remarkable for works so far outside the regular repertory. Their playing of the Tippett too was astonishingly assured; its considerable problems of balance and co-ordination seemed perfectly mastered. The new quartet is cast in two movements, the first a sonata-form mosaic of fast and lyrical sections, the second a slow meditation interrupted by fantasia-like dances.                          *      *      * There are thematic links with Tippett's major scores of the 1980s - Geraint Lewis's programme note pointed out connections with material from The Mask of Time and New Year - but its roots seem to stretch back much farther into Tippett's writing for strings. The first movement seemed the less convincing of the two, short on distinctive ideas and perhaps over-extending its material. But in the second the juxtaposition of rapt untethered lyricism in the first violin's high-lying, unaccompanied rhapsodies with the crystalline rhythmic shapes of the Purcell-inspired dances conjures up memories of Tippett's Corelli Fantasia from the mid-1950s, if without ever quite attaining that work's level of profoundity or transcendency. On repeated hearings too the first movement may well gain more coherence and identity. As Tippett's debt to Beethoven in his quartet writing becomes ever clearer (the second movement here is based on the great Adagio of Op. 132) so the full implications of his abstract designs become more elusive. The seemingly innocuous intent of many of the components should not be taken at face value. His dramatic writing has become more increasingly emblematic; perhaps his instrumental writing has acquired the powers of suggestion and ambiguity lacking there.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 12 KYODO -- U.S. Ambassador to Japan  Walter Mondale announced Saturday night [12 March] that the  United States and Japan have reached an agreement on the opening  of the Japanese cellular telephone market.    In a statement released by the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo,  Mondale  praised the Japanese Government for its hard work in resolving  the long-standing problem.    "The government of Japan will take all available measures to  ensure compliance with these commitments," the statement said.    Among the commitments are "to build 159 new base stations,  containing an additional 9,900 voice channels, according to an  agreed quarterly schedule, to provide coverage for 95 percent of  the population by December 1995, and to reallocate spectrum for  use by the U.S. technology-based system," it said.    "This agreement demonstrates that the U.S. and Japan can  work  together to achieve real market access in Japan," it said.    Meanwhile, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori  Kanzaki issued a statement on the Japan-U.S. agreement, which  read as follows:    1. Mr. Walter F. Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan, and I  have come to a final agreement today on the cellular phone issue  between Japan and the United States of America.    2. Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) has drawn up a plan for  expanded installation for the North American-type analog  cellular telephone system and transfer of a part of the spectrum  currently allocated to the company to the North American-type  system portion. The Government of Japan and the Government of  the United States of America have decided to take measures  including holding of regular meetings to assess implementation  of the IDO measures.    3. The Government of the United States will terminate  actions under Section 1377 of of the Omnibus Trade and  Competition Act in response to these measures to be taken by the  Japanese side.    4. I would like to pay respect for cooperation by Ambassador  Mondale and the efforts made by the corporations concerned  during the process leading to the resolution of this issue. I  earnestly hope that the settlement will translate into  maintenance and further development of the good economic  relationship between the two countries.    Later the same night, Mondale and Kanzaki had a joint news  conference at the Post and Telecommunications Ministry.    Mondale said the agreement is a good example for promoting  the U.S.-Japan trade framework talks. He added that although  the cellular phone negotiations are different from the framework  talks, both sides should have heart-to-heart discussions with  utmost effort.    Mondale also said the agreement will facilitate competition  in high technology and will eventually benefit Japanese  consumers.    Kanzaki said that Japan did not agree to setting of  numerical  targets with the agreement.</p>

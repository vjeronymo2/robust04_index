			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / 'Nuclear umbrella' call for EU France, along with Britain, should consider extending the umbrella of their nuclear deterrents to defend the rest of the European Union, Mr Alain Lamassoure, the French European affairs minister, said yesterday. Addressing a Franco-German conference in Paris, where, Mr Lamassoure was careful to say it was only his 'personal wish' that Paris and London should extend their current bilateral discussions on nuclear doctrine to include a European role for their nuclear weapons. But he stressed the Balladur government's desire that the EU's planned 'treaty of 1996 should do for foreign and defence policy what the 1992 (Maastricht) treaty did for money' in planning a single currency. The French minister also outlined, before several leading German politicians, his blueprint to make European institutions more workable and democratic by boosting the importance of the Council of Ministers, while rendering it more accountable to the European Parliament.</p>

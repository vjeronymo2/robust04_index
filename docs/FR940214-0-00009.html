			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statement of Consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This suspension removes the requirement that producers be paid on the basis of the base and excess plan for the months of July and August 1994. The proposal was submitted by Carolina/Virginia Milk Producers Association, Inc., Dairymen, Inc., and Southern Milk Sales, Inc. These cooperative associations have a substantial amount of milk pooled on the Georgia milk market. In support of their proposal, the cooperative associations state that the suspension is needed because in recent years milk in this area has been in short supply during July and August. Without the suspension, the cooperatives contend the market's base and excess plan would discourage production in those months. They further state that it is necessary to take this action well before the proposed suspension takes effect to address the desire of individual dairy farmers to have knowledge of the base payment period prior to any base purchases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several producers in Georgia filed comments in opposition to the proposed suspension. The producers state that the proposed suspension would force them to be paid on the blend price which would reduce the price they receive for their milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the order's base and excess plan, producers establish ``base'' on the basis of their production during the months of September through January and are paid on the basis of their ``base'' and ``excess'' milk during the following months of February through August. The plan was suspended during August 1993, the most recent base-paying month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the suspension of the base and excess payment plan in July and August, producers would be paid a blend price for all of their milk during those months. In July 1993, the last month the base and excess payment plan was operative, there was a 24-cent difference between the blend price and the base price. The difference between the blend price and the excess price however, was $3.96. Thus, while it is true that, without the plan, producers would receive somewhat less for their base milk, this difference is far less than the $3.96 difference between the blend price and the excess price, which is a major impediment to keeping milk that is in excess of base milk on the market. It is also a major obstacle to fluid milk handlers in attracting supplemental milk supplies on a direct-shipped basis from producers in nearby markets. Under the plan, such producers would be only entitled to the excess price for all of their milk shipped to the market because they had not earned base in the Georgia market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the past two years, the Class I utilization of producer milk tightened markedly during the months of July and August. For example, the Class I utilization in 1992 increased from 74.9 percent in June to 75.5 percent in July and to 79.7 percent in August. In 1993, the Class I utilization similarly increased from 77.6 percent in June to 89.7 percent in July and to 84.4 percent in August. These figures indicate that the market is extremely tight during the months of July and August and that there is merit to the request to remove any disincentive producers may have to increasing production or shipping supplemental milk to the market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The suspension will increase the amount of milk available for fluid use in the Georgia market. It will allow fluid milk handlers to attract supplemental milk supplies from producers in nearby markets. Additionally, producers with excess milk will not be encouraged to shift off the market in July and August and thereby detract from the basic function of the order in assuring an adequate supply of milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The benefits of having an adequate supply of milk available to meet fluid needs outweigh the benefits which would accrue to producers who would receive higher prices. Accordingly, the proposal to suspend the base and excess payment plan during July and August 1994 is adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1007  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Milk marketing orders. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, title 7, part 1007, is amended as follows effective July 1, 1994 through August 31, 1994: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1007_MILK IN THE GEORGIA MARKETING AREA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

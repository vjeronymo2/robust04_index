			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory revolt looms over Budget VAT move THE GOVERNMENT faces an all-party Commons inquiry into the impact on the poor of imposing value added tax on domestic fuel, amid signs that the Budget change could trigger a backbench Tory revolt. The social security committee is expected to launch next week an investigation into whether extra payments promised by the Treasury will cover the increased burden on low-income households. Unease surfaced among MPs as Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, refused to commit the government to compensate pensioners or people on low incomes in full for the impact of VAT. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced on Tuesday that VAT will be charged at 8 per cent on domestic fuel and power from April next year and at 17.5 per cent from April 1995. Mr Portillo sought to rely on the pledge in the Budget statement that the increase in bills would be taken into account when income-related benefits were uprated in the autumn through a formula based on the retail prices index. But, under pressure from Labour, the limits of that pledge became more clear as Mr Portillo emphasised that in some instances people on income-related benefits were over-compensated for price rises which in practice affected them very little. The Treasury estimates that the extension of VAT to domestic fuel will raise the retail prices index by less than 1 percentage point. A cross-party committee inquiry would heighten the political row over the Budget. Mr David Shaw, the Tory social security committee member who demanded the investigation, said: 'If something so sensitive comes up in the Budget, we have got to look at it.' Social security ministers believe that the Treasury will not agree to an increase for all pensioners which fully reflects the impact of the VAT change. Instead they are expecting some form of targeted payment which would not apply to all the 9.9m who receive the basic retirement pension, but would go to people on income support and on family credit. Mr Andrew Bowden, Tory chairman of the all-party group of MPs campaigning for pensioners, said on ITN yesterday that it was 'no use just increasing the income support rate. There has got to be an increase in the basic pension for all pensioners.' Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, last night wrote to Mr John Major seeking confirmation that people on income support would be compensated in full. Downing Street was unworried yesterday by the Tory backbench reaction, but the discontent could give the government cause for concern when the finance bill implementing the Budget is considered in detail.</p>

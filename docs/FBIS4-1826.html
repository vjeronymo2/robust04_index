			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Fan Chun (5400 0689): "CPC's Hong Kong Policy </F> Becomes Increasingly `Leftist'"]    [Text]Jiang Zemin Faces Criticism From Veteran  Cadres, Army Officials    "Even without an agreement with the British, we are capable  of and confident amount maintaining Hong Kong's smooth  transition."    "Hong Kong's economy will not be affected by politics."    These are the assurances given by Chinese officials to Hong  Kong people on different occasions. When China and Britain  suspended talks on Hong Kong's constitutional reform, however,  Hong Kong's stock and real estate market remained brisk,  presenting bright prospects.    However, the author heard something quite different in  Beijing: "The central authorities have made a rightist mistake  on the policy toward Hong Kong."    "We cannot barter away our principles."    "We should resolutely take over Hong Kong."    In the face of overbearing criticism from the top CPC  levels,  Jiang Zemin had to make some "clarifications."    While meeting with and feting veteran Army officials and  cadres in Beijing in early February, Jiang Zemin explained the  policies of the CPC Central Committee and answered their  questions. For a long time, these veteran army officials and  cadres had had misgivings about certain matters. Taking the  rare opportunity of their meeting with the party general  secretary, they sharply raised a wide range of questions,  including Army building, hegemonism, current social reality,  understanding of Marxism, and Hong Kong's transition. Of these,  the Hong Kong question was full of gunpowder. One person asked  Jiang Zemin: "Did the CPC Central Committee commit a mistake of  rightism in dealing with Britain over the question of Hong Kong?  Did economic interests override state sovereignty and dignity?"  <H5>  "Never Before Has the Policy Toward the British Hong Kong </H5> Government Been So Identical as Today"]    In the face of the question that regarded "left" as "right,"  Jiang Zemin replied: "This criticism is not correct. We are  fully prepared, as we had estimated the political and economic  challenges deliberately made by Britain during Hong Kong's  transition period. I hope the comrades present will rest  assured. The CPC Central Committee will never make any  compromise on questions of principle!"    Another person asked: "Is it true that the central  departments do not have a unified policy in dealing with the  Hong Kong question?"    Jiang Zemin raised his tone in the reply: "We can guarantee  you that the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the  State Council, and the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress [NPC] share identical views on the Hong Kong  question." He especially quoted Deng Xiaoping's latest  instruction: "Since the founding of the PRC, the policies of  the CPC Central Committee regarding the British Hong Kong  Government and the U.S. hegemonists' interference in China's  internal affairs have never been so identical as today."  <H5>  The Problem Can Be Resolved Easily When the British Side Has </H5> Further "Gone Off the Rails"    Regarding the question of Hong Kong's early recovery, Jiang  Zemin also conducted "ideological work." Of course, he stood by  some comrades who criticized Britain, saying: "As Britain has  violated and undermined the Sino-British Joint Declaration;  openly negated the agreements reached between the two  governments; incited hostile forces in Hong Kong to launch  anti-Chinese Government activities; and brazenly interfered in  the Basic Law, which is purely an internal Chinese affair;  comrades within the party, the Army, people's organizations, and  basic levels have urged the central government to adopt resolute  measures to recover Hong Kong at an early date. We have legal  grounds for such a move, as well as the political environment,  economic strength, and the backing of the 1.2 billion Chinese  people." Jiang then gave an account of the central committee's  policy: "However, a decision can be made only after judging the  development and changes of events. We are fully prepared  against the turbulence during the transition period and at the  initial period of the establishment of the Special  Administrative Region [SAR] Government. It is definite that the  British colonialists will create trouble politically,  economically, and socially. We should let the British  colonialists fully perform at the stage. Only when they have  fully exposed themselves and have gone off the rails will it be  easier to resolve the problem."    Jiang Zemin reiterated his position to the veteran Army  officials and cadres: The Chinese Government and the Chinese  people will never forget the base action of British perfidy; we  will never forget British plunder, slaughter, and aggression  against China during the Opium War; we will never forget the  British support and participation in China's civil war; and we  will never forget the British participation in the economic  sanctions imposed against New China for over 30 years. I can  assure you that after 1 July 1997, we will never allow the  remnants of the British colonialists to remain, we will not  allow the British colonialists to enjoy privileges, and we will  never allow foreign forces to meddle in Hong Kong's affairs.  The British authorities were informed long ago of our position  and principled stand.  <H5>  Li Peng Backs With Clear-Cut Stand the Leftist Line Pursued </H5> by the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch    Moreover, Premier Li Peng took the opportunity of his  participation in the inaguration of the Daya Bay nuclear power  station to brief relevant departments. In Shenzhen on the  afternoon of 5 February, Li Peng listened to an account of Hong  Kong given by Zhou Nan, director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch.  Present on the occasion were Zou Jiahua, Ding Guangeng, Xie  Fei, Lu Ping, and Lie Minqiu.    News of the meeting was blacked out. While meeting with  reporters, Zhou Nan refused to disclose that he had discussed  the question of Hong Kong with Li Peng. He simply told the  reporters to ask Li Peng.    It has been reported that Li Peng gave a five-point  instruction at the meeting:    First, the central authorities have highly appraised the  work  of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and  the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, which have implemented the central  policies in a comprehensive manner;    Second, the rule of the British colonialists will end on 30  June 1997; if any drastic changes take place during this period,  the central government will take over Hong Kong earlier in light  of the established principle and policies. This is China's  national policy;    Third, the central government is capable of maintaining Hong  Kong's economic prosperity following the establishment of the  SAR Government on 1 July 1997 so that Hong Kong can continue to  serve as an international financial, industrial and commercial,  and transportation center;    Fourth, regarding the political, economic, and social  troubles created by the British colonialists during the  transition period in an attempt to sow the seeds of turmoil and  confusion for the future, it is necessary to continue to  heighten vigilance, expose the plot, and adopt countermeasures  to protect the interests of the vast number of Hong Kong  compatriots; and    Fifth, under the principles and policies of the central  government, it is necessary to continue to unite all Hong Kong  figures who love the country and Hong Kong, and who are willing  to take part in Hong Kong's construction, including foreign  figures in Hong Kong who support the Basic Law and who are  willing to contribute to Hong Kong's prosperity.    In his speech, Li Peng straightforwardly expressed his  support for the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, which was aimed at the  criticism made by certain figures with foresight that the XINHUA  Hong Kong Branch was taking an increasingly "leftist" line.  This gives people much food for thought: Is it tantamount to  bureaucrats' shielding one another or has the XINHUA Hong Kong  Branch simply followed the line of Li Peng?  <H5>  Assuming the Posture of "Political Examination" of Hong Kong </H5> Civil Servants    Zou Jiahua also delivered a speech. He made the following  two main points: First, how should we deal with the British  unilateral constitutional reform? Second, can the  department-level civil servants take the through train? Zhou  continued: "Without the blessing of the Chinese side, we will  not recognize or undertake any responsibility for the political  system, economic matters, and things introduced unilaterally by  the British side which transcend 1 July 1997. All Hong Kong  civil servants now in office may continue their service after  1997 and the conditions may be more preferential. However,  there definitely will be changes in the department-level chiefs.  The Chinese Government and the Chinese people will never  recognize or accept the continued occupation of senior posts by  British agents after 30 June 1997. The three-tier council  elections introduced by Britain can last only until 30 June  1997.... How can the Chinese Government accept and inherit the  elections introduced by the British colonialists after the  change of sovereignty and administration?"    Following the breakdown of Sino-British talks, there are  indications that Beijing is taking the highly efficient  contingent of civil servants of the Hong Kong Government as the  target of attack. Now they have openly assumed the posture of  "political examination," and even have intimidated some  senior-level civil servants, which is bound to exert an adverse  influence. No wonder a conscientious senior-level cadre in  Beijing said indignantly: "In this way, they are undermining  the basic framework of the Hong Kong Government. How can the  concept of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong be realized in a  state of anxiety?"</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Personal annuities on par with staff schemes - Pensions Tax rules for approved pension schemes are to change. One aim is to make personal pension scheme annuities taxable on the same basis as pensions paid by occupational pension schemes. Another is to improve arrangements for monitoring the tax affairs of occupational pension schemes to ensure that the conditions on which tax reliefs are given continue to be met. The government also wants to remove a requirement for the Inland Revenue to approve the form of certain annuity contracts before they can be marketed to occupational pension schemes by insurance companies. The Inland Revenue said yesterday that the purpose of the changes was to improve the operation of the tax regime for approved pension schemes. At the moment, annuities paid by approved personal pension schemes are treated as annual payments, so that basic rate income tax is deducted from each instalment. For some people on small incomes too much tax is deducted and they have to reclaim the tax overpaid. Mr Clarke intends to change the basis of the charge for those annuities from Schedule D to Schedule E, bringing them within the PAYE system and allowing the correct amount of tax to be deducted from each annuity payment. This change will bring the taxation of personal pension annuities into line with those payable under occupational pension schemes, and will apply in general to annuities paid after April 6, 1995. Once pension schemes have been approved for tax purposes they are monitored by the Inland Revenue's Pension Schemes Office to see if they continue to comply with the conditions on which tax approval was granted. The Commons Public Accounts Committee has recommended improvements to the nature and extent of these compliance checks. In response to the PAC report post-approval compliance work has been expanded. The purpose of the Budget proposal is to improve the effectiveness of this compliance work. The Finance Bill will provide for regulations to be made which will define clearly the identity of the person who is responsible for looking after the tax affairs of an approved scheme, and specify more clearly the records which that person must keep. The Bill will also introduce a monetary penalty on people who make false statements in order to obtain the benefits of the pensions tax reliefs. One of the ways in which trustees of an occupational pension scheme can secure the benefits to be paid to a person who leaves the scheme before retirement age is through an approved deferred-annuity contract (often called 'buy-out contracts'). Under the Budget proposal, the requirement that these buy-out contracts must be in an approved form will be removed from July 1 1994. This will bring the tax rules into line with the requirements of the Third Life Insurance Directive (one of a series of directives implementing the single market in financial services throughout the European Union). New procedures, which have been discussed with pensions representative bodies, will ensure that the present flexible options available to pension scheme members can continue.</p>

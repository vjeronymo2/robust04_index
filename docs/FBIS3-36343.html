A detective had a conversation with Rozhok in the latter's  apartment.    The head of the Estonian security police, Juri Pihl, has  earlier said his department had no reasons to implement any  measures against Rozhok, as the man had committed no concrete  action against the Estonian State.    Rozhok says he received a formal order to appear in the  office of the Estonian Defense Police in Tallinn on Jan. 24. He  said he had refused to go because his appearing before Estonian  investigators had not been agreed upon with the Russian embassy  in Tallinn.    The representative of Zhirinovsky's party says he received  another call from a defense police official on Jan. 25. The  official, who had identified himself as detective Sergei Melnik,  had used expressions of "threat and blackmail" while speaking to  Rozhok on the phone, Rozhok said.    Rozhok also said he had delivered all publications in the  Estonian press concerning his activity in the country to the  Liberal Democratic Party faction in the Russian parliament.    Rozhok said Estonian security police officials had later  appeared in the place where he works. He claims the country's  security police had "worked out a number of schemes" for his  arrest.    "As long as violation of the rights of Russians and  exploitation of the Russians' labor continues in Estonia, also  my political activity toward the protection of their rights will  continue," he said. He also claimed that ninety-nine percent of  the reports published on him in the Estonian press were "a lie,  intertwined with threat and blackmail."</p>

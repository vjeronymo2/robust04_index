			<p>BFN     [Text] France seems to be working on a major new diplomatic  initiative in Rwanda. Yesterday, it was calling for the  organization of a regional summit to end the genocide. Today, it  was hosting Faustin Twagiramungu, the Rwandan interim prime  minister-designate, who was appointed by the Arusha accords as  representing a kind of third way between the Rwandan Armed  Forces and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front].    Faustin Twagiramungu held talks this afternoon at the  Foreign  Ministry in Paris. A Foreign Ministry spokesman this evening  revealed that there had been a broad consensus. According to the  spokesman, the prime minister-designate insists on the validity  of the Arusha accords, on condemning extremists on all sides,  and on setting up an international tribunal to judge those  guilty of the massacres. Twagiramungu will also see President  Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Balladur.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Venezuela takeover for banks The Venezuelan government has become de facto owner of several domestic banks as a result of heavy financial assistance to the sector in the wake of the failure of Banco Latino, the country's second-largest bank, last month. In return for aid to banks hit by unusually large withdrawals in recent weeks the administration has taken as collateral assets and shares at several banks amounting to 51 per cent or more of their stock, according to a Caracas banking official. While neither the government nor individual banks were willing to provide details, press reports yesterday said the banks receiving most aid from the Central Bank and the deposit guarantee fund were Banco Maracaibo, Banco Construccion, Banco La Guaira, Banco Barinas, Banco Metropolitano and Sociedad Financera Fiveca. Mr Julio Sosa, finance minister, has made it clear the government does not wish to own these banks or to 'nationalise' the banking system.</p>

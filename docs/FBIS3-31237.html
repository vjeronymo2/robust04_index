			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As we mentioned in the headlines, Radovan Karadzic,  president of the Srpska republic, held a news conference today.  He spoke about the current political circumstances surrounding  the resolving -- that is, the complicating -- of the situation  in and around Bosnia. Coming up now, at the beginning of our  bulletin, are several highlights from the address the president  of our republic delivered to a large number of reporters.    [Begin Karadzic recording] The truth of the terrorist event  in Merkale [Sarajevo's marketplace] has further crystallized.  There is an increasing amount of evidence that this was a  terrorist act. There are clear testimonies that no one heard any  whistling sound from the shell and that, evidently, this was not  a shell. The crater is too small. The number of dead and  wounded is out of all proportion for a 120-mm shell. Turkish  doctor (Senegal Karlovac) told CNN, in its diplomatic licence  program, that he had seen the wounded and that all their wounds  were inflicted below the waist level, that some of the wounds  were burns, that there were no traces of alien material -- that  is, no shrapnel in the bodies and that most deaths had been  caused by internal damage to organs due to the explosion.    It is evident that the wounds and burns are most likely to  have been inflicted by phosphorus. We have been in contact with  a group of Israeli experts on terrorism. They told us this  morning that, on the basis of all the data they had, they were  able to draw a conclusion that this was a cone-shaped explosive  whose flat side was aimed at the victims, that this explosive  was either triggered on the spot or dropped from a neighbouring  building, and that this was the form of terrorism practised by  Hezbollah and Afghans.    I also want to tell you that we have obtained reliable  reports that the Muslim side is planning to stage further  incidents, probably once the ultimatum deadline has expired.  There is also a plan for an attack by Muslim forces disguised  in Serbian uniforms on a small UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  squad, most probably a French squad. According to this plan  there would be no survivors, all the soldiers would be killed,  and even several dead Serbs, wearing uniforms of the Serb army,  would remain on the spot, having been killed earlier. This is a  very hellish plan which is supposed to fuel the tension in the  world which is at the moment by and large on the wane. [end  recording]</p>

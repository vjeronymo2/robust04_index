			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OPPOSING SIDES STATE CASE: TO SPRAY OR NOT TO SPRAY?  </P> <P> Regarding the protests by Co Long Pham and others that agricultural officials  have failed to adequately warn the Vietnamese community (in their own language)  in Orange County's Medfly spraying area, (Jan. 25), I have two questions:  First, why have they lived in Orange County for more than a decade and not  learned English yet; and secondly, are Pham and Yudelson aware that we voters  established English as our official language a few years ago via Proposition  62?  </P> <P> I have no grudge against members of any racial or ethnic group who come to live  in America. But if you want to be aware and informed, then buckle down and  learn the language!  </P> <P> J. B. KIEL  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

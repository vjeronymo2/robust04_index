			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: A taste for green chips - Investors are taking more notice of the world around them, but not at the expense of profit Given a choice between helping the environment and making money, most members of the financial community would choose the latter. But they are being forced to take more notice of the world around them as environmental issues move from the fringes of the investment world to the centre. The proponents of greener decision-making argue that it is in the financial sector's interests to take more notice of such issues, thus reducing environmental risk in their own transactions and helping to preserve the environment. Those urging change cite US government research showing that a company's share price drops by an average of 0.43 per cent - small but noticeable - in the week after the announcement of an environmental violation. More severely, insurance companies have felt the impact of global warming, blamed for much of the windstorm damage which has cost them Dollars 44bn (Pounds 29bn) since 1987. The pressure for change in the financial arena comes from several directions. In Europe, there are moves to make investors and lenders responsible for some of the environmental liabilities of their clients. The biggest worry centres on extended legal liability for environmental damage. Alarm at the huge but unquantifiable risks this might bring is motivating some business and financial groups to push for a new approach. Among these are: the government's Advisory Committee on Business and the Environment (ACBE); Business in the Environment, backed by Prince Charles; and the Geneva-based Business Council for Sustainable Development (which represented world business at the Rio Summit). Further pressure comes from several influential pension funds - especially in the US but increasingly in the UK - which are starting to question the environmental performance of companies in which they invest. Environmental campaigners, from single-issue groups to influential organisations such as Greenpeace, are also beginning to turn their attention to financial managers. Fisons of the UK stopped extracting peat from areas of scientific interest after a campaign by environmentalists. Three months ago, UK fund managers received an environmental analysis from groups criticising a flotation by Barito Pacific, an Indonesian timber company. Stimulating environmentalists' interest in the financial sector is their belief that their organisations can influence those obtaining loans, investments and insurance. Many in the financial community, however, reject accusations that they ignore the environment. 'We take the environment very seriously. After all, the UK insurance industry is on line for thousands of millions of dollars of liability,' says Francis de Zulueta, chairman of the Financial Institutions Environment Liability Development Group, linking UK insurers. 'These issues are now taken incredibly seriously and there is a much greater awareness of the risks and costs,' says Derek Wanless, group chief executive of National Westminster bank and chairman of ACBE. But while banks and insurers might be aware of the potential liabilities, especially from past pollution incidents and contaminated land, investors are less convinced by arguments that they should be more choosy about which companies they select. 'There is certainly a feeling that because there are lots of costs and risks related to the environment, those businesses who understand it will benefit,' adds Wanless. 'But investors feel there is little direct evidence that environmental attitudes work through to give clear business benefits.' 'We are willing to take environmental issues seriously, but the risks and rewards can take years to appear and can be difficult to measure,' says Eleanor Burton of Mercury Asset Management. Moreover, even if investment managers wanted to include a bigger range of green issues in their decision-making, they do not have the tools and information (see accompanying feature). Companies have few obligations to report on their environmental liabilities and the emerging practice of reporting on environmental performance (such as reductions in plant emissions) has yet to produce evidence that markets can use. This could change if governments made companies report in a standard, comparable format or investors made similar requests; both seem unlikely. There is, however, evidence that financial auditors are beginning to shift away from a purely historical perspective towards one of viability. But change is slow in accountancy. Although environmental reporting is the subject of voluntary initiatives in Europe and the US, the results are unlikely to be immediately useful to the financial community. 'The EC's fifth action plan on the environment talks about changing the whole basis of accounting, but nobody appears to be doing anything about it and there is a profound reluctance, especially in the UK, to take it on board,' says Rob Gray, professor of accounting at Dundee University and author of The Greening of Accountancy. But the financial sector has clearly acknowledged that its risks have been increased by bad or inadequate environmental performance. This realisation has been largely driven by the threat of extended legal liability. The insurance industry, nursing huge losses from US pollution claims, has also reacted. Gradual pollution is now excluded from public liability policies. 'And most direct insurers now have a hefty exclusion for pollution liability from their re-insurers,' says de Zulueta. But this reflects a purely negative response and the financial sector has yet to do anything positive to create change. 'The insurance industry is certainly in a strong position to influence clients and the businesses it invests in,' says de Zulueta. 'But it would lose competitive advantage if it was to select investments purely on environmental grounds.' Jeremy Leggett, a climate change and insurance specialist at Greenpeace, agrees that this would cause difficulties, but says it remains the ultimate aim. Many campaigners say selective investment is too complex and could be counter-productive. They feel a valuable first step is for investors to impress upon managements of the companies in which they invest the need for a sound environmental performance.</p>

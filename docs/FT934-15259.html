			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Patten blames Beijing for deadlock in talks HONG KONG'S Governor Chris Patten yesterday attempted to blame China for the failure to achieve any breakthrough in the long-running Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's political future. The comments came as the negotiations appeared to deteriorate into an argument over which side is guilty for the current stalemate. The governor was replying to Monday's statement by Chinese vice-foreign minister Jiang Enzhu that it would be 'no big deal' if an accord could not be reached. Mr Patten said: 'I think everybody in Hong Kong thinks it would be a big deal if we didn't reach an agreement in the talks.' He questioned China's sincerity in its approach to the talks. The 13th round in Beijing lapsed yesterday with the two sides remaining divided. They are trying to reach agreement over proposed changes to the mechanism for electing Hong Kong's 60-seat Legislative Council. Britain's chief negotiator, Sir Robin McLaren, said: 'I won't say we have made no progress, but I can't say I'm satisfied with the progress we have made.' Britain and China have agreed to start a 14th round on October 20, but local expectations of a breakthrough are declining along with the tone of the diplomatic exchanges between the British and Chinese negotiating teams. The atmosphere in the talks has deteriorated sharply in recent weeks. China recently republished an 11-year-old policy document on Hong Kong, voicing the threat of an early takeover of the colony. It has reacted angrily to Mr Patten's statement last week that the talks could continue for 'only weeks rather than months'. Analysts think Mr Patten's expected meeting with the UK cabinet on November 11 will provide the effective deadline for talks, unless there is a last-minute compromise.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Blantyre, April 17 (AFP) -- Malawi's independent  electoral commission on Sunday [17 April] named President  Hastings Kamuzu Banda's ruling party as the main violator of  electoral law.    In a press statement the commission, headed by High Court  Judge Anastazia Msosa, charged that Malawi Congress Party  officials had been seizing or buying voter registration  certificates, to be used in presidential and parliamentary  elections on May 17. The commission said it had gathered its  own evidence that the party had been doing this in nine of  Malawi's 24 districts. It said chiefs -- who play an  influential role in rural politics -- and MCP officials were the  main culprits in snatching voter certificates.    "Voters have either been told to surrender their  certificates  and come to a central location on election day to retrieve them  so that everyone votes for the same candidate, or they have  simply been taken without promise of return," the commission  said.    The commission also reported two cases of opposition parties  violating the electoral law. It said an official of the  Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) was apprehended while attempting  to seize registration certificates and another official of the  Malawi National Democratic Party bought voter certificates to  secure the election of presidential candidate Tim Mangwazu.    The commission, which has pledged to prosecute violators of  the electoral law, said campaign violence and intimidation had  been noted in several districts. "Tit-for-tat campaign meeting  disruptions resulting in a number of injuries have occurred  between the opposition United Democratic Front and the ruling  party," the commission said.    This was the first time that the commission, set up by  parliament had openly accused Banda's party of breaking the  electoral law.    If convicted, offenders face up to two years imprisonment or  a maximum fine of 5,000 kwacha (800 US dollars).</p>

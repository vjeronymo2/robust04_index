			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Building societies lobby for PIA The battle in the life insurance industry over the future of the regulatory system is intensifying, with supporters of self-regulation through the planned Personal Investment Authority becoming more vocal. Following a meeting of the Building Societies Association council this week, Mr Geoffrey Lister, chairman, has written to the Financial Times to express the sector's backing for the PIA as currently envisaged. 'Building societies believe that the PIA offers an excellent chance of providing the necessary reassurance to customers that the industry truly has their best interests at heart, while at the same time ensuring that the industry view is heard,' he says in a letter published today. His intervention follows a statement this week from Standard Life, one of the UK's largest life insurance companies. It is withdrawing support from the PIA on the basis that with only nine industry practitioners on its 19-strong board, it does not amount to self-regulation. Standard Life's move, and its call for statutory regulation instead, has highlighted the divide among life insurance companies over the issue. Mr George Greener, chairman of Allied Dunbar Assurance and of Eagle Star Holdings, believes the industry has put so much effort into self-regulation that it must continue to show that it can make that system work. To win support across the industry, he proposes that the PIA sets up a supervisory board, with a majority of public interest members, to oversee an executive committee made up of practitioners. Scottish life companies have already become openly divided, with Scottish Amicable backing Standard Life, but Scottish Widows and Scottish Provident supporting the PIA. Allied Dunbar, the financial services subsidiary of BAT, is also about to declare its support for the PIA. Letters, Page 7</p>

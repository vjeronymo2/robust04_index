			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'LIBRARY SWEATSHOP' PRO AND CON  </P> <P> "Library Sweatshop: A View From the Bottom" (Endpapers by Ron Kelley, May 20)  touched me in an uncommon way. It is more than distressing to read such an  eloquently angry diatribe against the necessary albeit routine duties performed  by library staff; it is a dagger in the heart to those of us who value the  intrinsic purpose of libraries and who are willing to spend our lives proving  our dedication.  </P> <P> Problems involving morale in a rapidly changing technological profession are  not the fault of the institution or the institution's administration; these  problems are an indication that not all technological advances are compatible  with human physiology.  </P> <P> I suggest that Mr. Kelley stop psychoanalyzing library work-flow charts and  begin to use his fine rhetorical skills to help people and computer screens  come together more easily in the future.  </P> <P> JODY STEFANSSON  </P> <P> PASADENA  </P></p>

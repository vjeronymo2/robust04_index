			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Leading Article: German gripes AS GERMANY weathers the difficult aftermath of unity, the electorate's behaviour is, hardly surprisingly, showing marked variations from the old Federal Republic's general pattern of remarkably stable consensus politics. Only around 75 per cent of west Germans would vote for either of the two main parties, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats and the opposition Social Democrats, according to latest opinion polls. The approval rating is even smaller among disgruntled east Germans, roughly 14 per cent of whom, on the basis of latest surveys, support a return of the former Communists. The weekend election in the northern city of Hamburg provides further evidence of the trend towards political fragmentation. Voters are unsettled by the recession and the need for further cuts in living standards to correct post-unification economic imbalances. Yet, after several years in which the reputation both of Mr Kohl and of SPD leaders has been eroded, large portions of the electorate believe neither large party can adequately address Germany's problems. The larger-than-expected collapse of Christian Democrat support to only 25 per cent of the Hamburg vote was accompanied by the loss of the SPD's absolute majority. The result, profiting a collection of left- and right-wing fringe parties, may set the tone for a further 19 regional and national polls during the next 13 months, leading to the general election in October 1994. A minor consolation for the political establishment was that the far-right Republican party, which has sought to gain ground from concern over immigration, narrowly failed to win the 5 per cent of votes in Hamburg necessary for parliamentary representation. The fission of the popular vote is likely to feed uncertainties in Bonn. Mr Kohl's coalition with the liberal Free Democrats - who failed to pass the 5 per cent hurdle in Hamburg - is strained by differences on both economic and foreign policy. The FDP's demands that German industry be spared extra financing burdens from plans for nursing the elderly has led to a new coalition rift. This has prompted fresh rumours that Mr Kohl is preparing for a Grand Coalition next year with the SPD. In crucial economic and industrial areas - concerning the budget, privatisation, transport, nuclear energy and social security - Germany requires bold initiatives to restructure an over-generous welfare system and restore its competitive edge. As the parties gear up for a year of electioneering, a strife-ridden political climate seems unlikely, however, to deliver the more radical policies Germany needs.</p>

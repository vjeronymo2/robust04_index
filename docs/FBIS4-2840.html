			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 13 (CNA) -- The 13th Economic Session  of the Sino-Saudi Arabia Permanent Joint Committee on Economic  and Technical Cooperation closed Wednesday [13 April], with the  two sides pledging to step up bilateral economic and trade  cooperation.    The two countries agreed to strengthen cooperation on  transportation, shipping, agricultural, power, and  telecommunications projects.    Vice Economic Affairs Minister S.J. Li and Ibrahim  Bin-Salamah, a deputy minister and vice chairman of the Saudi  Arabia Basic Industry Cooperation, inked the accord.    This was the first vice ministerial-level conference in  Taipei since the two countries severed diplomatic relations in  July 1990.    During two days of discussions, the two countries  tentatively  agreed to sign an investment guarantee pact and an agreement  eliminating double taxation.    They also agreed to reduce tariffs, increase private  exchanges, and clamp down on pirated computer software.    The committee will hold its next annual meeting in Riyadh,  but the time has not yet been fixed.</p>

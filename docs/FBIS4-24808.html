			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "There Is a Gold Mine in Every </F> Enterprise"]    [Text] It is difficult for one to understand very well the  news about Number One Automobile if one is unfamiliar with  economic management. However, the question it has raised,  namely, demanding efficiency from management, is very important  and specific.    State-owned enterprises must change their management  mechanism. But a change of management mechanism cannot replace  the strengthening and improvement of management. In order to  make profits and avoid losses, management is essential.    Enterprises must pay attention to technological  transformation. But technological transformation cannot replace  the strengthening and improvement of management either. Without  corresponding management, modern technology and equipment cannot  play their roles very well.    Many enterprises always complain that they do not have  enough  funds and always ask for help from banks to solve their  problems. But strengthening and improving management can not  only dispense with capital inputs, it can even save large  amounts of funds and under these circumstances improve returns  and obtain funds. Why do we not make great efforts to use this  method?    Successful enterprises in the developed countries do not  ignore management. Between the late 1980's and the early  1990's, a great change took place in the global automobile  market. American cars, which had played a dominant role earlier,  were continuously affected and threatened by Japanese cars, not  only in Japan, but also in other parts of the world and even in  North America. International commentators generally held that  as far as overall technological expertise was concerned, Japan  still lagged behind the United States, but Japanese management  was superior. The United States was not happy with its failure.  Americans organized forces to study their competitors. An  organization called the "National Automobile Plan" spent five  years on investigation and research. It made a scientific  exposition and conclusion of the production methods introduced  by Japan's Toyota Corporation and called it the "improved  production method." They held that if all of the industrialized  countries generally adopted this production method, the world  would change. They wrote their research results in a book and  published as the The Machine Which Changed the World.    These facts show that in the world today, enterprises around  the world not only compete in markets and through technology,  but also compete acutely in management. What is precious about  Number One Automobile is that it has already clearly seen this  modern wave and has boldly thrown itself into this wave to  compete.    At present, China's enterprise management does not meet the  needs of the market economy or the needs of modern large-scale  production. The contradiction is rather noticeable. The Number  One Automobile Group's practice offers us a convincing example  of demanding efficiency from management. Their leaders, staff,  and workers have already experienced the benefits of it. A  certain worker jubilantly exclaimed: "There is a gold mine  beneath my feet. The tool to mine the gold with is the improved  production method!" In fact, there is a mine in many  enterprises. Although they do not appear to be able to use the  improved production method immediately, they should always  proceed from reality, keep high standards, use better management  methods, and dig out the gold.</p>

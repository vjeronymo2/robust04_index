			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  confirmed Friday they will maximize efforts to write a framework  on American access to Japan's auto markets at "the earliest  possible time," a Japanese trade ministry official said.    Subcabinet-level auto trade talks between Sozaburo Okamatsu,  vice international trade and industry minister for international  affairs, and Jeffrey Garten, U.S. commerce undersecretary for  international trade, were held in Tokyo "in an amicable  atmosphere," the official told a press conference.    The two-hour discussion tackled the thorniest issue under  the  bilateral "framework" talks of setting "objective criteria" as a  tool to gauge progress in the opening of Japan's auto and auto  parts markets, the official said.    But both parties agreed to keep further details secret, he  said.    No U.S. officials could be reached for comment on Friday's  auto trade talks.    The latest meeting came after working-level auto trade talks  in Washington last week, at which both parties agreed to suspend  the issue of objective criteria.    The two countries remain at odds over the definition of the  criteria, with Tokyo unlikely to accept any U.S. requests  seeking future auto trade performance.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor recently proposed  some indicators relating to future Japanese commitment, such as  expanding the number of Japanese auto dealers handling U.S.  cars, a yardstick Tokyo thinks as tantamount to "numerical  targets."    The Japanese side has repeatedly said Tokyo is willing to  respond only to indicators meant to measure past progress.    The Japanese official said the U.S. is now "in a favorable  economic position" for settlement of the auto trade talks,  citing strong earnings results enjoyed by the "big three"  automakers.    The official said Okamatsu and Garten will informally meet  again Saturday before the latter leaves Japan in the afternoon.    Friday's subcabinet-level meeting will be followed by  working-level talks set for Monday and Tuesday in Tokyo, the  official said.</p>

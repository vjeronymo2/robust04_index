			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Equity Issues: Bumper crop of US offers makes 1993 record year Last year saw a surge in new international equity issues, making 1993 a record-breaking year with a bumper crop of share offerings from US companies, as well as privatisations in Europe and some emerging market countries. Altogether, new international equity issues raised Dollars 38.78bn, a 71 per cent increase on the Dollars 22.67bn of 1992, according to IFR Securities Data. Investment bankers expect international equity offerings to continue to boom in 1994. Low US interest rates and the prospect of declining rates in much of Europe encouraged investors to look for higher returns elsewhere, with the focus on the rallying stock markets in the main industrialised countries and some emerging markets. The US topped the league table of issuers, with Dollars 10.1bn of new issues. Argentina jumped to second place with a total of Dollars 2.88bn following the privatisation of YPF, the country's oil and gas company, in June, when the state sold 45 per cent for Dollars 3.04bn, including a Dollars 2.28bn international tranche. Spain (Dollars 2.83bn), France (Dollars 2.59bn), Mexico (Dollars 2.38bn) and the UK (Dollars 2.03bn) saw substantial issuance, with privatisations providing the lion's share. France saw privatisation issues from BNP, the banking group, and from Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group, while Spain saw substantial issues from Argentaria, the banking concern, and Repsol, the energy and chemicals group, and the UK government sold its remaining 22 per cent of British Telecommunications. In addition, a handful of European companies launched Initial Public Offerings for their US subsidiaries to take advantage of US stock market conditions. For example, Finmeccanica, the Italian state-controlled engineering group, launched US IPOs for minority stakes in its Union Switch Signal and Elsag Bailey Process Automation subsidiaries; Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and metals group, sold OM Group, its US speciality chemicals subsidiary, through an IPO in the US; and Trygg-Hansa SPP, the Swedish insurance group, launched an IPO for its associate Home Holdings. Mr Hank Erbe, equity syndicate manager at Lehman Brothers in London, says these IPOs provided 'opportunistic ways to raise funds' as companies saw their assets could get better valuations in the US. As for 1994, bankers hope to see the privatisation bonanza continue in Europe, with France and Italy expected to provide the main candidates, while Latin America and the Far East should also generate plenty of new issues for emerging market investors. 'The key to new issuance will continue to be the interest rate environment and the increasing internationalisation of US investor portfolios. As yields decline across the curve, we will see further flows into equities,' says one banker.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    TOP INTERNATIONAL EQUITY BOOKRUNNERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              1993                        1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Dollars                    Dollars Manager             bn    Rank   %   Issues     bn   Rank    %   Issues  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Goldman Sachs     5.449    1   14.06   61     3.733    2   16.47   53 Merrill Lynch     4.644    2   11.98   70     2.618    3   11.55   35 Morgan Stanley    3.323    3    8.57   30     3.845    1   16.96   44 SG Warburg        3.287    4    8.48   21     0.907    7    4.00    8 CS First Boston   3.211    5    8.28   32     1.477    5    6.52   30 Lehman Brothers   2.400    6    6.19   54     1.765    4    7.78   35 Salomon Brothers  1.442    7    3.72   26     0.407   12    1.79   10 JP Morgan         1.324    8    3.41    8     0.745    9    3.29    4 BZW               1.269    9    3.27   10     0.263   18    1.16    7 HSBC              1.121   10    2.89    5         -    -       -    - Industry totals  38.779  100     492         22.673          100  357  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IFR Securities Data  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (7): Sectors vie to be seen in a green light - Liquid packaging / The size of the market made it one of the first areas to attract EC legislators' attention IN 1990, 6.7bn litres of soft drinks were consumed in the UK. Add 785m litres of fruit juices and 400m litres of bottled water, and you begin to realise why competition between the various forms of packaging in this sector is so fiercely competitive. And these statistics do not include alcoholic beverages or milk. The sheer size of this market was probably why, along with the competing elements of the packaging industry, it was one of the first areas to attract the attention of EC legislators. Drinks packaging is also immediately visible to the consumer - in streets and countryside and on beaches. EC Directive 85/359, on containers of liquids for human consumption, requires member states to 'minimise the environmental impact of used containers, encourage a reduction in their use of energy and raw materials, and report to the commission actions taken and results achieved.' In response, the Boustead &amp; Hancock Report on the energy and raw materials requirements of liquid food container systems in the UK was commissioned by the government and relevant industry sectors. It covered the packaging systems used for soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, milk, vinegar and edible oils - 10 different systems in all  - and was published in 1989. An update is due, which will show what improvements in resource-efficiency industry has made. However, anyone looking to this report for a clear league table of which material or system is the most environmentally friendly would be disappointed. 'No single container system leads the field in all respects,' said co-author, Ian Boustead, of the Open University, in a paper published in the same year. 'While it is possible to identify specific environmental problems, it is important to remember that they are frequently interlinked. Action taken in an attempt to solve one problem can often exacerbate the effects of another,' he warned. 'Therefore environmental decision making should not be confined solely to identifying a solution to a given problem; it should also demonstrate that the proposed solution does not cause more problems than it solves, he advised.' Herein lies the basis of current thinking in much of the packaging industry, and in all aspects of the packaging chain, not only in liquid packaging. Taking one aspect in isolation, manufacturing energy usage, for example, will give a rating for each material that will bear no resemblance to the league table that comprises raw material requirements. A cradle-to-grave or life-cycle analysis of any given container is increasingly seen, therefore, as the only sensible way to proceed in balancing the different environmental priorities. The difficulty at present, however, is that a comprehensive set of data covering the whole field, and collected according to one universally accepted methodology, is not yet available. Work is in progress at leading independent research organisation, Pira International, which is represented on international committees under the auspices of CEN (Comite European de Normalisation). Drinks manufacturers and their packaging suppliers cannot afford, however, to sit back and wait for this information to be established as they have to respond to new draft legislation - the EC directive on packaging and packaging waste has superseded the beverage proposals - as well as increasingly green-minded consumers. In reality, although it is denied by the industry, the lack of independent and authoritative information means each of the material sectors is fiercely protecting its own market share by claiming environmental superiority over others. Each highlights the aspect that puts them at the top of any one league of environmental priorities in itsliterature. The debate has moved on from the mud-slinging witnessed in the 1980s: the nature of the business, especially liquid packaging, dictates this, as any one drink can be marketed in several pack styles. Each material is seeking the same business and this makes it difficult for the industry always to project a united front, even though attacks are generally made against packaging per se. From a consumer point of view, it is easy to understand how glass bottles, aluminium cans and steel cans could have a better environmental image than, say, plastic bottles and paper-based cartons, even though each of the five has merits. In 1991, 1.2bn used steel cans were recovered for recycling. Magnetic extraction is now available to an estimated 8m people, and the Save-a-Can network is present in districts housing 7.3m people. The UK recycling rate for used aluminium cans doubled from 5.5 per cent in 1990 to 11 per cent last year, or 462m cans. Glass recycling represents 21 per cent of all national glass production. The approximate number of people using bottle banks is said to be 10m a week, with 385,387 tonnes of glass recycled in 1991. On the plastics front, several schemes, including one in Sheffield, have been set up over the last few years, but actual recycling rates of post-consumer material are relatively low. Plastics are lightweight, however, and can save energy in their production, transportation and use. While it is true that beverage cartons currently cannot be re-used like returnable bottles, incinerators in some parts of Europe release energy from the pack for delivery to consumers. Cartons also have a minimal weight; they come from a renewable resource base and have low impact on waste disposal systems. How do these green factors impact on the market itself, as demonstrated by consumer buying decisions on liquid packaging? According to Nielsen Marketing Research, total sales of carbonated soft drinks increased by 1.4 per cent in 1991 over the previous year. Plastics (PET) grew by 6.1 per cent; cans by 1.3 per cent and glass fell by 28 per cent. Yet, in the take-home beer sector, sales measured by Stats MR produced different findings for the same period. In a total market that declined by 1.2 per cent, plastics (PET) fell by 15; cans by only 0.8 per cent, while glass bottles rose by 9.5 per cent. This was, however, from a small base. Doorstep deliveries now make up 65 per cent of UK milk sales, with over a quarter of the market now accounted for by cartons and plastics (HDPE) containers in the multiples and the remainder by corner shops. If these trends continue, doorstep deliveries could be down to 45 per cent by the year 2000. Rather than buying on environmental grounds, consumers seem to be still basing their decisions on fitness for purpose and convenience. For example, an 80-year-old single person does not want a 3-litre plastics bottle of lemonade, while a family of four finds this medium ideal. According to Boustead &amp; Hancock's report, consumers are an integral part of the liquid food delivery systems, in terms of material recovery. It is, therefore, difficult to justify changes in other less significant parts of the system, if the consumer is left untouched, they argued: 'This may be a politically sensitive area, but action would be a true test of environmental will.'</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEALTH BOMBER CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> The Times has shown a lowly bias against the Stealth bomber. Conrad's cartoon  on July 21 is the latest case in point. The cartoon degrades the superb  technological achievement of the B-2 by comparing it with the hokey Batman.  </P> <P> The text of Conrad's cartoon slammed the cost of the B-2.  </P> <P> Why does The Times insist on showing the B-2 expense as a negative? Surely The  Times knows that most of this expense will provide income for thousands of its  readers.  </P> <P> One would think if The Times feels it has to take a biased position it would be  in favor of building the B-2 according to the original production plan, if not  because the B-2 will provide a powerful defensive weapon then because it will  assure the continued flow of aerospace/defense dollars to the benefit of  Southern California citizens.  </P> <P> GENE GRAVES  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

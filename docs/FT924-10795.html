			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: BNZ moves ahead 7% midway to NZDollars 77.8m BANK of New Zealand (BNZ), a leading New Zealand private sector bank which is subject to a takeover bid from National Australia Bank (NAB), yesterday announced a 7 per cent rise in net profits to NZDollars 77.8m (USDollars 45.54m) for the six months to September 30 from NZDollars 72.73m a year earlier. The announcement came after a successful campaign by dissident BNZ shareholders forced the New Zealand bank to hold an extraordinary general meeting to consider the bid next Friday. However, it is expected that the sale, which needs 90 per cent acceptance, will be finalised early next month. Mr Syd Pasley, BNZ chairman, said the result was consistent with the information available to independent directors when they recommended acceptance of the NAB offer. Net operating profits before provisions and tax rose to NZDollars 149.5m from NZDollars 144.69m, broadly in line with the performance over the previous two six-monthly periods. Operating expenses were NZDollars 294m, down 7 per cent on the second half of last year. Mr Pasley said spending had been deferred because of management time being diverted to cope with the proposed sale to the NAB. Bad debt provisions amounted to NZDollars 32.5m, compared with NZDollars 40.01m, while total assets stood at NZDollars 20.42m against NZDollars 19.81m. Recoveries from BNZ's Adbro portfolio - the so-called 'bad debt bank' portfolio set up to handle the bank's bad and underperforming loans from 1986 to 1987 - were NZDollars 456m, down from the NZDollars 1.1bn that had been expected. The dividend was passed again. Mr Pasley said directors expected net operating profits after tax and provisions of between NZDollars 135m and NZDollars 160m for the year to March. Profits after tax and provisions for 1993-94 are pro-jected to be between NZDollars 145m and NZDollars 190m.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEASON IS BRIGHTENING FOR CLIPPERS  </P> <P> The weekend weather report in Cleveland, where Ron Harper spent three-plus  seasons as a professional basketball player, called for very cold temperatures,  and suddenly he comes to Los Angeles to bask in temperatures in the high 80s.  </P> <P> But that's nothing. With the Clippers, the outlook usually is bleak. Now, the  outlook is very bright. Harper, the long-coveted shooting guard, and Benoit  Benjamin, the recently-signed center, were in the fold.  </P> <P> Both took part in their first Clipper practice of the season Sunday, a  fast-paced two-hour workout at the Sports Arena. No suprising developments --  Harper looked every bit the standout open-court player who was acquired from  the Cavaliers in the trade for Reggie Williams and the rights to Danny Ferry,  while Benjamin appeared to weigh about 275 pounds -- but a day the Clippers had  long looked forward to had finally arrived.  </P> <P> "I can say this is one of the best days in the past eights weeks," said  Benjamin, clearly excited to rejoin teammates after a holdout that kept him out  of training camp and the first seven games. "I'm back on the floor doing what I  enjoy doing best, playing in front of the fans in L.A. They critique me, but I  still love 'em."  </P> <P> According to agent Henry Holmes, Benjamin's contract, depending on the  incentives attained, could be worth $3.85 million over two seasons, the  Clippers holding the option on the second. Holmes declined to discuss specific  numbers of the five-part bonus package for 1989-90.  </P> <P> The weight clause, the fifth incentive, is 265 pounds, but with some  flexibility in enforcement. Benjamin could go over and be fined, but then have  the money returned by bettering the 265 in a future weigh-in.  </P> <P> Benjamin, declining to say how much he weighs, said he will be ready for  Wednesday's game against New Jersey at the Sports Arena, but will need a week  to 10 days to reach top form. Joe Wolf, a natural forward who has pleased  coaches with his play, will again start at center against the Nets.  </P> <P> Coach Don Casey said he will wait before deciding if Tom Garrick, a backup  point guard who has made 18 of 27 shots over three games, or Harper will open  at shooting guard. It depends how quick the former Cleveland Cavalier learns  the Clipper system.  </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> Ron Harper is in the final season of a four-year contract, which makes him a  restricted free agent at the end of 1989-90. Although no meetings have been  set, the Clippers and agent Mark Termini plan to talk in the future, and the  Clippers have no plans to lose Harper, even if it means matching an offer sheet  next summer. . . .The state of new jerseys: Danny Manning will wear uniform No.  5 upon his return. David Rivers will take No. 44, giving up his No. 4 to  Harper. . . . Manning continues to practice and is drawing rave reviews, but no  date has been set for him being activated.  </P></p>

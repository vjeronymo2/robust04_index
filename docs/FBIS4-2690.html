			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva's economic pragmatism  has come to the fore in the speech he has given in China:    [Begin Cavaco Silva recording] Portugal can operate as the  door that will allow China into Europe. And in the same way  that we see Macao as the springboard for Portuguese businesses  into China, I believe Portugal can play a similar role in  allowing Chinese businessmen into the European community.    I have also emphasized to the Chinese authorities our  support  for the full integration of China in the international economic,  trade, and financial system. To this end we have been  advocating and will continue to advocate China's full membership  of the GATT system. [end recording]    Our special correspondent in Beijing, Feliciano Estevao,  reports in connection with Cavaco Silva's speech:    [Begin Estevao recording] It is true that Cavaco Silva has  given much to the Chinese authorities. For one thing he has  volunteered his image and prestige in support of the cause of  China's penetration of the EU's markets. As is known, in the  aftermath of the Tiananmen events, China was banished from the  political diaries of the EC countries. Second, Portugal  supports the normalization of relations between the European  Union and China. Cavaco Silva is of the view that there is no  longer any justification for continuing to enforce sanctions,  namely those banning visits by heads of state and monarchs to  the People's Republic of China. Third, Cavaco Silva has  unhesitantly advocated China's integration in the international  economic and financial system, namely its membership of GATT.  [end recording]</p>

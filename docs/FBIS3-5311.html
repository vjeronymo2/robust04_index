Arriving in Vietnam, National Assembly Chairman Chea Sim and  the distinguished Cambodian guests have brought to our people  the relationship of fraternity and friendship of the Cambodian  people, who are living in a country with an historic Angkor  civilization. This visit also marks a new developing step in the  friendship and cooperation relations between the two countries  and their national assemblies.    During its stay in Vietnam, the KOC National Assembly  delegation held talks with the Vietnamese National Assembly  delegation led by Chairman Nong Duc Manh in an atmosphere of  friendship and mutual understanding. Party General Secretary Do  Muoi, State President Le Duc Anh, and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet  held cordial talks with the visiting delegation.    The delegation visited the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and laid a  wreath there. It also visited Ho Chi Minh's living and working  quarters and many economic and cultural establishments in  different localities.    Being neighbors of Cambodia, we are very happy at the  important achievements recorded by the Cambodian people under  the leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk in building a Cambodian  state of independence, peace, and non-alignment, and one which  is friendly to all nations. We also express our joy at the  relations of traditional unity and cooperation between the two  close, neighboring countries of Vietnam and Cambodia. The  relations, after experiencing challenges, have been continuously  strengthened and developed.    Regarding their national construction and development, as  well as their efforts to develop their friendship relations,  especially in the present circumstances, Vietnam and Cambodia  share a common concern to strengthen and broaden the relations  of good neighborliness and multilateral cooperation for mutual  benefit. That relationship is based on the principles set forth  in the January 1992 Vietnam-Cambodia Joint Communique. The  principles were also repeated in the August 1993  Vietnam-Cambodia Joint Communique.    The joy of the two peoples is further multiplied when the  relations have been continuously strengthened and developed.  That is prominently manifested by this official friendship to  Vietnam by the KOC National Assembly delegation.    In the cordial talks with Party General Secretary Do Muoi,  State President Le Duc Anh, and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet,  Samdech Chea Sim expressed his fine impressions of the quick  improvement in the Vietnamese socioeconomy and the important  achievements recorded by the Vietnamese people in their  renovation undertaking. He confirmed that as a great  encouragement for the Cambodian people in their current  undertaking of national protection and construction. He  affirmed the Cambodian people's determination to overcome all  difficulties and challenges in order to take their revolutionary  undertaking to a situation of stability and development. The  KOC National Assembly, government, and people will do their best  to preserve and develop the Cambodia-Vietnam fraternal  friendship and the comprehensive cooperation for peace and  prosperity in each country and for peace, stability, and  cooperation in the region and the world. Samdech Chea Sim  thanked the Vietnamese Government and people for their previous  great assistance to the Cambodian revolution as well as their  present active contribution to the process for peace and  national concord in Cambodia.    In their talks with the distinguished Cambodian guests,  Party  General Secretary Do Muoi, State President Le Duc Anh, and Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet heartily welcomed the Vietnam visit by the  high-ranking delegation of the Cambodian National Assembly at  the Vietnamese new year. They considered this as a significant  event and a good sign of Vietnam-Cambodia friendship, unity, and  cooperative relations. The Vietnamese leaders confirmed that as  ever, Vietnam wishes -- and in reality, Vietnam has done its  best -- to build and strengthen the time-honored friendship and  the close, friendly relations between the peoples in the two  countries. And Vietnam always supports the Cambodian people's  efforts to build a Cambodia of independence, peace,  non-alignment, which is friendly to all countries, especially to  neighboring countries. The Vietnamese leaders stated that this  Vietnam visit by the Cambodian National Assembly delegation  ushered in a new era for the Vietnam-Cambodia relations of  friendship and cooperation.    Heartily welcoming the official friendship Vietnam visit by  the KOC National Assembly delegation led by Chairman Chea Sim,  we hope that the delegation will record fine achievements in its  visit and we trust that the Vietnam-Cambodia relations of  friendship and cooperation will be continuously consolidated and  strengthened.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Restructured Perkins Foods static at Pounds 10.1m Perkins Foods, which has been restructuring its business, reported static pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.1m for the six months to June 30, while turnover edged ahead from Pounds 199m to Pounds 201m. However, sales from continuing businesses were 9 per cent higher at Pounds 194m (Pounds 177m), yielding operating profits up 3 per cent at Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 11.4m). Mr Howard Phillips, chief executive, said the results had benefited from a strong performance by the fresh produce division, and by increasing volumes. The group makes 80 per cent of its sales in Europe. During the half the group closed its lossmaking UK frozen vegetables business and reorganised its canned mushrooms arm. In July it completed the restructuring into three divisions with the disposal of the UK catering meats business. The fresh produce side, which supplies Dutch supermarkets with off-season imported fruit and vegetables, saw volume growth of 12 per cent. Operating profits rose from Pounds 4.07m to Pounds 4.9m, and turnover increased from Pounds 79.9m to Pounds 89.2m. The frozen foods division, which now accounts for half of group business, lifted sales from Pounds 76.5m to Pounds 81.4m, yielding operating profits of Pounds 7.14m (Pounds 7.11m). Operating margins were under pressure, dipping from 9.3 per cent to 8.8 per cent - still good margins for the sector, Mr Phillips said. Operating profits in the chilled foods division fell from Pounds 2.29m to Pounds 2.03m as margins declined from 11 to 8.9 per cent. However, sales were ahead at Pounds 22.9m (Pounds 20.8m). The fall reflected a 10 per cent rise in turkey prices, which had proved difficult to recover, said Mr Phillips. But there was strong demand for chilled foods in Holland, which accounts for 65 per cent of the division's sales. Net interest payable was slightly lower at Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 1.33m). Earnings per share eased from 4p to 3.9p, or from 4.3p to 4.2p fully diluted. The interim dividend is unchanged at 1.75p.</p>

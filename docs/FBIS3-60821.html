			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITIM report] </F>   [Excerpt] Settlers in the Qatif Bloc have decided to  establish a body that will capture terrorist murderers who are  members of the Fatah organization. This comes in the wake of  the report, first released by ITIM, that the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] has called off its pursuit of Fatah murderers. One of  the settlers told an ITIM correspondent that if the IDF cannot  do its job, the settlers, whose friends have been murdered,  cannot sit by without bringing the murderers to justice.

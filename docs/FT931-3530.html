			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Peers resist leasehold rent move GOVERNMENT plans for leasehold reform survived a cross-party move to favour the tenants' interest yesterday, Alison Smith writes. Peers resisted by 162 votes to 117 - a government majority of 45 - a bid to remove the 'low rent' test from the proposals. Last week, the government relied on cross-party support as it managed to fend off an attempt by more than 100 Tory backbench peers to lessen the impact on landlords. The peers sought to limit the reforms, which allow long leaseholders to buy the freehold of their properties, to resident leaseholders only. An earlier move to end the provision that a property must be let at a low rent to qualify under the proposals was defeated in the Commons.</p>

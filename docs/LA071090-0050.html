			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUIT CHALLENGES DEVELOPERS' ROLE IN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS  </P> <P> The practice of allowing developers to pick their own consultants to prepare  environmental impact reports could be abolished statewide if a lawsuit brought  by opponents of an Altadena housing project succeeds.  </P> <P> The Friends of La Vina, a group opposed to the 272-unit housing project in the  San Gabriel Valley that has won county approval, filed a lawsuit in January  charging that the county policy of allowing developers to hire those who  prepare the environmental reports constitutes a conflict of interest.  </P> <P> The case is the first legal challenge to a practice in place since the  California Environmental Quality Act was passed in 1970, say land-use  attorneys, environmentalists and planners familiar with the law's regulations.  </P> <P> Reflecting a growing concern about the issue raised in the lawsuit, many  California cities and counties already have changed their policies and no  longer allow developers to select the consultants for environmental impact  reports, according to an official with the American Planning Assn. The City of  Los Angeles, meanwhile, is considering making such a change in its procedures.  </P> <P> The lawsuit sparked by the La Vina project is the second recent legal challenge  focusing on the county's handling of environmental impact reports. Opponents of  the Paramount Ranch development in Agoura filed suit claiming that the county,  in approving the project, relied too heavily on environmental reports submitted  by developers and failed to conduct an independent review. A judge Friday  rejected those arguments and ruled against the foes of the Agoura project.  </P> <P> Los Angeles attorney Deborah Bucksbaum, who filed the La Vina lawsuit, makes  similar complaints about the county review process, but also contends that  county planning officials violate the Environmental Quality Act at the very  start of the report process by allowing developers to contract with consultants  for the environmental studies.  </P> <P> "No one's challenged them and no court's ever told them they can't, but they're  really not allowed to do that" under the law, Bucksbaum said of county  officials.  </P> <P> Bucksbaum intends to argue in Los Angeles Superior Court later this month that  the state's Environmental Quality Act requires cities and counties to ensure  the objectivity of environmental impact reports by preparing them with their  own staff or hiring consultants to do them. In both cases, developers would pay  for the report.  </P> <P> County officials reject Bucksbaum's interpretation of the environmental act and  stand by their practice of accepting reports directly from developers. They  contend that past court rulings and the environmental act's guidelines clearly  allow developers the right to submit information to public agencies --  including environmental impact reports by consultants they have picked and paid  for.  </P> <P> "This is the procedure we use and we believe it is in full compliance" with the  law, said Richard Weiss, senior deputy county counsel.  </P> <P> Pam Holt, the county's supervising regional planner, acknowledged that under  the procedure the county sometimes receives environmental impact reports that  have obvious bias. "I won't lie to you, we have received EIRs that sound like a  sales brochure for the project," he said. "We say, 'Nice try but that won't  work.' "  </P> <P> But Holt said the county relies on a review process by county planners and  staff from other departments to ensure objectivity for the final version of the  reports. The review process and public hearings eliminate bias from the  developers' environmental impact reports, Holt said, because "there are just  too many people who get their shots at it . . . there are so many checks and  balances."  </P> <P> Darlene Phillips, a private attorney representing the county in the La Vina  case, agrees. "The issue is not so much who prepares the environmental impact  report as the adequacy," Phillips said. "The court has said as long as there is  an existing independent review, it is satisfactory."  </P> <P> Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit over the La Vina project, many cities  and counties have grown sensitive in recent years to the appearance of conflict  of interest when developers chose their own consultants, said Al Herson, vice  president of the California Chapter of the American Planning Assn. in  Sacramento. Because of this sensitivity, Herson said, the trend has been for  cities and counties to take control of the selection process.  </P> <P> Of 515 cities and counties statewide, about two-thirds in Northern California  and half in Southern California now select and contract directly with the  consultants, ending the developers' choice in the matter, Herson said.  Developers simply reimburse cities and counties for the completed reports, he  said.  </P> <P> "It's an appearance problem," Herson said. "The consultant is supposed to be  objective and it constitutes an appearance of conflict of interest if he's  working for the applicant."  </P> <P> City of Los Angeles planning officials are contemplating such a change out of  concern that developer-issued environmental documents are not trusted by  environmentalists and homeowners and that the review process takes too long. A  report analyzing practices used in 30 other California cities is due soon.  </P></p>

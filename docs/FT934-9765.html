			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ward Thomas takes the helm at Yorkshire TV MR WARD THOMAS, who started Yorkshire Television and put it together with Tyne Tees until the old Independent Broadcasting Authority split the two asunder in 1982, was back again in the chairman's chair at Leeds yesterday. Mr Thomas had lunch with Mr Clive Leach, the outgoing chairman and chief executive whose resignation he sought over the weekend. As Mr Leach left after more than 20 years at the company, Mr Thomas assured staff that Yorkshire-Tyne Tees had suffered 'a bad hiccup, but it is no more than a bad hiccup'. The dimension of the 'hiccup' resulting from overselling of advertising time is certainly around Pounds 9m, something that will push the Yorkshire group into a pre-tax loss for the year to September 1993. The loss is likely to be less than Pounds 5m. A financial settlement has already been reached with Mr Leach, who was on a three-year rolling contract, although the settlement, it is believed, was aimed mainly at protecting Mr Leach's pension rights. No decision has yet been taken on whether Yorkshire will seek a new chief executive. It is possible that Mr Ward Thomas, who has moved from his home in the south of France to the UK because of his growing involvement with the ITV group, may continue to run the company together with Mr John Fairlie, managing director of Yorkshire, and Mr John Calvert, managing director of Tyne Tees. As Mr Thomas embarks on the task of trying to reverse the decline in the Yorkshire-Tyne Tees share of ITV advertising - now down below 10.5 per cent  -there were growing rumours in ITV that Yorkshire was not the only ITV company that has been overtrading. Mr Kenneth Miles, director of the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers, said yesterday: 'It's not just Yorkshire, there are certainly others doing the same thing but Yorkshire was doing it in spades.' Mr Miles added: 'It matters to the extent that somebody is losing money and it can't only be the television station.' ITV companies usually sell their advertising through deals linked to the station average price. This is dependent on an individual company's share of advertising revenue and viewing levels. When advertising is sold on too optimistic a station average price, advertisers get a discount, usually in the form of further advertising slots. At extreme levels, companies run out of airtime in which to fit the discounted advertising, and the problem is rolled up from month to month - until, as in Yorkshire's case, the music stops. Industry gossip suggests that both Granada and Carlton are both a little 'overdealt'. Granada said last night: 'We are not overtrading. We are trading in our normal way.' Mr Tim Wootton, managing director of TSMS, the advertising sales house which sells airtime for Central, Anglia and Ulster, said yesterday that 'in the end it is necessary to have fewer ITV companies and fewer and more equitably balanced sales houses'. That, Mr Wootton believes, is the only way to solve the problem and also the only way 'you will get ITV to punch its weight'.</p>

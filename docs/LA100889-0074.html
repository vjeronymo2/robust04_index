			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PINE STORAGE BIN KEEPS FRUIT, VEGETABLES FRESH  </P> <P> Potatoes, onions and just about any other fruit or vegetables you keep on hand  will stay fresh longer in this set of storage bins made of pine.  </P> <P> The top shelf is flat, allowing you to store canned goods or dish towels, while  the bottom two drawers are actual bins. The wire-mesh fronts of each bin allow  the air to circulate around the foodstuff which, in turn, keeps moisture from  rotting the fruits and vegetables.  </P> <P> Measuring about 39 inches tall by 18 inches wide and 11 3/4 inches deep, this  practical piece of furniture is easy enough for the amateur woodworker to  complete. Our step-by-step directions, with accompanying photos, guide you in  construction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cut All the Boards  </P> <P> First, cut all the boards according to the schedule, and trace and cut the  patterns for curves onto the appropriate boards. Assembly is a series of gluing  and nailing the pieces together. The finishing hardware will be available to  you locally, but we offer a source for ordering a complete package for your  convenience.  </P> <P> To obtain Storage Bins, Pattern No. 797, please send $4.50. Another kitchen  convenience you might be looking for is our free-standing Chopping Block,  Pattern No. 642, also $4.50, providing four square feet of work space and as  easy to build as a box.  </P> <P> Prices include postage and prompt handling. California residents add 6% sales  tax. Send check or money order to Steve Ellington, c/o the Los Angeles Times,  P.O. Box 2383, Van Nuys, Calif. 91409-2383.  </P></p>

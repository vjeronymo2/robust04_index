			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As is known, in accordance with the ultimatum issued  by the UN Security Council, the bombing of the Bosnian Serb  positions by NATO aviation may start 21 February. In this  connection the redeployment has started of the blue berets in  the region where military operations may take place. Russian  blue berets also received this order, but they have refused to  obey it.    We contacted Leonid Kerestedzhiyants, Russian ambassador to  Croatia, by telephone and asked him to comment on this decision.    [Begin Kerestedzhiyants recording] It was not only the  Russian battalion that received this order, but a number of  other battalions as part of a plan to reinforce the blue berets'  positions in Sarajevo, to separate the opposing sides. The  battalion did not obey this order in agreement with Moscow  because the action which is currently being undertaken in the  area around Sarajevo with regard to the possible bombing of the  Serb positions, an issue that has been resolved without the  involvement of Russia and only within the framework of NATO  frees us, in our opinion, from now acting, obeying the orders of  commanders who do not regard it possible to take into account  our position, our approach to untangling the Bosnian- Sarajevo  knot.    Our battalion is located in the Vostok sector, a long way  from Sarajevo, and in general it does not border on  Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is on the frontier between Croatia and  Serbia. We do not consider it possible that our battalion, our  soldiers should find themselves in the zone where military  action may take place, which we are opposed to in principle.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Anger increases over Royal Navy job cuts THE GOVERNMENT came under renewed attack yesterday over its announcement that the Royal Navy would be cut by an extra 5,000 jobs to 50,000 by the late 1990s. The government will face questioning from MPs about the cuts later this month. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the Tory chairman of the Commons defence committee, said he had not been expecting further cuts. He told BBC radio: 'My committee is looking at the Royal Navy in an inquiry at the end of this month. This will give us a great deal extra to explore.' The committee is scheduled to take evidence from Ministry of Defence officials on April 28, and arguments over the new reductions might lead it to question ministers as well. Opposition MPs have already accused the Ministry of Defence of following Treasury orders when planning further cuts, rather than considering defence priorities. Some MPs were angered over the way the ministry had not made the cutback announcement through a parliamentary statement, which would have allowed ministers to be challenged. The news was issued instead through the ministry's press office on Thursday. The ministry insisted that there was no need for a formal statement because the figure was an assessment rather than a final judgment. The extra reduction in the Navy is the first clear indication of government plans for further defence cuts beyond the timespan of the cuts outlined in its Options for Change review - due to be completed in 1995. The reduction reflects increasing pressure on the defence budget. It is also an indication that armed forces chiefs are trying to maintain a full range of military capabilities even if that means cutting service numbers. The Royal Air Force is also expected to make further cuts. Under Options for Change the defence ministry scheduled a cut from 89,000 to 75,000 between 1992 and 1995. Senior RAF officers say the pruning of support services is now likely to leave a total of well under 70,000. The Navy announcement has reinforced expectations that the defence ministry, which has to find savings of Pounds 1.05bn over the next two financial years, will make further cuts in both the surface and submarine fleets. Defence officials say that the extra round of naval redundancies is not a direct result of the government's change of mind about Army cuts. However, when the government announced in February that it would restore 3,000 Army jobs and cancel two regimental mergers it made clear that the cost would have to be met from other parts of the defence budget.</p>

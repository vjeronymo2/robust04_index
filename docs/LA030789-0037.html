			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: CAPITAL EXPLANATION OF PHONE MESSAGES  </P> <P> So many readers ask, "What do people in Washington do all day long?" Believe it  or not, we are no different from super achievers in other parts of the country.  </P> <P> Most of the time we make telephone calls, leave messages and then wait for  someone to return them. We measure our importance by how long it takes for a  person to get back to us.  </P> <P> Because of this, many Washingtonians have become experts on the smoke screen  messages the secretaries are sending out to us when we call.  </P> <P> Here's one that is heard frequently: I phone and give my name. There is a pause  of about 45 seconds, I am put on hold, and then the secretary returns and says,  "He's not at his desk right now." This makes me wonder, "How far is her desk  from the boss' desk for the secretary to take 45 seconds to discover he is not  there?" Once in a while, when I lose my temper, I say, "Well, if he's not at  his desk, would you look and see if he is hanging outside the window?"  </P> <P> Many of the people I telephone are "in a meeting." Sometimes I want to know  what kind of meeting. I ask, "Is it a Cabinet meeting, an executive meeting or  a bowling team meeting?"  </P> <P> "What difference does it make?"  </P> <P> "I'd like to speak to him, and the only meeting I won't interrupt is the one  with the bowling team."  </P> <P> The excuse that always bothers me is, "Mr. Dominick is tied up at the moment."  An image immediately comes to mind of Dominick tied to a chair with a gag over  his mouth, listening to an IBM saleswoman trying to persuade him to buy a new  fax machine.  </P> <P> Another notorious excuse for not talking to me is, "Mr. Califano is out to  lunch." What's wrong with this message is that my call is at 9:30 in the  morning. So I ask the secretary to have him get back to me before dinner as I  have a 2 o'clock dental appointment.  </P> <P> I have a terrible problem about being rejected on the phone. My fears run amok  when I call someone and he won't talk to me, although I am certain that he's  there. In my mind I not only see him shaking his head at his secretary,  indicating "no, no," but I also see his face breaking into a wide grin while he  is doing it.  </P> <P> As the day goes on I keep imagining a large pile of pink slips on Califano's  desk, and the one with my name on it is at the bottom. The worst part is that  if I have to wait more than a few hours for the call to be returned, I usually  forget what I telephoned about in the first place.  </P> <P> The most painful blow of all is when one's children don't call back.  </P> <P> You leave a message on your daughter's answering machine and days go by, maybe  weeks, until she telephones.  </P> <P> "Why didn't you get back to me?" I ask.  </P> <P> "I only listened to my messages this morning."  </P> <P> "Suppose it had been important?"  </P> <P> "Why are you calling if it isn't important?"  </P> <P> In Washington, our livelihoods and our self-respect are hooked up to the phone.  It is an instrument that can either bring much happiness or destroy a fragile  ego overnight.  </P> <P> The only way to avoid letting the telephone call get you down is to make a game  of it. I keep score. If someone calls me back within the hour, I give myself 10  points; four hours, 6 points; eight hours, 3 points. If a person doesn't return  my call within 24 hours, I deduct 15 points. At the end of the day I add it all  up. If I have accumulated more points than I have lost, I figure I'm still  someone in Washington who has to be reckoned with.  </P></p>

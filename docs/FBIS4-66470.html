			<p>CSO     [Text] On 14 February the development of a fuel cell  prototype vessel was approved under Shipbuilding-Related  Expenditures in negotiations over the FY94 national budget plan  that are aimed at reviving the Ministry of Transportation. The  MOT will proceed with design and development of a prototype ship  in a four-year project to study whether fuel cells, which have  high heat efficiency and burn clean, can be used to replace  current diesel and gas turbine engines for ship propulsion.    In the initial year, &yen;200 million in the national budget  has been approved under the category ``R&amp;D Expenditures for  Next-Generation Ships.'' The original budget, as announced  unofficially, included no funds for this project. This project  calls for companies in the private sector to bear an equal  amount of the costs, which brings the total expenditures for the  project to &yen;400 million.    In fuel cells hydrogen and oxygen are reacted to provide  electrical energy. Electric power generating systems approaching  practical application include the phosphoric acid type and the  molten carbonate type. The MOT will conduct research on the  properties of a ship carrying a power generating system fueled  by liquified natural gas (LNG) and methanol, and develop a  prototype vessel.    In the same category of R&amp;D Expenditures for  Next-Generation  Ships, &yen;673 million was approved in the original budget plan  for R&amp;D expenditures for the Techno Super Liner (TSL). FY94  will  be the final year of this project, and two types of experimental  vessels will be completed.    In other Shipbuilding-Related Expenditures, &yen;164 million  was approved for Environmental Preservation, somewhat less than  the requested &yen;175 million. This breaks down to &yen;45  million for countermeasures against exhaust gases such as  nitrogen oxides (NO[.sub]x[/]) and &yen;119 million to  protect against oil spills. Each of these expenditures will  subsidize one-half of a government undertaking, so the amounts  actually spent on these projects will be doubled.    In addition, the government raised the ceiling on the ratio  of loans from open [sic] banks for marine shipping companies to  aid in compliance with International Maritime Organization (IMO)  double-hulled tanker regulations. In the past the ratio had been  either 50% or 60%, but now it has been revised to  60%  uniformly.</p>

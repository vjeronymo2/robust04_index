			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER WOUNDS SUSPECT AFTER SOUTHEAST S.D. CAR CHASE  </P> <P> A 23-year-old man was listed in serious condition Thursday after being shot by  a San Diego police officer who thought the man was reaching for a gun,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Vincent Taylor had his hands in the air as he was being arrested on suspicion  of drug activity, but suddenly dropped his hands toward his waistband,  prompting Officer Al Dobynes to shoot Taylor in the left side, Lt. Phil Jarvis  said. Taylor was unarmed.  </P> <P> Dobynes and Officer Marc Hoffman were on patrol in Southeast San Diego about 1  a.m. Thursday when they saw a car parked in an alley near 44th and T streets.  There were two people inside the car and several people standing around it,  police said.  </P> <P> When Dobynes aimed the patrol car's searchlight at the parked car the crowd  scattered and the car sped off, turning onto 43rd Street. Shortly after running  a red light at National Avenue, Taylor, who was driving, slammed on the brakes  and skidded onto the sidewalk at 43rd and Delta streets, police said.  </P> <P> A passenger in the car fled west on Delta and escaped, but police said they  found Taylor hiding nearby in a bank of ivy.  </P> <P> Police spokesman Dave Cohen said Dobynes saw Taylor and ordered him to stand  and put his hands in the air. Taylor stood facing away from Dobynes. Cohen said  Taylor then abruptly dropped his hands to his waistband and turned to the left.  Believing Taylor had a gun, Dobynes fired one shot from his .38-caliber  revolver, hitting Taylor, Cohen said.  </P> <P> Jarvis said a plastic bag containing "35 to 40 rocks" of cocaine was found in  Taylor's mouth. Taylor will be heldd on suspicion of possessing drugs for sale,  Jarvis said.  </P> <P> Taylor was previously from Los Angeles, police said, but because he used  several aliases and addresses, it was not clear where he lives in San Diego.  </P> <P> As is customary, Dobynes has been placed on administrative duty, Jarvis said,  until the investigation is complete.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Antonia Marcia Valle from Belem, Para State] </F>   [Text] Commercial flights to Haiti of the countries of the  American continent will be canceled, the bank accounts of the  military officers who ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide  will be frozen, and the commercial and financial transactions  with Haiti will be suspended. These measures are part of the  resolution approved on 7 June by the OAS Assembly. They  reinforce the economic blockade already imposed on the  dictatorial Haitian regime. Their objective is to force the  coupist military officers to leave power.    In OAS Secretary General Ambassador Baena Soares' opinion,  these measures can only be effective if all countries comply  with them. Baena Soares pointed out that these same sanctions  already have been approved by the OAS five times:    [Begin Baena Soares recording] All that is missing is  compliance with what has been approved. Sanctions, as the United  Nations calls them, and measures, as the OAS calls them, can be  effective, but only if they are complied with. [end recording]    The blockade of Haiti was reinforced after the plenary  session listened to a report by the UN and OAS representative  for Haiti, (Collin Granderson). He reported on murdered and  missing people, and on an escalation of raping of wives,  mothers, daughters, and sisters of militants who defend  democracy.</p>

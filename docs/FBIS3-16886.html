Cherepkov was unseated Wednesday evening. Addressing the  present situation in Vladivostok, Samoylov said he had kept an  eye on Cherepkov's performance ever since he rose to power.    Soon after he was elected Mayor, Cherepkov arrived in Moscow  with a bulky package of documents detrimental to the image of  Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko of the Primorskiy Region. A  subsequent inquiry showed, however, that the negative data  related mostly to performance by Nazdratenko's predecessor  Kuznetsov.    Cherepkov's opponents responded in kind and presented Moscow  with a package of negative data on his performance. They  claimed, among other things, that, pretending to be a sea  captain, Cherepkov had visited Japan to buy a dozen cars.    According to Samoylov, Cherepkov spent at least four of his  several months in office in Moscow. His dispute with the  region's leaders diverted his attention from the city's  problems. More than once he moved to restructure the city  government, took control of the districts' budgets and earmarked  substantial sums in aid to the local media editions which acted  as his mouthpiece. His efforts to update the city government  proved a failure.    The State Legal Administration suggested that Governor  Yevgeniy Nazdratenko unseat Cherepkov. First, however,  Nazdratenko was to have appeared on television to explain what  motivated his move against the Vladivostok Mayor. The  Primorskiy Administration preferred to stall until Viktor  Cherepkov was accused of bribe-taking and a number of his  associates were arrested, several weeks ago. On representation  from the court authorities, Cherepkov was finally removed from  office.</p>

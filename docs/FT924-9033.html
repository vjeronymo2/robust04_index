			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Businesses fail at rate of 76 a day: Company collapses reach their highest level since recession began BUSINESS FAILURES in England and Wales have reached their highest level since the recession started more than two years ago, with companies collapsing at the rate of 76 a day. Figures for the third quarter of 1992, published yesterday by the British Chambers of Commerce, show that 7,014 companies were declared insolvent, an increase of 21 per cent on the previous quarter and a 20 per cent rise on the same period last year. Individual insolvencies rose to 9,470, an increase of 37 per cent on the same period a year ago. The failures represent one in 38 companies actively trading over the past year. Such bleak statistics, based on insolvency figures prepared by the Department of Trade and Industry, are a further blow to a government desperately seeking signs of economic recovery. They will fuel speculation that Mr Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, who has advocated a policy of stimulating growth, might announce incentives for business in his Autumn Statement next Thursday. Interest rates have fallen 2 percentage points to 8 per cent since the insolvency statistics were collected, but there is no evidence that the reduction has improved consumer or business confidence. Mr Richard Brown, BCC director of policy, said the failures were 'alarming and underline the deep sense of instability in the business community'. With more than 19,000 companies going into liquidation in the first nine months of the year, it was not only badly managed businesses that were folding, but good companies suffering from a loss of market and bad debts. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade secretary, said the figures showed 'an economy in a free-fall towards slump with a government that cannot find a parachute'. Since the election, 31,000 companies and individuals had been forced into bankruptcy, but instead of giving the economy a kick-start, the government had kicked the feet from under many businesses, he said. For the 12 months to the end of September, the number of company insolvencies was 24,219, or 2.6 per cent of active companies registered. The total in 1991 was 21,827, compared with 15,051 in 1990 and 10,456 in 1989. Industries with the largest number of liquidations over the last year were construction, business services, metals and engineering, retailing and transport and communications.

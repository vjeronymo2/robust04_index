			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: No 'fire sale' of Mountleigh assets CREDITORS OF Mountleigh, the property company which collapsed in May with debts of Pounds 590m, were warned at a meeting in London yesterday not to expect a swift realisation of assets. Mr Tim Hayward and Mr Stephen James, partners of KPMG Peat Marwick, joint administrative receivers, told creditors that the affairs of the companies in the group were so closely interlinked that it was impossible to estimate the probable distribution until the properties and assets were sold. Since their appointment, the receivers have raised Pounds 57m from property sales, part of which was used to discharge overseas borrowings on certain properties. The receivers said they were determined to avoid 'fire sales' of the remaining assets. They have drawn up a 'planned and controlled' disposal programme for the remaining properties. They plan to sell the UK properties over the medium term, in the belief that a quick disposal would not realise the properties' maximum value. In some cases, they said, work will be necessary to enhance the value of properties. The receivers said they were not aware of any moves to have liquidators appointed to any of the companies in the group which are currently in receivership. 'We do not believe that it would benefit the creditors to start liquidation proceedings now,' they said. Mountleigh's debts comprise Pounds 400m owed to a group of banks holding debentures and floating charges, Pounds 140m due to bond holders and about Pounds 50m owed to trade and other creditors. The receivers said they held out little hope of payment for unsecured creditors. Mountleigh owns 83 investment, development and trading properties throughout the UK, most notably the Merry Hill shopping centre in the West Midlands. The group also comprises 60 companies incorporated overseas, based in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, France and the US. It also owns Galerias Preciados, which has 29 stores throughout Spain.</p>

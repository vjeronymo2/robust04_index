			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Letter: Insured have no say on medical costs Sir, In looking into the question of private medical fees ('MMC to examine medical fees', September 9), the Monopolies and Mergers Commission should not ignore the practices of the insurers themselves, which contribute to poor control over costs. For example: it is common practice, 'in the interests of efficiency', for hospitals to bill the insurance company direct. The patient, the consumer who pays in the end with his premiums, is not invited to approve invoices and query charges for treatments, drugs, dressings, etc, which he may not have received. He is regarded as too ignorant to be of help. It is also now becoming too common for patients to refer themselves to consultants, without prior involvement of their general practitioner, and for the same consultants' signatures to be accepted by the insurers for claim purposes. Meanwhile we, the insured, are prevented from voting with our feet and transferring custom to another insurer. If we do, we will find that medical conditions arising during the previous policy will be excepted, and we are thus forced to stay with our present insurer. This is nothing less than a restrictive practice. Only if consumers and their GPs can become more involved will there be day-to-day pressures to bring inefficiencies, abuses and costs under control.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 5 Feb (TANJUG) -- "I categorically state  that not a single shell was fired today from the Serbian  positions on the Sarajevo battlefield," Major General Milan  Gvero, deputy commander of the main headquarters of the republic  of Srpska army, said at a news conference this evening. At the  news conference held in the republic of Srpska presidency and  also attended by Nikola Koljevic, the vice president [of the  republic of Srpska], and Momcilo Krajisnik, the president of the  [republic of Srpska] people's assembly, in response to today's  massacre at the market in the center of Sarajevo, Gvero stated  certain facts that cause suspicion that the entire massacre was  staged.    On the basis of film material recorded at the market, Gen.  Gvero said it is obvious that there a lot of injuries to legs  and lower parts of the body. It is incredible that market  stools, and even bottles and eggs on sale, remained undamaged,  as the film material confirms. Those, and some other facts,  point to the possibility that this was a planted explosive  device, Gvero said.    Assembly President Momcilo Krajisnik said that today's  massacre was a "blow to the attempt to establish peace in this  area." We heard the news during a meeting with the Muslim  delegation at Sarajevo airport, where we discussed humanitarian  issues and ways of restoring trust, within the framework of  preparations for the next round of talks in Geneva.    Krajisnik expressed condolences to the families of the  victims in today's massacre and said that the Serb side would  make sure that all circumstances behind this crime were examined  and its culprits uncovered and punished.    "We do not have one single reason for applying such terrible  methods," said Nikola Koljevic. "We are doing everything in our  power in order to resolve the crisis by political means, restore  trust, and begin talks regarding all matters, from political to  humanitarian, but it is obvious that some factors are not  interested in peace," said Koljevic.</p>

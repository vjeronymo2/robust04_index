			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A place to mature - How to keep fine wine safe for years to come Not long ago the fine wine debate centred on who, in an inflationary era, would pay the costs of maturing the wine. Answer: the consumer. Now it centres on how, in a period of recession and of commercial uncertainty, the majority of fine wine consumers who store their wine can be sure they will eventually be reunited with it. Anyone who wants to be certain of the pleasure of drinking great wine at its best, perhaps 20 years after it was made, has to buy it young and find somewhere suitably cool, dark, still and secure in which to keep it. This usually means buying and storing it through a retail wine merchant. But what do you do when the merchant goes bust - as happened to Nigel Baring and Hungerford Wine, Berkshire? Unless each case of wine is clearly identified, by name or code with its individual owner, it is generally impossible to establish legal ownership. The fine wine market is already weakened by the failure of most 1980 vintages to gain sufficiently in value to justify early investment, and by the paucity of exciting vintages since 1990. If merchants cannot guarantee the safety of the stocks they hold for individual consumers, they may see the market disappear. For an increasing proportion of wine enthusiasts, the complication and uncertainty involved in investing in something as unpredictable as wine is just too much. As the quality and early drinkability of basic-to-medium calibre wine has increased markedly, so the incentives to invest in wine that, conventionally, has been considered 'fine' - ie ageworthy - diminish. Yet great wine at its best is incomparable in its potential effect on consumers and is what inspires most producers to keep on raising standards. Efforts made, by top producers in Bordeaux and the Rhone particularly, to make even long-term wines taste good on the way to maturity, are admirable. But wine demands time and steady low-temperature storage; two increasingly precious commodities. The world's greatest quantity of fine wine held in store for individual consumers is in Britain. It is therefore vital that British merchants and wine storage specialists put their warehouses in order so that confidence in fine wine storage can be re-established. Many merchants offer to store wine for their customers for a few pounds a year per case. Few have their own warehousing, although exceptions include: Averys of Bristol, which charges Pounds 5.25 per case per year to store wine in its Georgian warehouse; Justerini &amp; Brooks, part of Grand Met; Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, sister to Cutty Sark whisky; and the Wine Society of Stevenage, a non-profit co-operative and probably the safest bet. Most other merchants use one of the storage specialists, such as Trapps Cellars and Octavian. They can offer suitably dark, dank caverns full of wine, respectively beneath London Bridge station and in an old munitions dump in Corsham, Wiltshire. Octavian charges individual consumers, who represent about five per cent of its business, Pounds 7.50 a case per year for lots of up to 30 cases; the rate falling to Pounds 5.25 for more than 100 cases. Octavian charges its wine merchant customers Pounds 4.75 a case per year - to which the merchants add supplements for administration before calculating storage charges to customers. Octavian has launched a scheme designed to calm individuals' fears about the security of their bottles. Each case within a merchant's stock is labelled with the name of its individual owner. Each individual customer of that merchant has his or her own stack of wine within the merchant's own area. Corsham has 1m sq ft to play with. This scheme, called Protection Plus, is free until the end of March, and will then be offered at 80p a case handling charge. Trapps, more geared to trade than private customers, maintains that its system of allotting each case an individual code effectively replicates this, but its efficacy depends on the quality of each merchant's bookkeeping, and it is presumably the least financially secure merchants who are most likely to skimp on this. Bibendum, of London NW1, has already invested considerable time, and Pounds 15,000 in software, in devising its own system. Each case is labelled and each of its customers is sent an individual stock list at regular intervals which it claims is physically checked with cases at Corsham. When asked whether he considered his system superior to others in the wine trade, Bibendum's managing director Tom Heywood-Lonsdale said: 'We shouldn't be competitive in this area. All wine merchants should have exactly the same, high standards.' The Bunch, a group of seven high-profile independent wine merchants (Adnams, John Armit, Corney &amp; Barrow, Lay &amp; Wheeler, Laytons, Tanner and Yapp) has drawn up a code of practice for wine storage which, for duty-paid stocks at least, is very similar to the Octavian scheme, but without the luxury of stacks for individual customers. Security of stocks held in bond is more complicated, and Graham Chidgey, of Laytons, admits that it will be some time before an agreement can be reached on stocks of wine held abroad, as many young Bordeaux wines are, for example. There should be one system which operates throughout the fine wine trade which, surely, an effective trade organisation would have devised long ago. It will be messy and inconvenient to put it in place, but it is in everyone's interest to do so, even at this late stage. Now, while there is so little activity in the en primeur market for wine futures, there is simply no excuse not to.</p>

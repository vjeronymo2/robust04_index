			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO;  </P> <P> ENROLL YOUR CHILD IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL  </P> <P> Summer is over and it's time to get back to the three Rs: rules, requirements  and registration. For those who have not been through the process of getting  into an Orange County elementary school, here's how you do it and what you  need:  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE RULES  </P> <P> Children entering kindergarten must be 5 years old on or before Dec. 2;  children entering first grade and who have not attended kindergarten must be 6  on or before Dec. 2. Pupils must attend public or private school or be in a  tutoring situation from ages 6 to 18.  </P> <P> All children entering first grade must have a physical examination. Parents  have from 18 months before the child enters first grade until 90 days after  school starts to have the child examined. (Children entering a California  school for the first time must also have a physical examination.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE REQUIREMENTS  </P> <P> Parents must provide school administrators with:  </P> <P> * Verification of child's birth date (certified copy of birth certificate,  baptism certificate, passport, immigration visa, or a notarized affidavit from  parent, guardian, or custodian of the child when no other document is  available).  </P> <P> * A health certificate or medical record that indicates the child has had the  requisite physical examination.  </P> <P> * Written documentation of month/day/year of immunizations signed by the  medical provider or a medical exemptions waiver signed by the parents if they  have personal beliefs against such immunizations.  </P> <P> Required immunizations are:  </P> <P> * Three doses of polio plus one more if the last dose was given before the  child's second birthday.  </P> <P> * Four doses of DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) plus one more if the last  dose was given before the child's second birthday.  </P> <P> * Dose each of MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) plus one more if any were given  before the child's first birthday.  </P> <P> Schools will not admit children without the required immunizations or a waiver  signed by the parent. You may have your children immunized by your physician or  by the Orange County Health Care Agency at no charge. Locations are listed  below. Immunizations are handled on a walk-in basis.  </P> <P> * Address: 1725 W. 17th Street, Santa Ana  </P> <P> Hours: 7:45 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday; 7:45 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday  and Thursday.  </P> <P> * Address: 6462 Industry Way, Westminster  </P> <P> Hours: 12:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday; 4 to 8 p.m. Monday  </P> <P> * Address: 7212 Orangethorpe Ave., Buena Park  </P> <P> Hours: 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Thursday; 4 to 8 p.m. Wednesday  </P> <P> There are seven other locations throughout the county, but the hours and days  of availability are less frequent.

Once you know the  district, call the appropriate district office to find out which public school  your child should attend.  </P> <P> The next step is to go to your child's school and complete the registration  process, providing the school with the aforementioned verification of birth,  health certificates and immunization documentation.  </P> <P> Source: Orange County Health Care Agency; California State Department of  Education; Orange County Department of Education DALLAS M.

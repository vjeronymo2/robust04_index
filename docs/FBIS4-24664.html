			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "Oiling the Wheels"] </F>   [Text] China will employ more flexible policies to open up  new horizons for foreign investment in its oil industry. Wang  Tao, president of the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), said  co-operation with foreign governments and companies, unfurling  offshore as well as onshore, will take more flexible forms.    In an interview with Business Weekly, Wang said a wide range  of joint ventures is to be forged to tap the country's petroleum  resources.    Wang revealed that Chinese and international oil firms are  working on possible joint ventures in upstream as well as  downstream operations.    Big projects can be expected to begin immediately once  approved by the government,    China's oil industry, which annually produces 144 million  tons of oil and 16 billion cubic metres of natural gas, has  absorbed $15 billion in overseas investment over the past 16  years.    Wang is leading a 54-member Chinese delegation to the 14th  World Petroleum Congress opening today in Stavanger, Norway.    Wang said the oil delegation, the largest the country has  ever sent abroad, will promote Chinese views and ideas on  overcoming global challenges in energy development.    China, which is to host the 15th World Petroleum Congress in  Beijing in 1997, expects important information to emerge in  Stavanger.    The Chinese delegates are to cultivate foreign countries'  views on energy development and discover new measures for  protecting the environment.    "We hope exchanges on a wide range of topics in Norway will  help pave the way for greater foreign co-operation," Wang said.    He praised China's oil development over the past 15 years,  saying foreign co-operation has helped raise operations to a new  stage.    Chief among the accomplishments are that:    --About one-fifth of the country's land has been opened to  foreign oil exploration and development.    Foreign co-operation started 15 years ago in the country's  offshore areas, and was extended onshore last year with the  opening of international bidding for exploration in the Tarim  desert basin in XinJiang Uygur Autonomous Region.    Wang said exploration contracts with foreign firms are being  carried out.    Encouraged by China's open policies, foreign firms are not  only exploring virgin territory but are also enhancing the  recovery of oil in existing oilfields.    More than 70 foreign oil firms from 15 countries have  applied  for another round of bidding for onshore operations. Results of  the bidding are due within three months.    The foreign firms expect to explore 26 blocks and start 11  enhanced-recovery projects.    --Co-operative projects in oil refining and petrochemical  manufacturing are expected to satisfy the rising demand in  China, which anticipates 9 per cent economic growth in the next  seven years.    --Foreign companies will also work with Chinese on  engineering, technical research and equipment manufacturing.    Last year, CNPC signed $206 million worth of contracts for  engineering and labour services abroad. The volume equalled the  total for all of the 1980s.    --Preparations for overseas oil operations and financing are  under way.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ``qualified health care professional''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> would be defined to include a professional operating within the scope of his or her license, registration, or certification. For example, an otolaryngologist is qualified to diagnose a case of noise-induced hearing loss and identify potential causal factors, but may not be qualified to diagnose a case of silicosis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ``volunteer''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> would be defined to include individuals who willingly perform a service for the reporting railroad, who do not receive direct monetary compensation from that railroad and who are not involved in either (i) the operation of on-track equipment or (ii) any other safety-sensitive function for the reporting railroad as described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;209.303.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ``Work environment''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> would be defined as the physical location, equipment, materials processed or used, and activities of a worker associated with his or her work, whether on or off the railroad's property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ``Work related''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> would be defined to include any incident, activity, exposure, etc. occurring within the work environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A ``worker on duty'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be defined as an individual who receives direct monetary compensation from the railroad and who is engaged in either (i) the operation of on-track equipment or (ii) with any other safety-sensitive function as described in &sect;209.303.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Public Examination and Use of Reports (&sect;225.7)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;225.7(a), reference to ``Executive Director'' would be removed as obsolete, and would be replaced with ``Office of Safety.'' Thus, written requests for a copy of any report would be addressed to the Office of Safety at FRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;225.7(b), ``Accident Reports Act'' would replace the erroneous reference to ``Accidents Reports Act.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Reporting of Accidents/Incidents (&sect;225.11)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 225.11 would be revised to reflect that reports identified in &sect;225.19 submitted via magnetic media would be due within 30 days after the end of the month in which the accident/incident occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Primary Groups of Accidents/Incidents (&sect;225.19)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed revisions to &sect;225.19(a) and (b) would remove reference to the current threshold of ``$6,300'' and would replace it with the phrase ``current reporting threshold of (insert current reporting threshold).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, &sect;225.19(d), which identifies the third group of accidents (``death, injury or occupational illness'') that are to be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a, would be simplified to read as follows: ``Each event arising from the operation of a railroad, must be reported on Form FRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F 6180.55a, if it results in (1) death; (2) injury to any person that requires medical treatment; (3) injury to a railroad worker that results in (i) a day away from work; (ii) restricted work activity or job transfer; or (iii) loss of consciousness; or (4) occupational illness of a railroad worker.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Forms (&sect;225.21)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the revisions to the titles of the Forms listed in &sect;225.21, reference to ``Class I and II line-haul and terminal and switching railroads'' in &sect;225.21(b), would be removed as obsolete, and replaced with ``All railroads subject to this part.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because FRA is proposing deletion of the annual summary report (as discussed previously in this NPRM), reference to Form FRA F 6180.45 (entitled ``Annual Summary Report of Railroad Injury and Illness'') in &sect;225.25(f) would be removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed logs/forms discussed in new &sect;&sect;225.25(a) and (b) would be added to the list of forms as &sect;225.21(h), (Form FRA F 6180.XX_Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log), and as &sect;225.21(i), (Form FRA F 6180.XX(a)_Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Log). Additionally, the ``Property Damage Estimate Worksheet and Record'' (Form FRA F 6180.xx(b)) would be added to the list of forms as &sect;225.21(j).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Penalties (&sect;225.29)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 225.29 identifies the penalties FRA may impose upon any person that violates any requirement of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person who violates any requirement of this part or causes the violation of any such requirement of this part will be subject to a civil penalty of at least $500 and not more than $10,000 per violation. Civil penalties may be assessed against individuals only for willful violations, and where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations creates an imminent hazard of death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $20,000 per violation may be assessed. In addition, each day a violation continues will constitute a separate offense. Finally, a person may be subject to criminal penalties for knowingly and willfully falsifying reports required by these regulations. Appendix A provides the revisions to the schedule of penalties under part 225.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Access to Records (Proposed &sect;225.41)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA inspectors frequently encounter reluctance from the railroads when examining and photocopying claims department records, particularly railroad worker medical records. New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;225.41 would provide FRA representatives, or any representative of a State participating in investigative and surveillance activities under the Federal railroad safety laws and regulations, access to all records, logs, and supplementary records related to (a) rail-equipments accidents/incidents, including collisions and derailments; (b) highway-rail grade crossing accidents/incidents; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) death, injuries, and illnesses, including claims and medical records, for examination and photocopying (at no expense to the representative) in a reasonable manner during normal business hours. Further, a penalty has been proposed for each instance the railroad denies a representative access to any record, log, and supplementary record identified above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Schedule of Penalties (Proposed Revision to &sect;225.33)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix B would be redesignated as Appendix A and would be revised to add penalties for proposed &sect;225.33, ``Failure to adhere to Internal Control Plan,'' proposed &sect;225.39, ``Failure to Inform Employer of Injury and/or Illness'' and ``Failure to Provide Worker with a Copy of Form FRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F 6180.XX(a),'' and proposed &sect;225.41, ``Access to Records.'' Additionally, the dual entries under each of paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of &sect;225.12 would be coded ``(1)'' and ``(2),'' respectively, to allow the proper entry of data into FRA's enforcement database. Further, the penalties for violations of &sect;225.12(a) code (2) would be increased, in light of the 1992 amendments to the Federal Railroad Safety Act which increased the minimum penalty and settlement to $500.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Revision of Title 49, United States Code  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 5, 1994, all Federal railroad safety laws were simultaneously repealed, reenacted without substantive change, and recodified as positive law in Title 49 of the U.S. Code by Public Law 103&hyph;272. Due to this change, part 225 would be amended throughout to reference the newly codified provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

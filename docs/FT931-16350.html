			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / TSB Bank union calls one-day strike tomorrow A NATIONAL one-day strike by workers at the retail branches and computer centres of TSB Bank, England's fifth largest bank, will go ahead tomorrow, after talks broke down yesterday. Bifu, the banking, insurance and finance union, forecast large-scale support for the strike at the 1,400 branches but TSB said it was unlikely that branches would close. TSB said it would do everything possible to minimise disruption to customers. Fewer than a third of employees are likely to be involved in the action. Of Bifu's 19,000 members in the banking side of TSB - of a total of 25,000 employees - 10,000 voted in the ballot, with 7,000 in favour of strike action. White collar employees generally are more likely than manual workers to cross picket lines. Bifu has been negotiating with TSB for the past two years over a large restructuring programme that has involved the loss of about 5,000 jobs. However, talks at Acas, the arbitration, conciliation and advisory service, broke down after TSB refused to guarantee no compulsory redundancies among the further 1,000 job losses. TSB said yesterday: 'The vast majority of the losses should be voluntary but we can make no guarantees to Bifu.' Bifu is in a stronger position at TSB than at other banks because it has a greater percentage of members among the workforce than at National Westminster, Barclays and Lloyds Bank, where there are staff organisations. Most of the thousands of redundancies in the banking sector have been achieved by voluntary means. The recent threat of compulsory redundancies at a time of acceleration of job cuts at other banks has caused concern among staff associations. In November, Barclays' group staff union said they 'would not remain impassive' if there were compulsory redundancies. Bifu intends to follow tomorrow's strike with a rolling programme of selective walkouts around the country.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE NOTES: A LETTER-WRITING GRAPEVINE  </P> <P> The National Wine Coalition, a Washington, D.C., lobbying group representing  wineries and grape growers, has asked about 70 wine and grape growing trade  associations to urge their members to write Rep. Tom Luken (D-Ohio) opposing  the Sensible Advertising and Family Education Act of 1990.  </P> <P> John Volpe, executive director of the coalition, said in his letter that the  bill co-sponsored by Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Sen. Albert Gore  (D-Tenn.) would not address problems associated with alcohol abuse; violates  First Amendment rights of commercial free speech; and will have a severe  economic impact on the industries.  </P> <P> The Kennedy-Gore legislation would require five rotating warning labels on all  alcoholic beverages and also address advertising. Volpe said, however, that  because there is no federal preemption in the act, some 6,700 state and local  entities around the country could establish different requirements, costing  millions to implement.  </P> <P> Federal regulations already mandate a health warning on all packages of  alcoholic beverages.  </P> <P> Temperature-controlled lockers for wine storage have been opened in West Los  Angeles at the new Los Angeles Fine Arts and Wine Storage Co.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wine of the Week  </P> <P> 1989 Markham Sauvignon Blanc ($7) -- This attractive wine has a melony, almost  kiwi fruit aroma, and a delicate citrus hint in the finish, with none of the  grassiness associated with the variety. The lush, soft taste comes from aging  in French oak and the slightly elevated alcohol (13.3%). Under new owner  Sanraku of Japan, Markham has recently undergone some major in-house changes  that are now showing up in improved wines, but prices haven't yet moved up.  This is excellent value.  </P></p>

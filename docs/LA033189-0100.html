			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AGENTS SEARCH CAPITAL LOBBY FIRM IN MONTOYA INQUIRY  </P> <P> Widening their investigation of state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier),  federal agents armed with a warrant searched the offices of a politically  well-connected lobbying firm, the owner of the firm confirmed Thursday.  </P> <P> The investigators -- five from the FBI and one from the Internal Revenue  Service -- searched the files of Governmental Advocates Inc. for more than four  hours on Wednesday. The agents were seeking evidence of possible violations of  federal extortion, racketeering and conspiracy laws, according to the search  warrant, which listed a series of special-interest bills that either had been  authored by Montoya or had moved through the Senate committee he chairs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Firm's Clients Affected  </P> <P> Several of the measures affected clients of Governmental Advocates lobbyist  Jerry Zanelli and the firm's owner, Hedy Govenar. Zanelli, a longtime friend of  Montoya, is the former chief executive officer of the Senate. He has strong  ties to top Democratic legislative leaders, including Senate President Pro Tem  David A. Roberti of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> There was no indication that either Zanelli or Govenar is a target of the FBI's  investigation.  </P> <P> However, several sources familiar with the federal investigation said Montoya  is one of the principal subjects of the three-year inquiry into political  corruption in the Capitol called Brispec (for Bribery -- Special Interest). The  investigation came to light last August when FBI agents raided the offices of  Montoya, three other legislators and two legislative aides.  </P> <P> No state official has been charged with a crime, but in recent weeks federal  authorities have stepped up their investigation of Montoya and some others,  subpoenaing financial records and other documents and interviewing lobbyists  and legislative staff, according to sources. The same sources said they expect  the first indictment of a legislator to come in the next several weeks, but  they cautioned that public corruption cases are often slowed by unanticipated  delays.  </P> <P> Montoya's attorney, Michael S. Sands, said he was unaware of the search "and at  this time I have no comment."  </P> <P> This week, U.S. Atty. David F. Levi, who heads the investigation, went to  federal district court to obtain a warrant to search the files of Zanelli and  Govenar, whose office is located across the street from the Capitol. Levi would  not comment on the search warrant, which was ordered sealed by the court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Describes Document  </P> <P> But Govenar, angry at any suggestion that she might be involved in any improper  activity, described the document in detail to a Times reporter.  </P> <P> Both she and Zanelli were interviewed by the federal investigators during the  search.  </P> <P> "Most of the conversation seemed to be centered on honorariums and campaign  contributions," said Zanelli, who cut off the FBI interview for a previously  scheduled flight to Los Angeles. He said that he expects to be interviewed  again.  </P> <P> Govenar said she was initially happy to cooperate with the FBI, but became  especially angry with federal authorities when she discovered that two FBI  agents, posing as students wanting to know how to become lobbyists, had scouted  her office a week before the search.  </P> <P> "They told us they were students and they were very, very pushy," Govenar said.  The agents were able to come up with a detailed description of the office  needed for the search warrant.  </P> <P> Govenar said that during the search she voluntarily opened the firm's files,  allowing investigators to take whatever they wanted to, even before she was  served with the court order requiring her to do so. She said that she did not  want to accept the warrant: "It makes it look like I was uncooperative, like I  have something to hide, but they said they had no choice (but to serve the  warrant)."  </P> <P> The investigators carted off financial records dating back to 1979, as well as  documents on specific bills backed or opposed by the firm's clients, Govenar  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focus on 8 Bills  </P> <P> The warrant zeroed in on eight bills that Montoya authored or that were  approved by the Senate Business and Professions Committee, which he chairs.  </P> <P> For example, investigators sought records on a 1985 bill that Montoya carried  for the California Assn. for Financial Planning. The measure, which would  license financial planners, was hotly opposed by a number of other interest  groups, including the Investment Company Institute of Washington. The  institute, representing mutual funds and investment advisers, hired  Governmental Advocates to lobby their position. The measure passed but was  vetoed.  </P> <P> Montoya has also carried legislation that would allow the state Board of Dental  Examiners to regulate the use of so-called "conscious sedation" -- drugs used  to put dental patients into "twilight sleep." The 1987 measure was backed by  the California Assn. of Nurse Anesthetists, another client of Governmental  Advocates.  </P> <P> Federal investigators also seized the firm's files on Marina Lessees Assn., a  group backing a 1985 Montoya bill that helped block efforts to incorporate  Marina del Rey as a city.  </P> <P> Additionally, the warrant sought records on bills that affected other  Governmental Advocates clients, including three measures involving payments  paid to employment agencies by job applicants and a bill that would exempt some  agencies from licensing fees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Malibu Property  </P> <P> The investigators also sought information about a 1981 Montoya bill to exempt a  Malibu property owned by a Honolulu bank from restrictions under the California  Coastal Act. The measure, which was proposed before Zanelli was hired by  Govenar's firm, was introduced to get the attention of the California Coastal  Commission, which was reluctant to negotiate a proposed development plan,  Govenar said.  </P> <P> Montoya last year apparently was caught up in an elaborate FBI sting operation  when he took a $3,000 honorarium from Peachstate Capitol West, a bogus company  set up by agents. The day after receiving the payment, Montoya voted for a  Peachstate bill that supposedly would have helped the "company" build a shrimp  processing plant in West Sacramento. However, the investigation of Montoya has  gone far beyond his involvement in this one sting bill.  </P> <P> Govenar, who became a full-time lobbyist in 1979, said her firm was not one of  the biggest in the capital. The firm reported receiving a total of $360,000 in  revenues last year.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Jerry Gillam and Daniel M. Weintraub contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

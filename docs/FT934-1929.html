			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Providing good value The Accounting Standards Board cannot be accused of taking the line of least resistance. Its proposals on acquisition accounting have been barely watered down during consultation, despite vigorous opposition from those with a vested interest in promoting takeovers. Freedom to make provisions on acquisition for all manner of anticipated costs has done much to encourage unnecessary deal-making. Having enjoyed an accounting advantage over their international competitors through the 1980s takeover boom, UK companies might now find themselves worse off. Still, acquisitions which depend on a favourable accounting treatment are usually not worth making. The ASB is surely right that reorganisation costs and anticipated losses should be charged to profits rather than buried in the balance sheet. By sweeping away the layer of provisions with which acquisitive companies mask performance, this approach can only be good for transparency. It also ensures that all reorganisation expenditure is treated the same way regardless of who makes it. Potential prey will no longer be at a disadvantage, though companies which make excessive provisions in the normal course of business should perhaps take these proposals as a shot across the bows. By restricting the scope for asset write-downs, the ASB will also reduce the amount of goodwill arising from takeovers. But goodwill will not melt away entirely. The next task for the standards-setters is deciding how it should be treated. The option of writing off goodwill to reserves probably encouraged the wilder abuses of acquisition accounting. Yet alternatives - such as amortising goodwill over a fixed period or holding it in the balance sheet subject to revaluation - face widespread opposition. Finding a solution to that problem will be an even harder task for the ASB.</p>

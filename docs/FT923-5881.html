			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Brewers shaken by S &amp; N A TRADING warning from Scottish &amp; Newcastle knocked the shares and sent shock waves through the drinks sector. The company is seen as one of the safest stocks in a sector valued for its defensive qualities, with its northern-based market offering some immunity from the recession that is particularly buffeting the hard-pressed south-east region. However, S &amp; N yesterday warned that 'the company . . . cannot be expected to overcome all the negative aspects presented by today's business climate'. The stock retreated 29 to 390p. Most analysts, who were forecasting profits in the region of Pounds 240m, now expect only slight profits growth from last year's Pounds 222m. Mr Graeme Eadie at County NatWest commented: 'Up to now, Scotland and the North were thought to be holding up quite well, but if S &amp; N says it is suffering, it does not bode well for the rest of the sector.' The S &amp; N news crowns a bad week for the brewers, with Grand Metropolitan issuing a profits warning, and a series of downgrades for Bass. Observers now expect other leading stocks such as Allied Lyons and Guinness to come under fresh market scrutiny. Mr Andrew Holland at Kleinwort Benson, who yesterday also downgraded Whitbread, said the wave of bad news 'shows that the drinks sector is not the defensive division it has been painted'. Bass declined 9 to 488p and Whitbread 'A' 3 to 373p, although Allied was steady at 556p while Guinness put on 3 to 517p and GrandMet 5 to 389p. Slough disquiet Disquiet followed the decision by Slough Estates to reduce its interim dividend, after many institutions and analysts had assumed that the payment would be maintained. The results themselves were largely in line with market expectations and fully reflected the difficult times being endured in the property sector. The shares, which stood at 203p just 10 weeks ago, gained 6 to 95p in good 3.3m turnover. However, for some observers, the announced cut in the half-time dividend was not large enough to restore confidence. Mr Graham Stanley at County NatWest said: 'Cutting the dividend to a sustainable level has to be the correct decision in the current market. But we believe a more substantial cut is required for all overheads to be fully covered.' Another analyst pointed out that on a prospective net asset value of 268p, the shares are at a discount of around 67 per cent to nav, against a forecast market average of 20 per cent. 'At those kind of levels, it is obvious that the company has a credibility gap to close,' he said. Wellcome wanted Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome recovered sharply yesterday, spurred by hopes of approval for a new drug in the Aids armoury. The shares bounced 18 to 800p. Wellcome confirmed last night that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is to meet on September 23 to review the use of Atovaquone, a drug which combats a form of pneumonia brought on by the HIV virus. The drug is currently provided free in the US, on compassionate grounds, but if the FDA gives full approval, it would be marketed commercially. Pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Didier Cowling of Nomura Research said last night: 'It will not be a blockbuster but could be a nice new addition to Wellcome's portfolio.' The shares were also encouraged yesterday after analysts at some securities firms assured their marketmakers that suggestions of threats to Retrovir, the group's anti-Aids drug, had been overstated. There was hefty turnover in the electricity shares as unbundling of the Electricity Package, which ceases to be traded on September 4, gathered pace in very heavy volume. Among the leading recipients were Yorkshire, steady at 371p, where turnover reached 3.5m, and East Midland. The Package lost Pounds 92 to Pounds 3238. Sun Alliance remained the pick of the composite insurers, with the shares boosted a further 9 to 228p on 2.5m traded. The market is adopting a much more positive attitude to the stock ahead of interim figures scheduled for September 2. Another firm showing by the dollar, together with hopes that the recent hurricane damage may be the trigger for a sharp upturn in US rates, drove insurance brokers higher. The accolade for the most heavily traded stock yesterday in the London market fell to Clyde Petroleum, which held at 21p after a series of big blocks of shares moved across the Seaq ticker. The deals represented clearing of a large block of shares recently sold into the market as part of a big programme trade. Dealers noted some aggressive US buying of the oil majors, with BP, where American investors have been big buyers in recent weeks, closing 7 higher at 192 1/2 p on turnover of 5.6m. Shell put on the same amount to 464p. BAT Industries rose 23 to 738p with support from a firmer dollar and optimism about BAT's insurance and financial services activities. Cable and Wireless, ruffled in recent weeks by a series of profits downgrades prompted by the sharp decline in the dollar, staged a strong recovery, closing 11 up at 504p. Glaxo jumped 19 to 710p on news that the US Food and Drug Administration is to discuss increased use of the company's Zofran drug. Motor trader and coach builder Henlys was heavily traded, with hostile bidder T. Cowie believed to be increasing its stake. Cowie's brokers took its stake to 9.9 per cent and Henlys closed a penny firmer at 66p with 5.2m traded. Cowie added a penny at 121p. Chemicals group Courtaulds gained 9 to 430p as Hoare Govett reinforced its buy recommendation. Continued references to increasing supply and lower prices in the holiday industry hurt Airtours, which slipped 7 to 190p. Owners Abroad eased a penny to 62p. Rank Organisation, which runs the Butlin's holiday centres, suffered from the backwash of the trading warning from Scottish &amp; Newcastle, owner of Centre Parcs and Pontin's. The shares lost 8 to 519p. Scottish Television performed well with the help of a note from SG Warburg Securities. The stock jumped 23 to 375p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (6).

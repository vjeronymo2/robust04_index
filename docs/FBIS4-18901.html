			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "1993 Economic Report, 1994 </F> Forecasts"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 8 -- Inflation will drop from 4.2  to 3.5 percent, gross domestic product will increase 1.3 percent  and between 200,000 and 300,000 new jobs will be created by the  end of the year, according to the 1994 economic forecasts  presented to the cabinet on Friday [8 April] by Budget Minister  Luigi Spaventa.    Economic recovery will begin to show only this summer and  will be slightly below the government's expectations because  recession was deeper than previously estimated and eased only  starting at the very end of 1993, according to Spaventa's  report. While exports will continue to do well this year and  grow another 7 percent, imports will increase 3.5 percent,  bringing the trade surplus to about 64 trillion lire (39 billion  dollars) and the current accounts in the black by 32 trillion  lire (19.5 billion dollars).    The weakness of the lira, according to government officials,  was not the only reason the trade surplus boomed last year.  Competitiveness of Italian products was enhanced considerably by  the labor cost agreement reached last July, the officials  claimed. Job losses however will continue at least until June  but after the summer employment will pick up again and should  rise to 0.6 percent from minus 2.8 percent in 1993.    Industrial production will rise 1.6 percent and services  should also increase production by 1.3 percent, Spaventa said.    As for inflation, it should drop mostly thanks to slack  price  increases from abroad and the government's price containment  policies, while gross labor costs should rise only 3 percent  this year and interest rates will continue to come down, the  report stated.    The deficit will be a tougher opponent to beat, Spaventa  warned, saying that the 1993 recession and the delay in domestic  recovery will delay further debt and deficit reductions.    The three finance ministers at the cabinet meeting also  presented the 1993 economic report, confirming that GDP dropped  0.7 percent (compared to -3.7 percent in 1992) and that  unemployment reached an annual average rate of 10.4 percent  because of 655,000 job losses, while inflation averaged 4.5  percent against 5.2 percent in 1992.    Comparing 1992 to 1993, Spaventa said the balance of  payments  went from a deficit of 12.68 trillion lire to 32.51 trillion  lire in the black, while the balance of payments went from 34.37  trillion lire in the red to a surplus of 16.72 trillion lire.  The deficit also fell from 158.8 trillion to 153.51 trillion  lire.    Domestic demand fell 5 percent last year (compared to a 0.8  percent increase in 1992) also because household incomes dropped  2.1 percent and gross fixed investments plunged 11.1 percent in  1993.    Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi after the meeting issued  a communique warning Italy's economic press that false or  inaccurate reporting of government economic forecasts and  figures in the past have caused "grave political polemics,"  referring to allegations from Forza Italia during the election  campaign that Spaventa had "falsified" his forecasts.    "Any polemics, even the harshest, should be based on sure  and  incontrovertible data, supplied (officially and not  surreptitiously) by authorized public bodies," Ciampi said, also  referring to figures from Spaventa's report leaked to the press  last night.    "Conditions exist for a sustained and lasting economic  recovery," Ciampi said, adding that the turning point "probably  came between 1993 and 1994."    Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Ciampi said he had  some regrets because he "could have done more," but he stressed  that the country's economic conditions were showing "clear signs  of recovery."    The solution to recession "is old but still valid," he went  on, adding that success "is assured if there are correct and  healthy budget policies, a strict wage policy and monetary  policies aimed at stability."    The government's greatest regret concerns persistently high  unemployment but this was offset by falling inflation, an  improved trade balance, the July labor cost agreement and a  reduction in debt servicing, Ciampi said. Unfortunately, he  went on, there is no miracle cure for unemployment.    "Jobs are protected by creating serious and competitive  industries," which have been forced to reduce their labor force  through restructuring, the premier said. He praised the trade  unions for helping reduce wage hikes. As for the poorer south,  Ciampi said the region's economic backwardness "is closely  connected to social problems" caused by organized crime.    On foreign trade, one of the bright points since the de  facto  devaluation of the lira in September, Ciampi underscored the  importance of exploiting last summer's inflation-pegging  cost-of-labour accord if the export boom is to be maintained.  "Results of extraordinary importance have been achieved in the  balance of trade," he said, "enabling us to move in the space of  a year from a current account deficit of 34 trillion lire to a  surplus close to 34 trillion, or over 3 percent of GDP."    He said this put the economy in a position to face 1994 "in  a  totally different viewpoint" as regards competitiveness and  quality.    On public finances, he pointed to another "considerable"  result: curbing the PSBR/GDP [Public Service Borrowing  Requirement/Gross Domestic Product] ratio to below 10 percent  "for the first time in many years" -- although he recognised  that some of the credit was due to falling interest rates that  slashed debt servicing costs.    On his government's budgets and use of the tax lever, Ciampi  expressed "no regrets" in easing the fiscal pressure inherited  from the Amato government and shifting corrective priorities to  spending cuts.    "My government enacted budgets to the tune of 40 trillion  lire, but we couldn't squeeze the fiscal screw any tighter,"  Ciampi said, "because it would have stifled the recovery; that's  why we turned to the spending side, with important results."    A bigger budget squeeze "would only have had a nominal  effect  because revenue would have been lower, meaning lower tax returns  and higher social protection spending."    Ciampi again pointed to the objective of lowering fiscal  pressure by 1.2 percent this year, and praised finance minister  Franco Gallo for simplifying tax procedures. "Just look at the  new personal income tax form," he said.    Another goal he said had been achieved was a fall in the  cost  of labour, also in Italy's traditionally sheltered civil service.    In noting the fall in Italy's debt interest payments, Ciampi  voiced the hope that this would continue: "provided that we  preserve the confidence and credibility we have won over the  last year and a half."</p>

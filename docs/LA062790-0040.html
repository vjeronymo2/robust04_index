			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAVY LOWERS THE BOOM ON 2 LIVE CREW;  </P> <P> RAP: FIVE NAVAL BASES IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO STOP  SELLING ALL OF THE GROUP'S RECORDINGS.  </P> <P> The Marine Corps isn't the only U.S. military branch in Southern California to  restrict the sale of rap group 2 Live Crew's sexually explicit album, "As Nasty  as They Wanna Be."  </P> <P> Following the lead last week of Marine officials at Camp Pendleton near  Oceanside, U.S. Navy officials confirmed Tuesday that five naval bases in the  San Diego area have been instructed to stop selling the "Nasty" album.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences announced plans  at a press conference Tuesday in New York to stage an artists and musicians  march on Washington later this summer to demonstrate the music industry's  support for 2 Live Crew.  </P> <P> In San Diego, Chief Petty Officer Martin Wicklund, a spokesman for the Naval  Base there, said that the Fleet Support Office (the agency that oversees all  Navy exchange operations in San Diego) has directed base commanding officers to  remove the Miami rappers' controversial "Nasty" album, as well as all 2 Live  Crew recordings.  </P> <P> The decision covers exchange outlets at Miramar, North Island, Naval Station  San Diego, Naval Training Center and the Naval Outlying Landing Field at  Imperial Beach.  </P> <P> As of Tuesday, the album was still available to sailors in Long Beach and San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Lt. Cmdr. Steven Chesser, a spokesman for the Long Beach Naval Station, said  that the Long Beach exchange officer has not been instructed to remove the  album.  </P> <P> Senior Chief Petty Officer Erik Erickson, head of media relations for the Naval  Base in San Francisco, said that none of the 17 major naval installations in  the San Francisco area has been directed to remove the album.  </P> <P> At a New York press conference, Stu Ginsburg, president of the recording  academy's New York Chapter, read from a statement by Michael Greene, the  academy's president, which called the arts "the latest political target du jour  of the right-wing fear mongers."  </P> <P> Ginsburg said that the academy -- which also sponsors the annual Grammy Awards  -- plans to approach other arts-related groups about participating in what is  being conceived as a daylong event, including a concert, to draw attention to  the many debates over the arts that are now taking place in the courts and  legislative halls.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, U.S. District Court Judge Jose Gonzalez of Ft. Lauderdale,  Fla., acting on a civil complaint, declared the "Nasty" album obscene, making  it the first recording ever to be declared so in a federal court.  </P> <P> A Ft. Lauderdale record store owner was subsequently arrested for selling the  album, and three members of 2 Live Crew were later arrested for singing  material from the album at an adults-only concert in Hollywood, Fla.  </P> <P> One of the few artists who showed up for the New York press conference,  Hurricane of the rap group The Afros, spoke for many rap musicians when he  said, "Instead of doing drugs and the real bad, bad, bad things, we do the  music -- and we still get arrested."  </P> <P> In his written statement, Greene said, "Rap and metal music are under siege and  we must make Americans understand that these are the primary communication  mediums to and from the youth and repressed segments of our population. We  should be celebrating the success of these musical provocateurs and not  attempting to crush them."  </P> <P> Reached later at his office in Burbank, Greene said that numerous musicians  have contacted the academy in the wake of the obscenity ruling in Florida,  asking what they could do to help. The march and concert are a response to that  show of interest, he said.  </P> <P>  Free-lance writer Kari Granville contributed to this article from New York.  </P> <P> </P></p>

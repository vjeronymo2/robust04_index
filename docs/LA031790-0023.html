			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAYING FOR STATE HIGHWAYS  </P> <P> Two recent front-page articles, Douglas Shuit's "Tax Revolt: 1990: Hello  Gridlock" (March 6) and William Trombley's "Age, Growth Take Heavy Toll on  State," Feb. 11), discuss state government's struggle to maintain services and  infrastructure in light of voter imposed limits on spending and taxation.  </P> <P> While, both articles are generously sprinkled with quotes from frustrated  elected officials and bureaucrats, little attention is given to the other side  of the equation: How much can taxpayers afford?  </P> <P> Government may need more money to keep up, but so do the people of California.  </P> <P> For a generation and more, government in California has increased faster than  the citizen's average personal income. Taxpayers pay for the roads and then  must purchase and operate a car on those roads. Automobile costs are increasing  33% faster than increases in California average worker incomes. We pay for  services to our homes and for services for those who don't have homes, but the  cost of a mortgage or rent or home repair is going through the roof. Only 16%  of the people in Los Angeles have the required income to afford a median priced  home.  </P> <P> With taxpayers pushed to their financial limits just to keep up with costs of  everyday living, other answers besides tax increases must be explored to solve  government's problems. Privatization of government services to get more in  return for each tax dollar is one promising alternative given little or no  attention by the tax-and-spend lobby.  </P> <P> JOEL FOX  </P> <P> President, Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

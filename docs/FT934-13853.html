			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Concession ends Australian budget impasse THE 64-day impasse over the Australian budget ended yesterday when the federal government reached a deal with minority parties, who hold the balance of power in the Senate. This should ensure that the government's revenue-raising proposals can pass through both houses. Previously, the Senate had voted down two elements of the package - a second round of wholesale tax increases, due to come into effect in 1995, and measures to increase wine tax. The main negotiations yesterday centred on the two Green Party senators. They emerged from the discussions late in the afternoon to announce that the government would make a series of concessions to compensate for the wholesale tax increases. These would include: A ADollars 3 (Pounds 1.20) increase in the job search allowance for the short-term unemployed from March next year. An extra ADollars 1 a child a week in family payments to low-income families. An extra ADollars 2m in emergency programme payments. Abandonment of the higher education charge for students taking more than the minimum time to complete their degrees. The two Greens also negotiated to have future wine tax increases examined by an independent inquiry, headed by Mr John Button, a former industry minister, rather than by the Industry Commission. Commenting on the changes, Mr Paul Keating, the prime minster, said he believed the agreement was 'a reasonable compromise which does not undermine the government's medium term debt reduction strategy and is consistent with the intentions of the government for future budgets'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Imports covered by this review are shipments of all Thai rice including rice in the husk (paddy or rough); husked (brown) rice including basmati and other; semi-milled or wholly-milled rice, whether or not polished or glazed, including parboiled and other; and broken rice. During the review period, such merchandise was classifiable under item numbers 1006.10.00, 1006.20.20, 1006.20.40, 1006.30.10, 1006.30.90 and 1006.40.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The review covers the period January 1, 1990 through December 31, 1990 and fifteen programs: (1) Export Packing and Stocking Credits (EPCs), (2) Marketing Organization of Farmers (MOF) Payment-in-kind Program, (3) MOF Paddy Rice Purchase Program, (4) Cooperative Promotion Department (CPD) loans to Agricultural Cooperative Federation of Thailand (ACFT), (5) Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) Paddy Rice Mortgage Program, (6) BAAC Second Crop Paddy Rice Purchasing Program, (7) Ministry of Interior (MOI) Paddy Rice Raising Project and Compensatory Financing Program for Millers, (8) Bank of Thailand (BOT) Agricultural Purchase Project, (9) Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) Loans to Farmer Associations, (10) Public Warehouse Organization (PWO) Loan Program, (11) Department of Foreign Trade (DFT) Purchase of Milled Rice Program, (12) Export Processing Zones, (13) Incentives for International Trading Firms, (14) Export Promotion Fund, and (15) Tax Certificates for Exporters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Standing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent, the Royal Thai Government (RTG), contends that only the USA Rice Council (USA Rice), by letter dated April 29, 1991, requested this administrative review, and that the Department's preliminary determination that this review was initiated upon request of an interested party under 19 CFR 355.2(i)(5) is not supported by substantial evidence on the record of this review. Further, respondent argues that there is no evidence on the record of this review that the Rice Millers Association (RMA), the original petitioner in this proceeding, timely requested a review during the anniversary month of the publication of the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department accepted the USA Rice/RMA letter dated April 29, 1991, as being a request for review on behalf of both USA Rice and RMA because all the statements in the letter were made collectively and the names and addresses of contact individuals at both organizations were provided. To determine whether USA Rice had standing as an interested party in this proceeding, the Department in its letter of May 2, 1991, requested information from USA Rice regarding the function of USA Rice, the eligibility requirements for membership, and the number of members classified as importers, producers or sellers of rice. By letter of May 13, 1991, USA Rice provided the requested information as well as copies of their bylaws, articles of incorporation, and their annual report covering the period of review (POR). Based on the information provided by USA Rice, the Department determined that USA Rice is an interested party to this proceeding. Further, by letter dated June 7, 1991, the Department asked that RMA clarify its intent to request a review jointly with USA Rice. RMA's affirmative response of June 7, 1991 was treated not as a request for review, but as a clarification of RMA's intent. For these reasons, the Department treated the request for this administrative review to be jointly from USA Rice and RMA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Comments Received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from the respondent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent contends that in its preliminary determination, the Department wrongly rejected the short-term loan benchmark developed by the Bank of Thailand (BOT) and erred in using the benchmark methodology adopted in Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Countervailing Duty Order; Steel Wire Rope from Thailand (56 FR 46299; Sept. 11, 1991), (Steel Wire Rope).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

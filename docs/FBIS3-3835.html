Hwang noted that although it is only a year and a half since  the two countries set up diplomatic ties, China and ROK have  greatly increased political, economic and cultural contacts.    He said that the trade volume between the two countries last  year reached 9.1 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 50 percent  over 1992.    He noted that China has become ROK's third largest trade  partner and ROK is now the sixth largest trade partner of China,  adding that by the end of last year ROK's total investment in  China exceeded one billion U.S. dollars.    Hwang predicted that the annual trade volume between China  and ROK will increase greatly by the year 2000 if the two sides  keep up the current momentum of economic and trade cooperation.    Exchanges in the cultural and other fields between the two  countries are increasing as well, the ambassador said, adding  some of the well-known universities, such as Beijing University  and Fudan University (in Shanghai), now have research institutes  on ROK studies.    More than 150,000 people from the ROK toured China last  year,  according to Hwang, and is estimated to grow to about 500,000  this year.    On the prospect of Sino-ROK ties in the 21st century, Hwang  said that the biggest problem of the coming century would be the  economy. He stressed that China and ROK, bringing their  respective economic advantages into play, should make joint  efforts to strengthen their economic cooperation.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Motoring: Any colour except red - Stuart Marshall asks what your car's paintwork says about you OLD HENRY Ford once said, unforgettably, that customers could have one of his Model T 'Tin Lizzies' painted any colour they liked so long as it was black. That was before the First World War but change came slowly. Forty years on, more than one-third of the cars at the Earl's Court motor shows in the years directly after the Second World War were black. If you wanted a colour, not only did you pay extra - you had to put up with paint that lost its sheen and faded fast, however busy you were with polish and dusters each weekend. Compare the scene today. Fly into Heathrow or Gatwick airports, look at the thousands of vehicles in the car-parks. What do you see? Most are red, white or blue, in that order, followed by grey or silver metallics. There is a pecking order in paints. Sombre shades are posh. The topmost people choose very dark red (like a glass of Cahors), midnight blue, greens so dark they could be taken for black and of course, black itself. ICI, a leading supplier of paint to the car-makers, says the once-despised black has made a comeback recently and is being chosen for almost one new car in 10. Surprisingly, it is favoured as a 'boy-racer' colour for hot hatchbacks. Perhaps the owners think it makes them less conspicuous when the police are about because, in general, younger motorists go for bright colours. Psychologists believe driving a bright red car encourages aggressive tendencies, especially among the young. Some years ago, Audi dropped red for that reason. But now you see a lot of new, bright-red Audis. A change of heart by the company? 'No, I think perhaps we changed our psychologist,' an Audi man surmised. Colour can make a big difference to trade-in values, as owners of lavender, pink, orange or yellow cars often find to their cost. It does not pay to be too trendy. There is a reward for playing safe. Still rare in Europe, but tipped by ICI as a rising star, is the pearlescent finish which sparkles subtly because it contains millions of tiny particles of mica. Nearly one American-made car in three now has it and the fashion is likely to cross the Atlantic soon. Motorists worry less about preserving their car's looks than they used to. ICI approves. Modern paints, it says, are so tough they will last for years. Just remove grime with plenty of water and a few drops of detergent. The whirling brushes of a car-wash will do no harm to the majority of today's models, although abrasive road grit should be hosed off first. And polishing? Once every six months should preserve a showroom gloss, says ICI, reassuringly.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Fiat chief expected at inquiry today MR Cesare Romiti, managing director of Italy's Fiat industrial group, is today expected to appear before Milan magistrates investigating political corruption. Neither the time nor the venue for the meeting have been revealed. Investigators stress Mr Romiti himself is not under suspicion. Mr Romiti is unlikely to provide a list of cases where Fiat and subsidiaries have allegedly bribed politicians to win orders or participated in a more systematic network of kickbacks. Rather, he is expected to outline the general system of corruption. It is not clear whether this will convince magistrates that Fiat is co-operating. After his statement, Mr Romiti is expected to answer questions from the judges. The return to Italy of four senior Fiat managers 'on business' abroad and against whom cautionary warrants have been issued will be closely linked with the outcome of today's meeting. Magistrates want to question two of the four, Mr Paolo Toricelli and Mr Mauro Bertini, in connection with allegations of kickbacks on gas turbine contracts for the Enel state electricity generating authority. Mr Toricelli is chief executive of Fiat Avio, Fiat's turbines subsidiary, and Mr Bertini is its marketing chief. Mr Giorgio Garuzzo and Mr Massimo Aimetti have been implicated in allegations of kickbacks on bus contracts for the Milan municipality. Mr Garuzzo, Fiat's chief operating officer, was formerly managing director of its Iveco truck and bus subsidiary; Mr Aimetti is Iveco's finance director. Speaking to industrialists last weekend, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat's chairman, admitted that Fiat had been involved in episodes of corruption. However, he tried to distinguish between those who had paid bribes as part of everyday business and others who had based their fortunes on political contacts.</p>

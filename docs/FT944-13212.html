			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Gadget sellers feel the squeeze: Toys for yuppies lose allure as age of frivolity passes Shoppers are used to sales patter - autumn bargains, end-of-season discounts and the like. But one UK chain has begun wooing customers with a different campaign, the 'Takeover Clearance Sale'. The Leading Edge, purveyors of gadgets and gimmicks, is selling off surplus stock in a farewell to the unrestrained consumerism of the 1980s, when demand surged for useful but unnecessary products such as talking pens, battery-powered sponges and laser-guided golfing aids. Described by one retail analyst as a 'requiem to the boom', the move follows the disposal of The Leading Edge by Kleen-e-ze Holdings, the home shopping group, which tried and failed to use its successful mail order operations to support a retail chain. As Kleen-e-ze found to its cost, impulse purchases of executive toys and gadgets have all but dried up. One only has to look around boardrooms to know the age of the gadget is waning, say retail analysts. Rare is the executive whose desk now boasts a clock 'accurate to within one second in a million years'. In the US too, the disaffection with items such as watches that double as TV remote controls has forced Sharper Image, the San Francisco-based gadget manufacturer and retailer, to switch to more practical products. 'We got over-confident and let our catalogue and merchandise get stale,' said Mr Richard Thalheimer, the group's chairman and self-proclaimed 'PT Barnum of gadgetry'. While Kleen-e-ze was struggling to extract a profit from The Leading Edge, Sharper Image saw its profits falter as consumers stopped buying products such as the Personal Life Clock, which ticks down the owner's life expectancy. 'We found we could not compete with the warehouse stores, so we've moved into more practical products, particularly in healthcare,' said one Sharper Image executive. Even under the auspices of healthy living, the company still offers some bizarre accessories - the wrist-worn Snore Control System upsets the offender's sleep patterns when the noise reaches unacceptable volumes. Kleen-e-ze and Sharper Image have pursued different strategies to overcome the problems facing gadget makers. The UK company decided to withdraw from high street retailing after a two-year restructuring. It has focused instead on mail order and has captured a sizeable slice of the market for catalogues offering everyday items ranging from cordless kettles to thermal gloves. It also handles catalogues for Britain's Science and Natural History Museums, where solar-powered clocks and pocket 'stellarscopes' are more likely to find buyers. Sharper Image, meanwhile, acted to restore market confidence by buying back its own shares in August. Its shares have risen 31 per cent, while Kleen-e-ze shares fell 17 per cent since it sold its retail outlets. Mr Klein, however, has no regrets. He is determined to focus on home shopping. 'Management time and working capital can now be concentrated on our growing business - Kleen-e-ze Homecare and Innovations.' Sharper Image is also increasing its catalogue activities, which have grown faster than over-the-counter operations. 'Both companies have tried to tailor the product to being more practical and less gadgety,' says one analyst. 'But they still rely on impulse purchases for a large proportion of their profits, and I'm afraid that era is over.'</p>

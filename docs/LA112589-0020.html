			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AZTECS STARTING TO EARN EVERYBODY'S SUPPORT  </P> <P> Coach Al Luginbill has done a fantastic job of turning around the basic  approach to major college football at San Diego State.  </P> <P> So what does The Times choose to write two days before the Aztecs' big game at  Miami? The story dwells on 23 players who are gone! Next to it, there is a  second story about Scott Barrick, telling how well he's doing (at Palomar  College) since he quit.  </P> <P> Nothing wrong with either story, per se, but wouldn't it be far more logical to  focus on the game and the many positives of the new Aztec football program?  Could it be that this continuing emphasis on the negative is one of the reasons  that crowds have been much smaller than deserved for Aztec football this year?  </P> <P> Luginbill has insisted that he and the team must "earn" support from the fans.  I think they've done that in rather impressive fashion in a remarkably short  span of time. Maybe a bit more positive and generous coverage would hasten the  fans' return. By now, the Aztecs have earned it!  </P> <P> Tom Ables, San Diego  </P></p>

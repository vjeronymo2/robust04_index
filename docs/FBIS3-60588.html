A press release circulated at the press conference said  Russia earned 2.3 billion dollars from arms sales in 1992, and  has set sights on earning about nine billion dollars annually.  It is hardly sensible to turn away from this source of income  which helps solve numerous problems facing this country, the  press release says.    It also stressed that Russian arms exports are not  politically motivated. They are purely commercial in nature and  are not directed against the interests of any separate country.  "Moreover, we are prepared to discuss with the world exporters  a reduction of arms exports on a reciprocal basis," the paper  said.    Russia is now orientating its arms sales towards financially  and politically stable Middle East, Latin American, and  Southeast Asian countries. Good prospects exist for cooperation  with China in the military field, the release said.    Responding to questions from journalists, Aleksandr Shokhin  expressed confidence that the privatisation process underway in  Russia, including the sell-off of military enterprises, will not  impair state control over Russia's arms export. He recalled  that Russia had set up a special system of control over its arms  sales, and control is now being further tightened.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- A white paper issued  today on the situation of Chinese women says that Chinese women  have become a great force in the country's social and economic  development, due to the Chinese Government's fruitful efforts to  upgrade and enhance their economic status.    The 20,000-word white paper states that Chinese women had  enjoyed equal treatment with men in employment and payment.  Moreover, all employed women were provided with comprehensive  protective measures.    Since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, the  population of employed women has risen constantly. So far,  employed females accounted for some 44 percent of the total  number of employees, higher than the world rate of 34.5 percent.    The white paper says that in 1992, employed females made up  72.33 percent of all women over 15.    In the countryside, women laborers made up half the rural  labor force. The number of urban working women increased from  600,000 in 1949 to 56 million, while their share of the  country's total working population went up from 7.5 percent to  38 percent.    The white paper also lists Chinese women's areas of  employment. It says that among the 12 branches of the national  economy, nine employed over 1 million women, ranging from  industry, agriculture, building, transport and communications,  commerce, public health, education, party and government organs  to social organizations.    The white paper notes that the principle of equal pay for  equal work for men and women was basically in place. However,  due to current differences in cultural and professional  competence as well as occupational composition, income gaps  still existed.    According to a survey conducted in 1990, the average monthly  incomes for male and female workers in urban areas were 193.15  yuan and 149.60 yuan respectively, with women receiving only  77.4 percent of the pay given to men.    In rural areas, the average annual incomes for men and women  were 1,518 yuan and 1,235 yuan respectively, with women getting  81.4 percent of the earnings of men.    In other aspects, the white paper says that the Chinese  Government had provided comprehensive protective measures for  employed women. A survey showed that 85.3 percent of  child-bearing female workers and staff members in urban areas  enjoy a three-month paid maternity leave.    The Chinese Government also stipulated that female workers  during their pregnant and lactation period have their work load  and work time reduced.    Most state-owned enterprises where women predominate had  established gynecological clinics, rest rooms for pregnant  women, breast-feeding rooms, nurseries and kindergartens.    As the economic status of Chinese women improves, the white  paper says, they are playing an increasing significant role in  the economic sphere.    It says that rural women in China were an important driving  force in invigorating and promoting the rural economy. Females  accounted for more than half of all workers in agriculture,  forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries and water conservancy.    Of the 14 million self-employed rural individuals engaged in  commerce and service trades, women accounted for about  one-third. About 50-60 percent of the total rural output value  was generated by women.    The white paper says that in the cities, women had also made  important contributions to urban economic reform and development.    From 1982 to 1990, the growth rate in the number of females  employed in the following sectors, namely finance, culture and  education, radio and television, public health, sports and  recreation, social welfare, commercial concerns, catering,  supply and storage, and government and social institutions,  exceeded that of males by 21 to 78 percentage points.    In 1993, females accounted for 36.8 percent of those with  professional and technical titles in enterprises and  institutions throughout the country.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by V. Cvetkovska: "Merchandise Worth $1 Billion </F> Passes Through Thessaloniki"]    [Text] The Greek embargo on transit of goods from and to  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  forced Macedonian economists to obtain their first evaluations  and reviews on current and future damages resulting from the  unilateral blockade.    The first general evaluation of the Macedonian Chamber of  Commerce assesses that, besides damages to some companies'  already agreed import-export deals, the southern blockade will  cause direct stoppages in the economy: in production in some  economic sectors due to the impossibility of getting supplies,  but also in disposing of the goods. Lowered productivity  because of this situation threaten to put a complete halt to the  energetic industry and production based on raw materials,  particularly those that will be incapable of solving the  problems caused by additional costs for alternative  transportation routes. The economists were unanimous, at the  last assembly of the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce, in their  demand to the government to request urgent permission from the  UN Sanctions Committee for a transport corridor through the rump  Yugoslavia, because, as the economists said, other alternatives  are only temporary solutions that will cause additional  expenditures and damages. The annual balance of foreign trade  goods delivered through Thessaloniki Harbor reveals that the  value of export-import deals and transit amounts to around $1  billion, and separate analyses on damages to the economy,  energy, metallurgy, metal, chemical, leather, and construction  materials industries, as well as railway traffic, addresses the  fact that, aside from the basic damages caused by the unilateral  blockade, companies must also calculate damages generated from  alternative routes that will have a final impact on their  production process. In the energy sector, negative influences  in petrol supplies and derivatives, coke, coal, and other raw  materials, are expected. Based on the country's energy reserves  for 1994, it was planned to provide 1,100 metric tons of petrol  derivatives, and there are presently 52,000 tons of petrol being  held in Thessaloniki Harbor, amounting to $7 million. The  alternative direction crossing Albania is not the best choice  because of the small storehouses, but also because of the  limited transportation possibilities, thus the refinery will be  able to keep up the process of production only if railway  transportation across the territory of the rump Yugoslavia is  opened, as this would facilitate petrol transportation from  Bulgarian harbors. Increased transportation expenditures, this  sector warned, will be reflected in petrol and derivative  prices, which will be most directly felt in the economy and  citizens through their consumer goods. In order to avoid these  high prices, besides the transportation corridor across the rump  Yugoslavia, it is indispensable to diminish expenditures in the  derivatives production process. The sector most affected by the  Greek blockade is the metal-working industry, which realizes 80  percent of its exports through Thessaloniki Harbor, and 60  percent of raw materials are supplied from that direction. The  first evaluations of this sector's companies are that they will  have to spend an additional $20 million if they are forced to  transport their goods across other areas, such as Burgas and  Drac. Only the Skopje Iron Factory has to import goods worth $84  million from Thessaloniki Harbor and export 340,000 tons of  goods worth $106 million. The iron factory finds that  transportation alternatives across Bulgaria and Albania are  suitable only for small quantities, therefore it will not be  able to keep up even a minimum level of production. Jugohrom has  to import $5 million worth of goods, and import 14,500 tons of  raw materials worth $2.3 million, in the first quarter of the  year. Alternative transportation routes will add $1 million in  extra costs for the first three months; therefore they are  planning to reduce production to 50 percent in case the blockade  remains.    The 11 October Tractor company from Kumanovo had signed a  deal with a Greek partner for $26 million (the water supply  project for Greece), and since there is no other alternative  than pipeline transport, the whole project might "fall into the  water." The mines of Zletovo and Bucim are also expecting  additional expenditures for the supply of raw materials, and the  Alumina factory will be charged $3.4 million extra for  alternative transportation routes. The metal and electrical  industries will have to pay $3.1 million additional for  alternative transportation across Burgas, Varna, Drac, and  Istanbul, and the two "FAM" [not further specified] deals with a  Japanese company and Korea, Egypt, and Iraq will cost them  additional $140,000. The situation in EMO-Ohrid is similar, and  by the end of the year damages will amount to $500,000. OHIS,  which succeeded in finding new markets in Asian countries, will  have to increase its costs by 50 percent, and this chemical  giant has raw materials in the amount of $400,000 being held up  in Thessaloniki Harbor, alongside 13 tons of goods worth  $12,600. "Hemteks" was forced to stop production because it  couldn't get hold of raw materials held hostage on a ship in  Thessaloniki, worth 1 million German marks.  <H5>  No Alternative </H5>   "Strumicanka" will face the most irreconcilible situation in  the textile branch; its production and distribution is 90  percent oriented to Greek companies, which will engender damages  of $12 million. "Makedonka" from Stip will experience damages  of $2.7 million because it also has made import-export deals  with Greek partners. Knitted fabric companies have 100 tons of  knitting materials worth $600,000 held up in Thessaloniki  Harbor, and "Prespateks" from Resen has 33 tons of knitting and  other materials worth $200,000 being held up. The  leather-working sector has been affected by a blockade from two  sides, according to the chamber's observations. There are 18  containers of Australian leather for the needs of "Godel" and  "Dimko Mitrev" valued at $300,000 and assembly firms that have  made deals will have to pay 30 to 40 percent more for  alternative transportation.    Railway transportation, according to the findings of the  Skopje Railway Transport company, will experience monthly losses  of $8 million, and by the end of the year damages will amount to  $80 million, while public cargo transportation losses are  calculated at 14 million German marks. The transportation  companies are multiplying their expenditures by three from the  very start, and the opinion is that the alternative transport  through Albania is almost impossible, because it is difficult to  negotiate and cooperate with them. This problem has been  stressed in particular by the Tehnomental-Vardar, Inteks,  Gradinar Lozar, and Javor companies from Bitola, because, as  they say, it will have negative repercussions not only on trade,  but also on supplies for domestic producers.    These circumstances have compelled economists to be  unanimous  in their request for opening the northern corridor (transit  across the rump Yugoslavia), and they asked the government to  persist in that. The Bulgarians have already fought for that,  although only for humanitarian products. Although economists do  not give up the idea of constructing an east-west corridor  (Albania-Bulgaria-Turkey); still the most convenient solution  for our economy is to open the transit to the north, regardless  of how much more expensive it might be (its opening is expected  to cause new transit prices) -- nevertheless, it does not have  an alternative as a transit point for some products and sectors.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CANADA DRUG TEST AGENCY SOUGHT  </P> <P> Eighty-five days of testimony at a federal inquiry ended with harsh criticism  for sports groups and a $2-million proposal to replace their drug-testing  efforts with an independent agency.  </P> <P> Such an agency, Sport Canada's Director General Abby Hoffman said, would  conduct up to 3,000 random tests for performance-enhancing chemicals annually,  more than seven times the number now conducted on Canadian athletes.  </P> <P> Hoffman suggested that it would go a long way toward preventing the kind of  scandal that surrounded sprinter Ben Johnson when he failed a drug test at the  Seoul Olympics a year ago.  </P> <P> Commissioner Charles Dubin questioned the wisdom of spending public money to  create more bureaucracy instead of trying to improve the "most effective" way  to monitor athletes: watching their daily development.  </P></p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Spreadsheet keeps itself in check ONE of the chores of building a computer spreadsheet is checking that the data has been accurately entered. Reading the numbers back to a colleague is both time-consuming and tedious. But Temair Software, based in Rhode Island, has developed a software package called Spreadsheet Echo which enables the computer to read Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet numbers back to the user. The software will read back a range of numbers either by row or column, can be told to pause between cells, and speak in either a male or female voice. The user can also set speed or volume levels and listen through the computer's internal speaker or through headphones. The programme, which costs Dollars 99.95, is also multilingual. Temair Software: US, 401 454 4565.</p>

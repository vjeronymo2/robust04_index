			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Mircea Snegur by Romanian Radio </F> Broadcasting Company Director General Eugen Preda in Chisinau on  22 February -- recorded]    [Text] [Preda] It is Tuesday, 22 February, 1234 [1034 GMT].  We are in the office of the president of the Republic of  Moldova, Mircea Snegur, who was kind enough to receive us for an  interview intended for the Actualitati [Current Events] program  of Radio Romania.    Mr. President, this is the third time you honor me by  personally granting me an interview. I recall that on 28 July  1991 you gave me the first. Please, allow me to quote a passage  from the end of that interview: To the listeners of Radio  Romania, whom I esteem very much, today, on the 28th of July  1991, I would like to again wish you much health, happiness, and  success. Let us remember that we are relatives, we have common  roots. Let us hope that, by the joint actions we are  undertaking with the Romanian party, our history will reach a  peak in our development. Success, good luck, happiness, and let  us cultivate our kinship. I conclude the quote.    A long period of time has elapsed since then. Would you be  so kind and continue the idea you expressed then and anchor it  to the current moment?    [Snegur] Of course, a great deal of time has elapsed since  that moment, but in principle, in that context, my way of  thinking has not changed, and if you remember, during our recent  [5 February] congress titled "Our Home, the Republic of Moldova"  the same things were reiterated related to our history and  descent, as well as the need to maintain our ties and to  cultivate our kinship, as I said at that time. Thus, in  principle, the main idea calling for us to cultivate our ties as  relatives remains valid.    However, I can also see the reason behind your question  referring especially to that issue, and that is, I believe, the  anti-Snegur campaign launched in the Romanian press following  the aforementioned congress, Our Home, the Republic of Moldova.  In connection with this I would like to point out that our  policy is a sensible one in all domains, and it is being  permanently adapted to the reality in the Republic of Moldova  and to the people's wish to strengthen the state character of  our country, to develop as an independent state, and to preserve  our territorial integrity. At the same time, within the very  same policy, the principal directions regarding the spiritual  and economic integration of the Republic of Moldova with Romania  have remained unaltered.    [Preda] I would like to ask you a question regarding the  Ilascu case. What is your current assessment of that case?    [Snegur] Related to the Ilascu case I would like to say that  I prefer to act, rather than talk about it, so that my  intentions and hopes are still the same, namely that we will  manage to transfer those political prisoners to the  constitutional juridical bodies of the Republic of Moldova. We  have taken measures to that end, and we have also asked for the  support of those who can influence the mentality of the Tiraspol  secessionist leaders. To that purpose I do not find it  embarrassing and I do not try to avoid to meet and engage in  dialogues, regardless of whether they are direct ones or not,  with the Tiraspol authorities. As a matter of fact, yesterday a  number of [Moldovan] officials held talks there on the holding  of the [27 February] general elections in that region as well,  and on the need to maintain our economic and other ties. During  those talks, they again approached that issue [the Ilascu case].  As a result of our efforts, the Dniester leaders, Grigore  Maracuta, for instance, made a number of declarations stating  that they would revise the [death] sentence and adopt different  decisions. I optimistically assess that the problem will be  solved in the end.    [Preda] Recently the inter-ministerial commission met in  Bucharest. I understand that both Bucharest and Chisinau assess  its activity positively. What are your views regarding our  bilateral cooperation?    [Snegur] I consider that our prospects are very good,  because if one draws a balance of our ties and our actions  undertaken last year, in 1993, one can see that a number of new  measures and concrete directions were decided upon to enhance  our bilateral, mutually advantageous economic cooperation. I am  pleased to mention that, during the meeting, you mentioned they  did not talk about politics, but rather about the concrete  problems that ought to be solved by the inter-ministerial  commission. This is a thing that encourages us in a certain  way. We maintain our former position, namely that the  establishment of concrete ties between our companies ought to be  boosted and speeded up, and the commission is able to set up a  certain framework promoting such ties.    I was briefed on the meeting thanks to you -- as you carried  ample reports both on radio and television -- but, of course I  was also briefed here, at home, by the head of our delegation,  and I found that their meeting was a positive and encouraging  one.    [Preda] Mr. President, the inter-ministerial meeting  established a kind of a schedule with respect to various  contacts. According to that schedule, this year the prime  ministers are to meet twice, plus the two meetings of the  inter-ministerial commission. This means that a meeting will  take place in each quarter. Do you expect other meetings as  well, perhaps at an even higher level?    [Snegur] In my opinion, the good understanding between us  and our ties make it possible for us to meet at any time. It is  true that the meetings we held over the past years had been  planned and the agendas had been worked out well in advance, but  whenever problems arise, Mr. President Ion Iliescu and I contact  each other over the telephone and if we decide to see each other  we meet and discuss those problems. Lately the issue of holding  a meeting did not occur to us, but I think that a meeting at the  highest level cannot be excluded.    [Preda] I would like to thank you very much and, in  conclusion, perhaps you would like to address a few words to our  listeners in Romania.    [Snegur] All right, I will do that. All I can say is that  next time we will [words indistinct] such good wishes. This is  welcome because a certain continuity is needed, but please  believe me that I am making efforts to promote a consequent  policy.    My best wishes to the radio listeners. May this year bring  rain and peace. I wish that in Romania work will continue to  further the economic reform. Thus Romania would advance a  little bit in the promotion of the reforms. Thus we will also  have the possibility to examine and turn to good account the  good things they do, but also learn from certain mistakes that  are made. We admire and watch with satisfaction the  democratization processes in Romania and, as a result of this,  you will be witnessing multiparty elections [on 27 February].  [passage indistinct] I hope that this will be a fruitful year  in results and that the harvest will be good, which will raise  the standard of living of the population.    I wish you much health and happiness.    [Preda] Thank you.</p>

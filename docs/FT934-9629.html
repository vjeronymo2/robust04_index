			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / China seeks new phase in relations with US CHINA yesterday called for a new approach to Sino-US relations, describing next week's summit between the presidents of the two countries as a possible turning point in the vexed relationship. Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, said the leaders' gathering at the Asia-Pacific Co-operation Forum to be held in Seattle from November 19-20 was an opportunity for the two sides to put their relations on a more businesslike basis. Presidents Clinton and Jiang Zemin are due to meet on November 19. It will be the first meeting between leaders of the two countries since before the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989 ended high-level contacts. Mr Qian's remarks, in which he stressed the need for relations to be placed in a longer-term perspective, point to China's wish to set nagging problems over arms proliferation and human rights in the context of the broader relationship. Chinese officials believe a preoccupation with human rights is stopping relations between Beijing and Washington reaching their potential. Officials have voiced strong objections to the US linking human rights and trade issues, especially the renewal of China's Most Favoured Trading Nation status. But Mr Clinton is certain to make the point forcefully that China must continue to improve its human rights record to ensure MFN renewal. US officials, including Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, have stepped up their warnings to the Chinese that MFN cannot be taken for granted. The World Bank has estimated that loss of MFN, with its preferential tariffs and quotas on a whole range of items, would cost China Dollars 7bn-Dollars 15bn (Pounds 4.6bn-Pounds 9.9bn) annually in lost sales to the lucrative US market. Mr Clinton said earlier this year when he extended MFN for another 12 months that a further extension would require 'overall, significant progress by China' in human rights. The US also wants improvements in the treatment of prisoners in Chinese jails. It is seeking 'access to Chinese prisons by international human rights organisations' such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). China has always opposed inspection of its prisons, claiming this would constitute 'unwarranted interference'. But Mr Qian indicated a possible softening. Steps taken recently by the Clinton administration to improve relations include the despatch of senior officials to Beijing. Mr Mike Espy, agriculture secretary, is the first cabinet official to visit there since the change of administration.</p>

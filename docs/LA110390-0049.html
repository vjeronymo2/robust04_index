			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> COUNCIL APPROVES 159-UNIT PROJECT  </P> <P> A 159-unit housing development in the Mission Oaks area of Camarillo has  received unanimous approval from the City Council.  </P> <P> But before Pardee Construction Co. can proceed with plans to build the  single-family houses on 36 acres in the eastern portion of the city, it must  take measures to improve the traffic flow along Mission Oaks Boulevard, near  Alta Colina Road.  </P> <P> In addition, Pardee must construct a 30-foot buffer wall between the  development and the existing homes to the south of the proposed project.  </P> <P> Overall, council members said they are pleased with Pardee's plans.  </P> <P> "We got everything we wanted out of them," said Councilman Michael Morgan. "We  got our buffer zone . . . and our traffic study."  </P> <P> Although the council voted Wednesday night to approve the project, it could be  years before construction starts, Morgan said. Pardee must still file for  building permits, which are limited to 400 units a year under the city's  growth-control ordinance. TINA DAUNT  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> PERESTROIKA FOR SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The schools have to be fundamentally restructured. We have to change the  system.  </P> <P> The role of business is the role of the rest of the community, that is to get  in and help to make the necessary changes.  </P> <P> We have some management (skills) and we have the resources to (further) this  process in an effective way.  </P> <P> One of the key elements of restructuring is to realize that the centralized  management that we have today (isn't working). (Give) local schools more power.  It would help a lot.  </P> <P> It's kind of an extreme example, but you can liken it in some way to the  Eastern European economies, which were highly centralized. Everything was  controlled from the top. I think that they found that that economic system just  doesn't work. A (decentralized) democratic sort of system is just much more  efficient. I think that the same sort of perestroika for our school systems  would be very effective.  </P></p>

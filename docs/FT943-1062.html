			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: Brazilian markets put faith in Cardoso reforms - The Emerging Investor When Latin America's biggest economy goes to the polls next Monday its financial markets, and especially Sao Paulo's roller coaster stock market, hope to be toasting Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso as Brazil's next president. The market is betting that Mr Cardoso will speed up privatisation and introduce fiscal reforms to underpin Brazil's current stabilisation plan, which has brought monthly inflation down from 50 per cent in June to below 5 per cent at present. Such reforms are likely to lead to strong, perhaps explosive, growth for the equity market and a big increase in capital raising by Brazilian companies as economic stabilisation triggers pent-up consumer demand. If, as polls suggest, Mr Cardoso wins more votes than the other candidates combined on Monday, a run-off ballot in mid-November will be avoided and Mr Cardoso would enjoy a strong mandate for change. But Sao Paulo's volatile stock market, the fastest growing Latin American market this year, is likely to fall in the short term if the election goes to a run-off ballot, which would probably pit Mr Cardoso against the left-wing Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. Mr Cardoso is leading Mr da Silva by more than 20 points in the polls, largely due to the success in tackling inflation of Brazil's new currency, the real, which Mr Cardoso steered through Congress while finance minister. Market optimism about the real, which is linked to Brazil's foreign exchange reserves of around Dollars 40bn, led Sao Paulo's main index to climb by 65 per cent in dollar terms in July and August, although it has since stabilised as investors take profits. Over the year the index is up by about 90 per cent. One of the spurs to the growth has been growing foreign investment, which has boosted trading volumes and is expected to increase if Mr Cardoso wins the election. Net foreign investment in the stock market this year reached Dollars 5bn by the end of August compared to Dollars 5.5bn for the whole of 1993 and Dollars 1.3bn in 1992. Market capitalisation was Dollars 163bn at the end of August. Although foreigners account for only about 20-25 per cent of trading compared to more than half in Mexico, a taste of what may occur under a Cardoso presidency came last month when there was a record net inflow of Dollars 1.5bn to the stock market from overseas and volume averaged Dollars 500m a day as a Cardoso victory seemed increasingly likely. Despite shares' recent appreciation and the fact that many are now trading at above their book value, the potential for growth is still huge and could reach 300 per cent under the four years of a Cardoso presidency, according to some bullish brokers. They point to Brazil's internal market of 150m consumers, a strong and competitive private sector and an economy that is operating at well below capacity. To tap this potential, say reformers, there needs to be more privatisation combined with an overhaul of Brazil's precarious public finances, its unwieldy tax system and a social security programme under serious funding pressures. Analysts believe that even though Mr Cardoso's left-of- centre Social Democrats will not have a majority in Congress, they are expected to pick up seats there and in state elections. This, combined with Mr Cardoso's electoral allies in the rightwing Liberal Front party could provide a platform for change. Mr Sergio Goldman, an associate director at financial house Bear Stearns' Sao Paulo office, highlights government-controlled giants like the telecom company Telebras which could be privatised. 'A privatised Telebras would be expected to make a return on equity of at least 10 per cent instead of the 3 per cent it will probably show this year. That would mean an increase in profits from Dollars 500m to over Dollars 1.5bn,' says Mr Goldman. However, given Brazil's fragmented political system and opposition to radical change in some areas, such as government-controlled companies, analysts are unsure about how quickly reforms will occur. Some bankers are also cautious about equities growth, even if reforms are adopted. Mr Wayne Perkins, a vice-president at Brazil's Banco Norchem, expects shares to be bullish but says many of the expected reforms have already been anticipated by the market, and that equities are now at a record high and overvalued on several measures, including expected return on equity. Among the sectors expected to outperform the market, he says, are those in areas like food, clothing, retail and electrical goods aimed at poorer consumers who are likely to benefit from increased purchasing power with lower inflation. Previously these consumers, who did not have savings accounts, saw their salaries eroded daily by inflation. But Mr Perkins stresses that stock picking will be the key as many shares in these sectors have already shot up in value this year in expectation of stabilisation. The retail chains Lojas Americanas and Casa Anglo, for example, are now trading at four times their book value per share, he notes. Analysts also predict a big increase in share issues by companies looking for investment capital. Because of Brazil's economic problems and low equity prices companies have not been increasing share capital. There has actually been a reduction in the number of listed companies in recent years. But that scenario should change if the economy is stabilised. A rising stock market is expected to prove more attractive than the small local bond market or the international debt markets for companies seeking capital. To exploit the promise of underwriting fees for equity issues and initial public offerings as well as opportunities in the growing American depositary receipts (ADR) and mergers and acquisitions markets many foreign investment banks have been opening offices in Sao Paulo. Those companies are confident that even if Brazil's stabilisation attempt fails this time round, the country will tackle its economic problems sooner or later. According to a New York-based banker, the question is not whether reforms will happen but when they will happen: 'There's a lot of pressure for change in Brazil. If the real currency fails there will be a crisis and that will make the need for reforms even clearer.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Ten best performing stocks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Friday   Week on week change Stock                     Country       23/9/94    Dollars         %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Telefonos (A)             Peru           1.3930     0.2998     27.42 Guoco Holdings Philippines               Philippines    0.2701     0.0577     27.17 Telefonos (B)             Peru           1.4731     0.2904     24.56 Kordosa                   Turkey         0.4748     0.0924     24.16 Banco Wiese               Peru           5.7855     1.0576     22.37 La Fabril                 Peru           2.1006     0.3700     21.38 Aksa Akrilik Ve Kimya Sanayil                   Turkey         0.6866     0.1130     19.70 Alarko Holdings           Turkey         0.8619     0.1412     19.60 Brisa                     Turkey         0.2075     0.0310     17.54 Peru-Pacifico             Peru           1.0681     0.1582     17.39  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

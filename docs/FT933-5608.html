			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Interest rates hurt Courtaulds Textiles: Courtaulds disappoints HIGHER than expected interest costs adversely affected Courtaulds Textiles, which reported a 16.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.7m in the first half. The drop in net interest payable, from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 2.8m, was less than analysts had expected. Mr Martin Taylor, chairman and chief executive, said analysts had made 'an error' in not realising the impact on interest income of the fall in UK interest rates. Courtaulds keeps most of its cash in sterling deposits. Borrowings declined from Pounds 64.6m to Pounds 53.2m. However, Mr Taylor said the group would be effectively degeared by the year-end when debt should fall back by around Pounds 50m. Profit before interest in the UK rose from Pounds 9m to Pounds 10.6m, while the US edged up to Pounds 4.5m, against Pounds 4.4m. In the rest of Europe, however, profits collapsed from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 400,000. Mr Taylor said: 'The continent is hell. Profits have fallen for five half-years running and that hurts. The outlook is not good.' The contribution from the pension fund surplus fell from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 700,000. Profits before interest slipped from Pounds 16.2m to Pounds 15.3m on increased turnover of Pounds 422.5m (from Pounds 394.9m). It was the first rise in sales since the demerger from Courtaulds Chemicals three years ago. Mr Taylor said: 'Last year we reported big profit increases but were bearish about the UK economy. This time profits have fallen but we are basically bullish about the British recovery.' A change in boardroom responsibilities follows Mr Taylor's appointment as chief executive of Barclays Bank, which he starts in January. Mr Noel Jervis, managing director, will replace Mr Taylor as chief executive. Earnings per share fell to 10.4p from 12.2p. The interim dividend is raised from 4.4p to 4.7p.

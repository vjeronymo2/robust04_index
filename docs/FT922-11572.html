			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / BAe appoints ex-BTR chief as chairman BRITISH AEROSPACE ended its seven-month search for a chairman with yesterday's announcement that Mr John Cahill, former chief executive of BTR, will take over from Sir Graham Day next month. Sir Graham has been acting chairman of BAe since Professor Sir Roland Smith was forced to resign in a spectacular boardroom coup last September after the failure of the company's Pounds 432m rights issue. Other possible candidates are believed to have been approached but to have been reluctant to take the job because they would have had to continue working with BAe's existing top management team. Sir Graham insisted that 'only one offer was made; John was the man. We are very pleased'. Mr Cahill said that he intended to work closely with Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, and the company's board, but he would not be drawn on how he planned to tackle the specific problems and issues facing the company. Sir Graham said Mr Cahill would be a full-time chairman because 'you can't do this job as a part-time chairman'. Mr Cahill's immediate challenge will be to restore the credibility and reputation of the company which was badly dented by the failure of its rights issue, the ensuing boardroom turmoil and the resignation of Sir Roland. BAe's new chairman takes over as the company is refocusing on core defence and aerospace businesses, under pressure because of defence cuts and the slump in civil aviation. Mr Cahill regards defence 'as the main thrust' of the company. 'We have an opportunity to pick up some market share in this business,' he said, adding that he considered defence and aerospace as a 'healthy business'. BAe will also announce the appointment of a finance director to replace Mr Dudley Eustace, who resigned last month, at its annual shareholder's meeting next Thursday. The City welcomed the appointment of Mr Cahill, 62, an experienced international businessman who was chief executive of the BTR industrial engineering group from 1987 to 1991. BAe's shares closed yesterday 5p higher at 348p after rising at one stage by as much as 16p. After a review of BAe's activities, aerospace analysts expect Mr Cahill to speed up the restructuring process spelt out in last year's rights issue document. Mr Cahill will work closely with Mr Evans and the present BAe senior management, but is also expected to adopt a hands-on approach, examining every business in BAe's portfolio. 'He is no soft touch, and he has a big opportunity to turn the company around during the next five years,' one City analyst said. Sir Graham said the search for a new chairman had involved finding 'someone who was British with a solid business record and with international experience'.

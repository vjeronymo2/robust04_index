			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed feature on first session of National Council </F> of Accord for Russia Movement in Moscow 28 May, incorporating  accounts of speeches by State Duma Deputy Sergey Glazyev,  Federal Assembly Deputy Petr Romanov, Social Democratic People's  Party Chairman Aleksandr Rutskoy, and Communist Party of the  Russian Federation leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, under the general  heading "Russia Should Once Again Believe in Itself: Broad  Patriotic Movement's National Council Has Taken Place in Moscow.  The Fatherland. Morality. Professionalism"]    [Text] Aleksandr Rutskoy, former Russian vice president,  chairman of the Social Democratic People's Party, and hero of  the Soviet Union:  <H5>  "New Russians" Are West's Fifth Column </H5>   Before it is too late we must explain to people and make the  masses conscious of the fact that as a result of the bloody  slaughter in Moscow and the dissolution and bombardment of the  supreme constitutional organs of power, an antipeople  police regime has been established in the country, whose basic  levers of control are force and disinformation. We have an  obligation to explain unambiguously to society what we can  expect in the future from the antipeople regime which has taken  under its wing a tyrannical clan of power-seekers, unprincipled  political posers, and skilled adventurists who are selling  Russia lock, stock, and barrel.... The class of so-called "new  Russians," comprising representatives of the most well-off  strata of society who have managed to grow fantastically rich by  plundering the country and redistributing material wealth and  resources, has formed and established itself.... The "new  Russians" are those mafia clans which are ruling the country,  the corrupt bureaucrats who serve their political, ideological,  and social interests, the section of the intelligentsia which  has sold out to the the regime, and the criminal world....  We have every right to claim that the regime which has become  established in the country is serving the interests of Western  powers, international financial circles, and their fifth column  in Russia -- the "new Russians".... Even the destruction of the  country's industrial potential caused by the bloody war with  fascist Germany cannot be compared to the damage which the  enthusiastic reformers have inflicted at the behest of their  Western sponsors. According to many indicators, the level of  the country's economy and the population's standard of living  has fallen twice as much as during the four years of the war....  If such a policy is continued, Russia may in the very near  future come up against mass unemployment for the first time in  75 years, which in some regions may affect up to 30 percent of  the working population. In such circumstances a social  explosion will become inevitable....    Today you cannot help but broach the subject expressed by  the  slogan: "Let's live in harmony." Suffering from an  ill-concealed inferiority complex after the coup d'etat and the  failure of December's electoral farce, the regime decided to pin  the blame on everybody and cover their wound with the fig leaf  of the "Social Accord Treaty." This would have been funny had  it not been so sad. Because for a head of state to sign a  treaty with heads of administration and a government whom he  himself had appointed and to attempt to negotiate an agreement  with social and political organizations on a series of  self-evident issues, which are incidentally regulated by law, is  no more than a display, a farce, whose tragic finale is known in  advance. But the treaty appeared. Everybody has now finally  seen who is who. The alignment of socio-political forces has  become precise and clear. Those supporting the antipeople police  regime lifted the veil themselves and shattered the various  myths surrounding left-wingers, right-wingers, and centrists  supposedly representing the opposition. Now everything has  fallen into place, now even a political novice can grasp who is  on whose side and who is against whom or what. Fortunately, the  myth about "centrism," which confused the public consciousness,  has also been shattered. Today everyone has begun to understand  that Russia lacks a social base for refined centrist policies,  since its basis -- the middle class -- does not exist. What  kind of pure "centrism" can we be talking about when during  three years of "reforms" the most fundamental social and  property-based stratification of the people has taken place?  What kind of centrism can there be when 3 percent of people in  the country are rich, 7 percent are moderately well-off, 50  percent are poor, and 40 percent are destitute?    Today there is a struggle in progress between two  parties: the party of national betrayal which is in power, and  the national opposition party which is defending the people's  and the state's interests, and comprises both left-wingers  and right-wingers, who are nevertheless united about one thing  -- love for their Homeland and serving their people  patriotically.    ...It is necessary to state in a precise and clear manner  the  movement's strategic aim which is as follows and cannot be  otherwise: to come to power and implement a series of measures  to restore order, revive the economy, and reestablish the  country's unity within the borders of the Soviet Union. The  route to achieving this is based on victory in the elections.  Therefore, we should unambiguously state that we demand that  early elections of the Russian Federation president should be  held.... A government in opposition should be formed and  proclaimed at the assembly, and candidacies for all positions in  the state administration nominated right down to regional level.    In conclusion I would like to point out that if we form a  line, a scrimmage, in the struggle for power, we can only expect  defeat. We should act as a united front, forget all squabbles,  rows, disputes, and insults. We do not have all that much time  left. It is time to put a stop to unprincipled behavior,  spinelessness, and compromise. Either we, having once  genuinely united, resolve the issue of power and save the  country, or we will be crushed by the approaching colonial  democracy and orgy of crime, and the next of the regime's  proteges will get into office under the cover of the political  hullabaloo.    Gennadiy Zyuganov, deputy of the State Duma and leader of  the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation:  <H5>  Repeal the Criminal Belovezhskaya Deal! </H5>   What does the present state power actually represent? It is  the power of a parasitic minority over the vast majority of the  people. The dominion of a handful of people, linked by a  network of mutual support and rich from plundering public  property, is becoming more and more firmly established in  Russia. As plunder and thieving on a wide scale have become  possible with the permission and encouragement of the present  authorities, they themselves are becoming criminal and are  turning corruption into an ordinary everyday phenomenon. The  support of Western capital is turning the Russian authorities  into an exclusively comprador, antipeople force....    The second Russian conference of the Communist Party of the  Russian Federation, which took place in April of this year, came  to the conclusion that this regime has no constitutional and  legal basis whatsoever, and is one of the main sources of civil  confrontation and a serious obstacle on the path to social  accord. The conference drew up a series of general democratic  measures in the area of politics aimed at overcoming the present  situation by peaceful means, and I think that the "Accord for  Russia" movement could use these proposals of ours as a basis.    The preparation of proposals for the creation of a  government  of national confidence is the most important part of our work  and should be commenced immediately. The names of the  candidates for such a government should be published and its  members' work should be organized with a view to studying the  situation in the appropriate areas of public life, with  appearances in the press and on television. A detailed program  should be produced and highly professional managers selected.  On the basis of the election results, such a shadow government  could be transformed into an actual government of national  confidence....    Preparations for a presidential election should run  alongside  those for the general elections. Here "Accord for Russia"  should clearly direct its attention to forming a kind of state  council of its most authoritative leaders. In the event of a  presidential election being called, it would be possible to  nominate one or two agreed candidacies from among them, which  need not be advertised before the election is announced.  Opposition candidates for the post of president could make a  general statement to the effect that the presidency as a state  institution contradicts Russia's historical practice and  traditions. One of the new president's first actions should be  to make an amendment to the Constitution abolishing the  institution of the presidency and restoring genuine people's  power in the form of the unified system of soviets of people's  deputies....    The struggle to recreate a renewed Union of the Soviet  peoples on a voluntary basis will be an inseparable part of the  "Accord for Russia" organizations' activities. The most  important action here would be for the parliaments of all states  formed on the USSR's territory to denounce the Belovezhskaya  agreements. The first public step in this direction could be  the adoption by the second congress of USSR peoples of the  general idea of resurrecting the Union, and the holding of a  meeting in Belovezhskaya Forest in December 1994 involving  representatives of all the Soviet republics' patriotic forces,  who will declare in the name of their peoples that the criminal  agreement between the three presidents has been repealed.</p>

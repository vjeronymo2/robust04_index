			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LIKE A PANDORA'S BOX  </P> <P> Regarding your editorial, "The Real Issue Is Students' Health" (Feb. 19), the  birth control controversy may have clouded the issue. We in Los Angeles know  experientially that school-based clinics have no silver lining.  </P> <P> San Fernando High School (in the L.A. Unified School District), received a  clinic in November, 1987. About 25% of the predominantly Hispanic 3,000-member  student body uses its services. This on-campus clinic has been a classic case  of "what you see is (not) what you get." We were promised comprehensive health  care. What we got is nothing more than basic first aid and simple, diagnostic  medical care. In fact, the majority of the time, students are not treated by a  doctor, but by a nurse practitioner or clinician.  </P> <P> The real kicker about the school-based clinic is that (with the exception of  dispensing medication), almost two-thirds of its services are already provided  to students by our approximately $20-million annual student health services  division budget. The greatest use of the clinic is for sports physicals, which  have always been provided by our district.  </P> <P> The birth control issue does cloud other equally vital issues. Ripe for debate  is the unlimited medical malpractice liability, the distraction of the learning  process that an on-campus clinic causes, real and future cost, as well as the  duplication of services, both within the school and community.  </P> <P> School-based clinics, when opened, become not what you see, but what you get.  Just like Pandora's box.  </P> <P> EADIE GIEB  </P> <P> Pacoima  </P></p>

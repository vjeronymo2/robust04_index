			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Lending fall shows demand still weak A SURPRISE FALL in bank and building society lending to individuals and companies has underlined the fact that demand pressures are still weak in spite of signs of recovery. Lending in March fell by Pounds 1.2bn compared with the previous month, after a Pounds 700m rise in February, figures released yesterday by the Bank of England show. Some of the seasonally adjusted fall can be explained by large debt repayments in the manufacturing sector. M4, a broad measure of money supply which takes in bank and building society deposits as well as notes and coins, rose by 0.7 per cent in March compared with February to show a year-on-year rise of 3.6 per cent. Although this was higher than the year-on-year increase in February of 3.3 per cent, the figure is still only just inside the Treasury's 'monitoring range' of 3 per cent to 9 per cent. That indicates relatively fragile demand for credit. The British Bankers' Association said that last month the nine biggest banks which it represents received net repayments of Pounds 900m, after showing a rise in lending of Pounds 200m in February. It said manufacturers had repaid debts, on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, worth a net Pounds 1.4bn. This was the largest figure since it started records in 1986. The repayment was boosted partly by many businesses having large amounts of surplus cash as a result of public expenditure, reflected in the large government deficit last month of Pounds 9.5bn. Another factor which had damped companies' need for borrowing was a run of rights issues. Lending to individuals by the nine banks rose during the month by a relatively high Pounds 1.1bn, even though the figure was magnified by March being a month when quarterly interest payments become due.</p>

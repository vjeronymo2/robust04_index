			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The Malaysian envoy to  Tokyo criticized Japan on Thursday [23 June] for remaining  noncommittal on the planned East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC),  saying Japan's position depends on that of the United States.    In a speech at a Tokyo hotel, Malaysian Ambassador to Japan  H. M. Khatib said Japan has not yet made a decision on whether  to join the EAEC because it is "very concerned" about the U.S.  position on the caucus.    Japan initially said it was waiting for a consensus on the  plan by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), but  is still undecided even after a consensus was reached, he said.    "All it has said so far is that it is still studying the  proposal and is waiting for more details about operational  aspects of the EAEC," Khatib said in the speech sponsored by the  Asian Affairs Research Council.    "It seems clear to us that Japan's position on the EAEC is  dependent on the U.S. position," he said. "As long as the  United States remains opposed to the EAEC, Japan has excuses not  to be part of this caucus."    He said it would be a "pity" if Japan, which could play an  important part in the EAEC, would cause the EAEC project to  stall, pointing out that Japan's absence from the caucus would  make China and South Korea reluctant to participate.    But he said ASEAN would wait for Japan to make a decision  because Japan is important for the caucus.    Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed proposed the  establishment of the EAEC in 1990. The potential members  include Japan, South Korea and emerging Southeast Asian nations.    Khatib said the EAEC aims at promoting an open and free  trade  system and is not meant to be a closed, inward-looking trade  bloc. It is also compatible and unconfrontational with the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, he said.    The envoy said ASEAN believes the U.S. would approve of the  EAEC once it has a better understanding of the idea, so that  ASEAN will continue to be "transparent" with the U.S. about it.    But if the U.S. still cannot "rid itself of its own  difficulties" despite the transparency, ASEAN hopes the U.S.  will not take any "measures destructive of this positive effort  to further enhance growth of East Asian economies which will  also benefit the U.S. in turn," he said.    "It really is unwise for anyone to kill the goose that could  lay enough golden eggs for all," he said.    Mahathir, who boycotted the U.S. invitation to an informal  APEC summit in Seattle last November, will attend another summit  in Indonesia this fall, he said.</p>

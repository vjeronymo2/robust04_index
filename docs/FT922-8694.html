			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Hapag-Lloyd pays more after sharp rise PRE-TAX profits at Hapag-Lloyd, the German shipping, airline and travel group, improved dramatically last year, rising to DM140m (Dollars 84.8m) from DM41m in 1990. The dividend is to be increased to DM10 from DM8 per share. The group is also proposing a rights issue, raising its authorised share capital by a nominal DM40m - an increase of a third on existing share capital of DM120m. Hapag-Lloyd said that the aim of the issue was to secure funds for further investment in growth areas of its business. Details will be fixed at the date the new shares are issued following the shareholders' meeting on June 22. The company warned that operating profits would probably fall this year because of declining returns in the shipping sector, the group's biggest business. Mr Hans Jakob Kruse, chairman, said the central reason for the turnround in group profits last year was the recovery in the liner shipping division, accounting for 57 per cent of group total sales of DM3.66bn last year. This was due to 'substantial improvements in cost structures'. The chairman said the shipping division's returns were still inadequate in view of the heavy capital tied up in ships and containers, and forecast that the business would remain vulnerable to declining trade growth rates and an over-supply of shipping space and weak freight rates. The trend during the current year would be markedly weaker, he said. The tourism division, which accounted for almost a third of group turnover, had a good year in profits terms with a particularly good performance from the Hapag-Lloyd airline because of high seat-load factors.</p>

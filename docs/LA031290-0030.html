			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOOK EDITOR HEADS CRITICS CIRCLE  </P> <P> Jack Miles, book editor of the Los Angeles Times, has been named president of  the National Book Critics Circle.  </P> <P> "People are always talking about how the literary world is a New York-East  Coast Establishment.  </P> <P> One of the things we were proud to affirm by having Jack be our president is  that is not the case," said Thomas M. Disch, vice president and secretary of  the organization. "The National Book Critics Circle is a national organization,  and it's wonderful that we should have a president who is located on one of our  coasts other than the Eastern one. It's about time."  </P> <P> Miles, Disch added, was selected by acclamation by the group's board of  directors, who represent 591 members throughout the country.  </P> <P> The circle is best known for its prestigious annual literary awards in fiction,  poetry, general nonfiction, biography and criticism. "But our main function is  to look after the interests of book reviewers," said Disch, noting that in the  natural course of his work at The Times, Miles will also be doing the work of  the organization.  </P> <P> Before joining The Times in 1985, Miles was executive editor of the University  of California Press at UCLA, where he was responsible for generating and seeing  into print about 25 titles a year.  </P> <P> A native of Chicago, Miles spent 10 years as a Jesuit seminarian, educated in  Rome, Germany and Israel as well as in the United States.  </P> <P> He received a Ph.D. in Near Eastern languages from Harvard University in 1971  and has taught at Loyola University of Chicago. Miles has also taught at the  University of Montana and worked as an editor at Doubleday &amp; Co.  </P></p>

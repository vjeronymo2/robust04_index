			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Medical Records and Certification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters suggested we specify in the regulations what constitutes a certification that a transfer is in the patient's best interests. They asked if an entry in the patient's medical record would be sufficient certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before an unstabilized individual may be transferred in the absence of a request for transfer, the statute requires a physician to sign a certification that based upon the information available at the time, the medical benefits reasonably expected from appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual and, in the case of labor, to the unborn child, from effecting the transfer. If a physician is not physically present in the emergency department at the time of transfer, a qualified medical person may sign the certification after consulting with a physician who later countersigns that certification. Section 1867(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii) of the Act, both as added by COBRA (section 9121(b)) and revised by OBRA 89 (section 6211(c)(4)), requires an express written certification by a physician or other qualified medical personnel attesting to the elements just delineated; the certification, while it may be written explicitly into the medical record, cannot simply be inferred from the findings in the medical record and the fact that the individual was transferred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree with the Fifth Circuit, in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Burditt  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 934 F.2d 1362 (5th Cir. 1991) wherein the court, in addressing whether there had been a knowing violation of section 1867 of the Act, held that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> A hospital may violate [the certification] provision in four ways. First, before transfer, the hospital might fail to secure the required signature from the appropriate medical personnel on a certification form. But the statute requires more than a signature; it requires a signed certification. Thus, the hospital also violates the statute if the signer has not actually deliberated and weighed the medical risks and the medical benefits of transfer before executing the certification. Likewise, the hospital fails to make the certification required by 42 U.S.C. 1395dd(c)(1)(A)(ii) if the signer makes an improper consideration a significant factor in the certification decision. Finally a hospital violates the statute if the signer actually concludes in the weighing process that the medical risks outweigh the medical benefits of transfer, yet signs a certification that the opposite is true.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1867(d)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, as amended by section 6211(e) of OBRA 89, now allows imposition of civil monetary penalties if the physician ``knew or should have known that the benefits did not outweigh the risks.'' We are therefore revising &sect;489.24(d)(1)(ii)(B) to require that a certification state the reasons for the transfer and include a summary of the risks and benefits upon which it is based. As the statute requires that a physician or other qualified medical personnel in consultation with a physician weigh the benefits and risks associated with the transfer before an unstabilized individual may be transferred, it should not be unduly burdensome for the physician or other medical personnel to state the risks and benefits that have been weighed. It should be noted, however, that, under the statute, the physician, not the qualified medical personnel, makes the transfer determination in all cases. The narrative rationale need not be a lengthy discussion of the individual's medical condition reiterating facts already contained in the medical record, but it should give a complete picture of the benefits to be expected from appropriate care at the receiving facility and the risks associated with the transfer, including the time away from an acute care setting necessary to effect the transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revised &sect;489.24(d)(2)(iii) (formerly a part of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)) requires that the certification be included in the individual's medical record and that it be sent to the receiving hospital along with the transferred individual. We believe that this will assist the receiving hospitals in determining whether the individual was transferred appropriately under the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters believe it is unreasonable and burdensome to require physicians to sign for every patient transferred and that it is unduly harsh to assess a criminal penalty for a decision that could be a mistake.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1867(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act requires a physician to certify patient transfers because it was the intent of Congress to protect emergency patients and women in labor against erroneous transfers. However, the statute and the regulations do allow other qualified medical personnel, in consultation with a physician, to certify patient transfers when a physician is not physically present in the emergency department so long as the physician later countersigns. Penalties, however, are civil in nature, not criminal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter wants the regulations revised to require that medical records accompany not only unstabilized but stabilized patients being transferred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

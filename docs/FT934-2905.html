			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Paving the way towards Emu - FT writers report on the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels European Union leaders yesterday prepared the way for much closer co-operation on macro-economic performance in the run-up to full economic and monetary union. They agreed the principle of legally binding macro-economic guidelines, including a general call for lower interest rates, wage restraint, lower budget deficits and government debt. But French objections to the details delayed formal adoption of the proposals. Mr Henning Christophersen, European economics commissioner, said the guidelines - required under the Maastricht treaty - would probably be adopted by EU finance ministers in Brussels on Monday. The guidelines are a diluted version of the original proposal but Mr Christophersen said they would still be used 'as a basis for the examination of the (economic) performance of member states'. The French difficulties concern the wording on wage restraint - France and others believe they should be tougher - and binding commitments to the EU budget limits agreed at last year's Edinburgh summit. Finance ministers also discussed yesterday the practical work of the European Monetary Institute, the forerunner of a European central bank, which will supervise the second phase of Emu, beginning on January 1. Officials said that European Union leaders were likely formally to endorse Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, a Hungarian-born Belgian, as first president of the EMI before the summit ends tomorrow. Mr Lamfalussy made clear he expected to be heavily involved in the discussion of EU economic affairs, even though the EMI's statutory role is mainly supervisory. Germany and Britain have resisted suggestions by the Belgian presidency and Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, that the EMI's role should be beefed up. But Mr Lamfalussy is still likely to work closely with the finance ministers, Belgian officials said yesterday. He will attend their meetings when the preparations for Emu are discussed. The first EMI board meeting is likely to take place on January 3, although it will take a few months for a working secretariat to be established in Frankfurt, where the EMI will be based. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said the Bundesbank would restrict itself to providing technical help to establish the EMI. He added that Germany would not be among those countries which would allow the EMI to manage their monetary reserves during the second phase of Emu. Mr Christophersen played down German opposition to a strong EMI. 'I think they (the Germans) have been so keen to get it to Frankfurt .. because they want it to be a real institution, with some influence,' he told journalists. 'Why in heaven have it in Frankfurt unless it has real powers?'</p>

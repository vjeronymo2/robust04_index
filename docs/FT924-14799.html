			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Lilley signals financial curbs on social security A CLEAR signal that the social security department will become a casualty of fierce Treasury curbs on public spending, which might yet see it reneging on Conservative manifesto commitments, was given yesterday by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary. To escape the recession, 'we must curb public spending, including social security', Mr Lilley told the Conservative conference. Talking later to journalists, he refused even to reaffirm the Tories election pledge to uprate child benefit in line with inflation, or discuss possible hikes in the National Insurance contributions ceiling. 'I'm not going to respond to specific items,' he insisted. Mr Lilley is understood to be fighting the Treasury hard to avoid overturning election promises, but a number of other cuts are fast becoming probabilities. These include reducing the period during which the jobless are entitled to unemployment benefit from 12 months to six, although resulting savings would be offset partially by higher Income Support payments. Housing benefit and disability allowances could also be hit. With discussions still continuing, the Treasury may still succeed in imposing stronger control over the social security department's Pounds 70bn budget. Legislation to end the statutory uprating of state pensions - which will be based on September's inflation figure released tomorrow - is being actively canvassed by the Treasury. In a speech geared largely at playing to the instincts of many of the Tory representatives, Mr Lilley promised renewed efforts to clamp down on social security fraud, setting a target of Pounds 500m in savings this year and hinting at a higher target for next year. 'I'm closing down the something-for-nothing society,' he declared. He singled out 'councillors who draw the dole to run leftwing campaigns' and 'young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue' as being on his 'little list of benefit offenders who I'll soon be rooting out'. Hinting that he is anxious to see greater targeting of benefits, Mr Lilley said that 'improving benefits is not just a question of spending more money. It's how we spend it that counts.' But, while he wanted to focus benefits on the most needy, he wished also to restore incentives to work which would limit the extent to which further 'means-testing' could be introduced. Other priorities included simplifying the benefits system and encouraging personal responsibility. He stressed the importance of absent parents contributing to the upkeep of their children. He also announced the setting up of a new 'family credit' advice line. Mr Lilley said the helpline would mean that, for the first time, a benefits advice service would be available to potential claimants as well as those already claiming family credit. He also underlined his previous announcement of tougher rules affecting so-called New Age Travellers.</p>

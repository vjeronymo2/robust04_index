			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Greece supports the membership of Cyprus in NATO if  the U.S. plan for gradual expansion of the North Atlantic  alliance toward the east is adopted. NATO expansion was at the  center of discussions today, the first day of the NATO summit.    NATO leaders today approved a plan to establish closer  military ties with all former communist countries in East  Europe, including Russia. However, NATO leaders refrained from  adopting a demand by many former East European countries to join  NATO as equal members. The United States proposed a plan to  gradually expand the alliance to the east. According to  reliable Greek sources in Brussels, the Greek side is taking a  positive approach to the U.S. plan but believes this expansion  should include all CSCE members, in order to open the way for  the membership of Cyprus.</p>

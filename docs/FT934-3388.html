			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Political Notebook: Peace at Christmas? A new Anglo-Irish declaration by Christmas. Yes. But, peace by Christmas. Who knows? Such is the assessment of an informed insider in Mr John Major's government on the precarious search for a settlement in Northern Ireland. The judgment is a more interesting than it looks. For a start it would have been hard to imagine only a few weeks ago that a senior minister would be talking even about the possibility of an end to 25 years of IRA terrorism. Now, for all the embarrassment which followed the disclosure of Britain's clandestine contacts with Sinn Fein, ministers are still taking seriously the prospect that the IRA may be about to throw in the towel. All sorts of people in Whitehall are talking about how the IRA's middle-aged leadership has been shaken by the unthinking brutality of the latest wave of loyalist terrorism. It despairs at the future facing its children. Others assert with confidence that if the IRA's council called an end to violence, any renegade units would be dealt with. The IRA, we are told, has a disciplined command structure and central control of all its main arms dumps. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is more optimistic still. He believes a form of words which pays a little more than lip-service to the aspirations of Irish nationalism will persuade the gunmen to emerge from the shadows. He was furious when he discovered that Mr Major had been in continuous dialogue with Sinn Fein for most of this year and, probably, for a great deal longer. But the squall has passed. Mr Reynolds, according to British intelligence, has had his own contacts with the republican leadership. So the two leaders have been going line-by-line through the draft of their proposed joint declaration. By the end of last week's meeting about two-thirds of a document running to three or four pages in total had been agreed. The difficult bits were left for this week's second meeting in Brussels and, perhaps, for a third in London next week. But further progress has been made during talks among officials. The sticking points have been well-rehearsed. The main one centres on finding language to reconcile the nationalist demand for Irish self-determination with the British guarantee of the unionist veto in the north. Mr Reynolds wants provision in the joint statement that any permanent political settlement would be subject to concurrent referenda in the south and north. He wants also an all-Ireland convention to give form to the south's legitimate interest in the affairs of the north. That, along with British recognition of the legitimacy or validity of unity (Mr Major has baulked at 'value'), would represent a nod in Sinn Fein's direction. For his part Mr Major will get an unequivocal Irish commitment to the 'consent' principle in Northern Ireland: de facto recognition of the unionist veto over any constitutional change. Mr Reynolds is also ready to include a pledge that part of a longer-term political settlement would be the removal from its constitution of the republic's legal claim to Northern Ireland. If that - along with another offer to Sinn Fein to join negotiations once it had renounced violence - represents the structure of the eventual joint statement, there is still plenty of argument to come. In Anglo-Irish relations the devil is in the language. Words such as self-determination or joint authority are loaded with sinister implications for the unionists. Mr Major can do nothing without at least tacit support from them. Mr Major has told Mr Reynolds he is prepared to reaffirm Britain's studied neutrality over the ultimate future of the province. The lesson of recent weeks is that the exasperation of the British people with Northern Ireland has provided the prime minister with an opportunity to take more risks with unionist opinion than most of his predecessors. But some things - words such as self-determination and a permanent all-Ireland convention are among them - move too far in the direction of the nationalists. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, has told Mr Major he will not have it. So different words and phrases will have to be found. By the end of the process - probably next week - there will be plenty of rhetorical contortions to allow Dublin to say it has met the aspirations of the nationalists and London to say it has safeguarded unionist opinion. There is danger though in such dilution. Sinn Fein and the IRA may conclude there is no incentive to join negotiations. In addition, the message to unionists may be sufficiently disconcerting to prompt a further upsurge in loyalist terrorism. Sadly, declarations offer no guarantee of peace.</p>

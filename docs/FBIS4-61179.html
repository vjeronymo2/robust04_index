			<p>BFN     [Text] An official visit by a Russian parliamentary  delegation to Kyrgyzstan began yesterday. It is led by  Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. He said when  signing an interparliamentary agreement: Even if you leave in  our agreement only the (?first clause) saying that the sides  will contribute to developing interparliamentary cooperation and  promoting equal and mutually beneficial relations in political,  social, economic, cultural, and other spheres, this alone would  be sufficient for the successful development of ties between  parliaments and peoples of the two sovereign countries.    The Russian Federation Council chairman first visited Prime  Minister Dzhumagulov. For over an hour they discussed economic  problems of the two republics. They also discussed the issue of  putting to a better use Kyrgyzstan's former defense facilities.  Their capacities are not being used at present. However, each  sovereign state should be able to defend itself. Therefore the  defense industry should not be moved backstage, and the  centuries-old, friendly relations between the two countries  should not be neglected. As the saying goes: An old friend is  better than two new ones. We cannot ask Russia alone to settle  the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh. We don't want it to be blamed  for imperialist manners, if it alone will be forced to impose  order here. Of course, we recognize the special interests of  Russia in relation to this and other regions of the former USSR.  But at present, Russia not only counts on its own forces but  expects that all the other CIS countries will correctly  understand its policy. All this was stated by Sherimkulov,  speaker of the Kyrgyzstan parliament, during a brief news  conference after signing the agreement on interparliamentary  cooperation between the two countries.    Russian Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko said:  Russia's main interest is (?peace) in Central Asia and the  Caucasus. The Russian armed forces in the Caucasus are a kind of  dividing line between warring sides. We recently reached an  accord on economic cooperation of the CIS countries, but it is  impossible to do anything for the well-being of people if two  CIS member-countries are fighting against each other. This  impedes developments in the CIS.    Answering the question from a journalist from  Nagorno-Karabakh on details of the peace-making plan, Shumeyko  said: Parliamentarians agree on this issue -- that a  comprehensive approach to this problem should be taken. We can  speak about three stages: First, full cessation of military  activities [words indistinct] and signing a peace treaty. Only  after this can we specify the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. No  less important is the fact that a third side has been invited to  participate in talks on settling the conflict -- the three  chairmen of Supreme Soviets of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan,  the Russian Federation, and representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh  will try to find a solution to the problem that has not been  solved by governments. Under these conditions the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly cannot withdraw until it finds a  solution to the problem, Shumeyko said.    The guests left for Osh and Dzhalalabad oblasts, the areas  where natural calamity has happened. Talks on settling the  Caucasian conflict will begin on 4 May.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 8 June, together with responsible comrades of the  provincial agricultural, power industrial, and pricing units as  well as responsible comrades of some cities and counties,  including Gaocheng, Xianxian, and Lincheng, Leaders Cheng  Weigao, Li Bingliang, and Gu Erxiong studied and explored the  situation where the province reduced the peasants' burdens and  solved the problems relating to the rural areas' electricity  charges in the past years as well as some existing problems.  They also exchanged views on the measures that should be  adopted this summer when planting, harvesting, and field  management are underway.    Cheng Weigao stressed: According to the relevant state  regulations, we should give to the peasants all the interests  that should be given to them. None is allowed to violate  regulations to add burdens on the peasants. There must be no  increase in added burdens, even 1 yuan. Due to the scissors  movement of the prices for farm and sideline products, the  comparative efficiency of agriculture has been reduced over the  past years. Along with the decreases in the output of the  province's cotton and oil-bearing crops, the peasants' real  income has become stagnant, and that in some localities has even  been reduced. It is a foregone conclusion that the province  will have a summer grain harvest this year. Thus, the peasants  engaged in summer grain production will possibly register a  bigger increase in their income. The problem at present is that  we must not think of adding burdens on the peasants when the  agricultural situation is better, and the peasants' income  increases slightly. At present, we must realistically adopt  measures and concentrate energy on grasping the planting,  harvesting, and field management in the rural areas. According  to the state regulations, the grain departments should do a good  job in purchasing summer grain. Those who violate regulations  to reduce [words indistinct] and prices and to damage the  peasants' interests should strictly be punished. We should not  only ensure to give to the peasants the interests that should be  given to them according to the state regulations but also  strictly prevent the occurrence of a rise in the peasants'  burdens after a fall so as to mobilize their enthusiasm and to  ensure a sustained, faster, and smooth development of  agriculture and the national economy.    In regard to the issue of ensuring the supply of electricity  for the rural areas' three summer jobs and the issue concerning  electricity charges, Cheng Weigao pointed out: The provincial  discipline inspection commission, the provincial supervisory  department, the power industrial department, and the pricing  department should continuously regard the issue concerning the  rural areas' electricity prices as an important task and firmly  grasp it. The staff and workers contingents of the power  industrial units should well be consolidated and managed.    Cheng Weigao pointed out: At present, we should also  strengthen the propaganda and education for the peasants and  urge them not only to resist unreasonable burdens but also to  fulfill the duties that every citizen should fulfill. So, the  peasants should ensure the delivery of grain in good quality and  full quantity and automatically hand over to higher levels the  money to be obtained by the higher levels in a reasonable and  unified way.</p>

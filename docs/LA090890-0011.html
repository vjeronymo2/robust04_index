			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIVING THE ANSWERS TO A DIRECT QUESTION  </P> <P> Do TV sports directors ever watch sports at home? They are so out of touch with  viewers that I feel the need to point out some obvious mistakes of TV sports  coverage:  </P> <P>  -- Sports viewers never want live action displaced by replays. Never.  </P> <P>  -- Sports viewers don't want even a few minutes of non-sports background  informantion -- like having to watch how Grover Cleveland established Labor Day  before the real coverage of U.S. Open Tennis began.  </P> <P>  -- Sports viewers who watch boxing have no morals. They are not offended by a  boxer getting beaten bloody and they would also not be offended if the cameras  caught a few seconds of the girls carrying the cards around the ring between  rounds.  </P> <P> JOHN VASI  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

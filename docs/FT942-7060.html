			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Prescott sets out agenda for leadership A call for a return to the socialist values of the 1945 Labour government was urged yesterday by Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, as he launched his campaign for the Labour leadership. Speaking to the Prison Officers' Association conference in Portsmouth, Mr Prescott sketched out a traditionalist agenda for a government-led return to economic prosperity. But as leadership speculation raged at Westminster, it emerged that Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, and Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting leader, have discussed the prospects for a joint ticket for the leadership and deputy leadership. Such a 'balanced ticket' between the modernist Mr Brown and the traditionalist Mrs Beckett would be potentially attractive to Labour voters seeking a continuation of the ideologically tolerant atmosphere established by John Smith. Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary and leading modernist, is also said to be considering the merits of a joint candidacy with Mr Prescott or Mr Robin Cook, the traditionalist shadow trade and industry secretary. Mr Blair, who set out his vision of Labour's future on Wednesday, used an address to the CMA post office managers' union conference in Southport, Merseyside, to urge the government to sign the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. Mr Blair's campaign will be given a significant boost today by a MORI poll in The Times which shows that he is much more popular than Mr Prescott among trade unionists and working-class voters. The poll gives Mr Blair 32 per cent support among Labour supporters, compared with 21 per cent for Mr Prescott, 12 per cent for Mrs Beckett and Mr Brown and 7 per cent for Mr Cook. It says Labour's lead over the Conservatives among unskilled workers would rise 10 percentage points if Mr Blair became leader. In a speech stocked with references to traditionalist icons, Mr Prescott attacked the government's privatisation programme and pledged that a future Labour government would renationalise British Rail and private prisons. In a passionate attack on the government he contrasted Labour's support for public service and accountability with Conservative support for 'private greed and sleaze'. After 15 years of Conservative government, the UK had witnessed a return to the five evils of idleness, want, squalor, disease and ignorance identified in the wartime coalition government's 1944 white paper on full employment. Mr Prescott's prospects would be substantially improved if he could win the endorsement of senior union leaders. However, many leaders are unwilling to endorse a candidate because they believe Mr Blair, whose modernist policies many find uncongenial, is unbeatable. Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

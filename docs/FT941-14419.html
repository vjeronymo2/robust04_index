			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 60% rise at Rubicon Profits of Rubicon Group rose from Pounds 1.22m to Pounds 1.94m pre-tax for the half year ended November 30. The 60 per cent improvement was scored on the back of a Pounds 13m rise in turnover to Pounds 23.44m. Acquisitions were behind the advance. High Speed Production, a manufacturer of precision metal components and assemblies, contributed Pounds 11.3m to turnover and Pounds 1.1m to operating profits in the four months since it joined the group. Prior to the purchase, Rubicon's sole interest was in the supply of shop equipment. Mr George Duncan, chairman, said the result was achieved in the face of a disappointing outcome for certain of the shop equipment businesses. He underlined the importance of the contribution made by HSP, which was acquired in July for Pounds 9m via the issue of shares, loan notes and cash. Mr Duncan said HSP was benefiting from strong underlying market growth and improved market share. Earnings per share for the half year emerged at 7.8p (7.2p) and the interim dividend is being lifted from 1.5p to 1.8p.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Eligibility rules to be tightened - Legal aid THE government's plans to curb legal aid expenditure would result in 'a massive cut in the number of people eligible for legal aid', The Law Society warned yesterday. The government plans the net cost of legal aid to rise to Pounds 1.284bn in 1993-94, Pounds 1.406bn in 1994-95 and 1.528bn in 1995-96 - representing increases of Pounds 399m, Pounds 502m and Pounds 606m respectively over last year's public expenditure targets. This will result in an increase, on average, of 10 per cent a year from present levels. But to ensure that legal aid spending 'did not rise even faster', the Lord Chancellor said it was necessary to take a number of measures from April next to tighten eligibility rules. Lord Mackay's proposals include: a reduction in the level of disposable income at which an applicant is entitled to free legal aid to income support levels - a reduction from Pounds 3,060 per annum to Pounds 2,213 per annum. dependants' allowances for civil legal aid will be reduced to income support levels; equivalent changes will be made to financial eligibility regimes for criminal legal aid and for advice and assistance under the Green Form scheme; the upper eligibility limits for civil legal aid (the level of disposable income at which people cease to be eligible) will not be increased next year; contributions for those above the free legal aid limits will increase from one-quarter of disposable income to one-third, and will continue for the life of the case. The Law Society, the solicitors' governing body, said it was 'devastated' by the proposals. 'It will result in a massive reduction in access to justice taking more than 7m people out of eligibility for legal aid,' a spokesman said. Mr Paul Boateng, shadow legal affairs spokesman, accused the Lord Chancellor of caving in under Treasury pressure and of 'betraying his office as protector of the rights of all people regardless of means to equality under the law and access to the courts'.</p>

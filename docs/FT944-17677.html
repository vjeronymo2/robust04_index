			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Boost for telecom competition A 'one-stop telecommunications shop' has been set up by European governments to promote greater competition in provision of telecoms services and help harmonise licensing arrangements. Twenty European governments, including all EU states except Ireland, have given their backing to the European Telecommunications Office, which has been established in Copenhagen. The European Commission sees the office as a key step in opening up Europe's telecoms market to competition. Eleven governments, including all the EU except Portugal, Greece and Ireland, have agreed the office will provide a standardised application procedure for companies wishing to provide new or competing telecoms services within their countries.</p>

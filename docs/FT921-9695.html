			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Mortgagors can object to costs GOMBA HOLDINGS (UK) LTD v MINORIES FINANCE Court of Appeal (The president, Lord Justice Stocker and Lord Justice Scott): January 30 1992 A MORTGAGOR is entitled to object to allegedly unreasonable non-litigation costs itemised on a mortgage account submitted to him on redemption; and the court can order that the costs be quantified by a taxing master, such quantification ordinarily to be on the contractual basis of taxation. The Court of Appeal so held when allowing part of an appeal by eight plaintiff mortgagors, Gomba Holdings (UK) and others, from Mr Justice Vinelott's decision on a preliminary issue, that they were not entitled to object to allegedly unreasonable items relating to non-litigation costs, in accounts submitted to them by the defendant mortgagees and receivers, Minories Finance and others. LORD JUSTICE SCOTT giving the judgment of the court, said that in 1984 and 1985 Minories Finance made substantial advances to the mortgagors under debentures, guarantees and mortgages. Demands for repayment were not met and joint receivers of the assets were appointed. On March 18 1986 the mortgagors issued an originating summons seeking accounts of the monies owed, and redemption on payment of monies due. By February 11 1987 they succeeded in raising sufficient to meet the liabilities. The receivers were discharged. There were outstanding disputes as to the accounts. An order for various accounts and inquiries was made by Master Munrow on March 14 1988. On June 22 the mortgagors served notice of objection to the accounts submitted. Their objections included 'unreasonable and/or improper amount'. The majority of items related to solicitors' or advisers' charges, or receivers' remuneration. The total challenged was Pounds 1.8m. On October 13 Master Munrow directed trial of a preliminary issue of certain questions arising out of the notice of objection, including whether the mortgagors were entitled to object on the ground that the items were unreasonable in amount. Under the mortgage deeds Minories was entitled to 'all costs, charges and expenses on a full indemnity basis' and the receivers were entitled to retain their remuneration out of the mortgaged property. It was clear that 'costs, charges and expenses' included costs, charges and expenses incidental to litigation, and costs, charges and expenses incurred otherwise than in connection with litigation. Mr Justice Vinelott declared inter alia that the mortgagors were not entitled to object to non-litigation items on the ground that they were unreasonable. The mortgagors appealed. Minories cross-appealed. It sought an order that the mortgagors were not entitled to object to unreasonable litigation or non-litigation costs, unless the court had deprived it of the costs. Order 62 rule 1(4) of the Rules of the Supreme Court provided that references to costs included 'fees, charges disbursements, expenses and remuneration', and costs of or incidental to proceedings. The natural meaning of rule 1(4) was that 'costs' was not confined to litigation costs. Order 62 rule 12 (2) provided that on taxation on an indemnity basis 'all costs shall be allowed except insofar as they are of an unreasonable amount', and any doubts the taxing officer might have as to whether they were reasonable 'shall be resolved in favour of the receiving party'. Both the standard and the indemnity bases of taxation under rule 12 were based on concepts of reasonableness. Rule 19 provided that a taxing master had power to tax '(a) the costs arising out of any proceeding . . . ', and '(c) any other costs the taxation of which is ordered by the court'. Paragraph (a) was dealing with litigation costs. Paragraph (c) was dealing with non-litigation costs. Rule 24 provided that where the court ordered an account to be taken and the account consisted in part of costs 'the court may direct a taxing officer to tax those costs'. In that rule too, there was nothing that confined 'costs' to litigation costs. The principle that a mortgagee was entitled to add to the secured debt his costs, charges and expenses properly incurred was firmly embedded in the law. On the true construction of the mortgage, guarantee and debenture, Minories was entitled to be paid all its actual costs, charges and expenses including the receivers' remuneration, except insofar as they were of unreasonable amount or had been unreasonably incurred, any doubt as to reasonableness being resolved in favour of Minories. The Rules of the Supreme Court provided machinery for quantification. They provided in particular for accounts to be taken and inquiries to be made. And they provided for costs to be taxed by the taxing masters. Mr Potts for Minories submitted that non-litigation costs were not subject to taxation and could only be quantified by the taking of an account with or without supplementary enquiries. Mr Cullen for the mortgagors accepted that that was correct. The view seemed to have been shared by the judge. The proposition that non-litigation costs could not be subjected to a process of taxation to quantify the recoverable amount was unsound in principle and on authority. 'Taxation' was no more than the name given to the quantification process whereby the amount of recoverable costs and disbursements was ascertained. A special cadre of judicial officers, the taxing masters, had been established to carry out that process. Order 62 rule 19 authorised taxing masters to tax (a) costs of proceedings, and (b) any other costs the taxation of which was ordered by the court. 'Costs ' included 'fees, charges disbursements, expenses and remuneration'. Rule 24 enabled a Chancery Master taking an account to request a taxing master to tax any items of 'costs' comprised in the accounts. The effect of those provisions was that if an account contained items of litigation or non-litigation costs, they could be referred to a taxing master for taxation, ie for him to decide what amount was recoverable. He must be told on what basis he was to conduct the taxation. On the basis of the authorities also, litigation costs and non-litigation costs could be referred for quantification to a taxing master (see Allen v Jarvis (1869) 4 Ch App 616; National Provincial Bank of England v Games 31 Ch 582; Adelphi Hotel(Brighton) (1953) 1 WLR 955). Minories was contractually entitled to recover costs on an indemnity basis. Its contractual entitlement corresponded with the indemnity basis of taxation set out in Order 62 rule 12(2). Prima facie the basis of taxation of a mortagagee's costs should correspond with his contractual entitlement under the mortgage deed. Nevertheless, in relation to 'costs of and incidental to' civil proceedings in the Court of Appeal and High Court, the court had a statutory discretion (see section 51(1) Supreme Court Act 1981). Orders for payment of costs to be taxed on standard basis had already been made in the action. The court needed to decide what, if any, residual rights Minories could claim. The discretion should ordinarily be exercised to reflect the contractual right (see Seavision Investment v Evenett, October 18 1991, CA). A mortgagee was not to be deprived of a contractual or equitable right merely by reason of an order made without reference to his contractual or equitable right and without adjudication as to whether he should be deprived of those costs. That opinion accorded with that of Mr Justice Vinelott. The court did not agree with Mr Justice Vinelott that a complaint about the fixing of the receivers' remuneration at an unreasonably high level could only be pursued in a separate action. A separate action was not necessary. The mortgagors were entitled to object to items on the ground that they were unreasonable in amount, but any doubts were to be resolved in favour of Minories. The master had power to direct that costs be taxed by a taxing officer on an indemnity basis. Indemnity costs were not to be disallowed on the ground that standard costs had already been ordered, unless the court intended to deprive Minories of those costs. To the extent indicated the appeal and cross-appeal were allowed.

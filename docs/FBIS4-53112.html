			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Again, The Worker Problem"] </F>   [Text] President Suharto's call the other day for higher  industrial wages may sound like music to many laborer's ears.  "The wage system should not widen the social gap," the President  said in seminar, jointly organized by the Ministry of Manpower  and the International Labor Organization.    Suharto cautiously added that wages should not rise so high  as to damage the competitiveness of the Indonesian economy,  which benefits from cheap labor.    The question is, will or can the President's call be  realized  and enforced in the near future? Given the many experiences in  the past in which many laws remain unenforced, it is  understandable enough if one is doubtful that the fate of our  workers will drastically change for the better soon.    Even after the Medan incident last month in which widespread  labor protests turned into anti-Chinese rioting, one should not  expect any immediate change for our worker's lives. Yes, now  all parties involved have pledged to improve the welfare of our  workers. But, we can see that as long as the government's basic  perception of the labor problem prevails, it will hamper a  speedy cure of the existing ills.    Many of us are inclined to believe that low wages and unfair  treatment of workers are the main factors which have triggered  most of the current labor disputes. But, suppose that these two  factors have been improved is there any guarantee that it will  cure our labor problems? Frankly, we doubt it.    For one thing, labor is perhaps the most neglected sector in  our development program. We can boast of our successes in  development, citing impressive statistics. Yet, what is the  position of our workers at this stage? Have they received the  slice of our development pie that rightly belongs to them?    We are afraid the answer is "No." The source of the evil is,  perhaps, our traumatic experience with the communist-dominated  labor movement prior to he abortive communist coup of 1965,  which apparently continues to haunt many of our officials and  causes the government to follow policy which strictly controls  the labor movement and gives low priority to the education of  the labor force.    Coupled with the government industrialization policy, which  inclined to side with the employer, the result is a disaster for  our workers. For more than 20 years there has practically been  no serious, comprehensive policy to tackle our labor problems.    The figures speak for themselves. According to 1990 data,  more than 76 percent of our workforce is comprised of people  with only elementary school educations. About 39 percent of our  unemployed, a staggering 38 percent of the population, are  elementary or secondary school graduates.    No wonder the majority of our workers belong to the lowest  strata of our society. Poorly educated and lacking in training,  most of them are helpless and have no bargaining power in  dealing with their employers. Aside from that, most of them are  ignorant of their rights, since organized labor is seen as  something undesirable.    Thus, if we really and sincerely want to upgrade our  workers,  certain measures should be taken immediately. The first and the  most important thing is to change our perception of labor. Our  laborers should not be eyed suspiciously as a possible political  force, or for their potential as troublemakers. They are part  of our national assets and will always remain so. Certainly  they should get their share of the development pie.    More vocational training schools should be opened. Top  priority should be given to offering workers a chance to improve  their skills. Labor laws should be fairly enforced. And of  course the worker should also not be denied his rights,  including their constitutional right of association. Everybody  knows that without association, the workers are powerless.    In short, if we start from the premise that our workers are  our partners in development, then surely they deserve to be  treated fairly and humanely and given their due. We believe  that in the end such a humane approach will benefit not only our  workers, but also their employers. And certainly this, in turn,  will serve to boost our national development efforts, which aim  to build a just and prosperous society for all Indonesians.</p>

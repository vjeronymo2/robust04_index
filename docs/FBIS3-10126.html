			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Mariano Buitrago, the National  Development Bank, BANADES, deputy general finance manager, has  reported to BARRICADA that one of the main reasons why producers  could not repay their loans on schedule in the past crop cycle  is that the producers found no buyers. Consequently, the bank  has proposed a plan whereby producers would store their crops in  silos specially prepared by BANADES. A Certificate of Deposit,  with a Guarantee Certificate in favor of BANADES attached, would  be issued in the producer's name. Because the producer requires  some time to market his crop, BANADES will take the Guarantee  Certificate and issue Finance Certificates that would be offered  to private banks at competitive rates. Private banks will buy  the Finance Certificate. The BANADES loan portfolio thus would  become healthy and money would be available either to finance  the industrial plants willing to buy the production or to help  producers find their own ways of marketing their crops, in or  outside the country while the new production cycle is in  progress.</p>

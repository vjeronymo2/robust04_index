			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Union deal saves Hoover plant HOOVER'S production plant in Glasgow has been saved from closure as a result of a far-reaching deal reached yesterday between the US consumer group and the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. The 1,000-strong workforce at Cambuslang approved the agreement yesterday at a lunchtime meeting. An estimated 700 jobs will be created under the deal - 400 at Cambuslang and the rest at Hoover's factory at Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. The agreement - reached after weeks of secret negotiations between the company and the union - involves a 12-month pay freeze and radical changes in working practices, including the introduction of flexible and interchangeable skill working. Hoover is expected to announce the closure of its French production plant at Dijon next week. The AEEU was told by the company that it would have to agree to the changes proposed or the Cambuslang plant and not the Dijon operation would have had to be closed. Mr Jimmy Airlie, AEEU national official for Scotland, said yesterday: 'We have saved the future of the plant. It is a tough deal, but we had no alternative but to accept it. It is a good day for Cambuslang.' The union has had to accept a curb on its power. All shop stewards will have to work normally at their former jobs and not remain full-time working on trade union business.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Today's reports testify to some  stabilization of the Crimea situation. Let us hear what Mayak's  ever-objective correspondent Vladimir Plotnikov has to say.    [Plotnikov] Good day. Today we have the session of the  Crimea Supreme Council continuing--that is where emotions are  highest. The main issue is forming a government for the  republic and the working group to continue the talks with the  Ukrainian side on the problems of which you and our listeners  are well aware.    The deputies did decide to deal with the first issue, the  working group, first of all, because continuing the talks and  curbing the tension between Simferopol and Kiev are  exceptionally important and time is very tight--just 10 days.  More than half the time that has been allocated has already  passed. Having discussed the personalities, the deputies  elected the working group and the Ukrainian Supreme Council will  now also appoint a group. In the next few days they will  continue their joint search for ways out of the political  confrontation.    Peace and calm in the peninsula are essential conditions for  economic reform. Removing this tension is absolutely vital and  this is what Deputy prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov talked about  in his speech. He addressed the deputies for 40 minutes,  outlined the main problems for the economy of Crimea and the  options there are for its development. He then spent 90  minutes, maybe more, answering questions, and after that there  was even more discussion and something I think was quite  unexpected--for Saburov himself and even for President Meshkov:  The majority of deputies were very sharply critical of the  government's program, in particular, for being woolly, for not  making provision for public welfare for the poor, for not taking  account of the ideas and suggestions of Crimean economists and  their managers in the economy. Key posts in the government have  been allocated not to local officials, but to people from Moscow.    It began to look like a government crisis, and President  Yuriy Meshkov took the floor. You know how passionately he can  speak, and that is how he spoke on this occasion. He appealed  to the deputies to cast aside grievances and reproaches and to  vote for the government. Several proposals were then made.  Saburov spoke once again and deputies then broke up for a  recess, for consultations, and at 1720--in one hour's time--they  will gather for the vote. So I hope we will find out what the  outcome of our latest government crisis--and I hope that the  crisis will not materialize, that the deputies will vote for--in  an hour's time.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MILAN DENIES VALVANO REPORT  </P> <P> Jim Valvano, under pressure to resign at North Carolina State, may be on his  way to the Italian basketball league, a Milan sports newspaper says. The  Italian team says: No way.  </P> <P> An executive of Italian basketball champion Philips Milan on Friday denied a  published report that the club is talking with Valvano and might sign him for  next season.  </P> <P> "The report is groundless," Tony Cappellari, general manager of Philips Milan,  told The Associated Press on Friday. "We did not contact Valvano and do not  immediately plan to change coaches."  </P> <P> Valvano, however, did not deny the report. Contacted at the airport when he  returned from New York to Raleigh on Friday, the coach said only: "It is best  to concentrate on the present at this time."  </P> <P> Cappellari said the disappointing performance of Philips in the Italian league  this season has sparked a number of false reports about a coaching change.  </P> <P> Latest among them is a report by Italy's largest sports daily, Gazzetta dello  Sport of Milan, that Valvano was negotiating his transfer to Philips. The  report appeared in Friday's paper and said the team and Valvano may be nearing  a deal.  </P> <P> The Italian newspaper said Valvano planned to bring playmaking guard Chris  Corchiani to Italy with him.  </P> <P> Valvano has come under fire at North Carolina State, which already is under  NCAA probation and now is the target of a point-shaving investigation. With the  faculty already calling for his resignation or firing, two of the state's  newspapers on Friday joined the cries for Valvano's head.  </P> <P> "Philips has a tradition of changing few coaches," Cappellari said. "In any  case the decision is always taken at the end of the season, never during."  </P> <P> Philips, currently coached by Franco Casalini, has struggled all season and  won't make the playoffs.  </P></p>

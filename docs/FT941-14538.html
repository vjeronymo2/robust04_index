			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / P&amp;O threatens staff with dismissal P&amp;0 European Ferries has threatened to dismiss more than 1,000 of its employees if they refuse to accept new conditions of employment. The company has also threatened to sack them if they strike against the proposals. Mr Geoff Christian, the company's fleet director at Felixstowe, said: 'We don't want a confrontation but a negotiated settlement.' Final negotiations are due to take place tomorrow between crew and shore-staff unions at Felixstowe in Suffolk, Larne in Northern Ireland and Cairnryan in Galloway over company plans to cut wage costs from Pounds 10m to Pounds 7.5m a year. Members of the RMT maritime union at Felixstowe, Larne and Cairnryan last week voted by 319 to 36 to back industrial action and reject the company's proposals. Mr Christian said he was asking for a report from the Electoral Reform Society on the validity of the ballot. The RMT must give six days notice of its strike intentions and it has yet to do so. The company warned yesterday that it had gone as far it could in making 'considerable concessions' to changes in working practices. It had agreed to scale back its proposed job reduction of 240 by half. Mr Christian said last night he was hopeful the unions would accept improved redundancy terms. Talks are continuing between the two sides at P&amp;O's Portsmouth operations. Last week maritime officers in Dover accepted the company's terms; the rest of the workforce is non-union. Mr Tony Santamera, the RMT's national officer, said yesterday members were 'extremely angry' at the company's attitude. He said the union's negotiators had been told by management that those refusing to work under the new conditions would be fired.</p>

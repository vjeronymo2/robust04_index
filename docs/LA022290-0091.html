			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GENTRIFICATION CAN TAKE A TOLL ON HUMANS  </P> <P> I have followed, with interest, your intermittent articles dealing with (staff  writer) Berkley Hudson's move to Eldora Road in Pasadena.  </P> <P> As I have worked in this area for four years, I've watched the slow, gradual  change with interest and anticipation.  </P> <P> I agree with your appraisal of the neighbors (people) and homes. I was  saddened, however, by your article (Times, Jan. 7). Gentrification of a  neighborhood can bring about as much loss as gain in human terms.  </P> <P> The residents who have lived in this area for years are not necessarily  "undesirable" because of income constraints. Many are as concerned of the  future of their neighborhood as the newcomers. They are as caring and as good a  neighbor as any, anywhere.  </P> <P> M. J. CRUNK  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

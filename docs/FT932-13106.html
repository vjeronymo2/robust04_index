			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / As They Say in Europe: Rough ride for le style - Is the EBRD a victim of British philistinism? THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development is starting its annual meeting in London amid some controversy about alleged over-spending. The recriminations have annoyed French staff members, who see local reaction as typical philistinism. Thus, Pierre Pissaloux, the budget director, told Le Monde: 'The characteristics of modernity and elegance are not to be found among British attitudes.' How right he is. I had been struck by the same thought at the end of our summer holiday last year when we visited the early-Gothic cathedral at Coutances, in Normandy. It is not as stylish as Chartres, nor as awesome as Amiens, but it is a fine place with a magnificent organ (which was in use to prepare for a recital). We emerged with the early-evening sun dappling the plane trees in the cathedral square. Through the fine-spun tracery of the leaves, we could pick out easily the two sets of heavy-duty electricity cable, hugging the boughs like honeysuckle, leaping from trunk to trunk. Every now and again, echoing almost perfectly the grey of the stone and the form of the windows of the nave, a loudspeaker was lashed to a tree. From these, the last notes of the toccata ringing in our ears, we heard the final phrase of an announcement on a local radio station of the huge savings available on certain items if one were shrewd enough to buy them now from Prisunic. That was succeeded by a ballad from a heavy metal group, the members of which were so aroused by the sight of a certain maiden that they could not desist from repeating forcefully their innermost desires. My wife observed that such a striking counterpoint of sacred and secular could not have occurred at Winchester or Wells, and I replied: 'Ah yes, if only we shared the modern and elegant attitude of the French.' It is probably the Pounds 750,000 marble wall at the EBRD that has attracted most comment. This wall is rough at one end and becomes smoother gradually, to achieve perfection at the other. The intention is to symbolise the transition of the bank's clients from rough-hewn post-communism to the seamless web of affluence that characterises western society today. The bank's boss Jacques Attali admitted that this 'might have been done differently'. But Pissaloux said to Le Monde: 'It might shock, seem bizarre, and it might not have been done, but it was necessary to create a unity of style.' That struck another chord. When I was central Europe correspondent a decade ago, I visited a couple of dissidents, whom I shall call Peter and Anna, in Prague. He had just made his almost-daily visit to the central police station. A year before, he had emerged from nine years' incarceration in an unheated north Moravian castle where he had been beaten periodically by someone the communists employed to convince dissidents of the error of their ways. I recall sitting in the cramped kitchen-cum-living room as Peter talked of his vision of Czechoslovak socialism and how far it was from the reality. In my ensuing account of our evening, I failed to convey what Pissaloux would call the 'disunity of style' - none of the furniture matched. The sheer 'roughness' of the occasion was marked by Peter's signal that it was at an end: 'I wish to be alone with my family now.' To return, however, to the original problem - the British shortage of elegant modernity. This is a reflection of a national concept of style which was illustrated brilliantly recently when a bloke in his dad's bowler hat tried to flag down 30 stampeding horses with a short stick, around which was a tightly-furled red flag. It was called the Grand National, and the British thought it proved to the world just what was wrong with Britain. The fiasco was, it was alleged, noted around the globe. This is nonsense: outside the UK, it made little impact. Even in Slovakia. I mention that because the occasion was graced by a heavy Slovak nag, Quirinus, priced at 250-1, on which I had a couple of quid each way because it had won the Velka Pardubicka, a race which makes the Grand National look like a village gymkhana. Only one Slovak paper carried an extensive report of the shambles. But it struck an original note in that it blamed the jockeys for what had gone wrong. On closer reading, it emerged that these unsophisticated central Europeans had misunderstood the nature of the Jockey Club, which runs British racing. The west has clearly under-estimated how far the benighted peoples of the former communist world have yet to evolve. They do not understand that the Jockey Club is a club from which jockeys are barred. And they believe that a bank exists for the benefit of its customers.

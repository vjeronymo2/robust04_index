			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Business and the Environment: Green jobs at the top Leading US companies are paying greater attention to environmental matters through executive-level appointments, according to a survey by Arthur D Little, the international consultants. Almost half of the top industrial corporations in the US have vice-presidents in charge of environmental affairs, the survey shows, with sectors like electronics and forestry - until recently perceived as low risk in terms of the environment - seeing the greatest increase. Arthur D Little looked at the top 100 companies in the Fortune 500 index and found that 49 had environmental vice-presidents in 1991, up from 38 the previous year. Of the top 50 corporations, 31 had executives directly responsible for environmental affairs compared with 25 in 1990. The US forest products industry, facing increasing public pressure concerning issues like deforestation and recycling, saw the greatest increase; all but one of the seven leading forestry products companies in the top 100 had such executives last year compared with only half of such companies in 1990. Stephen Poltorzycki, director of Arthur D Little's environmental health and safety practice, said that public and government scrutiny of industry was expanding from the oil and chemical sectors. 'Only recently have controversies over deforestation, paper recycling and dioxins used in the paper-making process elevated environmental affairs in the minds of some companies in the forest products sector.' The electronics sector had been similarly affected by scrutiny of its use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). 'Despite the fact that major CFC-manufacturing companies have made strides in developing CFC substitutes for the electronics industry, public pressure has caused companies to take very visible steps in their efforts to be environmentally responsible.' Chemical and oil companies in the US have been well represented by environmental affairs executives for the past few years, with six of the eight chemical companies in the top 100 having vice-presidents in charge of environmental affairs.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified correspondent at National Conference </F> news conference by National Conference spokesman Abdelkader  Bensalah]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Good evening ladies and  gentlemen, 1,235 people participated in the national conference.  The official spokesman of the conference has announced that the  dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] is not present in the  conference, contrary to the rumor. The conference is setting up  its committees. Only two hours ago, HAMAS [Islamic Society  Movement], the PRA [Party of Algerian Renewal], and the MDRA  [Democratic Movement for the Renewal of Algeria] withdrew from  the conference. [passage omitted]    The conference proceedings were opened by Youcef Khatib,  chairman of the National Dialogue Commission, with a welcoming  speech in which he said:    [Begin Khatib recording] This not the time for one-upmanship  or bargaining because the issue concerns first and foremost the  fate of Algeria. The present circumstances thus require unity of  ranks to confront all the challenges facing the country. Oh  brothers and sisters, we do not doubt at all and everybody has  got the good intention. However, the required results from all  parties have not been realized completely despite the efforts  made by the National Dialogue Commission. In my name and on  behalf of all the members of the National Dialogue Commission, I  thank all the parties which have dealt with us with all  seriousness and sincerity." [end recording] [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Abdelkader Bensalah, conference  spokesman]  The idea of the National Dialogue Commission was right from the  beginning, to go into the depth of the matter and find out its  facts with precision and caution in light of its importance and  seriousness. The Commission has always had the conviction that  dealing with this matter required time and patience at the same  time. The Commission has, through its endeavors toward this  Islamic tendency registered tangible results, the most important  of which is represented in the latter's acceptance of dialogue  as a principle and as a political method to deal with this  problem and the need to arrive gradually at its solution. From  these premises, the Commission has embodied this option, i.e.  that of continuing dialogue when it included it in the platform  for national consensus. [end recording]    [Correspondent] The official spokesman concluded his speech  by stressing the need to adhere to dialogue as a positive means  to ensure its continuation and deepening by the transitional  bodies, considering that the dialogue is a pressing need for  dealing with all parties. After this, opportunity was given to  journalists to ask questions, and the national spokesman  declined to answer some of them considering that they were  premature. [passage omitted]</p>

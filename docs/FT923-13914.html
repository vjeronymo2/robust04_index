			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Top public pay rises cut to 4% THE GOVERNMENT yesterday slashed recommended rises in the pay of Britain's top public servants and MPs allowances in an effort to set an example over pay restraint and reinforce its determination to control public finances. Top civil servants, judges and members of the armed services were told they could only have a 4 per cent pay rise this year against a recommendation of up to 24 per cent. In a further rebuff to the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB), ministers overruled its proposal to increase allowances of MPs by up to 40.2 per cent. MPs will receive an office allowance increase of only 9.8 per cent, but the government could be defeated when the Commons debates the proposals in a free vote next Tuesday. A further 3 per cent will be paid to top public servants next year and 2.8 per cent the year after, in addition to whatever increase is decided for those years. The total increase amounts to about half of what was recommended. Underlining the importance attached to the decision, Mr John Major returned to London from the G7 summit in Munich specifically to chair an extended cabinet meeting which decided to hold down the rises. The government's stand on top people's pay, which will save Pounds 22m this year, was generally welcomed by Tory MPs but denounced as a betrayal by unions representing senior civil servants. The Association of First Division Civil Servants accused the government of 'sheer political opportunism'. The Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists said it was a 'slap in the face' for senior civil servants and the review body. In its most fundamental review since 1985, based largely on comparisons with the private sector, the review body recognised the need for 'reasonable restraint', but argued that job security in public service had to be offset by the compensation packages and service contracts common in the private sector. However, Downing Street said 'wider considerations' had to be taken into account in setting top people's pay, citing the fall in average earnings and the 4 per cent going rate for private sector pay settlements. The Treasury said that the decision was intended to 'send a signal' as work begins on agreeing public spending totals for the next financial year. The government is to investigate extending performance-related pay to the highest Civil Service grades. After yesterday' decisions, the salary of the head of the home Civil Service will rise this year from Pounds 104,750 to Pounds 108,940, instead of Pounds 130,000 as proposed by the TSRB. A major-general in the army will see a rise from Pounds 53,000 to Pounds 55,120 instead of Pounds 63,000. The separate decision on MPs' office cost allowances is set to provoke angry exchanges next week in the Commons. Labour has already tabled a motion calling for a Pounds 40,000 allowance and could win support from Tory MPs unhappy at the Commons facilities. The TSRB proposed increasing MPs' allowances to between Pounds 37,360 and Pounds 42,360, including extra help for general office expenses.

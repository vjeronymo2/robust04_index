			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Observer: Ministering angel Pity the Earl of Longford, the veteran Labour peer and former cabinet minister who has been championing the cause of penal reform for 50 years. He despairs of securing any improvement while Michael Howard remains home secretary. Indeed, the normally restrained peer has dubbed Howard 'the prince of darkness'. He is pinning his hopes on Home Office minister Baroness Blatch, who helped remedy some of John Patten's mistakes when he was education secretary. Longford calls her his 'angel of light'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In Sidi Fredj, Algiers, the proceedings ended  officially this evening for the sessions of the follow-up  committee for the implementation of the national agreement  signed between the Malian Government and the unified Azawad  movements and fronts. This came with the signing of the minutes  of the meeting which is known as the Algiers meeting. The  signing, supervised by the Algerian diplomacy, gives a fresh  impetus to the Bamako agreement, and puts an end to the  differences which for years prevented the carrying out of this  agreement. Our colleague Bechir Hedibel attended the signing  ceremony and sent us a report:    [Begin Hedibel recording] [passage omitted] The agreement  provides for the integration of all the Azawad fighters in the  Malian Government organs: army, police, customs, and  administration. A tripartite committee has been formed and put  in charge of implementing this provision, and it will start work  next month. The committee is composed of representatives of the  Malian Government, the unified Azawad movements and fronts and  the mediating state, i.e. Algeria. It has been agreed to  integrate 1,500 fighters in the regular Malian Army, and 4,860  fighters in civil sectors, i.e. in the civil service. In the  Algiers agreement, it has been agreed also to remove the  military bases of the unified Azawad movements in northern Mali.  In return, the northern population will benefit from  development projects to break their isolation and integrate them  in the regular administrative life of the state of Mali.

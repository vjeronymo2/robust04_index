			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER VIEWS: THE WOES OF A WITNESS FROM WAUKEGAN  </P> <P> Question: I am writing this letter to you in hope you can help me in collecting  my witness fees.  </P> <P> In October, 1987, I was subpoenaed by the city attorney of Los Angeles to be a  witness. Prior to this summons I was told that the city attorney would pay my  expenses for coming to Los Angeles from Waukegan, Ill., to testify.  </P> <P> After I submitted my expenses (for $1,575), the city attorney's office informed  me that it would take from 6 to 10 weeks before I would receive my expense  money.  </P> <P> In October, 1988, I received from the Municipal Court of Los Angeles Judicial  District a revised amount that would be paid. It was for $1,055, which I signed  and returned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Check Arrives  </P> <P> Finally, about four or five weeks ago, I received a check for $350. I called  Mr. Pete Covette in the city attorney's office about the $350 and he stated  that this was the amount that would be paid. How could I travel 4,300 miles  (round trip), pay for seven nights' lodging ($20 a night) and eat three meals a  day for $350?  </P> <P> I am amazed by the misleading statements made to me. Mr. Covette claims he did  not know anything about the revised amount issued by the Municipal Court. I  sent a letter to the city attorney of Los Angeles on Oct., 24, 1988, in regard  to this and he did not reply. I hope that the city attorney's office will not  stonewall you if you pursue this for me. -- S.Z.  </P> <P> Answer: As much as the Los Angeles city attorney's office appreciates witnesses  coming back here to testify, its staff is the first to admit that no one ever  got rich doing it.  </P> <P> Pete Covette, the assistant supervisor for the West Los Angeles Branch of the  city attorney's office and your principal contact here, regrets any  misunderstanding but points out that fees and expenses for out-of-state  witnesses are rigidly spelled out in the statutes (Penal Code, Section 1334.3).  </P> <P> And, unless a judge personally intervenes, there's not much anyone in the city  attorney's office can do about it. And the limits that the statute puts on  surface travel expenses, as well as the per-diem expenses, obviously haven't  been revised for lo, these many years: 10 cents a mile if the witness elects to  use surface transportation and $20 per diem for other expenses.  </P> <P> The confusion, Covette feels, arose because, instead of flying out, you elected  to drive here from Waukegan and billed the city for 20 cents a mile. There is a  20-cent-per-mile provision in the statute, but it applies only to surface  transportation (cabs or a rental car) used to get you to the airport back home,  and to and from the airport here.  </P> <P> Had you chosen to fly out (and that's what the lion's share of the witnesses  do), the city would have picked up your round-trip air fare. And, because it  turned out that your testimony wasn't needed anyway (the defendant entered a  guilty plea), "We would have picked up his hotel bill until we could arrange  for a return flight home," Covette adds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Visits Daughter  </P> <P> According to the city attorney's records, you chose to drive out and spent the  next three months visiting with your daughter, who lives near here. Covette and  his office have no quarrel with that, nor with the eight days' per diem for  which you billed the city.  </P> <P> "His hotel and meal expenses for those eight days aren't very much out of line  with our limits, anyway," Covette adds. But where the figures get skewed is in  the computation of the mileage -- 4,300 miles at 10 cents a mile is $430 and  you billed it at 20 cents a mile (the local rate), which is $860.  </P> <P> The city attorney's assistant supervisor admits that the whole thing has taken  far, far too long -- the person originally handling your case transferred out  of the office, the case was temporarily dropped and then the since-settled case  in which you were going to testify was assigned to a judge who didn't feel he  had jurisdiction to rule on the expense matter.  </P> <P> And, Covette concedes, the city does, indeed, still owe you some money, which  he promises he will get to you posthaste. The city puts your actual expenses at  $590, of which you've received $350. The other $240 will be along very shortly.  </P> <P> This leaves one baffling aspect still unresolved: that mysterious revision from  the Municipal Court of Los Angeles Judicial District, which scaled down your  submitted bill of $1,575 to $1,055.  </P> <P> "We can't find any record of such a revision, anywhere," Covette says, "and  I've asked him several times to send me a copy of it -- it would certainly  resolve the whole thing -- but he says he's lost it. And, without it, our hands  are tied."  </P> <P> You are right in one respect, of course: There's no cockeyed way in the world  anyone could drive from Waukegan to Los Angeles at 10 cents a mile and break  even on it. But, until somebody updates the statute to more realistic levels,  that's what they are stuck with paying you.  </P> <P> Philosophically, look at it this way: You had a nice, leisurely visit with your  daughter and the City of Los Angeles, at least, picked up a token part of the  expenses.  </P> <P> Q: I wanted to thank you ever so much for your recent article regarding my  dilemma with Blue Cross. My enclosed letter from Blue Cross will indicate to  you how effective your article was -- what my lawyer and the insurance  department could not do, you accomplished. -- Z.A.  </P> <P> A: All's well that ends well regardless of how it came about. The drastic  cutback in the amount that Blue Cross would pay for your young son's required  physical therapy struck me as an error of some sort, and it's encouraging to  see that Blue Cross has gone back and reimbursed you for the two claims  previously denied, and that it intends to honor all future therapy sessions for  the boy at the agreed-upon 80% basis. I'm delighted that it worked out for you.  </P> <P>  Campbell cannot answer mail personally but will respond in this column to  consumer questions of general interest.

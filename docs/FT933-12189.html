			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Council reformer meets resistance: Why the Banham ideas are attracting strong criticism - The review of local government structure itself faces radical revision after fierce controversy. FT reporters examine the issues SIR JOHN BANHAM'S review of local government in England, which started announcing proposals for reorganising councils in May, is now itself destined for a wide-ranging review. Although the measure was supported by politicians of all parties and was intended to proceed on the basis of consensus, it has so far aroused fierce controversy in each of the four areas for which proposals have been announced. Final reports for these areas are not due until September. The review, in five tranches, has already recommended creating 24 unitary councils in place of 66 county and district councils. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has said that changes to the review will be announced soon - probably this week - amid speculation that the review might effectively be abandoned. Mr Gummer could change its policy remit, or make the review voluntary with councils needing to 'opt in'. He is also under pressure to speed the programme, at present timetabled to last another three years. County and district councils have had totally opposing reactions so far, and business leaders have been scathing. The proposals for North Yorkshire were labelled 'Shambleshire' by Lady Elizabeth Anson, deputy chairman of the Association of District Councils. The review owes its current form to Mr Michael Heseltine, who announced it as environment secretary in 1991. Unlike the reorganisations in Scotland and Wales, which were decided by ministers, Mr Heseltine's idea was that an independent commission should be appointed to consult closely at the grassroots. He hoped to deliver local councils which would command popularity with their electors, unlike the artificial 'counties' created by the last review in 1973, and give back self-governance to the cities - such as Bristol and Leicester - which had lost their status in the last review. The first of the review's five tranches took in all the most disliked 'artificial' counties - Avon, Cleveland and Humberside - plus their surrounding areas, and Derbyshire. Mr Heseltine also aimed to resolve the debate on the merits of two-tier councils - with counties having some functions while others are taken by smaller districts - and unitary councils. England's metropolitan districts and London boroughs are already unitary, and are untouched by the review. Critics have been angered by the review's piecemeal nature, which has led to widely differing outcomes in different counties. However, these stem from the government's policy guidance, which was intentionally left vague. This states: 'The commission should examine each area which the secretary of state directs it to review to see whether a unitary structure would better reflect the identities and interests of local communities and secure effective and convenient local government. It should weigh the costs of change, including the transitional costs, against the benefits of its proposals.' On an overall structure, the government 'does not wish to impose a national blueprint for reform, or to require the wholesale abolition of either district or county councils'. But it expects 'a substantial increase in the number of unitary authorities'. Two flaws quickly became apparent. Measuring cost and community identity, and balancing between them, have proved almost impossible tasks. Reconciling these problems without falling foul of the charge that it was 'imposing a blueprint' proved to be beyond the commission. The model for cost-effectiveness of different proposals, drawn up by the accountants Ernst &amp; Young, is at the heart of the problem. E&amp;Y said that costs would be affected in four areas - staff (which accounts for more than 75 per cent), accommodation, information systems, and the 'cost of democracy' (which includes any extra administrative costs from holding elections for different areas). E&amp;Y's analysis of staff costs showed a hefty 'economy of scale'. While councils with a population of 50,000 or less needed more than five administrative staff per 1,000 population, this number dropped to 3.5 for a population of 300,000, and below three for populations of more than 1m. These assessments led to several proposed large county-based authorities, notably in Derbyshire, Durham, North Yorkshire and Somerset, to the fury of district councillors. The Association of District Councils objects to the E&amp;Y model, and says estimates of cost savings should be decided by meetings between counties and districts. But when E&amp;Y asked counties and districts for estimated staff costs, it found wide disparities. Differences between counties and districts have hampered the review in other ways. The districts, which called for the review and hoped to achieve unitary status for all districts, maintaining their current boundaries, are disappointed. The other alternative facing Mr Gummer is to allow councils to 'opt in' by inviting the commission to review them. The government could set targets for the number of councillors or electors who would need to be in favour, making the process essentially voluntary. Counties would support this, but districts believe it could be a camouflaged exit from the entire review.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Idriss Deby yesterday visited Aozou in  the far north of Chad following the official restoration of the  Aozou Strip by Libya to Chad. On that occasion, the Chadian  head of state decided to upgrade the Aozou administrative post,  the only locality in that 114,000-square-km desert area to  subprefecture status. The Aozou Strip was handed over to the  Chadian authorities yesterday after more than 20 years of Libyan  occupation. For many people, Libya is trying, by that gesture,  to gain increased African support in its efforts to get the  United Nations to lift sanctions against it. [passage omitted]</p>

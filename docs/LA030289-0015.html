			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Six of your readers flailed away at Michael Novak for daring to defend the  unborn (letters, Feb. 18). The writers ignored the central factor of the whole  equation of life -- the existence of God and his guiding hand in the concerns  of men and women. The old bromide that the end justifies the means is not valid  today, yesterday, or a thousand years hence. A baby, fetus, blob (you name it)  is already part of the human family and we cannot with impunity deliver it over  the clinics of death.  </P> <P> Facts are stubborn things but we have fiendishly clever people who can weasel  their way around almost any obstacle such as "Thou shalt not kill."  </P> <P> CHRIS THOMAS  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

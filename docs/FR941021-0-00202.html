			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has consistently encouraged States to advance in the implementation schedule, while discouraging any delays. The Service is encouraged by the advances proposed by Maine, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Vermont, and will accommodate these changes in the schedule. The proposed delays by Texas and Georgia are viewed as setbacks to the Program. Both proposals, however, are premised on improved license procedures that will better accommodate the Harvest Information Program. The Service has made it clear that no schedule changes will be made that cause financial disadvantage to other States entering the Program. Therefore, a one-year delay will be granted for these States with the understanding that a portion of their original ``start-up'' monies will be used to assist those States that are now advancing in the schedule. The long-term ramification of delays in State Program entry are being reviewed with the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Limiting the Program Requirements to Licensed Hunters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Seven States specifically regarded this as a positive change that would aid them in the implementation. Three implied support by their broad agreement to changes. Two States had reservations. Missouri expressed concern that with each exemption the quality of the harvest estimate is reduced. They urged rigorous survey standards for exempt categories of hunters. Maryland strongly encouraged the Service to require that all migratory bird hunters participate in the Program. Their concern is that serious bias may be introduced and that Program credibility may, as a consequence, be in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general the Service agrees that under a State licensing (permitting) system, exempt hunters must be enrolled by an alternate survey procedure. The Service acknowledges that the migratory bird harvest from all hunters is desirable and that unlicensed hunter harvest must be addressed. The Service proposes to do this with individual States as they enter the Program. The Program changes that have evolved since its original design have replaced a Federal Permit with a State Permit. This change places many States in the incongruous role of requiring an action that under State law is specifically exempt from a license requirement ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  hunters under 16 years of age). This conflict is better addressed with individual States. Some States have the authority to require non-licensed hunters to acquire permits, but many do not. In response to the request for information on unlicensed hunters, only Maine responded. In Maine, only hunters who hunt exclusively on their own land are exempt from licensing. They estimate this to be 0.3 percent of the hunter population (600 individuals) and that their hunting is largely for deer. Migratory bird hunter harvest would be ``negligible''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Hunters Will Now Acquire Permits for Each State in Which They Hunt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All State comments were supportive of this change. They varied from ``support'' to ``a significant improvement''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Program changes that evolved into issuance of a State permit negated the notion of a Federal permit that would be valid in all States. This change will also simplify questions by restricting them to the species available in the State of hunting and generally will be more cost-effective for the States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'BURN THIS' AT SKYLIGHT THEATRE  </P> <P> The chemistry of a play changes from production to production.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Tambor's lucid, gritty staging of "Burn This" at the Skylight Theatre  illuminates this process.  </P> <P> The original staging of Lanford Wilson's play was energized by the lightning  flashes of John Malkovich's performance as Pale, the hot-under-the-blue-collar  brother of a recently deceased gay dancer.  </P> <P> Without that stunning overload of charismatic power, the play assumes its real  shape. It's actually a play about the dancer's roommate Anna: a  dancer-cum-choreographer who finds her professional and personal life shattered  and reassembled after the dancer's death. The relationships are clearer and the  inner core of Wilson's drama more accessible.  </P> <P> This doesn't mean that Duke Moosekian's Pale is less impressive, just that it's  more within the framework of the play. It's a many-faceted creation that isn't  subordinate to, but amplifies Katie Mitchell's Anna. She is completely  believable as a dancer who realizes that her statements will be better phrased  as a choreographer and that her desperate loneliness just may find its  fulfillment in the dangerous and volatile Pale. She realizes Anna's potential  with crystalline simplicity.  </P> <P> John Cardone gives Anna's third roommate, Larry, a bittersweet tint riddled  with wry humor. He underlines Larry's own sense of solitude in his duel of  innuendo with Kevin Kilner, as Anna's solely self-extinguishing current flame.  </P> <P>  At 1816 1/2 N. Vermont Ave., Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m., through July 28.  $12.50. Information: (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-RISE COMPLEX OPPOSED BY RESIDENTS AND PICUS IS GIVEN OK  </P> <P> Delivering a slap at City Councilwoman Joy Picus -- and a stunning blow to  Woodland Hills homeowners -- Los Angeles planning commissioners Thursday  approved construction of a controversial $150-million high-rise project next to  a residential neighborhood.  </P> <P> Commission members voted 3 to 2 to allow development of the nine-building  Warner Ridge office complex at the northeast corner of De Soto Avenue and  Oxnard Street. They rejected pleas by Picus and nearby residents that  single-family homes be built on the ridge instead.  </P> <P> Planners praised the 22 1/2-acre proposal as "a quality development" that has  built-in safeguards to keep it from causing traffic jams in the adjoining  Warner Center area in the western San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> But opponents who have spent 30 months fighting the development warned it will  bring gridlock to nearby streets. They complained that the high-rises will  extend Warner Center's urbanization for the first time beyond its boundaries  and into a residential area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Picus Angered  </P> <P> "I'm angry, outraged, appalled by what they did," Picus said after the  commission vote. "This is a very pro-development commission appointed by the  mayor. It reflects his pro-development bias."  </P> <P> Picus vowed to try to overturn the commission action at the City Council --  although she acknowledged that it may be difficult to win the eight council  votes necessary to do that.  </P> <P> "I think it will be a chore. I will really have to work at it. It won't be  easy," she said.  </P> <P> She said Councilman Hal Bernson, head of the council's influential Planning and  Environment Committee, has already "dropped hints" that he supports the Warner  Ridge proposal.  </P> <P> "I'm just horrified at the commission allowing an intrusion of Warner Center  into a single-family neighborhood," she said. "This was a quality-of-life issue  that was ignored by the majority of the commission."  </P> <P> Dejected leaders of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization said they will  continue their opposition when the project's zone change and General Plan  amendment come before the council for review. But they wavered on an earlier  pledge to fight the project in court if necessary.  </P> <P> "We need eight votes, and we know we have one for sure," Robert Gross, a vice  president of the group, said in reference to Picus' planned council fight.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lawsuit Lost  </P> <P> But Gross would not speculate about whether his organization would file a  lawsuit to block the high-rises. Last week, the group lost a suit that it had  filed to prevent development of surplus Pierce College land. This week, the  homeowners were asked to pay $58,000 in attorney's fees that the developer  spent in fighting their lawsuit.  </P> <P> Warner Ridge developer Jack Spound said he is confident that changes made  during the last two years to his construction plans will protect the adjacent  neighborhood of 30-year-old homes.  </P> <P> He said the changes were made at the request of nearby residents, some of whom  withdrew their opposition and became supporters of the project during the 2 1/2  years of debate. "We hope the City Council complies with its commission's  recommendation," said Spound, who is in partnership with the Johnson Wax  Development Corp. for the project.  </P> <P> As proposed, the Warner Ridge commercial complex would consist of three  seven-story buildings, two five-story structures, one four-story building, one  three-story building, a one-story restaurant and a parking structure that would  be partially built into the ridge.  </P> <P> The buildings would be positioned so that the ridge screens them from the view  of residents of the nearby Carlton Terrace residential neighborhood. Dirt  excavated from the site would be piled into a berm along the northeastern edge  of the site to similarly shield next-door Pierce College from the offices.  </P> <P> Thursday's commission approval was welcomed by college officials. Although they  were told last month by the Los Angeles Community College District to stay  neutral in the dispute, school officials made it clear that they oppose  construction of homes on Warner Ridge because of the potential for homeowner  complaints about flies and odors from the campus farm.  </P> <P> Commissioners Suzette Neiman and William R. Christopher voted against the  high-rises. Neiman said she believes the project would destroy the integrity of  the city's effort to cluster tall buildings in the middle of Warner Center.  Christopher indicated that he thought the project was too big.  </P> <P> But Commissioners Theodore Stein Jr. and Fernando Torres-Gil and panel  President William G. Luddy praised the Warner Ridge plan. They rejected a  suggestion by city planning staff members that the project's proposed 810,000  square feet of floor space be reduced to 541,700 square feet.  </P> <P> "I believe this is a quality development," Stein said. "If all projects on  Ventura Boulevard had its quality, the dissension we see there week by week  wouldn't be there."  </P></p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Arts: The varnished truth - Cinema IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER (15) Jim Sheridan THE THREE MUSKETEERS (PG) Stephen Herek FREE WILLY (12) Simon Wincer Sometimes 'real-life' stories in the cinema are the hardest to believe of all. In The Name Of The Father comes towards us loud with topicality (Irish Troubles), ardent with indignation about the fate of the Guildford Four, and all but pasted over from head to toe with yesterday's newspaper cuttings. Yet I scarcely believed a single moment of it. Yes, of course it 'happened': give or take some dollops of cinematic licence. Yes, Gerry Conlon and his three co-victims of miscarried justice spent 15 years in jail for a pub bombing they never perpetrated. And yes, they were released after long lobbying by friends and family: or those of them still free or alive after British justice had done its work. The movie has already been cheered in Ireland and praised in America. We, the whipping boys, get it last. But a nation on the receiving end of punitive propaganda often gets the truest view. As the whip comes down, it can peer up at the exaggerated body-language and the intelligent features changed by empurpled melodrama. As in My Left Foot and The Field, director Jim Sheridan takes a Big Subject and piles on the big emotions and big scenes. Sundered families; father-son showdowns in jail; battling barristers (Emma Thompson shining through an armful of briefs); and a supporting cast pitting brutal Irish ideologues against brute British pragmatists. To our left: Don Baker as the jail's fictional Provo-cateur who sparks riots and turns prison guards into human torches. To our right: Corin Redgrave as the dour, assembly-kit top cop named 'Dixon', a sort of Jack Warner from Hell. Where Foot had a miracle-working central performance from Daniel Day-Lewis and Field had its DIY aura of mythic pastoralism, Sheridan's new film is horribly trapped between reportage and re-imagining. Day-Lewis is back, but his Gerry Conlon is not a person, more an actor's exercise. Though drawn from life - the long black curls, the blend of fecklessness and street-smarts, the famed harangue to the media circus when freed - the character never seems more than a skin-deep bid by an actor radiating stoical magnitude to play weakness, skittishness and bewilderment. The failures of imagination and identification mount up. Who are these rent-a-crowd Brits and Irish who keep steaming up the screen? Are all anti-terrorist cops merely multi-decibel thugs like the night raiders who arrest Gerry? ('Get up out of bed, you dirty murdering bastard]' cries one, just in case we think they woke him with a cup of tea and a newspaper). And are all Irish terrorists pale-eyed, guard-torching psychos like the composite played by Baker? Where the supporting dramatis personae are conveyor-belt cliches, the main characters are flawed factory one-offs. At the film's supposed heart is the relationship between the Conlons, father and son. Dad (Pete Postlethwaite) was also wrongfully arrested for terrorism, so Sheridan has the sentimental inspiration of letting the two men share the same cell for the duration of their sentences. It never happened, but what the hell. Schiller had Queen Elizabeth meet Mary Queen Of Scots: no good art without licence. But rather than strengthening the movie, this reduces the father-son liaison to a glib mutual therapy session designer-scripted to make Gerry see the light about authority figures. Ah] (he realises over the slow, unageing years): better peaceable old Pop with his luminous inner strength than the braying prescriptions of Irish fanaticism or British despotism/duplicity. And so the long bromide-opera wears on. Almost every idea in this movie has been pureed for simpletons. We are spoonfed the early 1970s as flared trousers, soft drugs and offcuts from Blow Up. We are spoonfed the Irish Troubles as a tale of Them (Brits) versus Us (Irish), sweetened with a few concessions about bilateral bad apples. And we are spoonfed the redressing of injustice as Emma Thompson holding passionately forth in a never-happened courtroom finale. To wash it all down is the cold coffee of Captionland. Yes, up there in white letters on black background: what happened to the characters after the end of the film. But of course the film never really began. What we want to know is what happened to the characters during the film: and what happened to Britain and Ireland during all those years consigned by Sheridan to the de-flavourising machine of pop-agitprop movie history. The week does not improve, but at least it lightens up. If France called Euro Disney a 'cultural Chernobyl', what ever will they call the latest Hollywood version of The Three Musketeers? Enter screen left four colloquial, ill-shaven, Burbankspeaking bratpackers: Charlie Sheen (Athos), Kiefer Sutherland (Aramis), Oliver Platt (Porthos) and Chris McDonnell (D'Artagnon). Exit screen right Alexandre Dumas. We are all for a good slap-happy version of adventure fiction's great cheval de guerre: a film full of witty anachronisms, camp villains and tone-hopping dialogue. But unfortunately we had that already 20 years ago, in Dick Lester's brace of musketeer movies. The new film substitutes imbecility for wit and historical crassness for judicious anachronism. Our four heroes dash about rural Austria (playing rural France) in search of wrongs to right, castles to question the architectural provenance of, and warring accents to sort out. The good chaps are largely American. The bad chaps are largely English, led by Tim Curry's preening Richelieu. The high point of the first 10 minutes is Curry's multi-syllable response to the news that three rebel musketeers are trying to defy him. 'Thre-ee-eegh?' he quavers, consigning Edith Evans's handbag to acting history's oubliette. But after that it is all downhill: with Rebecca De Mornay's Milady, Hugh O'Connor's King Louis and all four musketeers fighting over the Oscar for Worst Performance In A Costume Film. So we turn to Free Willy. Now there is an assignment for a modern musketeer. A green Dumas might have penned this ecologically correct yarn in which an orphaned killer whale who wants to escape his Oregon seaquarium (played by a Mexico City seaquarium) is helped by an orphaned boy who wants to escape - yes] - his stifling goldfish-bowl existence in an adoptive home with a swank view of the Pacific. The boy (Jason James Richter) has only two consolations: his mouth organ and his summer job at the Sea World. Willy, the said whale, soon warms to the boy and his organ. And the boy warms to his Willy. The film is directed by Simon Wincer, who established his animal-schmaltz credentials with Phar Lap. Just to ensure that our tear ducts are fountaining as freely by the close as Willy's spouter, Wincer has the boy say to the whale 'I love you' at least four times, accompanied by keening music from Basil (Blue Lagoon) Poledouris. Anti-whaling audiences, roll up. Anti-wailing audiences, stay away.</p>

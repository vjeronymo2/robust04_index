			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with COSATU General Secretary Sam </F> Shilowa by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text]  <H5>  End of Crude Apartheid </H5>   Apartheid in its crude form will soon be a thing of the  past.  What will remain are institutions and structures at a political  and socio-economic level. The key danger to the transition will  be from the apartheid bureaucracy. The demise of apartheid may  open up contradictions between organised labour and the  unemployed who could be exploited by employers. An ANC [African  National Congress] government will be under tremendous pressure  from small and medium size enterprises whose approach to wages  undermines labour standards and worker rights.  <H5>  Loss of Leadership </H5>   The nominations for the national and regional legislatures  have taken away certain key leadership including officials.  Loss of leadership is also positive (in that people with a  working class background will be in decision-making places in  our country). Our success will depend in part on our ability to  consolidate the emerging leadership.  <H5>  Contradictions Within the Alliance Different Emphasis </H5>   As the major partner in the new GNU [Government of National  Unity], key personnel from within the ANC will find themselves  in senior executive, legislative and administrative positions in  national, provincial and local government.    This reality will introduce new strategic challenges, social  class/strata tendencies and tensions:  <H5>  A New Social Stratum </H5>   The new reality will not just present a new strategic  challenge. In effect, the promotion of several thousand key  ANC-linked personnel into senior governmental positions will  constitute the formation of a new social stratum. Between the  new ANC senior governmental stratum, especially those in  management roles in the civil service, and the mass of workers  in the public sector certain tensions and contradictions will  occur. This new social stratum may well exhibit new class  tendencies which have an anti-popular character. But we must be  careful not to present or conceptualise these strains as a  simple ANC vs COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions]  contradiction. The vast majority of public sector workers, and  the majority of the popular masses are ANC activists, members or  supporters. On the other hand, senior ANC personnel in  government will also find themselves frustrated, undermined and  blocked by the large bureaucracy they will inherit from  apartheid. To some extent rank and file public sector workers  (and workers more broadly in all sectors) will be natural allies  of the new governmental strata.    Quite apart from their subjective strengths and weaknesses,  the new stratum will face contradictory strategic and class  pulls and inclinations. Which of the different tendencies  sketched out above will emerge as the dominant tendencies will  be a function of strategic clarity on our part, struggle and the  relative balance of organised forces within the broader ANC-led  alliance.    There are other contradictions that will face us. The ANC  will be subjected to a lot of demands by all sorts of interest  groups. Our membership will expect change in the conditions of  work and living standards. Employers will expect the ANC to  confront us on issues such as a productivity, minimum wage and  to accept a wage restraint. The ANC as the government of the  day will have to concern itself with catering for the needs of  society as a whole, including our class enemies. The prospect  of a new public sector union engaged in negotiations with an ANC  government is both challenging and full of uncertainties.    Contradictions and differences may not only be confined to  COSATU and the ANC, but may also come from within. Already  different strategies exist between unions. We need to find ways  and means of containing these while emphasising areas of  agreement. Our key role is not only to prevent contradictions  and differences, but to find a way to manage them in the  interest of the working class.  <H5>  Employers Strategies </H5>   The opening up of the world to employers, the formation of a  single employer organisation/federation will ensure greater  coordination amongst them. They will attempt to copy the  strategies of their counterparts in other parts of the world  where attempts are being made to weaken and to split the labour  movement. We must avoid being forced to articulate their  position around the opening up of the economy. We need to  increase our productive capacity to that of world standards.  Such increase should be aimed at benefiting society as a whole.  <H5>  2. Redefining Our Role </H5>   The changing situation demands of us to redefine our role.  New methods of dealing with problems, demands and expectations  will have to be found. While workers in the past may have  joined us because of our links with the Congress movement, in  the future they will join us primarily because they expect us to  safeguard their interests. Some will even put pressure on us to  concentrate only on bread and butter issues and leave the rest  to political parties and organisations. Our members are part of  the community. Therefore we can never confine ourselves to  bread and butter issues. They want houses, water, electricity,  an end to violence, etc. Increasing the social wage of workers  is our responsibility, we need to be engaged in struggle through  the RDP [Reconstruction and Development Plan] and other avenues  to win these issues.  <H5>  Trade Union Independence </H5>   The strength of COSATU will depend in part on our ability to  maintain trade union independence. We need to differentiate  between independence and non-alignment. We are in alliance with  the ANC and SACP [South African Communist Party] based on a  particular programme. This alliance must be maintained and  strengthened so as to ensure ever deeper and broader democracy.  Independence means that we are not a conveyor belt of our  alliance partners. It will be a sad day for trade unionism if  COSATU was to become a sweetheart federation. Our members will  do to us what we have done with the old TUCSA [Trade Union  Council of South Africa] unions.  <H5>  Prioritising Our Involvement </H5>   In the past year we have been involved in too many fora. In  some of these we were represented in name only with either no  person attending regularly or no report back and mandating  structures in place. We need to prioritise issues around which  we wish to negotiate in fora and participate to the best of our  ability. Failure to prioritise will mean involvement in  everything, but no capacity to deliver or time to develop  policies. The weakness and vagueness of sections on Trade and  Industry as well as labour market policies in the RDP is an  indictment on COSATU.  <H5>  Defining a 3-5 year Strategic Vision </H5>   In defining our role in this ever changing situation, we  must  base it on a long term sustainable strategic vision. Such a  strategy, while allowing for dynamic changes, must guide us  between now, the post-Election conference in May and the Fifth  National Congress in September. From September onwards, we must  be planning to confront challenges that lie ahead. Not only do  we need a 3 year programme, but our strategies must take into  account that the Government of National Unity and Reconstruction  will last for about 5 years. Our strategy will have be  underpinned by among others the following broad objectives:     -  winning an election    -  RDP that provides for real transformation    -  ending violence and crime    -  attaining financial self-sufficiency    -  mass driven programmes and campaigns    -  sustaining membership and growth    -  provide real service to affiliates    -  solidarity.       We must also analyse and plan to deal with the strategies of  employers at a regional level. No COSATU vision will succeed  unless it is also based on the Southern African region. Issues  such as regional economies, trade union solidarity and labour  migration needs proper discussion.  <H5>  3. Key Challenges </H5>   As outlined at the beginning, many challenges will face us  in  the coming period. Key amongst these are:    3.1 Building organisation    The paper presented at the Special Congress contained a nine  point plan to strengthen organisation:  <H5>  Capacity building </H5>   COSATU needs to build capacity (personnel and structures)  that makes it possible for us to respond to defined priority  areas timeously.  <H5>  Servicing Membership </H5>    In almost all our regions, workers are complaining about  lack  of service and involvement in decision making. The majority of  our affiliates still use the same structures and methods of the  early eighties to drive the organisation forward. Most cases  either go unchallenged or are badly handled, resulting in  disgruntlement and resignation. In most factories that hard  fought for victory for holding general meetings during working  hours is no longer utilised.  <H5>  Building Structures and Layers of Leadership </H5>   The cornerstone of our organisation is supposed to be  locals.  In most areas they either do not exist or are not being  attended by shopstewards and officials. While it is true that  violence plays a role in the declining attendance, our neglect  of those structures is a contributing factor.    The other factor is the status of locals in COSATU. We need  to revisit our debate on the role of locals and regions in the  run up to the 5th National Congress. If we are going to be a  real force against employers, we will have to once more rely on  our members to defend us against them.  <H5>  Realignment of Structures </H5>   The two previous papers on demarcation has proven that there  is a bigger debate looming in industrial demarcation. We have  two routes: One is to implement piecemeal as we go along, the  other is to wait until we have concluded the whole debate. The  danger is that we are faced with an immediate task of putting  together a service sector union and that waiting too long would  just kill the initiative. The reality is that we need to  redefine industry and build strong unions.  <H5>  Interaction With Institutions </H5>   We need to put structures for the implementation of the RDP  in place. Their role before the elections will be to identify  areas of concern to COSATU, institutions and organisations with  whom we need to interact, build capacity for implementation.  Beyond the elections they will have to relate to a number of  fora, affiliates, employers and government structures. The ANC  conference resolution places the coordination of the RDP at the  President's office and Premiers. We must realign our structures  to the same scenario.  <H5>  Setting Up Proper Fora </H5>   After the elections, we must identify a few forums for  participation, develop policies and feed this publicly or  through our interaction with mass bases formations.    We should concentrate on the following areas:    Trade and Industry and Industrial Strategy in particular,  Workplace Democracy, Public Sector and Parastatals, Labour  Market issues, Education and Training and Macro-Economic  policies.    We must consider pushing for a merger of the NEF [National  Economic Forum] and NMC [National Manpower Commission]  structures to deal with labour market and macro-economic issues.  We should also debate the possibility of setting up a committee  that interacts with government on socio-economic issues. All  interest groups of significance would be represented.  <H5>  Policy Formulation </H5>   Apart from principled positions, we have got no detailed  policies on a number of crucial issues. Very often we reach  consensus only to return to the same issue at the next meeting.  We should put together a team/s to look at the following areas:     -  minimum wages    -  grading/skills/wages    -  investment strategy    -  new comprehensive LRA [Labor Relations Act]    -  labour based (construction) standards and wage rates on  labour  intensive construction and public works programme.    -  Affirmative action    -  Productivity.   <H5>    The Struggle for Socialism </H5>   The special Congress held in September reaffirmed our  commitment to socialism. We need to ensure that conditions for  such advancement are possible. The RDP, while itself not a  socialist programme, lays the basis for such advancement.  COSATU together with SACP and other organs of civil society  need to plan beyond the end of the GNU around which the RDP is  based. The conference on socialism must emerge with certain  answers and a programme that can easily be implemented. we also  need to find ways and means of strengthening the Left both  inside and outside of parliament.</p>

The foreign secretaries of  the two countries will have two days of parleys to negotiate  comprehensively on all aspects of Jammu and Kashmir issue,  besides other bilateral matters. The Indian foreign secretary  is reaching Islamabad tomorrow. Pakistan Television diplomatic  correspondent says this is for the first time that India has  explicitly agreed to place the Kashmir issue on the agenda of  talks. Pakistan on its part has always been raising the Kashmir  issue during previous high-level talks between the two  countries, while India always tried to avoid the question.    In Islamabad, a Foreign Office spokesman has said the  forthcoming talks with India will be the final round of formal  dialogue between the two countries if New Delhi shows no  flexibility on the Kashmir dispute. He told reporters yesterday  that there will be no more formal talks on bilateral relations  if the Indians fail to come with concrete proposals on Kashmir.  Pakistan, the spokesman said, is willing to discuss nuclear and  other issues with India only if it shows serious interest in  resolving the dispute over the occupied valley. Kashmir, he  added, is the flash point and there can be no peace in the  region if it is not resolved. While agreeing on the forthcoming  talks, Pakistan had asked India to end the siege of Hazratbal  Shrine and stop human rights violations in occupied Kashmir to  make the secretaries-level talks meaningful. Our correspondent  says though the siege of Hazratbal Shrine was lifted on the 16th  of last month, the flagrant human right violations have been  continuing unabated.    Foreign Office sources say Pakistan wishes to reiterate that  continuing escalation of repression by the Indian troops and  paramilitary forces in Jammu and Kashmir is a source of most  serious concern and anguish for the people and the government of  Pakistan. During the talks, the sources said, the Pakistani side  would urge India to concede to the wishes of the people of  Kashmir and grant them their inalienable right of  self-determination -- a promise it had made but denied to them  since 1947.    The Foreign Office spokesman said Pakistan will find it  extremely difficult to continue this sterile process of dialogue  if India fails to respond to the aspirations of the people of  Kashmir. If there is no progress, Pakistan would take the  matter before the international community and tell the world to  resolve the explosive situation, the spokesman added.    In the light of the secretary-level talks between Pakistan  and India on Kashmir, the members of the Kashmir Committee of  the National Assembly and prominent Kashmiri leaders were  briefed about the government's position. Foreign Minister  Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali told the committee members that Pakistan's  stand on Kashmir had always been clear. It supports Kashmiris'  right to self-determination and their ongoing struggle for this  inalienable right. Pakistan wants the implementation of the UN  resolutions on Kashmir because it understands that peace in the  region will remain elusive unless this dispute is resolved. The  chairman of the National Assembly's Kashmir Committee, Nawabzada  Nasrullah Khan; the president and prime minister of AJK [Azad  Jammu and Kashmir]; president of the People's Party of AJK;  President of Muslim League of AJK; President of Liberation  League of AJK; and acting president of the Jammu and Kashmir  Liberation Front attended the briefing.    President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has described the  Pakistan-India foreign secretary-level talks scheduled on Sunday  in Islamabad as a step to find out a political and amicable  solution to the decades-long Kashmir issue. Talking to newsmen  in Akora Khattak, the president said this is a political forum  available to us and we want to use it. Pakistan wants that the  Kashmiris should be given their birthright of self-determination  in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the United  Nations. Pakistan has always condemned Indian brutalities  against the innocent Kashmiris and it would continue to extend  moral and political support to them. President Leghari regretted  that Indian atrocities have reached their peak and there is no  precedence of such brutalities in the entire history of mankind.  He said the strength of the Indian forces has crossed the  figure of 500,000 in occupied Kashmir. The president said the  world pressure on India for a peaceful solution of the Kashmir  issue is also building up.</p>

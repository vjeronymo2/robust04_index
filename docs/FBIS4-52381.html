			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- Despite the tension on the  Korean peninsula created by Pyongyang's suspected nuclear  weapons program, the volume of inter-Korean  processing-on-commission trade is rapidly growing, authorities  said Tuesday.    The government authorized businesses to purchase about  7,223,000 U.S. dollars worth of end products made through  processing-on-commission from North Korea in the first four  months of this year, about nine times that of a year earlier or  1.6 times that recorded in the whole of last year.    A government official expected that purchases of  processing-on-commission goods from North Korea would reach at  least 20 million dollars by the end of this year.    The approval amount for purchasing such goods was the  monthly  maximum of 3.1 million dollars in April, rising from 1.81  million dollars in January, 970,000 dollars in February and  1,345,000 dollars in March.    South Korean businesses' sales of raw and subsidiary  materials for processing-on-commission to the North also rose.    Goverment approval for selling such materials totaled  4,806,000 dollars in January-April this year, up about 700  percent from the same period last year.    Seoul's approval for total inter-Korean trade including  other  kinds of goods increased 11 percent to reach 64,670,000 dollars  in the four months from a year ago.    Inter-Korean processing-on-commission trade includes mainly  trousers, coats and duck-down jackets, but not high value-added  clothing including suits.    A government official said, "With inter-Korean  processing-on-commission trade in a stable stage and visits to  the North having become impossible, South Korean businessmen are  focusing mainly on processing-on-commission trade."    Government permission for purchases of  processing-on-commission goods amounted to 23,000 dollars in  1991, 556,000 dollars in 1992 and 4,385,000 dollars last year.</p>

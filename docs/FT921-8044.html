			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Banks continue to support YJ Lovell YJ LOVELL Holdings, the UK housebuilder and property developer, yesterday announced that its bankers had agreed to continue to give financial support to the group. The group warned in December that it was in breach of loan covenants affecting net worth and interest cover and that it was having talks with its banks over the future of its borrowing facilities. Mr Robert Sellier, chief executive, said yesterday that the banks, led by Barclays, had agreed to maintain loan arrangements in return for security against the bulk of Lovell's land bank and other assets. Mr Sellier said that the banks had conducted a full financial appraisal and had been satisfied that there 'were no black holes.' The banks would look at the position again in 12 months time. 'They have been very fair and we are under no pressure to make disposals although our main intention will be to reduce borrowings,' he said. Net debt at the end of last September, including about Pounds 40m off-balance sheet borrowings, totalled Pounds 111.4m compared with shareholders funds of about Pounds 70m. 'Our intention is to reduce gearing to 50 per cent. Obviously we will not be able to achieve that target in the current year, although debts are coming down,' said Mr Sellier. The group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 20.3m in the year to September 30 compared with a profit of Pounds 19.4m. The latest figures included provision of Pounds 61.5m against housebuilding and property operations. The group said in December when it announced the loss that it would be unable to pay a final dividend. Last April, when launching a Pounds 31m rights issue, it had promised to maintain the dividend. Mr Sellier said that there had been an increase in interest from potential house purchasers since the beginning of this year but that it was too early to say whether that marked the beginning of a recovery in the UK housing market. Lovell's share price rose 4p to 25p following the announcement compared with last year's rights issue price of 130p.</p>

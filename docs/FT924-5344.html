			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Taxing the Monarchy: The Royal income and perks THE ROYAL INCOME AND PERKS Income from property: Income from the 36,500 acres of the Duchy of Lancaster was pounds 3.1m last year. This is used to fund the privy purse, which pays minor royals and staff pensions. The Sandringham estate provides about pounds 600,000 pf private income. The Queen also derives some income, possibly around pounds 1m, from her stud farm and winnings of her horses. Investments: Estimates of the value of the Queen's investment portfolio, managed by stockbrokers Rowe and Pitman, vary from under pounds 50m to almost pounds 600m. This is based on a portfolio said to be worth about pounds 30m in 1971. The higher estimates assume dividends have all been reinvested, which is unlikely. Income from the portfolio is estimated at pounds 1m to pounds 42m. Perks: The royal yacht, Britannia, costs the Ministry of Defence about pounds 9.5m a year. Government departments spent about pounds 2.5m on the royal train last year, pounds 21.8m on palaces and residences, and pounds 6.9m on the Queen's Flight. Other perks of the job include additional travel costs, around 400 out of more than 1,000 personal staff and security cover. PAYMENT FOR ROYAL DUTIES Civil list: The Queen is the biggest recipient of funds from the civil list, receiving pounds 7.9m this year, due to rise to pounds 10.4m by the end of the century. Next comes the Queen Mother, with pounds 640,000, and Prince Philip with pounds 360,000. They are the three who will continue to be paid by the state under the new arrangements. Other current recipients are the Duke of York, whose allowance was pounds 250,000, in addition to his naval salary, which is fully taxable. Prince Edward got about pounds 100,000, the Princess Royal pounds 230,000, Princess Margaret pounds 220,000 and Princess Alice pounds 90,000. The last five royals will continue to be included in the civil list, but the Queen will reiburse the Treasury the full value of their allowances. A total of around pounds 5.1m will be repaid from income from the Duchy of Lancaster. Royal cut back: The Queen, Prince Philip and the the Queen Mother will continue to receive money from the tax payer. The rest of the Royal Family will be paid for by the Queen.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Outstanding bankruptcy debt rises OUTSTANDING debt from Japan's corporate bankruptcies in May rose 29.1 per cent from the same month last year to Y571.5bn (Pounds 2.5bn) as more companies were brought down by stock speculation and fewer failed because of the country's labour shortage. Teikoku Data Bank, the credit research agency, said the amount of debt was down 25.4 per cent from April, though the number of cases rose by 4.2 per cent. The largest failure was Hachidai, a property developer, which had outstanding debts of Y114bn. The labour shortage has been a prime cause of bankruptcy among smaller companies, but the slowing of the domestic economy has made the problem less severe. Teikoku said 40 companies blamed their failure in May on a lack of workers, the lowest figure since November 1990. However, slowing retail sales has resulted in an increase in bankruptcies of retailers, of which 73 failed in May, up from 44 in April. One of the most notable failures was that of Lec, a maker of bathroom products, which was the first Tokyo listed company to file for protection since 1986. Lec had outstanding debts of Y25bn, and was apparently a victim of stock speculation, as its core business was profitable. The failure of Lec has raised questions about the willingness and ability of Japanese banks to support all of their troubled clients.</p>

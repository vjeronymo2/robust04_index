Taking the Initiative in Requesting My Retirement (Part  One of Two) -- Disappointed at Jiang Zemin's Political Report, I  Made Up My Mind To Retire; I Was Accused of Trying To Hang on to  My Post Because I Had Suggested That the Replacement Be Effected  After the Adoption of the Basic Law    With respect to the handling of Hong Kong affairs, Jiang  Zemin and Li Peng would listen to the reports and analyses made  by Li Hou [2621 0683] and Lu Ping [7627 1627] only, but would  not see me or listen to my analyses, resulting in a growing gulf  between them and me. I estimated that the problem between them  and me was no longer the matter of differences on the 4 June  incident. It was already very difficult, or even impossible, to  change the situation. If I was to continue to work in Hong Kong  but had to obediently follow the "blind command" from Beijing,  proceeding on the basis of disregarding Hong Kong's realities, I  just could not do the job. Jiang Zemin's Political Report to the  Fifth Plenum made me even more disappointed. I made up my mind  to retire, and wanted to find out if I would be able to secure a  "safe landing." Seizing the opportunity of a break from Central  Advisory Commission group discussions which Song Ping [1345  1627] was also attending, I presented to him my formal request  for retirement. Song Ping was very surprised and asked: "Why?  The center is not considering the issue of your retirement." I  replied: "I am already over 70. Too old. Too busy. Already feel  mentally tired. Often feel exhausted. I do hope the center will  give approval." All this was true. But I thought it better not  to mention the main reason. At the same time I raised some  demands: I planned to live in Shenzhen and do some investigation  and research work as my ability would permit. On the one hand  Song Ping said: "Now is not the time for you to retire. Don't  think about this issue." On the other hand he also said: "For  the time being the center cannot find a suitable person to  succeed you." I recommended: "Ye Xuanping is suitable. He is  from Guangdong and familiar with the situation in Hong Kong, and  have had much contact with personalities in Hong Kong and  Macao." Song Ping said: "This is a good idea, and may produce  mostly good results."    Several days later, when the Fifth Plenum was still going  on,  Song Ping asked the Central Organization Department deputy head  in charge of Hong Kong and Macao cadres to tell me not to think  about the issue of retirement, informing me that the center had  truly not considered the issue. Another message was that if  there should be retirement in the future, then those few demands  would not be a problem.    Around this time I also met Yang Shangkun. I asked him to  transmit to the center my request for retirement. Yang Shangkun  readily said: "No consideration for now. Continue to work for a  while, and then we will see." I insisted that he transmit the  request. He shook his head and did not approve of my making the  request.    In order to make Beijing let me retire, I decided to make  use  of my public appearances in an effort to create an atmosphere so  that the people of Hong Kong could also become psychologically  prepared. On 11 December 1989, I was invited to the  ribbon-cutting opening ceremony of the Dynasty Club owned by the  tycoon Cheng Yu-tung. When interviewed by reporters, I took the  initiative in telling them that I had submitted to the center my  request for retirement. After Beijing learned the news, first, I  received a telephone call from Yang Shangkun's secretary, who  said that Yang Shangkun was somewhat unhappy and transmitted a  message to me: "Don't mention the matter of retirement again."  Then people in Beijing told me that Zhongnanhai had made a new  decision on the personnel of the Hong Kong Branch of the Xinhua  News Agency and that Zhou Nan [0719 0589] would come to Hong  Kong to take over my job.    I was very happy, but upon learning this information the  colleagues all faulted me for openly taking the initiative in  talking about retirement, "thereby giving them an opportunity."    On 23 December the center sent a telegram, asking me to go  to  Beijing immediately. I knew that this trip was related to the  matter of my retirement. I arrived in Beijing the next day. In  the evening of the same day Li Peng, Song Ping, and the head of  the Central Organization Department summoned me to Zhongnanhai.  They came straight to the point. As soon as they sat down, they  announced: "The center has decided that you retire and be  succeeded by Zhou Nan. What do you think about the decision?"  They did not say that I had taken the initiative in requesting  my retirement but instead said, "The center has decided." I  replied, smiling: "Thank the center for approving my request for  retirement." I also suggested: "Zhou Nan may immediately come to  Hong Kong to take over the job. It might be advisable to  announce the decision after the National People's Congress [NPC]  has adopted the Basic Law, so as to let the people of Hong Kong  get psychologically prepared and have a peaceful New Year." They  immediately said that this suggestion could be considered. But,  later they considered this move made by me to be an attempt at  "hanging on to my post," and decided to take further measures to  make me leave Hong Kong promptly.

Taking the Initiative in Requesting My Retirement (Part  Two of Two) -- The Suggestion That I Be Transferred Back After  the Adoption of the Basic Law Was Rejected; Zhou Nan's Xinhua  News Agency Appointment Was Announced Without Being Considered  by the NPC Standing Committee.    As the talking drew to a "close," I stood up to say goodbye.  Suddenly Li Peng turned around and asked Song Ping: "Have the  senior comrades been informed?" Song Ping said: "Comrade  Xiannian knows this. The secretaries of the others are all  present and will make their reports." I knew that persons such  as Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun would all have their secretaries  participate in the meetings of the Standing Committee and the  secretariat in order to keep informed of the details of the  discussions at the meetings. Their question and answer showed  that Li Xiannian already knew the decisions to dismiss me and  appoint Zhou Nan (later I also learned that Zhou Nan had been  recommended by Li Xiannian), and that the other senior comrades,  perhaps referring to Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun, might not have  been informed beforehand.    The next morning I met Ji Pengfei [1213 7720 7378], who  said,  seeming to be trying to show his powerlessness with regard to  the matter, that Song Ping merely told him at a public rally  that Zhou Nan would take over my job, and did not solicit his  opinion. Ji Pengfei also told me that he once said to Song Ping:  "Zhou Nan has diplomatic experience, but the Hong Kong job is a  comprehensive one." He also said to me: "They do not understand  the situation. You have developed a new situation in Hong Kong  and made great contributions." He was still indicating his  powerlessness on this matter. I smiled and replied: "The reason  was your excellent leadership. But while talking to me, Li Peng  and the others did not say a single word about my six-year work  in Hong Kong. I don't know their assessment."    In the afternoon Ji Pengfei asked someone to tell me that  the  center had decided to ask all the responsible persons of the CPC  Hong Kong and Macao Work Committee (i.e., the several deputy  directors of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY) to  come to attend a meeting in Beijing. For Li Peng and the others  were unhappy about my attitude expressed on the preceding  evening, considering me to be trying "to hang on to my post" and  intending to take measures.    On 25 December Jiang Zemin presided over the meeting; Li  Peng  was late for half a hour. Song Ping, Ji Pengfei, Li Hou, Lu  Ping, and Zhou Nan attended the meeting; all the deputy  directors of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY were  also present.    Jiang Zemin started by announcing the center's decision that  I retire and be transferred back, and that Zhou Nan take over  the job. The suggestion, made by me and some deputy directors of  the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, that I be  transferred back to the hinterland after the adoption of the  Basic Law had been rejected. It had been decided that a public  announcement be made on 15 January 1990, and that Zhou Nan  immediately go to Hong Kong to take over the job. In his speech  Jiang Zemin responded to the remark I had made to Ji Pengfei,  saying: "Comrade Xu Jiatun has done a great deal of work in Hong  Kong, and has made achievements." Li Peng came very late, and  made some harsh comments rejecting our suggestion regarding the  takeover.    Ji Pengfei said nothing from the beginning to the end.    It was very abnormal, within the CPC, to hold such a meeting  and use such an approach to announce the transfer or dismissal  of a high-ranking cadre and for leaders to assume such an  attitude toward the matter. In my lifetime I had been  transferred from my jobs many times, but had never seen such a  "solemn" situation.    According to usual practices, after the party made the  decision on my dismissal and Zhou Nan's appointment, the State  Council should raise the matter to the consideration of the NPC  Standing Committee. The dismissal and appointment should be  announced only after being approved by the NPC Standing  Committee. However, unusually, Zhou Nan's assumption of his  office in Hong Kong was announced in the news released by the  XINHUA NEWS AGENCY in Beijing on 15 January 1990. The NPC  Standing Committee did not even discuss the issue as a matter of  formality. There has been no announcement by the NPC Standing  Committee to this day. In trying to transfer me back to the  hinterland, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and the others did not even  bother to put up a facade. (143)  <H5>  [25 Sep 93 p 4] </H5>   [Text] Events Shortly Before and After I Left My  Country. Leaving Hong Kong After Being Relieved of My Office  (Part One of Two) -- I Retired as I Had Wished, But to My  Surprise Jiang and Li Would Not Let the Matter Drop; Zhou Nan  Did Not Say a Single Word About My Leaving Hong Kong at the  Farewell Banquet.    After the 25 December meeting, I returned to Hong Kong right  away, and immediately moved out of the Hong Kong Branch of  XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Building, vacating the office. Colleagues  advised me not to be in such a hurry and said that when being  transferred back to the hinterland Li Chuwen and others all had  left Hong Kong six months after the respective announcements,  hoping that I would also stay in Hong Kong a bit longer after  leaving office. I thanked them for their kindness, and  immediately started packing, transporting my personal belongings  to Shenzhen. It seemed to me that it had not been just for one  or two days that Jiang and Li had wanted me to leave Hong Kong  early. As I had fulfilled my wish to retire, leaving early could  get me extricated from the dispute-infested place early. This  was something my colleagues did not think about. But at the time  I did not thought that Jiang and Li would not drop the matter,  and that the "next chapter" was waiting for me.    I planned to go to Shantou on 9 February to participate in  the opening ceremony of Shantou University built on the basis of  the donation from Li Ka-shing, to come back to Hong Kong on the  11th, and to leave Hong Kong for Beijing on the 12th to attend  the last plenary session of the Basic Law Drafting Committee. I  thought that the 12th would be the day when I would be  officially relieved of my office and leave Hong Kong.    After learning that I would soon retire and leave Hong Kong,  China's institutions in Hong Kong and people in society all  came, suggesting the holding of farewell banquets for me. If I  accept the suggestions, then not only would there not be enough  time, but such events would also cause resentment on the part of  some people in Beijing when the news spread. On the other hand,  if I should accept some invitations, then I would be suspected  of showing favor; therefore I politely declined all the  invitations. The heads of some major Chinese-owned institutions  in Hong Kong would not agree to that and insisted on "showing  their sentiments" in some way. In the end they made a compromise  proposal that a farewell dinner be held on the 50th floor of the  Huarun Building one day before my leaving Hong Kong. I could not  but accept the proposal.    Zhou Nan would arrive in Hong Kong on 5 February. I and the  deputy directors decided to expand the Spring Tea Banquet so as  to introduce the new director of the Hong Kong Branch of the  Xinhua News Agency to the people of Hong Kong and to say goodbye  to the people of Hong Kong. The general office estimated that  the number of participants would be larger than in the previous  National Day banquets held by the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY. As the place we usually rented might not be able to  accommodate 3,000 people, the main conference hall of the  International Trade Conference Center, which could accommodate  4,000-5,000 people, was rented. On the day of the banquet people  of all circles in society came to the conference hall. In my  speech, I especially introduced the new director Zhou Nan to  people, wishing Zhou Nan "well," and said farewell to Hong Kong  compatriots and Chinese and foreign friends, expressing my  gratitude for the support given to the Hong Kong Branch of the  Xinhua News Agency and to myself over the six years. Standing on  the podium and facing the thousands of pairs of eyes in the  hall, I had all kinds of thoughts, and did my best to control my  strong emotions. After the toasting, I hurriedly retreated to  the lounge. While still in Beijing Zhou Nan had sent a telegram  to the general office of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS  AGENCY, asking it to prepare his response speech at the banquet.  She Mengxiao, deputy director and secretary general, had  personally drafted the speech for him. As Zhou Nan liked to cite  ancient poems, he also had cited two lines of a Tang Dynasty  poem for Zhou. The text had then been sent to Zhou Nan in  Beijing by fax. But unexpectedly Zhou Nan did not use a single  word from the text after coming to Hong Kong, and instead used a  text that he said he had prepared himself. The speech in no  place mentioned my name, Xu, and did not have a single word  about Xu's leaving Hong Kong, totally ignoring the "newcomer  welcoming" speech made by the host of the banquet, thereby  astonishing the participants.    Seeing this abnormal occurrence, not only did colleagues in  the branch ask me after the banquet, "What was going on?" but  people in society also talked about the incident. Many people  made phone calls to ask people to inquire of colleagues in the  branch, asking: "Have you noticed it?" and "why?"    I felt that this could not have been Zhou Nan's own  "creation," and that he would not have dared to behave in such  an arrogant manner without being backed by "instructions."    Li Ka-shing had already invited me to the 9 February opening  ceremony of Shantou University built on the basis of Li  Ka-shing's donation. Although Zhou Nan had already assumed  office in Hong Kong by that time, Li Ka-shing did not express  any attitude. I specially suggested to Li that Zhou Nan be also  invited; Li agreed and sent out an additional invitation. I and  Zhou Nan planned to go to Shantou together and to come back to  Hong Kong together.    Li Ka-shing's donations to projects in China were mainly  concentrated on Shantou University. At the time his donations to  Shantou University had already totalled HK$560 million, and in  addition a foreign exchange fund had also be set up for the  purpose of hiring foreign professors. He had said to me that he  had planned to invest in the Shantou Power Plant, and that he  would not take the power plant's future profits which could be  used to cover Shantou University's operational expenses. In the  process of establishing Shantou University, Li Ka-shing had had  many differences with some personnel of Guangdong Province in  charge of the matter. In some cases he raised the relevant  matters to my attention, and I then took up the matters with the  relevant supervisory agencies in Beijing and Guangdong,  presenting my own opinions and expressing the hope that they  would help resolve the problems and reduce Li's difficulties so  that things could proceed as much as possible according to Li's  ideas. (Installment No 144)  <H5>  [26 Sep 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] Events Shortly Before and After I Left My  Country. Leaving Hong Kong After Being Relieved of My Office  (Part Two of Two) -- I Was Very Disappointed at the Fact That  Only Li Tieying [2621 6993 2503] Had Been Sent To Attend the  Opening Ceremony of Shantou University; The Center Asked Me Not  To Turn Over the Responsibility for Taiwan Work; Zhou Nan Was  Rather Unhappy About It.    Li Ka-shing was not only involved in matters of funds but  also in matters of the school's size, capital construction, and  teaching material. He had asked Chuang Shih Ping, former  chairman of the board of directors of Nanyang Bank to serve as  an advisor of Shantou University and also asked Huang Lisung,  former chancellor of the University of Hong Kong to serve as an  advisor. Usually there were seven or eight people from Li's  company among those in charge of the construction of Shantou  University. He had even sent his own secretary to provide help.  All this showed the importance Li gave to Shantou University. He  once told me: "I have devoted a great of deal of my energy to  making Shantou University a prestigious university."    Accompanied by Chuang Shih Ping, I had specially visited  Shantou University during its construction. I had seen that  Shantou University's size and facilities as well as architecture  had all been modernized, a rare phenomenon among universities in  China.    I thought that as Li Ka-shing had devoted not only money and  energy but also his "painstaking care" to the university because  of his patriotism and love for his native place, he should be  given support and encouragement. When Yue-kong Pao had built a  university in Ningbo, the center had treated him with honor. Not  only State Counselor Gu Mu [6253 3668] but also Wan Li, chairman  of the NPC Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony of  Ningbo University. I had wanted to achieve some balance. Before  the 4 June incident, I had suggested to responsible persons at  the center that it would be advisable that one of the four  persons, PRC President Yang Shangkun, General Secretary Zhao  Ziyang, NPC Standing Committee Chairman Wan Li, and Premier Li  Peng, attend the opening ceremony of Shantou University. They  had all said that the suggestion would be considered. After the  4 Juneh incident I again suggested that Jiang Zemin, the new  general secretary, and Premier Li Peng attend the opening  ceremony and go to Shenzhen after the ceremony to meet with  people of various circles in Hong Kong. But in the end they only  sent Li Tieying, the head of the State Education Commission, to  attend the ceremony; I was very disappointed.    Li Ka-shing's wife died before the opening ceremony, and Li  felt great sorrow. I specially visited him, and attended the  memorial ceremony and funeral. Li told me that he was very sad  because of his wife's death, and that his attending the opening  ceremony would not be affected. I also told him that I would  definitely attend the ceremony. He said: "I will have a  specially chartered plane to take you there and then bring you  back." I said: "You don't have to pay any attention to making me  comfortable. It is better to be casual. Let us see who the  center will send here (at the time we did not know that Li  Tieying would come)." However, he still personally came to the  airport to greet me, and arranged for me to stay in the  "Presidential Suite" of the best hotel in Shantou City.    If only I would ask, Li would always consider making  donations to the hinterland. His donations for the Asian Games  in Beijing and the Cultural Foundation of Hong Kong had in each  case totalled around HK$10 million. When I left Hong Kong, I  only agreed to having a private farewell activity, but the  activity was just a lunch together as the two of us often had  had before. During the lunch he said to me emotionally: "If you  were not a Communist, our friendship could be even deeper." He  had already heard about my plan to live in Shenzhen and to do  some research on Hong Kong, and therefore said: "I will often go  to Shenzhen to see you. I can provide financial assistance if  there should be any difficulties in research work." I was also  very moved at the time, and expressed my appreciation,    After attending the opening ceremony of Shantou University  on  9 February, I returned to Hong Kong together with Zhou Nan the  next day, planning to go to Beijing on the 12th to attend the  final session of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee and  the meeting of the NPC Standing Committee. Before my departure I  said farewell to colleagues in the branch and indicated that I  would be leaving Hong Kong officially the next day. Upon  learning the information, the British Hong Kong government  solicited advice from the Hong Kong Branch of the Xinhua News  Agency, offering to send people to see me off. Some comrades in  the branch politely declined the offer because they did not want  me to officially leave Hong Kong on that occasion. I expressed  my appreciation of the colleagues' good intentions, but was  still determined to officially leave Hong Kong on that occasion.  However, unexpectedly, Yang Shangkun and Yang Side [2799 1835  1795] told me face to face during a meeting in Beijing: that  some important contacts in Taiwan with whom I had been  responsible for communicating should not be turned over to Zhou  Nan, and that I should continue to be responsible for the matter.    I immediately transmitted the message to Zhou Nan, who  looked  very unhappy after learning the message. He took the initiative  in seeing Yang Side, and also requested a meeting with Yang  Shangkun; but Yang Shangkun did not see him.    At the time Taiwan was faced with a presidential election,  and the situation was rather tense. When I had returned to  Shenzhen after attending meetings in Beijing, Yang Shangkun sent  a telegram to the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY,  asking me to meet Yang Side to exchanges views on the situation  in Taiwan and the work on Taiwan. I talked with Yang Side by  having a long-distance call. He suggested that I go to Hong Kong  so as to make it easier for me to have discussions with the  relevant people on a timely basis. For this reason I went to  Hong Kong three times. On each occasion I stayed at the Stanley  guest-house for one night and left the next day. Each time She  Mengxiao, deputy director and secretary general of the branch,  came to see me, I asked him to report to Zhou Nan on my behalf  and to give him my regards.    I did not think that my three official business trips to  Hong  Kong would cause unexpected storms.</p>

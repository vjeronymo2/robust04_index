			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Automatic Cutoff Devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed previously, NHTSA has concluded that Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 208 currently allows automatic cutoff devices. NHTSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comments on whether the agency should regulate automatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cutoff devices. As part of this rulemaking proceeding, NHTSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comments on whether any or all of the proposals in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice relating to warning lights, readiness indicators, owner's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manuals, and labels should also apply to vehicles equipped with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatic cutoff devices. NHTSA believes that the vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers, in developing automatic cutoff devices, will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attempt to guard against the possibility of air bags being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatically deactivated when they should be providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection. Nevertheless, for the purpose of possible future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking, the agency requests comments on the necessity for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA's taking steps to ensure that air bag protection remains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activated at all appropriate times.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Consumer Education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency actively works with consumer groups to promote  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child safety, and has been instrumental in reversing the stance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long held by the American Academy of Pediatrics that infant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restraints may be placed in the front seat. Additional consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education is a necessary ingredient toward a successful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment of the philosophy embodied in this rulemaking. Toward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that end, NHTSA will work actively with the interested parties to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further promote infant safety and to minimize any risk to infants from passenger side air bag. NHTSA invites comments in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Proposed Effective Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If adopted, the proposed amendments would become effective 30 days following publication of the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> X. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under E.O. 12866 and the Department of Transportation's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been determined to be ``significant'' under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Absent this rulemaking, and given a vehicle population in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which all cars and light trucks are equipped with driver and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger air bags, an estimated 1,050 air bag deployments a year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will occur in pickup trucks and two-seater vehicles when a front  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger seat is occupied by an infant in a rear-facing infant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seat. The level of the injuries resulting from these deployments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are uncertain, but may well be severe. In an effort to assess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the potential for safety trade-offs resulting from the failure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactivate the air bag after it has been deactivated for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit of infant passengers, the agency estimated that only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about one percent of the vehicles which would be permitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a cutoff device are likely to be carrying an infant. If one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumes for the purpose of analysis that the older occupants of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 percent of these vehicles did not reactivate the air bag for the benefit of non-infant passengers, approximately 3 occupants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who are at least one year old may receive AIS 2&hyph;5 (survivable)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuries. In addition, for every one percent of all affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles in which the older occupants deliberately turn off the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air bag, 1&hyph;3 fatalities and 23&hyph;32 additional injuries could occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each year. Since the agency believes that the percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles in which the passenger air bag is inadvertently or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deliberately deactivated would be fairly small, the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infants who would avoid potentially serious injury far exceeds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number of non-infants who might be injured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA estimates that the per vehicle price impact for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition of a passenger air bag cutoff device is $10.15 in 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dollars. This cost reflects a cost of $5.15 for the cutoff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device and $5.00 for the light sensor that allows the warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light to have variable levels of brightness. NHTSA has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated the annual costs of this proposal, as that figure is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dependent on the number of vehicles voluntarily equipped with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manual cutoff devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

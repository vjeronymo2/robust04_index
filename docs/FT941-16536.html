			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / NHS 'health cheques' urged Private insurers should take over the National Health Service and issue patients with 'health cheques' to pay for health insurance, the European Policy Forum, a cross-party think-tank, says in a report on the UK health service. It said the insurance companies would commission healthcare from doctors and hospitals. The cheques would be worth between Pounds 200 and Pounds 1,500, depending on people's age and circumstances. The Department of Health said an insurance-based health service had been ruled out many years ago and this remained the case.</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> HAMILTON ALMOST LOST 'PART III'  </P> <P> George Hamilton, who hasn't had a role in a feature film since 1981, almost  didn't end up in "The Godfather, Part III."  </P> <P> Hamilton, 51, plays a WASP lawyer who sets up a deal for the Corleone family  with the Vatican Bank.  </P> <P> Hamilton said in the January issue of Vanity Fair that his agent at first  turned down the role because he had been told it would be a cameo.  </P> <P> "You did what?" he recalled telling his agent. "We're talking about 'The  Godfather' here."  </P> <P> Finally Hamilton called director Francis Ford Coppola in Italy, and Coppola  assured him that he still wanted the actor.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Francis, you're telling me that you will work with me to make it  good. That's all I need.' And I jumped on a plane and went to Rome," Hamilton  said.  </P> <P> It was his first role since "Zorro, the Gay Blade" in 1981. Hamilton's other  movie credits include "Love at First Bite" and "Where the Boys Are."  </P></p>

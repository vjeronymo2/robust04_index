			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / (CORRECTED) Oil dealer's row with Chevron threatens Caspian project:  Differences over the ownership and route of a pipeline from Kazakhstan's vast Tengiz oilfield Corrected (published 17th May 1994) appended to this article. A conflict between the US oil company Chevron and Mr Johannes Deuss, the Bermuda-based Dutch entrepreneur once known as king of the world's oil traders, has become the biggest obstacle to construction of an oil pipeline from the energy-rich Caspian Sea to the west, according to western oil analysts. Chevron plans to spend Dollars 20bn over 40 years developing Kazakhstan's vast Tengiz oilfield, which could be producing 700,000 barrels a day at its peak in 2010. But problems over the export route for the pipeline and the composition of the pipeline consortium threaten to undermine the largest western-led energy project in the former Soviet Union. The proposed pipeline consortium includes Russian and Kazakh state oil companies, as well as Chevron and the Oman Oil company, 100 per cent owned by the Oman government with a board made up of Mr Deuss and Oman officials, mostly from the oil ministry. It is Mr Deuss's insistence that Oman Oil have a 33 per cent share of the pipeline consortium that has led to the latest impasse. At issue is a proposal that Chevron would put up much of the capital for the pipeline, which will cost about Dollars 1bn. It would also guarantee to ship all Tengiz oil through the pipeline at an agreed rate. This would enable the other three partners to arrange western financing for their share of the capital costs. Chevron, however, is reluctant to bear the burden of the capital financing and to see such a large portion of the transportation revenues going to Oman Oil. Analysts in Alma Ata, the Kazakh capital, say Chevron wants 'significantly more' than a 25 per cent stake, and wants it to come out of the Oman Oil share. The Kazakh authorities are reported to have set a deadline of June 1 for settlement of the dispute. Mr Deuss 'wants a huge equity stake in return for putting in no capital,' said a western diplomat in Alma Ata. 'We don't know if Deuss has gotten greedy, or if something else is going on.' Last month the World Bank declined to take part in financing the pipeline, a development which, according to an April 8 bank report, has put the consortium 'in crisis'. The conflict is not the only obstacle to getting the region's oil flowing. Russia has demanded equity stakes in big oil and gas projects in former Soviet republics, slowing down the completion of contracts. Russia's Lukoil has won a 10 per cent share in Azerbaijan's big Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli fields. Moscow also wants an equity share of the Tengiz field, as well as of Kazakhstan's huge Karachaganak natural gas field, to which British Gas and Agip, its Italian partner, have sole negotiating rights. The World Bank report concludes that Kazakhstan 'has little choice' but to surrender the equity shares. 'Without Russian co-operation on pipelines, Kazakhstan cannot attract the high levels of foreign investment needed to develop its oil-gas sector,' the report says. But the emergence of international dealmakers such as Mr Deuss in the Caspian area, which could become one of the leading oil and gas producing regions of the world, has complicated negotiations between governments and international oil companies. Mr Deuss, aged 52, once operated a Citroen dealership in the Dutch city of Nijmegen. But in the early 1980s he began buying oil in the Soviet Union and soon became one of the world's premier oil traders. Mr Deuss has cultivated close relationships with the leaders of Oman, Kazakhstan and Russia. He won the friendship of Oman's leaders when it was still paying a marketing premium to Saudi Arabia for handling its oil. In return, he was appointed president of Oman Oil Company. 'Deuss showed them he could provide a better return for a lower price,' said a western oil trader in Alma Ata. In Kazakhstan Mr Deuss provided a timely loan exceeding Dollars 100m, earning him the trust of President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Thus, when the Tengiz deal seemed likely to be delayed indefinitely, Mr Deuss was able to get together Mr Nazarbayev and the other principals and get the deal signed in April 1993. Mr Nazarbayev has rewarded Mr Deuss handsomely. Oman Oil received rights to two tracts on the Caspian's offshore northern shelf in a deal involving a six-company western consortium including British Gas and British Petroleum. Mr Deuss also has made a powerful friend in Russia's prime minister, Mr Victor Chyrnomyrdin, the former energy minister. The three Caspian Sea republics - Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan - have studied various routes for transporting their energy to the west. Russia is pushing them to follow the route of existing pipelines to its Black Sea port of Novorossisk, a route that would allow Moscow to retain its monopoly grip on the region's oil supplies. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan appear to be succumbing to the pressure. Their favoured route now begins at Novorossisk, where the crude would be loaded on to tankers. Turkish worries about supertankers passing through the Bosporus Straits, site of a tanker collision in March, means that the oil might be transferred to a second pipeline to the Mediterranean. It would either traverse the Bosporus or Turkey's port of Samsun. CORRECTION Because of a computer transmission error the World Bank was incorrectly given as the source of a report on a proposed Kazakh oil pipeline quoted in an FT article about delays to the Tengiz oil project published on May 13. The source was actually a report by Oxford Analytica.</p>

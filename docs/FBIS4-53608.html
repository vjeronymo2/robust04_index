			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been learned that a Japanese trading firm has  rescinded a contract which it had concluded with Russia to  export its decommissioned submarines through intermediary trade  to North Korea for use as scrap.    The Japanese trading company took this action after the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] asked it to  stop the intermediary trade. However, Russia has resumed the  export of its decommissioned submarines to North Korea without  giving it prior notice. As a result, the uproar over the export  of Russia's decommissioned submarines to North Korea has now  subsided, leaving unanswered the question of whether the Russian  decommissioned submarines are militarily useful.    The Japanese trading firm in question is Toen Trading  Company  (based in Tokyo). It concluded the contract with Russia under  which it was to buy 12 decommissioned submarines from the  Russian Defense Ministry for export to North Korea for  dismantling and reexport as metal scrap to China.    The Japanese trading firm exported last January one of the  12  decommissioned submarines to North Korea. MITI, however,  intervened in this intermediary trade, claiming, "The trade may  violate the Foreign Exchange Management Law that prohibits  Japanese companies from engaging in any intermediary export of  weapons" and asked Toen Trading Company to stop the intermediary  trade. In response, the company exchanged a letter of  confirmation with the Russian side that "Russia will keep the  contracted submarines in place as they are until MITI approves  the intermediary trade."    On 12 May, however, the NHK broadcast a video showing  Russian  submarines being shipped from Vladivostok to North Korea. Russia  appeared to have embarked on direct deals with North Korea  without giving prior notice to Toen Trading Company. The  Japanese trading firm has decided to revoke the contract with  Russia after receiving no answerers to its queries.    After examining photographs submitted by Toen Trading  Company, MITI has concluded that "Russia's decommissioned  submarines in question are so badly obsolete that they cannot be  used as weapons." It, however, has been cautious about approving  intermediary trade by asking Russia to allow on-the-spot checkup  of the decommissioned submarines in view of the controversial  issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons.    Now that the Japanese trading firm has revoked the contract,  MITI need not make a judgment on "the sticky issue" (says a  senior MITI official).    Although MITI still says "we need to ask the Russian side to  confirm if the contract has actually been revoked and that the  issue has yet to be resolved completely," it appears to be  feeling no anxiety about the knotty issue.</p>

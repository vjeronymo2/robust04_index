			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 Mar (MENA)--AL-JUMHURIYAH demands that  security be provided for the Palestinian people as a first step  toward ending the occupation because this is the only way to  bring about a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace.    In an editorial today, the paper says that the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre revealed the serious dimensions of the Middle  East conflict and proved that working for a just and  comprehensive peace involving all parties concerned means  providing security for all parties. It does not mean securing  the existence of one party at the expense of the other.    AL-JUMHURIYAH emphasizes that real peace requires ending all  racist trends and discrediting all claims about the right to use  force to expand into other people's lands and that peace means  coexistence and cooperation without discrimination. Since the  Palestinian people are disarmed under the occupation, the  settlers living on lands they will never be entitled to under  any circumstances must be disarmed, the paper stresses.    AL-JUMHURIYAH affirms that Egypt will continue to back the  Palestinian people with its firm, solid, and effective stances  because this is the destiny it accepts willingly.</p>

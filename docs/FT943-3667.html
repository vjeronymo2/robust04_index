			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: No measure of competitiveness Sir, I enjoyed Frances Williams's critical remarks on the Institute for Management Development competitiveness report (World Trade News: 'Lean and mean, but is it fair?', September 7). Judging nations on the basis of a bunch of economic, political and cultural indicators as if they are competing against each other on these terms is nonsense. As Paul Krugman convincingly argued in a recent article (Competitiveness: a Dangerous Obsession, Foreign Affairs, March/April 1994) on the obsession of national politics with competitiveness, wealth creation of countries or companies cannot solely be matched with success on world markets or competition for foreign direct investment (FDI). Although it is obvious that national income depends on a variety of different factors, single national characteristics should not be judged as if nations are competing on these characteristics. Taken together they shape the economic structure of nations  -but is there a general formula behind their respective impact? Even if we focus on economic indicators, it is by no means clear that world trade or FDI rank first in determining national wealth in each country. Think, for example, of the US, Japan and France, which have reached high levels of per capita income with low export quotas - instead of highly obvious differences in their respective trade balances. If, however, the analysis is limited to world market success, one should focus on the structural failures of foreign trade - that is, on single products or product groups. This micro-economic approach reveals much about existing strengths and weaknesses of different countries - the more so where trade among high-tech countries is concerned. As a matter of fact, sectoral productivity and product-based technological leads are more valuable in offering an explanation of foreign trade structures and the impact on national income than the IMD indicator, which neither serves national governments in shaping economic policy nor the real-world businessman.

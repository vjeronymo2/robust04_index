			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Norske Skog makes first fall into red NORSKE Skogindustrier, Norway's biggest pulp and paper producer, yesterday unveiled its first annual loss, and warned of up to 450 further job cuts as part of a programme to reduce costs by NKr200m (Dollars 20m). Norske Skog reported a 1992 pre-tax loss of NKr662m against a profit of NKr480m in 1991 and will not pay a dividend after paying NKr2 a share a year earlier. The weak performance was due to foreign currency losses on loans, restructuring costs and a NKr191m loss suffered by Papeteries de Golbey, a French newsprint mill of which the company owns 49 per cent. Norske Skog's A shares closed down NKr1.50 at NKr85 in Oslo. 'The international forest products industry is experiencing the longest and deepest recession since 1945,' Norske Skog said, adding that there was a sharp fall in prices for most of its main products. Group sales fell to NKr7.83bn last year from NKr8.97bn in 1991, but operating costs were cut to NKr7.10bn from Nkr7.79bn. Norske Skog charged 1992 accounts with NKr200m for restructuring, against a charge of NKr130m in 1991. Minority interests in affiliated companies showed a loss of NKr183m last year, against a NKr23m profit in 1991. Net financial items of NKr432m were charged against 1992 accounts, compared with NKr143m in 1991. Norske Skog posted a NKr228m unrealised foreign exchange loss on loans, and said that NKr160m could be attributed to December's devaluation of the krone. In sharp contrast, the group achieved a NKr80m foreign currency gain in 1991. The group plunged into an operating loss of NKr47m in 1992, against a profit of NKr500m in 1991. Mr Arnfinn Hofstad, Norske Skog chief executive, issued a cautiously optimistic view for the group's prospects in 1993, but nevertheless warned the result this year would be poor.</p>

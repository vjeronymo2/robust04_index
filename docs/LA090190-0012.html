			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITICISM OF PUBLISHER BY KAHN IS CRITICIZED BY BOOK PUBLISHER  </P> <P> I was astonished that the Los Angeles Times published and syndicated, without  any attempt to obtain verification from me, an article as distorted as the one  written by Roger Kahn about his experience writing Pete Rose's biography. At  the very least, I'd like to set the record straight.  </P> <P> I am not the greedy monster Roger Kahn portrays me as being. Roger and Pete  Rose had until spring, 1987, to finish the book (on Rose), but when Roger's son  died and he asked me for additional time, I most definitely agreed to give it  to him. Roger and I agreed on a delay of several months; I did NOT respond by  starting a lawsuit as Roger indicates.  </P> <P> However, when Roger still hadn't finished the Pete Rose book by the end of 1987  (far past the new deadline), my company did begin to balk. After all, Roger and  Pete had made a commitment to give us this book, and they had accepted $225,000  for it. It did not seem unreasonable to expect them to honor the commitment,  but it turned out that we had to hire lawyers to get the point across. Roger  said he settled the suit at a "great loss." Well, he fails to mention that we  agreed to accept repayment of far less than the amount Roger and Pete had  received from us, so who suffered a greater loss?  </P> <P> Roger curiously complains that the press was misled, but I think if anyone was  misled, it was Warner (Books, Inc.) in expecting to receive a finished book  from Roger for the money it paid. Roger says, "The book for Warner never  worked. Books that begin with naked hype never do." Roger forgets to mention  that the sole reason it didn't work was that he wrote only a small portion of  the biography -- barely past Pete's high school days. Roger admits that when  "the publisher was gone," he sat down with Pete to complete the book. By then,  he found another publisher willing to gamble that he and Pete would finish the  book.  </P> <P> LAURENCE J. KIRSHBAUM  </P> <P> President,  </P> <P> Warner Books, Inc.  </P></p>

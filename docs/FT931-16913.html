			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Major stance on sterling is applauded THE POSSIBILITY that Britain's separation from the European exchange rate mechanism will end in divorce may have increased yesterday after Mr John Major appeared to attach new conditions for sterling's re-entry and said that that would not happen for at least another year. The prime minister's reference to linking sterling in a modified form of the ERM to the yen and the dollar was seen by several commentators as impractical, on the ground that it would require an implausibly large stepping up of co-operation on economic matters between Japan, the US and Europe. Mr Major's ruling out of sterling rejoining the ERM this year was applauded as realistic by several members of the Treasury's new economic advisory panel and by industry representatives. They said it improved the prospect of a UK recovery. One view was that if Britain proposed as a condition of ERM re-entry even an informal method of linking European currencies with the yen and dollar, the result might be a permanent block on the UK's re-joining the mechanism. The UK left the ERM in mid September after widespread selling of the pound. Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and a member of the Treasury's seven-strong economic panel, which meets for the first time this month, said: 'Mr Major's remark makes him appear not to be all that keen on a European monetary policy. It throws doubt as to whether he really wants Britain back in the ERM.' Mr David Currie, head of economic forecasting at the London Business School and another panel member, said: 'In view of the marked disagreements (on economic policy) between Japan, the US and Germany, it would be extremely difficult to adapt the ERM to introduce a link with the yen and the dollar.' But there was a general welcome for the idea of Britain putting off re-entry to the ERM for at least another year. Such a move would appear to rule out during 1993 any government-inspired effort to engineer a higher sterling exchange rate, in a development that would permit a relatively relaxed policy on interest rates and so strengthen recovery prospects. Since Britain left the ERM, sterling has depreciated by about 12 per cent against other main currencies and the government has cut base rates by 3 percentage points to 7 per cent. Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University, a long-time critic of UK economic policy and a member of the Treasury advisory panel, said: 'I welcome Mr Major's comments. We are seeing an enormous outbreak of good sense.' Others warned that in the long term industry would require a way to limit changes in the value of sterling, irrespective of the future for the ERM and whether Britain was a member. Mr Andrew Sentance, head of economics at the Confederation of British Industry and another member of the Treasury's economic panel, said: 'Industry has not lost interest in exchange rate stability.' Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive of Lucas, the engineering components group, said: 'Industry has managed to live with currency fluctuations in the past and will do so again, even if Britain stays out of the ERM. I'm not too concerned about the UK failing to rejoin over the next year, but longer-term it would be very useful to see greater stability in currency rates.' Mr Major's comments are unlikely to end the broader debate about whether Britain's rejoining the ERM - possibly after enough time has elapsed to permit a UK recovery and for the German Bundesbank to cut its interest rates and so reduce some of the general strains within the mechanism - is in the UK's best interests. Mr Tim Congdon, head of economic consultancy Lombard Street Research and a fierce ERM opponent who is another member of the Treasury's economic panel, said: 'I am pleased that Britain is not going back (to the ERM) this year. But I am disappointed that the government is even contemplating rejoining later on.' As far as much of industry is concerned, whatever the longer-term aspects of possible ERM re-entry, there is widespread welcome for the benefits of a lower sterling exchange rate. PRIME MINISTER'S MAIN POINTS In his interview with Sir David Frost, Mr John Major said: The UK would not return to the European exchange rate mechanism in 1993 There might be a need for international co-operation to create a relationship between European currencies, the US dollar and the yen, if sterling returned to a managed exchange rate system He expected 'gentle' growth of 1 per cent in 1993, accelerating in 1994 Unemployment might not lag so far behind recovery as it did after the recession of the early 1980s About two thirds of the public-sector borrowing requirement was cyclical and there would be a 'benevolent change' once the economy recovered The UK could not afford to take risks with inflation.  Low inflation and low interest rates were needed to stimulate investment The government's aim was to have the minimum level of taxation, particularly direct taxation The government was not retreating on British Rail privatisation but was following through the proposals published last summer.</p>

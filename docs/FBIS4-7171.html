			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of reply speech by President Le Duc Anh at state </F> banquet hosted by Indonesian President Suharto in Jakarta on 26  April -- recorded]    [Text] Dear President Suharto, Mrs. Suharto, and ladies and  gentlemen of the country of the historic Bandung Conference;    I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the  wholehearted reception and warm feelings of friendship extended  to us by his excellency president, his wife, and the Indonesian  people from the first moment we arrived in your country. I am  moved at the president's fine words about the Vietnamese  fatherland and people and the relations between our two  countries. These words demonstrate the Indonesian people's  profound feelings for our people.    Being in the Southeast Asian region, the peoples of Vietnam  and Indonesia struggled under harsh conditions for national  independence and both won victories in 1945. Over the last 49  years, we have built a fine relationship of friendship,  sympathy, and mutual understanding.    Our people always remember the Indonesian people's honest  support for the Vietnamese people's legitimate effort for  national unification. Today, our two peoples share a common  aspiration in building a prosperous country and changing  Southeast Asia into a region of peace, stability, and  cooperation. That is the firm basis for the continuous  consilidation and development of our long-term friendship and  cooperation relations, making it a long-lived relationship as  our beloved President Ho Chi Minh said 35 years ago when he  visited Indonesia.    Dear President Suharto, ladies, and gentlemen;    Visiting the fraternal Indonesian country, we are happy  about  the great achievements made in the past 25 years by the  Indonesian people under the president's leadership and under the  national ideology of Pancasila. On this occasion, we sincerely  wish the Indonesian people greater achievements in taking  Indonesia into the taking-off period in national development and  international and regional cooperation.    As the president of the Nonaligned Movement, Indonesia has  actively contributed toward a Southeast Asia region of peace and  cooperation and for a more stable and prosperous world. On that  basis, Indonesia has an increasingly important role in the world  and region. Vietnam wholeheartedly supports Indonesia's active  role in that direction and stands side by side with our  Indonesian friends in the struggle for peace and equal  cooperation among nations.    Dear Mr. President, ladies, and gentlemen;    The international and regional situations continue to change  in a swift, profound, and complicated manner, thus presenting  all nations great opportunities and challenges. In our region,  the trend of peace, stability, cooperation, and development has  been increasing. We believe that Southeast Asia is enjoying the  most favorable conditions since the end of World War II for  solidly building cooperation for regional long-term peace and  prosperity. We always attach importance to improved relations of  friendship and cooperation for mutual benefit among regional  countries on unilateral and bilateral bases.    We are content at the fine development of the Vietnam-ASEAN  relationship, and with ASEAN's active support, Vietnam is  energetically preparing to become a full member. We hold that  this conforms with both Vietnamese and ASEAN interests and is  beneficial to peace, stability, cooperation, and development in  the region. We strongly believe that my official friendship  visit to Indonesia will contribute to solving problems of mutual  concern and further accelerate our multi-faceted friendship and  cooperation relation for the benefit of the peoples in our two  countries and for peace, stability, cooperation, and prosperity  in Southeast Asia and the world.    In the atmosphere of friendship and fraternity between the  peoples of Vietnam and Indonesia, I invite all of you to toast  President Suharto and his wife to good health and happiness, the  prosperity of the Indonesian people, the consolidation and  development of the Vietnamese-Indonesian multi-faceted  friendship and cooperation, and Southeast Asia becoming a region  of peace, friendship, cooperation, and development. I wish you  all good health.</p>

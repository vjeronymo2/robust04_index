			<p>BFN     [Text] The Azerbaijani Army on Monday [18 April] morning  resumed attacks on Nagorno-Karabakh positions in the Mardakert,  Martuni and Fizuli sectors of the front, a Nagorno-Karabakh  military source said.    He told INTERFAX fighting was still in progress at noon.    On Sunday, intense fighting was going on on a large section  of the front in Mardakert and Fizuli Districts.    The source said Nagorno-Karabakh forces had rebuffed all the  strikes and had switched over to launching counterattacks in  some areas, mainly in Mardakert District where it had destroyed  some of the Azerbaijani firing positions.    The source denied Azerbaijani reports that hundreds of  Nagorno-Karabakh troops had been killed. He said Azerbaijan's  losses had been much heavier than Nagorno-Karabakh's.    Meanwhile, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry said that, on  Sunday afternoon, Armenian tank units positioned in northern  Nagorno-Karabakh had made several attempts to advance towards  the town of Terter, but were stopped by Azerbaijani forces,  which destroyed six Armenian tanks and seized another two pieces  of new armor.    Early on Monday morning, the Armenians once again tried to  break through to Terter, simultaneously attacking villages close  to the town, but were thrown back around 0800 after heavy  fighting, losing three tanks, one armored personnel carrier and  about 90 troops, the ministry said.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Study forecasts rising level of economic growth The Swiss authorities have been given a fairly strong - if grudging - endorsement from the OECD for their recent management of the Swiss economy, writes Ian Rodger. Switzerland is recovering from three years of mild recession, and the OECD, in its latest annual assessment, forecasts 1.5 per cent real growth this year and 2.5 per cent next year. Inflation, which soared to 6.6 per cent in mid-1991, has dropped below 1 per cent, and seems likely to remain low. 'With employment picking up and consumer confidence progressively reviving in the course of 1994, household consumption should gather strength. Machinery and equipment investment is likely to continue its recent upswing, reflecting ongoing efforts of enterprises to modernise productive capacity, as well as reduced credit costs and lower prices of imported investment goods,' the OECD forecasts. 'But the favourable outlook should not give rise to complacency,' the OECD warns. It predicts that a further round of public spending cuts and tax increases will be needed to eliminate a relatively high budget deficit. It also says that business investment decisions could be affected by uncertainty over Switzerland's participation in the process of European integration. The Swiss voted against joining the European Economic Area in 1992, and the federal government has yet to clarify how it will now pursue its goal of joining the European Union. The OECD says 'stepped up' efforts should be made to liberalise many economic sectors and align standards with those of the EU. It has also renewed its complaints, first made in its November 1992 report, about how the Swiss National Bank monitors monetary growth. It says that the country will fall well below the bank's target of an average 1 per cent annual growth in the seasonally adjusted monetary base over the three year period to 1994. The OECD observes that the bank's policy stance 'still appears relatively restrictive', but it then falls into line with the central bank's cautious view that the scope for further easing is limited, given the speed of economic recovery. Meanwhile, the Swiss Federal Office for Economic Issues said yesterday that economic recovery continued in the second quarter with a 2.4 per cent rise in the annualised seasonally adjusted growth rate of gross domestic product compared with a robust 3.2 per cent in the first quarter. It said all main components of GDP rose, with the exception of exports, which were 4.6 per cent lower, compared with the first quarter. Exporters have been complaining recently that the strong Swiss franc is hurting their competitiveness. The country's unemployment rate fell to 4.5 per cent in August compared with 4.6 per cent in July. and 4.7 per cent in August 1993.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Last Week saw the Australian market begin to ease after several weeks of rising prices, which took the market indicator up by 100 cents from the season's low point of 411c/kg in August. This week the decline accerlerated and clearances at auction deteriorated at the same time. The market indicator yesterday reached 469c/kg, and at Melbourne and Fremantle around 30pc of the offering was passed in. The setback was not unexpected but is proving rather sharper than many traders thought probable.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel will continue supplying the Gaza Strip with  electricity for the next few months. Autonomy officials asked  the Electric Company to do so until its own independent source  of electricity is set up. A ship outfitted with turbines is  expected to anchor off the coast of Gaza in three to six months,  providing most of Gaza's electric needs. The Civil  Administration has paid Israel's Electric Company 40 million  shekels to cover the Strip's debt.</p>

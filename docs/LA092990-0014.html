			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THE RIGHT KIND OF OFFICIAL  </P> <P> Reading a recent article about City Councilwoman Cathy Bean, I was reminded of  a quote I read of something Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said: "If you want  something said, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman."  </P> <P> I think Councilwoman Bean is making some people very uncomfortable with her  persistent questioning of the way things are, the way things are "always done."  Maybe men can comfortably assume they know everything and be admired, but women  -- and especially women who have been active in the League of Women Voters --  want to really know. And that's the kind of person I want serving me on the  City Council.  </P> <P> RUTH A. HIBBARD  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

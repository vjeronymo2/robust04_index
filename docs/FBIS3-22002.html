			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 23 Mar (NA) -- Defense Minister  Oscar Camilion today said the Armed Forces "categorically reject  the possibility of joining the antinarcotic effort, for which  they feel neither competent nor inclined."    The minister said the Armed Forces' non-engagement in the  antinarcotics fight is due to the fact that "there are the  necessary organizations to do it like the Border Police, the  Argentine Coast Guard, and the Federal Police."    "There are countries in which the armed forces have to  intervene because they do not have those security  organizations," the minister said. "The Armed Forces  categorically reject the possibility of joining antinarcotic  efforts, for which they feel neither competent nor inclined."    In this regard, he assured that Argentina "does not have the  problems of other countries, where drug traffickers make  themselves the owners of land areas."    Concerning U.S. "pressure" for the military to join the  antinarcotics fight, he said: "It is their problem to  permanently insist on that fight, just as we insist that they  should halt drug consumption among their population."    On the other hand, Camilion denied press reports that  President Carlos Menem advocates the engagement of the military  in domestic intelligence work.    The minister said the Armed Forces will only "extend  logistical support" in case of domestic disturbances, like the  one that occurred in December in Santiago del Estero, although  he admitted that government members followed this specific case  with "concern."    Camilion maintained that the government "has no intention"  of  making the Armed Forces join domestic intelligence work, adding  that he received "neither formally nor informally, neither  directly nor indirectly," any indication in this regard from  President Menem or Presidency Secretary General Eduardo Bauza.    In statements to journalists after opening the academic year  of the School of National Defense, which is subordinated to his  portfolio, Camilion recalled that the Armed Forces are ruled by  defense and internal security laws, and he categorically denied  that the "amendment" of such laws is being studied.    He also categorically denied that the United States has made  any reference to the possibility of the military taking action  in case of an eventual social outbreak in Argentina.

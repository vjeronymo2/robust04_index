			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Horrigan joins Liggett Group MR EDWARD Horrigan, who headed the large tobacco business at RJR Nabisco and was vice-chairman of the parent company ahead of the Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out of the company in 1989, is re-entering the cigarette business. The Liggett Group, now the smallest of the leading US cigarette manufacturers, whose brands include Chesterfield, Lark and Eve, announced yesterday that Mr Horrigan had been appointed chairman and chief executive, with effect from May 24. Mr Horrigan - whose board positions include a directorship at USAir - quit RJR shortly after the Kolhberg, Kravis Roberts-led leveraged bid won control of RJR Nabisco. According to Barbarians at the Gate, the best-selling book on the bid tussle, Mr Horrigan demanded to either be chief executive of the company, or part company. He reportedly left with a Dollars 45.7m golden handshake, and acquired a candy business in Atlanta. Liggett, part of Brooke Group, has faced troubled times recently, with declining profits and falling market share. It announced the departure of its chief executive and chief financial officer in January. At that stage, the company created an interim three-person 'office of the chief executive'. The team included Mr Bennett LeBow, chairman of Brooke. Most recently, Liggett has stirred the already troubled waters of the US cigarette market by introducing a new discount brand, Eagle, which is stylishly-packaged and undercuts rival products on price. The introduction of Eagle came after Philip Morris, the largest US cigarette company, announced large price cuts in its full-priced brands, and both Philip Morris and RJR attempted to edge up prices of their discount brands, narrowing the price differential between the two segments of the market.</p>

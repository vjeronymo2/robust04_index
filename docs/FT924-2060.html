			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Observer: Dunn that Is the invasion of British journalists into the top positions in the US magazine business about to be repeated in the cut-throat world of New York tabloid newspapers? If Mort Zuckerman, the US real estate developer turned publisher, can lick the New York printing unions into letting him take over the New York Daily News, one of his first jobs will be to recruit a Fleet Street editor. Mort, owner of US News and World Report, has already been sounding out the top brass at Associated Newspapers; the suggestion has been made that the man to turn round the Daily News is Martin Dunn, the 37-year-old editor of Today, part of Rupert Murdoch's rival stable. Of course, this may be just a bit of mischief-making. But Dunn seems well suited. Not only has he lifted Today's circulation by more than 20 per cent, but he spent six years in the Big Apple partly working for the Sun. The word is that he would be off like a shot if he were offered the chance to edit the Daily News.</p>

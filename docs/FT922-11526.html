			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Observer: Work study As Britain's industrialists were urging one another to lead the charge to recovery, two British Rail workmen on Greenwich station were shovelling debris into a motorised cart on caterpillar tracks. 'Better than a wheelbarrow,' observed a waiting passenger. 'Must hold three times as much.' By the time the train was due, the cart was full. One workman rested, while the other started it up and steered it at snail's pace up the platform which is separated by a railing from a strip of grass. 'But much slower than a wheelbarrow,' the passenger added, 'though it must cost a dozen times more'. As the train arrived, five minutes late, the workman was inching down the ramp at the platform's end. And by the time the train pulled out, he was edging up the ramp to the strip on the other side of the railing. 'Blimey, they're going to dump it on the grass,' said the passenger. 'They don't even need a wheelbarrow - they could just shovel the stuff straight over the fence.'</p>

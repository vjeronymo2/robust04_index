			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ULTIMATUMS ARE USUALLY A STEP TO WAR, BUT NOW PEACE SEEMS CLOSER;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: WESTERN NATIONS TRADITIONALLY USE ULTIMATUMS AS A PRELUDE TO WAR,  BUT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION NOW SEEMS TO BE AIMING FOR PEACE.  </P> <P> After Iraq swallowed Kuwait, the Bush Administration persuaded the U.N.  Security Council to adopt resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion, demanding its  unconditional withdrawal, calling for economic sanctions and directing the  prompt return of all hostages. At the same time, responding to Saudi Arabia's  pleas, it deployed a large number of troops for, as President Bush stated,  "defense and deterrence."  </P> <P> But then Bush changed course. He doubled the number of the roughly 200,000  personnel deployed, to add forces trained for offensive operations.  </P> <P> Bush explained that the change was required to scare Saddam Hussein into  compliance. But he soon discovered he was also scaring the American people.  Americans increasingly worried that Bush might launch an offensive before fully  testing the blockade's efficacy, which was already noticeably eroding the Iraqi  economy.  </P> <P> That concern mounted on Nov. 28, when America arranged for the U.N. Security  Council to approve a resolution providing that if, by Jan. 15, Iraq had not  complied with all prior resolutions, the member states might use military  force.  </P> <P> By now, Americans were not only scared but puzzled. Was the ultimatum prompted  by the hope that America might induce the Iraqis to respond affirmatively, or  was it -- as has often been the case -- designed as a ritual prelude to war?  </P> <P> Ultimatums are a decidedly "non-Arab" procedure. The Arab peoples do not like  irrevocable decisions that may lead to violence. There is an old Middle Eastern  saying that if an Arab should ever cross the Rubicon, he would pick up the  Rubicon and take it so that he could cross and recross it, as events evolved.  </P> <P> In sharp contrast with Arab tradition, Western nations have a long history of  using the ultimatum as an irrevocable step toward war. Thus, in 1914, Austria  served an ultimatum on Serbia, and in 1939, France and Britain delivered an  ultimatum to Germany. Later, in 1956, Britain and France gave Gamal Abdel  Nasser an ultimatum -- after they had begun their abortive Suez adventure.  </P> <P> But if the future of Bush's ultimatum is murky, it is clear that if the United  States attacks Iraq, our sons and daughters will bear the brunt of the struggle  -- and take most of the casualties. With the honorable exceptions of Britain,  France and Canada, most nations in our jerry-built coalition will cheer while  Americans fight.  </P> <P> Yet if most of the coalition is counting on Americans to wage a fierce war, the  American people are by no means eager for the fray. Though some indulge the  illusion that the United States can use its superior air power to win a quick,  relatively cheap war, my experience as a director of the U.S. Strategic Bombing  Survey in 1944-45, and America's experience in the Korean and Vietnam wars,  taught me air power does not win wars. Nor should any rational American assume  the Iraqis would meekly permit superior U.S. air power to bomb their  arms-producing facilities. They would retaliate.  </P> <P> Thus, more and more Americans are convinced the United States should not rush  into war without first testing the efficacy of the current economic blockade --  which is already having serious effects. As former Secretary of Defense James  R. Schlesinger testified before Congress, for example, Iraq's civilian  production has declined by some 40%, while Iraq's foreign-exchange earnings  have been almost entirely blocked.  </P> <P> But advocates of immediate war protest that the blockade may not prove its  effectiveness in less than a year. They argue the United States cannot sustain  nearly a half-million troops in the desert for that long.  </P> <P> That, however, is no rational basis for immediate action -- merely an  illustration of the stupidity of U.S. overdeployment. We should not let past  errors stampede us into rash action. This is the opinion of two distinguished  former chiefs of staff -- Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., who was chief of Naval  Operations, and Gen. David C. Jones, former chief of the U.S. Air Forces. It is  affirmed by two former secretaries of defense, Schlesinger and Robert S.  McNamara. Gen. H. Norman Schwartzkopf himself in the gulf, who will bear  command responsibility, has expressed eloquent doubts that a war can be fought  without massive U.S. casualties.  </P> <P> To placate this growing skepticism, Bush has felt driven to make a formal show  that he is exhausting the diplomatic option. He is sending Secretary of State  James A. Baker III to discuss the matter with Hussein and has invited the Iraqi  foreign minister to come to Washington.  </P> <P> Is serious progress likely to come from this? One might instinctively say no,  but the Administration seems at long last to have decided to return to its  earlier definition of war aims. Under these, the Iraqis need only release all  hostages, which they have now vowed to do, withdraw from Kuwait and permit its  legitimate government to be restored.  </P> <P> Some Administration spokesmen have suggested that all other issues might be  reserved for settlement after the current crisis has been resolved. These would  include the abandonment of Iraq's potential nuclear capacity and its current  capacity for chemical and biological weapons. Baker has reportedly been  authorized to promise that once the current crisis has been resolved, the  United States will not use the authority provided by the U.N. Security Council  to attack Iraq.  </P> <P> Thus, Bush has provided at least some hope that the crisis can be resolved  without war. One must expect, of course, that Hussein will seek to allay the  impression that Iraqi compliance amounted to complete capitulation. He will not  have an easy time, for he has courted Arab opinion as a hero who stands up to  imperialist America, Israel's principal friend. Still, in settling with Iran,  Hussein showed he is capable of withdrawing from a drawn-out conflict without  losing his iron hold on his own country.  </P> <P> Although Bush has been categorical in demanding that Hussein not gain a whisper  of a concession as a reward for his aggression, it is possible that, in talking  with Baker, Hussein will propose a modified form of compliance. Perhaps he will  offer to withdraw from all but the northern area of Kuwait on the excuse --  which the Kuwaitis deny -- that Kuwait has been siphoning oil from a field Iraq  now claims, or try to retain an offshore island to provide Iraq some land area  on the gulf.  </P> <P> Such an offer would present grave problems to the Administration. Many  Americans would contend that such a minor territorial qualification was not  worth the life of a single American, while several coalition members would be  likely to turn their backs on any further assistance to U.S. military action.  </P> <P> Whatever the future may hold, whether America launches a war or the blockade  brings down Hussein, the effect would leave the Middle East even more chaotic  than before the Iraqi aggression. The destruction of Iraq's military force  would upset the balance of power in the region -- leaving Syria and Iran  dominant.  </P> <P> Thus, even while talks are proceeding, Washington might announce that, at the  conclusion of the crisis, it will ask the Security Council to convene an  international conference, not only to conclude unfinished business of the  crisis -- by providing for the abandonment of Iraq's potential nuclear capacity  and its current capacity for producing chemical and biological weapons -- but  to deal with all major Middle East problems.  </P> <P> The most pressing is the Palestinians' desire for their own nation. A promise  that the Palestinian problem will be examined could facilitate a settlement in  the current test of wills.  </P> <P> Some plausible rationale for a conference will be necessary. But it should not  be linked to the gulf crisis; rather to the end of the Cold War and the  approaching end of the century and millennium. Participants would include not  only Arab states but representatives of arms-producing countries, and its  substance should be restricted to the Middle East. That is the world's most  dangerous region, for there are more weapons in the Middle East than the  totality of those assigned to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  </P> <P> Thus, the conference should cover not only the securing of peace, but arms  reduction. It should include a serious discussion of suggestions made both by  Egypt and Israel for the establishment of the Middle East as a nuclear-free  zone, and should consider prohibitions against chemical and biological weapons,  as well as environmental questions.  </P> <P> Great strides in diplomacy have historically been made when statesmen have  taken advantage of the end of epochs to reorder mind-sets and structural  prejudices. At the end of the Napoleonic era, the warring nations of Europe met  at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, to rearrange the furniture of Europe. The  war-torn Middle East provides a similar opportunity today. The secretary of  state's visit to Iraq might lay the basis for the larger conference that could  promise all peoples of the Middle East a brighter future.  </P></p>

Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the terms ``control zone and transition area,'' and airspace designated from the surface to adjacent controlled airspace is now being described as Class D and Class E airspace in this vicinity. The intended effect of this proposal is to modify controlled airspace in this vicinity to that actually required for aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before September 30, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to: Michael Sammartino, Acting Manager, System Management Branch, AEA&hyph;530, Docket No. 94&hyph;AEA&hyph;03, F.A.A.

Communications should identify the airspace docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address listed above. Commentors wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments on this notice must submit with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AEA&hyph;03''. The postcard will be date/time stamped and returned to the commentor. All communications received on or before the specified closing date for comments will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposal contained in this notice may be changed in light of comments received.

Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the terms ``control zone and transition area,'' and airspace extending upward from the surface to overlying controlled airspace is now being described as Class D &amp; E airspace in this area. The intended effect of this proposal is to reflect that amount of controlled airspace actually required for aircraft operations under instrument flight rules at the Morgantown Municipal-Walter L. Bill Hart Field, WV. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and Class E airspace areas extending upward from the surface and from 700 feet above ground level are published in Paragraphs 5000, 6002, 6004, and 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D &amp; E airspace designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

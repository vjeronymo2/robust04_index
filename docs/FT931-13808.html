			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Diller to head TV shopping network MR BARRY DILLER, who resigned last February as chairman of Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox film and television studio, has been named chairman and chief executive of QVC Network, a leading US cable television home shopping network. The move follows Mr Diller's recent agreement to purchase Dollars 25m of QVC's equity in a privately-negotiated transaction. The negotiations that led to Mr Diller's appointment are believed to be aimed at achieving joint control of QVC's board by Mr Diller and two corporate partners which are also substantial QVC shareholders - Liberty Media, a Wyoming-based company that has also agreed to buy voting control of QVC's main rival, and Comcast, a cable operator. QVC recorded Dollars 36.2m net profits on Dollars 729m of revenues in the first nine months of its 1992-93 fiscal year.</p>

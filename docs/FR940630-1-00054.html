			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Comparison of FAA Proposal With International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and European Joint Aviation Authority (JAA) Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ICAO does not perform airman or agency certification actions of the type proposed by the FAA in this NPRM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The JAA currently has not completed writing its operations regulations and, therefore, has no airman charges at this time. For foreign repair station certification, the JAA has announced a charge of $1,000 per non-European facility. The charge will be assessed irregardless of an inspection visit. Within Europe, JAA certificates are issued by the appropriate Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of the JAA member country and applicants are charged according to the fees of that CAA. Two examples of fees for comparable services provided by the CAA's of JAA member countries follow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United Kingdom CAA hourly inspector rate is 0D147, which is approximately $297 U.S. per inspector hour. Repair station certification charges range from 0D442 to 0D3,180 ($884 to $6,360 U.S.). Additional hourly charges may be assessed. Actual transportation and subsistence costs are added for facilities located outside the U.K. These charges include a 7.5% profit on certification actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The German LBA repair station charges range from 800 to 7,000 Deutsche Marks (DM), which is approximately $479 to $4,191 U.S. Transportation costs are also added. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are no reporting or recordkeeping requirements associated with this NPRM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 established the requirement that, within the extent permitted by law, a Federal regulatory action may be undertaken only if the potential benefits to society for the regulation outweigh the potential costs to society. In response to this requirement, and in accordance with Department of Transportation policies and procedures, the FAA has estimated the anticipated benefits and costs of this rulemaking action. The FAA has determined that this proposed rule is not a ``significant rulemaking action,'' as defined by Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). The results are summarized in this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would not impose any additional costs on any members of society other than those requesting FAA certification services outside the United States. The proposed rules, if implemented as final rules, would reimburse the FAA for the cost of services currently being provided to the users. Thus, the beneficiaries, rather than the general taxpayers, would pay for the services provided by the FAA. The FAA has determined that the proposed fees are equitable and reflect the cost of providing these services. The benefits of this NPRM would therefore be the elimination of the need for general revenues by the FAA to cover the costs of these services provided by the FAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to consider the impact of proposed rules on small entities, that is, small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and local governments. If there is a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, the Agency must prepare a draft Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) for the NPRM and a final RFA for the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would primarily affect general aviation pilots and foreign repair stations. The RFA applies neither to individuals nor foreign entities. Therefore, a RFA is not required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> International Trade Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would affect primarily general aviation pilots and foreign repair stations. The proposal would have a favorable competitive impact on U.S. repair stations by removing the subsidy that the FAA has provided to foreign repair stations in the form of lower charges for certification services. The NPRM would enhance the competitiveness of domestic firms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism Implications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct implications on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12866, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is nonsignificant under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is not considered significant under Order DOT 2100.5, Policies and Procedures for Simplication, Analysis, and Review of Regulations. A draft regulatory evaluation of the proposal, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination and International Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in the docket.

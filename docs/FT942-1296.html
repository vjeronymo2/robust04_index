			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool When selling resumed in Australia on Tuesday prices generally were firm to unchanged. A slightly easier tendency appeared the next day, but by Thursday prices were again firm. However, the real test of values will come next week, at the closing sales for the 1993-94 season, when there will be substantial quantities of wool on offer. It is noted that there has been a fall of inquiry for stockpile wool. Last week's sales, reports Wool International, totalled 4,687 bales, of which 3,418 were for deferred delivery. At June 17 the stockpile amounted to 3,678,788 bales. While most traders continue to predict a reasonably firm start to next season's sales, a key factor in the longer term is the reluctance of spinners to pay prices for tops which fully reflect current replacement costs. The market indicator was 627c/kg on Thursday.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jacques Isnard: "The New Strategic Sub `Le </F> Triomphant' to Begin Its First Tests in the Atlantic"; first  paragraph is LE MONDE introduction]    [Text] Defense minister  Francois Leotard was scheduled to visit Cherbourg on Friday, 22  April, to view the latest of France's new-generation submarines,  Le Triomphant. The underwater craft will travel to its  Ile-Longue operational base in Brest in early May. Ten years  after initial drawings, Le Triomphant--which will be followed by  three other missile-launching nuclear submarines of the same  type--will prepare to set sail for its sea tests from Brest. The  ship will be declared "ready for active service" in the summer  of 1996.    Now under the command of ship captain Francois Dupont, Le  Triomphant was put on slipway at the Cherbourg naval shipyard  directorate in June of 1989. But the first studies for the  submarine began over 10 years ago, and it has been 8 years since  the first piece of sheet metal was welded in place.    The goal with Le Triomphant was to build as quiet a  submarine  as possible, able to fire more sophisticated nuclear missiles  than those carried aboard such first-generation ships as Le  Redoutable and its enhanced version L'Inflexible. Hence Le  Triomphant's undersea tonnage of 14,355, against 8,920 metric  tons for its predecessors. This huge underwater displacement is  similar to that of modern submarines in service in the United  States and Russia, which meet roughly the same technical  criteria.    Engineers made four specific design choices to reduce  radiated noise and make Le Triomphant quieter during operations.  First, they equipped it with a steel hull of very high elastic  limit so that it could dive deeper (beyond 300 meters). Second,  they made the submarine more hydrodynamic and streamlined its  propeller. Finally, they insulated propulsion and auxiliary  installations from the hull and suspended them on springs to  avoid vibrations and shocks.  <H5>  A Fr81 Billion Program </H5>   Likewise, Le Triomphant carries renovated weaponry. In  addition to defensive weapons consisting of torpedoes and Exocet  SM39 submarine-launched missiles, the submarine will transport  16 M45 missiles. Each M45 can disperse six nuclear  warheads--staggered over time or space--that can strike targets  more than 6,000 km away from their underwater launch point.  Moreover, the M45 features penetration devices and electronic  countermeasures to help it thwart enemy defenses.    France has decided to begin building three other submarines  of the same model, two of which, the Temeraire and the Vigilant,  have already been named. In the past, the Strategic Ocean Force  has included as many as six strategic submarines. By 2005, that  number will have dropped to four. Construction of the four new  submarines is estimated to cost a total of Fr81 billion, not  counting spending on the M45 missiles. The decision whether to  replace the M45 in 2010 by a missile dubbed M5 is not expected  to be made before 1997.    Following Leotard's on-board tour, Le Triomphant will sail  to  the Ile-Longue base, in the Brest roadstead, between next 2 and  4 May. It will be presented to Francois Mitterrand on 7 May when  the head of state travels to Brest to witness the launch of the  first French-built nuclear aircraft carrier, the  Charles-de-Gaulle. The prime minister is scheduled to join the  president on his visit to Le Triomphant submarine.    During the following two years, the submarine will perform a  series of sea trials--a crucial step before it enters active  service, i.e., makes its first operational patrol. The tests to  enable the crew--two rotating crews of 110 men each--to learn  how to handle the ship at maximum submersion will take place in  the Atlantic. Le Triomphant will later effect a full-scale  launch (minus the explosive charge, of course) of an M45  missile, and fire torpedoes and SM39 missiles. This will enable  the Permanent Programs and Testing Committee (CPPE), which makes  proposals concerning the rating and active service acceptance of  the submarine to the general staff, to hand down its verdict.  Active service is slated for the summer of 1996.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine can soon become a major exporter of  domestically manufactured military hardware. Such a view was  expressed by experts, helping Ivan Plyush, a presidential  candidate, to conduct his election campaign. They published a  paper with analysis of the situation in the industrial military  complex and its prospects.    They contend that the most hopefull export commodity could  be  the T-84 tank designed in Kharkov. It is superior in its  characteristics to both its Western counterpart and the Russian  T-80 tank. Experts regard diesel submarines, anti-aircraft and  anti-submarine missiles as equally promissing for Ukrainian  export.    They revealed that next year the country plans to put out a  new modification of the Kalashnikov automatic rifle,  out-performing the basic model. They single out Asia as the  most lucrative market for Ukrainian arms. An offer from an  Indian company called Resources Argumentation is seen as  particularly enticing for Kiev. Especially as they offer  $5-$7.5 billion in long-term credit to advance Ukrainian  industry.    When the USSR was in existence, Ukraine's share in the  Union's production of arms amounted to 40 percent for  spacecraft, up to 50 percent for tanks, and up to 15 percent for  other arms. At the same time, by some statistics, up to 20  percent of Ukrainian industry worked for defense. Since then  the figure has shrunk to 10 percent.    Meanwhile, Ukraine and the U.S. have reached agreements to  implement projects on converting some Ukrainian munitions plants  to civilian production. This concerns a Kiev-based aircraft  construction plant where civilian aircraft are planned to be  assembled, the Malyshev plant (diesel engines production), and  the Arsenal plant (medical equipment manufacture).    Experts estimate the conversion projects at $770 million.</p>

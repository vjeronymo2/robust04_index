			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Abbey's silent minority DO YOU know anyone who has repeatedly turned down the chance to be given a free gift worth Pounds 273 - or even Pounds 546? It may seem unlikely that anyone would look a gift-horse of this sort in the mouth, but according to Abbey National there are many such people around. They are soon to be given a final chance to claim a gift of free shares which they should have taken in 1989. The people concerned are some 390,000 customers of the former building society, Abbey National, which dished out 100 free shares to 5.4m members when it was floated on the stock market three years ago. Just why anyone should refuse repeated exhortations to fill in a form which will bring them a free allocation of shares is a mystery. Since the shares were issued in 1989 they have risen in value from Pounds 130 to Pounds 273 and annual dividends have been paid out twice on them. Even if a good proportion of the missing customers are long-since dead, there must be tens of thousands of people around who are entitled to claim the shares. Few of them seem inclined to step forward. Last time Abbey National wrote to the 390,000 silent customers, it got only 5,000 replies. Presumably most of the people concerned who are still alive have had envelopes coming through their doors at intervals in the last few years. Perhaps they thought they were junk mail or dire warnings about falling behind with their mortgage payments. If you were an Abbey National member at the time of the float and did not receive your shares, perhaps because you changed address, then you should consider whether the shares are owing to you. To qualify for the shares at the time of the float, an Abbey National saver had: to have at least Pounds 100 in their account between December 31, 1988 and April 11 1989 and to be the first named person on the account and over 18 years old by April 11 1989. Abbey National borrowers had to meet similar qualifications, but were required to have borrowings of more than Pounds 100 from the society between the same dates. Individuals could qualify for two allocations of shares if they were both a saver and a borrower, so there must be some people who, if they but knew it, are entitled to nearly Pounds 550 worth of shares from Abbey National. If you think you are eligible, then you must fill in a claim form giving details of your accounts with the society at the relevant dates. If you do not receive a letter from Abbey National, a free 24-hour helpline has been set up which you can call. The number of the helpline is 0500 - 500 - 202. Abbey National proposes to sell unclaimed shares in the market in 1993. Most of the cash will go straight into its reserves (which is good news for existing shareholders as it will improve the earnings per share). A small proportion of the money raised by the sale will be given to the Abbey National Charitable trust for donation to selected charities. If for some reason, you do not get in touch with Abbey National before the shares are sold off, do not despair. The bank will still have to repay you the money any time until six years after the flotation. Money on the dividends paid before the shares are sold off can be claimed for up to 12 years. Meanwhile, other building society customers must be wondering who will reap a bonanza when the next large society converts into a company. That day may still be some way off. Jon Foulds, chairman of Halifax, the largest building society, this week said that chances of Halifax having a stock market flotation were negligible for the next three to five years at least.</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / The Monday Interview: Branching away from the ranch - Ted Waitt tells Katharine Campbell how he made Sioux City the Gateway to the world's personal computer-users One of the typically eccentric 'milestones' by which Gateway 2000 chooses to chart its growth was July 1992, the month the gravel parking lot was paved. Ted Waitt, 32, who created the world's ninth largest vendor of personal computers from a farmhouse in Iowa nine years ago, cares deeply about such things. 'The gravel symbolised our philosophy of keeping the cost of doing business low, and not losing sight of our roots.' The rest of the staff, with their mud-spattered cars, eventually won him over, but even then, a colleague had to send in the engineers to explain why keeping his own space unpaved would be a symbol too far. Now the largest mail-order PC vendor in the US, Gateway sold Dollars 1.73bn worth of IBM-compatibles in 1993, 56 per cent more than the previous year. It claims to be leaner and meaner than its rivals, including Dell, the industry pioneer of direct marketing. Dispensing entirely with dealers and their mark-ups, Waitt assembles machines using brand-name components, and addresses its computer-literate, price-sensitive clientele through ads in specialist magazines. That works even for sales to large corporations, at least those with decentralised purchasing organisations. If the function is centralised 'you have to do a lot of schmoozing. We don't schmooze much; it's expensive,' Waitt explains. Convinced the formula would travel, Gateway established a subsidiary in Dublin last October, from where it wants to service the rest of Europe. Sales in the UK have gone better than expected, but the continent will be far trickier. Waitt unveiled his French models at the beginning of this month, and Germany is pencilled in before the end of the year. Rivals are deeply sceptical that the relatively unfamiliar mail-order approach will catch on. But if it wasn't a high-wire act, Waitt wouldn't be having fun - which he patently is. The antithesis of the computer nerd, his gifts are not those of the technical visionary; his is basically a highly gifted sales and marketing brain. When forced to sit down, the nervous energy is challenged alternately into fiddling with his lank pony tail and getting through the daily two packs of Camels. No friend of the business suit, he made his mark in London a few years back by showing up at a black tie ceremony in cowboy boots and a string tie. Given his apparent restlessness, it comes as a slight surprise that he has settled down to a wife - Joan is a real estate broker - and two young kids. Product of the boondocks of Sioux City - and proud of it - Waitt happily admits he had always set out to make money, 'and, um, for whatever reason, I was fairly convinced I would be successful at something'. As the marketing literature for Gateway will not let you forget, the Waitts have been in cattle for five generations, but Ted, it seems, was not exactly encouraged aboard. Instead, he took himself off to the University of Iowa, where he failed to stay the course in finance and marketing - 'college in America doesn't prepare you for a whole lot of anything' - and went to work as a salesman in a computer store in Des Moines. Then, as now, no gizmo freak, he started off knowing nothing about PCs - but nine months later was in business on his own. Mike Hammond, whom he met at the store, provided the technical brains and his elder brother Norm - trained in the family cattle business - the financial nous. Ted, meanwhile, did what he does best - selling. Ads have been a company trademark from the start. At first Waitt wrote his own copy and the creative work is still done in-house - including that for Europe. And of course he continues to star in the big parts in the ads: he posed in pirate gear in the US; as King Arthur for the UK launch; as Lafayette for the French. It is all intended to reinforce the company's home-spun philosophy - which is also why the packaging is covered in splashes of black and white - supposedly reminiscent of cowhides. His taste for convertibles and jet-skis aside, Waitt claims he actually doesn't like spending money. He certainly kept his hands off the cash as the business grew. Started on Dollars 10,000 secured against Granny Waitt's certificate of deposit, the company still makes much of its low gearing. Gateway belonged solely to him and his brother until 15 per cent was floated on Nasdaq last December. Like a child who resists growing up, Waitt does not relish everything that running a big company entails. Outside shareholders, he concedes, are indeed 'a bit of a nuisance, yes'. He also affects not to track the share price: 'It would drive me crazy'. One can see his point. Launched at Dollars 15, it motored up to Dollars 24, but was last week lingering only just above the low of Dollars 13.5. Even if Gateway's net margin of 4.1 per cent is still one of the best in the business, Wall Street disliked being surprised by the 1994 first quarter earnings - down 2.7 per cent on a 12 month comparison. Waitt is only just learning - reluctantly - to play the game. And his investor relations man, Jim Wharton, who joined last autumn after having been mayor of Sioux City, certainly followed an unusual path to the post. Earnings were down partly because an unexpected change in 'bus' technology, the process by which data is moved around within the PC, caught the company on the hop. The problem illustrates the ever-present risk of being tripped up by change in a business where minimal inventory is a crucial component of cost minimisation. The company was also eventually forced to allocate more resources to its (free) customer support service when some other software companies began to charge for after-sales assistance. Waitt does not deny the difficulties. 'Six months ago, the time spent on each call suddenly went up by about 50 per cent.' 'We are finding we are giving DOS lessons over the phone - people stay on the line for four or five hours, particularly at night.' Unhappy customers complain that at one point last year their calls might not be returned until the following day. Another thing Waitt has disliked, one suspects, has been the need gradually to cede control to others. Bob Spears, managing director of the European operation, observes that Waitt loves coming to Dublin. 'He likes to be around a Gateway of just 200 people again.' Founded a year before Gateway, Dell, which plunged into loss for the first time in 1993, is further down the road to adulthood - and struggling. What lessons does he draw? 'Dell is a very different company' begins Waitt, who himself could not be more different from his earnest, terribly mature, but actually younger rival Michael Dell. He believes that if you combine mail order with more traditional selling - as Dell does - managing it becomes very complicated. While Waitt thinks he has already achieved 'critical mass' sufficient to survive among the big boys, there are hurdles aplenty ahead. Europe will almost certainly prove tougher than he imagines, to begin with. At the same time, Gateway's strength to date does lie in its marketing and distribution formula; if margins are cut to the bone on PCs, Waitt could always shift to mobile phones, or almost anything else. So how can he prove Gateway is not just another a rocket chip, in the jargon? Much fingering of the pony tail. 'That's the tough part,' he says.</p>

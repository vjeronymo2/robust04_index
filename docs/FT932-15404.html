			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Japan boosts aid for Russia FOREIGN and finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations gathered in Tokyo last night for a two-day meeting which will attempt to secure the leadership of Russian President Boris Yeltsin by providing his country with another substantial aid package. The pressure on Japan, as host, to give generously was reflected in a government decision to increase its planned bilateral assistance from Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.2bn) which includes trade insurance, humanitarian aid, and technological assistance to the Russian nuclear industry. Japan's assistance is expected to be announced today in an address by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who has made clear to other participants that Tokyo will not formally raise the contentious issue of the Kurile Islands. The islands, which were occupied by Soviet troops in 1945, are claimed by Japan. Apart from Russia, foreign ministers are expected to discuss the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, threatened by increasing violence, and the continuing conflict in Bosnia. They are also expected to discuss North Korea's announced pull-out from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Finance ministers will hold their first session this afternoon, and discuss the state of the international economy. Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, Japan's finance minister, intends to explain the stimulatory package announced yesterday and hopes to prompt discussion on the rapid appreciation of the yen. But Japanese officials expect that the US and other G7 members will have little sympathy for Tokyo's concerns that the yen's movement could put extra pressure on the country's export industries. Instead of focusing just on the yen's rise, Japanese officials plan to argue in favour of 'currency stability'. Bilateral meetings with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, will be held by individual countries today, but the group discussion of assistance to Moscow is scheduled to begin tomorrow morning. It is expected that a final package will total around Dollars 36bn, but that figure includes already negotiated debt relief and credit extensions from the International Monetary Fund. Mr Kabun Muto, Japan's foreign minister, said yesterday that the quality of aid was important. He intends to emphasise the need for increased assistance for the restructuring of Russian companies and will reflect Tokyo's concerns about pouring large, poorly targeted amounts of money into a 'black hole'. Meanwhile, Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said the ministers had come to Tokyo on a 'noble mission': 'That is, to determine how the world's industrialised democracies can best unite together to support the historic struggle of the Russian people to build a free society and a vibrant economy.'

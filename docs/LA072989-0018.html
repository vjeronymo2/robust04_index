			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PHILOSOPHICAL BAGGAGE' OF EVOLUTION  </P> <P> According to Christian orthodoxy, faith is a gift given by grace, by God. That  which can be proven does not require faith, which is the cornerstone of  Christianity. One is "saved" by grace -- not by the state.  </P> <P> Fundamentalist Christians indulge in idolatry by demanding that the state  perform a function which doctrinally belongs only to their God.  </P> <P> If fundamentalist children have their faith torn down "by talking about  evolution as fact," their parents should address the problem to their God  rather than to state curriculum commissions.  </P> <P> LAURIE HALL  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> IT'S TWO FOR THE 2-A SHOW: LINCOLN VS. EL CAMINO FOR TITLE;  </P> <P> LINCOLN: THEIR ANGRY YOUNG MEN, WITH HELP FROM A SPEEDY NEWCOMER, GAINED A  MEASURE OF REVENGE AND A BERTH IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.  </P> <P> Lincoln High's football team had 21 angry young men, all seniors, who vowed to  put to rest a two-year-old inferiority complex.  </P> <P> Mind you, the Hornets did indeed advance to the San Diego Section semifinals in  1987 and 1988. Nothing to be ashamed of, but what gnawed at them was the fact  that one team -- San Pasqual -- had terminated their title aspirations each  year.  </P> <P> "We went in last year talking revenge," said Thomas Baker, a senior outside  linebacker and blocking back at Lincoln.  </P> <P> But revenge was not to come. Not then, anyway. San Pasqual, which came from  behind in the 1987 game to edge Lincoln, 28-27, last year routed the Hornets,  40-29.  </P> <P> As fate would have it, this season Lincoln and San Pasqual again advanced  through the preliminary rounds only to meet each other in the semifinals.  </P> <P> Here was one final opportunity for Lincoln's seniors to prove they could indeed  topple the North County power. One final opportunity to advance to San Diego  Jack Murphy Stadium, where the section finals are waged each year. One final  opportunity to put themselves in position to earn a 2-A championship, something  San Pasqual did in '87.  </P> <P> Last chance -- better take it.  </P> <P> Lincoln did, coming from behind twice in the final three minutes to pull out a  stunning, 35-32, victory. (Lincoln plays El Camino for the title at 5 p.m.  Saturday).  </P> <P> But this could hardly be called revenge. The senior almost singularly  responsible for the final touchdown which came with less than 30 seconds  remaining was the only senior on the team who did not experience either of the  failures of the past two autumns.  </P> <P> Victor Dean did not play football for Lincoln the past two years because of  eligibility problems. But without Dean this year, the Hornets most likely would  not have advanced to the semifinals.  </P> <P> "This is the first time I've ever been on a team where the result of a game is  in the hands of one player," said Terrell Davis, a senior running back.  </P> <P> Against San Pasqual, Dean took a kickoff at his 23 with 34 seconds showing. San  Pasqual had just went ahead, 35-32, following a nine-play, 58-yard drive. But  that lead was short-lived because Dean ran the kickoff back 77 yards for a  touchdown and gave Lincoln the margin of victory.  </P> <P> That was only an encore. Dean started the show the previous week in the  quarterfinals against Grossmont. With the Hornets trailing, 25-19, Dean fielded  a punt at his 21, bobbled it, picked it up a second time, looked straight ahead  and dashed 79 yards into the end zone.  </P> <P> His touchdown return tied the score and put Lincoln into position to later win  in a California tiebreaker.  </P> <P> Just luck?  </P> <P> Not really. Dean has returned seven punts or kickoffs for touchdowns this year.  And the punt return against Grossmont came amid some odd circumstances.  </P> <P> "The officials were calling everything," said Bakir Madyun, one of the top  offensive linemen in the county, who was supposed to be blocking during the  punt return. "So we were scared to block and we ended up just standing in their  way."  </P> <P> Dean's main attribute is his speed.  </P> <P> "He may be the fastest player on the team," said Vic Player, Lincoln coach.  </P> <P> That's saying something because all four runners of Lincoln's state-qualifying  400-meter relay team, which turned in a 41.6 last spring (Dwayne McAfee,  Charles Brown, Scott Hammond and Doug Boyd), play football.  </P> <P> But wait, that's not all. The Hornets' 1,600-meter relay team, eighth fastest  in the county last year (Hammond, Davis, John McCartney and Hanno Readen) also  play football.  </P> <P> But Dean's teammates and coaches say the returns are the result of more than  just speed.  </P> <P> "I think he has the vision," Davis said. "And it's natural. He can feel it when  he's going to get hit, and he ends up making all the right moves."  </P> <P> Vic Player, Lincoln coach, agreed.  </P> <P> "It's a feeling," he said. "It's all natural. It's nothing he works at or  nothing we can teach, he just has it.  </P> <P> "And I'm sure glad he discovered it the last couple games."  </P> <P> Yes, Dean has discovered it. He's been questioned about it and he's dwelled on  it. But now he says he must forget about it.  </P> <P> He too speaks of his touchdown returns as a reliance on instinct or reaction --  something not to be thought of if success is to continue.  </P> <P> "I'm just going to take it like I always do," he said. "I'll practice hard this  week and play my best Saturday."  </P> <P> While Dean's late-game heroics have singled him out on a team heavy in team  unity and light in individual superstars, they have also given the team reason  to listen to another player, wide receiver Dwayne McAfee, who all season has  been convincing the Hornets that "as long as there's still time left on the  clock, we can win."  </P> <P> Some players say McAfee's sideline rousting can become irritating. But they  also say he has instilled an attitude in the team.  </P> <P> "We'll be sitting down on the sideline and he tells us to get up," Baker said.  "He tells the crowd to get up and make some noise. And he does make a  difference."  </P> <P> "He even yells at the cheerleaders," Player said.  </P> <P> McAfee gets his inspiration from a Bible passage.  </P> <P> "Philippians 4:13 says we can do all things through Christ which strengthen us,  and that's the attitude this team has," he said. "Hey, San Pasqual is a good  football team. They're big and strong and they have a big offensive line that  they marched behind and scored with a few seconds remaining. But still we  didn't give up."  </P> <P> Added Charles Brown, a senior running back, "I know we had enough time to win  even if Victor had gotten tackled. The offense would have taken over and moved  down field as it can. I know we had enough time."  </P> <P> Call it a team-wide attitude.  </P> <P> "Even the two games we lost (to Southwest, 21-18, and to Crawford, 13-6), they  were saying we didn't lose the games, we just ran out of time," Player said.  </P></p>

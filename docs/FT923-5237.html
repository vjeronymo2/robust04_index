			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Leading Article: A PR coup for the banks THE BRITISH clearing banks' talent for public relations is almost as impressive as their genius for losing money. To have conveyed the impression that they want to introduce charges on current accounts in the depths of a particularly severe recession invites no more flattering verdict. Yet, ironically, the clearing banks have a reasonable case for phasing out free banking. On past form they will probably fail to make it persuasively, before exploiting the notorious inertia of the majority of bank customers by slapping on the charges regardless. For years the big four clearing banks complained that they did not earn enough from current accounts to defray the heavy costs of money transmission. Then Midland Bank ensured that transparency in bank charges would be deferred sine die when it introduced 'free-if-in-credit' banking in the mid-1980s. This entrenched a system of cross subsidisation. Lloyds Bank stirred the pot further when it started to offer interest on current accounts in 1988. Since then retail bank profits, while still handsome enough to absorb the consequences of the banks' folly in corporate lending, have been under growing pressure. As for the customers, those who have managed to stay out of overdraft have enjoyed an inexpensive service, subsidised by a minority that includes people paying usurious interest rates of up to nearly 40 per cent on unauthorised dips into the red. Part of the rationale for offering such a competitive current account service was to lock customers into a long-term relationship, thereby opening the way for the banks to sell them more lucrative savings products such as life assurance and pensions. Such a strategy, which involved turning a core banking product into a loss leader, looked risky in the 1980s. It looks more risky in the present decade when endowment policy bonuses are being cut and growing disillusionment is felt by consumers over the products and quality of service peddled by life assurance salesmen. The problem that the big four clearing banks face in seeking to address the declining profitability of retail banking is that their history and size continue to give rise to the suspicion that they are part of an oligopoly, even if many areas in which they operate are highly competitive. The merest hint of collusion would give the Office of Fair Trading justifiable cause to sit up and take note. Yet in practice the big four clearing banks are no more likely to move as one on current account charges than they did on the introduction of plastic card charges. Their more normal game is follow-my-leader, after sizing up the market's response to innovation. The Midland's move to free banking in 1985 was in part a response to the free banking service provided by smaller competitors such as the Co-operative Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Now that the pendulum looks set to swing the other way, it would not be surprising if the big banks once again restricted free banking to those who maintain a high minimum credit balance in their account, while smaller competitors, whose ranks now include a more versatile group of building societies, offer a completely free current account alternative. Such competition probably offers a more effective remedy than anything the OFT can do. And in the long run, greater transparency in charges will be healthy for both the banks and their customers.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Morocco free trade zone Morocco will build a new harbour and a free trade zone of some 5,000 acres in the Atlantic coast port of Dakhla in disputed Western Sahara, Reuter reports from Rabat. The official news agency MAP quoted Mr Mohamed Hassad, public works minister, and Mr Driss Jettou, commerce and industry minister, as saying the harbour would take three years to build and become a centre for deep-sea fishing. Morocco claims Western Sahara, but Polisario guerrillas have been fighting for independence since 1976.</p>

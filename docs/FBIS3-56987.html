Aleksandr Panov Ready To Give Helping Hand to Russian  Businessmen for Asian Market"]    [Text] Russian politicians of the highest rank have  repeatedly underlined that broader cooperation with the  countries of Asia could plug some of the gaps in Russia's  relations with the West. This equally applies to trade and  economic relations, as well as political ones. Their  invigoration will be discussed in the course of a tour of the  countries of Central Asia, the Russian Far East, and China by  Andrey Kozyrev, head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He is  setting off on this trip on 24 January. Aleksandr Panov, who  has recently changed his job from ambassador to Seoul to that of  deputy minister of foreign affairs, kindly agreed to comment on  the state of Russia's relations in the Asia-Pacific Region in an  interview with your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent.  <H5>  Russia Faces Asia </H5>   In Mr. Panov's opinion, Russia has till this moment been  paying its main attention to broader relations with the West.  This can partially be explained by the fact that the more  economically developed part of the Russian territory is in  Europe. However, the diplomat believes, relations with Asia are  extremely promising only if because of the current rapid  economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Of no minor  importance is also the fact that Asian countries are not  refusing to buy finished products from Russia. Mr. Panov thinks  that Moscow has been able to do much in recent years to expand  trade and economic relations with the Asia-Pacific region: far  from falling, the volume of trade has grown. Russia's political  ties with countries in the region are also picking up: Boris  Yeltsin's visit to Japan took place after all, and he also went  to South Korea, India, and China. This years opens with a visit  to the PRC by Andrey Kozyrev. In Moscow, they are awaiting  South Korea President Kim Yong-sam, and the head of Japan's  cabinet, Morahiro Hosokawa.  <H5>  Foreign Ministry Offers its Services to Russian Businessmen </H5>   Mr. Panov believes that a stronger Russian position in the  Asia- Pacific Region will be helped by its participation in  regional organizations. Russia already today takes part in two  of them: the Pacific Economic Council, which brings together  private businesses; and the Pacific Economic Cooperation  Council. Membership in these structures helps Russian  entrepreneurs keep abreast of all important events in the  region. According to the diplomat, entrepreneurs of the Russian  Far East began to trade independently on Asia's markets in  recent years. Today they account for nearly 50 percent  ($600-700 million) of Russia's trade with South Korea. The  business contacts, however, are not always successful owing to  unfamiliarity with the region. Mr. Panov therefore advises that  Russian businessmen increasingly seek assistance from Russian  embassies and trade missions which, in his words, are ready to  help them find partners.    Mr. Panov thinks that membership in regional structures  would  help Russia avoid competition with countries like the United  States and Japan that traditionally wield strong influence in  the region and are naturally reluctant to yield ground to  Moscow. The diplomat noted with regret, however, that real  competition is a long way off because U.S. trade with  Asia-Pacific countries is around $300 billion, while Russia's  trade with the Asia-Pacific region has never exceeded $10-15  billion. As for boosting these figures through arms exports,  one should not expect contracts worth billions in the near  future. Russia, he believes, lacks sufficient experience in  this business. Besides, Asian markets, arms markets in  particular, are traditionally geared to supplies from the United  States, France, and Great Britain.  <H5>  To Draw Borders With China Is Easier Than With Japan </H5>   Mr. Panov thinks that, for the first time in decades,  relations between Russia and China are simply normal: "In the  past, we either fraternized or argued." Problems do exist, of  course, but they are solvable. One is territorial. There is a  widely held opinion that Russia is handing over its territories  to the PRC unilaterally. What really is happening, according to  him, is that Beijing also makes concessions. The diplomat also  terms as promising Russia's recent proposal on the joint  economic use of these border territories. The other problem is  the transparency of the Russian- Chinese border. There too, the  Russian Foreign Ministry is taking measures to limit no-visa  entry by the Chinese.    As for Japan, in the wake of Boris Yeltsin's visit to  Tokyo, the sides have in full measure come to realize the entire  complexity of the territorial problem. Mr. Panov believes that  one should not expect an appreciable progress in its solution in  the near future. According to him, Russia and Japan will start  a new round of talks in February, but a complete settlement of  this question should be preceded by the process of rapprochement  in the sides' positions on the entire set of both political and  economic problems.</p>

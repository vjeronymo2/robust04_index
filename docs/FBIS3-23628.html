			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Minister of Defense of Ukraine General of the </F> Army Vitaliy Radetskyy: "Start of the Year: Building, Educating,  Peacekeeping"]    [Text] The third year in the building of the armed forces  of Ukraine has begun, encompassing questions of the composition  and structure of the troops (forces), their training for  military action, their technical equipping, manpower  acquisition, mobilization and strategic deployment, the training  of reserves, the performance of active duty and other issues.    There is every reason to assert today that we have chosen  the  directions of military development correctly. The basic laws on  military issues have already been adopted, the Military Doctrine  has been approved, and the conceptual development of two  interconnected state programs is underway--the building and  development of the armed forces, and the development of weaponry  and military hardware. The efforts of the leadership personnel  of the armed forces of Ukraine and the work of our military  intellectuals facing the knot of problematical tasks pertaining  to military organizational development are directed namely at  that.    The scientific development of the force composition of the  armed forces within the limits of the size stipulated for us,  and the organizational structure of command and control  elements, large formations and units with the aim of the most  efficient utilization of the weapons systems and military  hardware, firepower and striking power of the troops (forces)  has gained particular urgency.    Questions of equipping the armed forces of Ukraine with  advanced weapons systems and military hardware and reducing the  variety of logistical mat&eacute;riel have also not escaped the  attention of military scholars and specialists. Keeping in mind  the systematic restructuring of the economy of Ukraine that is  underway, they are not failing to pay attention to questions of  the structural convergence of the military-industrial complex  and the armed forces.    Paramount attention is being devoted therein to the use of  our world-class achievements in the realm of missile and space  technology, which will make it possible in the future not only  to equip the armed forces of Ukraine with all types of modern  missile hardware, but also for our state to take part in  international space programs in the interests of the national  economy and science. We can thus state with confidence that  Ukraine can and will be a missile and space power.    The search for solutions continues with regard to the  problems of the Black Sea Fleet.    We feel that the first and main task that must be resolved  pertaining to this problem, and on which the success of all  further work depends, is a complete verification of all of the  property and military hardware of the Black Sea Fleet on hand,  both on water and on land, as well as the assurance of  regulation law and order in Sevastopol and the Crimea as a  whole. The building of our own fleet for Ukraine is continuing  at the same time. The small ASW ship Lutsk, whose crew is today  continuing their teamwork, has completed sea trials and has been  commissioned in the force composition of the Navy of Ukraine.    Tasks pertaining to raising the combat readiness of the  elements for technical and rear support of the troops (forces),  at the same time, have not lost their significance as well. A  constant search is underway for ways to increase the  maneuverability and survivability of support and servicing  units. A search is underway for sources of extrabudgetary  financing for the measures being carried out in the armed forces.    One problem in military organizational development was  bringing the system of training and indoctrination of the  military cadres into conformity with the considerations of the  requirements of troop practices, the views of the nature and  methods of waging modern possible wars, operations and battles.    The Military Collegium of the Ministry of Defense met in  order to solve this important problem, and reviewed problems and  issues of military education and the rectification of errors.  Concrete measures were instituted in accordance with their  decisions with regard to improving the qualitative composition  of the leadership elements of field education and the  performance of paramount measures aimed at building an efficient  system of military education and indoctrination, as well as the  organized holding of graduating exams and the distribution of  young officers among units and subunits.    Work was continued to refine future improvements in the Army  and Navy, the draft and the performance of military service by  those obligated to serve.    Attention has not diminished in this regard toward the  activity of the military commissariats, through which all of the  personnel of the armed forces pass twice--the first time during  their conscription into active military service, and the second  when they are discharged into the reserves. The principal  interaction of the Army and the civilian population of Ukraine  and the reservists takes place through the military  commissariats. The reputation of the armed forces is thus formed  in the citizenry based on how the military commissariats operate  today.    A council was held at the Ministry of Defense with the  command personnel of the military commissariats, with the aim of  further strengthening the local elements of military  administration as an important echelon in military  organizational development; the council discussed concrete ways  of raising the quality of the conscription of the youth and  improving mobilization readiness and the official activities of  the military commissariats at all levels.    The commanders and elements of educational and  socio-psychological work and the chiefs at all levels have been  conducting a search for ways of improving the  socio-psychological climate among the troops, and for more  effective forms for the indoctrination of the personnel with a  regard for historical and national traditions in the interests  of strengthening military discipline and order.    Our planned work among the troops and measures to monitor it  have shown, at the same time, that such deficiencies as  excessive formalism in the organization of combat raining,  education and indoctrination of the personnel, an inability to  organize service and order under the new conditions and to know  the most important things in work continue to exist in the units  and subunits.    The Military Council of the Air Forces has thus still not  defined its place and role in preserving the battleworthiness of  aviation and improving morale and the psychological conditions  of the servicemen, and has gotten tied up in the resolution of  secondary tasks, which has affected the activity and overall  status of the military collectives.    A certain sluggishness and inconsistency in the performance  of work to strengthen military discipline has been typical in  general of a certain quantity of larger formations and units;  that has kept them from achieving any noticeable improvement,  reducing the number of instances of non-regulation relations or  absences without leave and eradicating other negative phenomena.  The quantity of servicemen who have deserted their units also  remains too high.    We have taken concrete steps, aside from measures on a  disciplinary plane, to improve the situation in the ranks by  improving the food and everyday living conditions for all  categories of servicemen and making a transition to a new style  of dress, along with more active work with regard to improving  standard legal documents and the organization of interaction  with the bodies of internal affairs, as well as the entry into  force of the Temporary Statute of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.  The state of military discipline and provision of good living  conditions in subordinate units and subunits is considered to be  one of the principal indicators of the professional ability of  commanders and superior officers at all levels.    The start of the new training year in the armed forces of  Ukraine was devoted by and large to the practical rehearsal of  questions of bringing the troops and forces to combat readiness,  studying areas of combat application and routes of access to  them, and improving engineer measures and the combat interaction  of subunits. The Ministry of Defense also conducted several  important measures over that brief period.    The problem of training individuals for higher  military-political leadership to fulfill their constitutional  obligations under conditions of crisis and conflict situations  has existed for nations at all times. This problem has gained  particular urgency during the period of building our young state.    Its resolution is complicated by the necessity of training  higher personnel in the organizational unity and interaction of  all power structures that constitute the military organization  of the state.    Joint strategic staff exercises were conducted in the  interests of solving this problem, new to us, from January 24  through 28 of this year under the leadership of the President of  Ukraine and Supreme Commander-in-Chief, with the involvement of  the commanders of the Border Troops, National Guard, National  Security Service, Minister of Internal Affairs and chief of  staff of Civil Defense of Ukraine with the corresponding command  and control elements. The fact that the improvement of knowledge  and skills of the higher military-political leaders endowed with  the functions of ensuring external and internal security was  accomplished for the first time against a uniform strategic  background and on a uniform plane and intent was a principal  feature of the exercises.    The results of the training confirmed the necessity of  utilizing forms of strategic training, in the process of which  questions of the joint resolution or elimination of crisis and  conflict situations that affect the vital activity of the state  and the administration of its power structures and regions are  practiced. The organization of such strategic exercises will  require additional scientific refinement in this regard in the  interests of further improvements in them, which will provide an  opportunity of devising the corresponding nationwide official  documents.    The great amount of training work that was performed by the  Ministry of Defense, along with the other ministries and  agencies, with regard to resolving problems connected with the  deployment of the elements of the former strategic nuclear  forces of the Union in Ukraine, as is well known, have already  gained practical realization. The Supreme Soviet approved on  February 3 the trilateral declaration of the presidents of  Ukraine, the United States and Russia on the removal from our  territory of all nuclear weapons. The declaration contains  provisions for Ukraine pertaining to guarantees of the military  security of Ukraine on the part of the United States, Russia and  Great Britain, which voluntarily joined the declaration as a  nuclear power and additional guarantor of the security of our  state. The declaration also guarantees compensation for Ukraine  for the value of the highly enriched uranium that is contained  in the nuclear warheads that will be removed from Ukraine to  Russia for dismantling.    The political gain that was won therein has allowed us to  make international activity, including in the military spheres,  more active.    Relations are being expanded, on a bilateral basis, with  regard to military-technical collaboration among the military  agencies of the CIS nations. Working meetings have been held  over this brief period by delegations of Ukraine with  delegations from Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.    A military delegation headed by the Minister of Defense of  Ukraine, over the brief period of February 8-9, made a friendly  official visit to the Hungarian Republic, where they were  received by prominent state and military figures and held  negotiations on the further development of fraternal relations  and mutually advantageous military-technical collaboration on a  broad circle of issues.    We will now have two battalions in Yugoslavia, each of which  will have three special companies, one combat-engineer company  and rear and medical support companies, owing to the fact that  the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine adopted a resolution on 19  November 1993 to increase the size of the Ukrainian contingent  in the peacekeeping forces there to 1,220 people. This decision  was made by request of the UN Security Council.    Work was performed over January-February of this year  pertaining to manpower acquisition for the first battalion,  training of the rotation personnel and its dispatch by aircraft  and railroad.    We expect that our soldiers will fulfill their peacekeeping  duties in a worthy manner.    The crisis situation in the economy, and the lack of a  military-industrial complex in the country that could  structurally meet the needs of the armed forces of Ukraine for  weaponry and military hardware, continue to have a negative  impact on the logistical status of the troops, and are reflected  in the pace of their development. The personnel of the armed  forces are utilizing all available opportunities to preserve the  battleworthiness of units and formations of the command and  control elements under the difficult economic conditions.    I would like to emphasize overall that the difficulty of the  problems that have arisen cannot diminish our persistence in the  organizational development of the armed forces of Ukraine. The  fact that the army needs help in other areas in these difficult  times, and first of all on questions that pertain to the youth  and, in particular, instilling in them a feeling of national  pride and readiness to serve in the ranks of the armed forces of  their Fatherland, also cannot be concealed.    The new state has to have its own army. This is undoubtedly  a  state matter, a matter for all the people. I thus appeal not  only to the leaders of state structures, but also to civil  society, to the mothers and fathers of the pre-conscription  youth. We must all together with the army, after all, prepare  from among our youth the reliable defenders of the independence  of Ukraine, prepare them with full responsibility. The results  will then be substantial, and the benefits from them will be  felt.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Japanese Government is cool about the results  on biddings for supercomputer procurement. A Ministry of  Foreign Affairs [MOFA] official said: "Biddings are held  fairly. The results merely reflect who are the competitive  bidders." On the other hand, there are views that the results  can bring considerably favorable effects on the whole course of  the deadlocked Japan-U.S. framework talks because the  governmental procurement biddings issue has been symbolic of  frictions between Japan and the United States.    In 1990, the Japanese Government instituted the procurement  procedures based on the principle of competitive bidding. A  Ministry of International Trade and Industry official insisted:  "Our procurement system treats Japanese and foreign bidders  completely without discrimination. Therefore, there is no  problem." Commenting on the results, a MOFA official said: "The  fact is simple. Competitive bidders have won the bids."    Concerning the report that U.S. Cray Research Inc. is  dissatisfied with the results, a MOFA official said: "The  reason Cray won fewer computers than it had expected is not  because there were problems in the procedures but because Cray  lacked competitiveness." Meanwhile, another official criticized  Cray's action, saying: "It is unfair to resort to political  actions."</p>

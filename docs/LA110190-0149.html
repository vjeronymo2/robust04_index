			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> JUDGE RULES FOR SWAP MEET  </P> <P> City officials must allow businessman Paul Cho to open a proposed swap  meet-style store in Northwest Pasadena, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge has  ruled.  </P> <P> In his decision Tuesday on a lawsuit brought against the city by Cho, Judge  David Yaffee ordered the city to inspect Cho's store at 625 N. Fair Oaks Ave.  and issue a certificate of occupancy.  </P> <P> Yaffee said the Pasadena Community Development Commission abused its discretion  by refusing to consider deteriorated conditions at the shopping center when it  and, later, the Board of Directors vetoed Cho's proposal for the Fair Oaks  Department Store.  </P> <P> The city said Cho's store would detract from redevelopment goals for the area  and would increase traffic. But Yaffee said that conditions at the shopping  center have already deteriorated to such an extent that major stores are  reluctant to locate there.  </P></p>

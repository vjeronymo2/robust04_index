			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Mexico put on negative credit watch Mexico was placed on negative credit watch yesterday by the international rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's, as both investors and the government struggled to make sense of the implications of this week's 29 per cent devaluation of the Mexican peso. Ms Lacy Gallagher, Mexico analyst at S&amp;P, explained that Mexico's long-term rating was likely to stay in the BB spectrum, but that the credit watch meant the current BB+ could be downgraded to BB or BB- in the next months. 'The basic question is how the government is going to manage the crisis in confidence that has arisen. We are going to be watching very closely how they follow through on the commitments (about economic policy) they have made to investors over the past few days,' Ms Gallagher said. Analysts said that, after the 'hostile' meeting in New York on Thursday of 70 money managers and Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexican finance minister, confidence could only be restored if questions about inflationary pressures, privatisation revenues and monetary and fiscal policy were adequately addressed - something that did not happen in the meeting. 'The investors asked for complete details - with numbers and projections and everything - and frankly that is very difficult at the moment,' said a senior Mexican finance ministry official. 'We are going into brainstorming mode and, by the end of next week, we ought to have an outline that will be satisfactory.' The official said projections would be hard to make until the peso had stabilised. The spot middle peso weakened late yesterday to finish at 4.925 to the dollar. The main Mexican stock market index was up 1.54 per cent at the close, but analysts said it would not be a good reflection of confidence until the peso rate was stabilised and equity prices could be valued in dollars. Mexican stocks trading in New York were virtually unchanged on the day. Analysts estimate that Mexico's budget will have to be cut by between 2 and 4 per cent of GDP, or approximately Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) to Dollars 10bn, in order to make up for increasing interest payments on foreign debt and for lower tax revenues from an expected slowdown in the economy. Some of this gap will be closed by lowering resources available to development banks. Privatisation revenue, generated by sales of existing electricity and petrochemical plants, is being touted as a potential saviour. Executives in those industries say they are interested, especially because serious bargains might be found, but that financing those purchases will be very difficult. Inflation is the other problem, especially as merchants in Mexico City and on the US border began to ignore the government freeze and raise prices. 'Its simply not clear how they are going to keep wages and price pressures down,' said Ms Joyce Chang, analyst in the emerging markets group at Salomon Brothers.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Arts: BT connects with the grass roots - Sponsorship which is excellent news for the arts. Like many responsible companies BT allocates a percentage of its profits, half a per cent in practice, to good causes, which include the arts. Last year BT profits were down so the goodies-bag shrunk from Pounds 15m to Pounds 14m, although Rodger Broad, who looks after the arts at BT, was able to negotiate an increase in his budget from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 1.8m. This is by far the largest sum devoted by a UK company to arts sponsorship, and the probability of higher BT profits means it should grow again in 1994. Broad must have the heaviest arts post bag in the land - more than 700 letters a day, most of which would like a cheque by return. The in-tray has grown by 40 per cent in the last eighteen months, reflecting the financial crisis hitting arts organisations. Unfortunately most of BT's budget is tied up in long-term contracts, such as the National Touring Art Exhibition, organised by the South Bank to bring art to the regions, which mops up Pounds 1m over three years; Northern Ballet Theatre; and the biennial drama festival which finds fifty leading amateur theatrical companies simultaneously presenting a BT commissioned play, which this October is Peter Whelan's up-date of A Midsummer Night's Dream. But nothing lasts for ever and BT's five-year sponsorship of the New Contemporaries Tour, at Pounds 65,000 a year, is up for re-appraisal. This results in big media coverage (most of it unfavourable about the art on display) but small audiences, in contrast to the National Touring Exhibitions which are attracting steadily larger audiences but less publicity. There are exceptions: last month's display of Picasso prints at Leyhill Open Prison proved such a happy example of a sponsored media happening that it is to be repeated in another prison. BT avoids big splashy events in favour of grass roots arts involvement although it cares greatly about media coverage and value for money. It is now pumping Pounds 200,000 into amateur music under the umbrella of the National Federation of Music Societies, and its latest project is Voices for Hospices. On one evening in October 1994 thousands of singers throughout the country, in hundreds of separate locations, will sing Messiah, and hospices could benefit by up to Pounds 1m from box office revenues. BT is putting up Pounds 80,000 towards administration and publicity.                             *       *      * Computers and art are enjoying a creative love affair and IBM is doing its bit to bless the union. It asked print students at the Royal College of Art to come up with their impressions of the IBM AS/400 computer. For its Pounds 15,000 in prizes IBM took the copyright on more than thirty art works which will decorate IBM offices and be reproduced as gifts to key customers,as well as ideas that can be used to pep up advertising copy. It also allowed one computer to get a full artist's paint job, and is considering dressing up computers, not the most decorative of machines, with colour and design.                             *       *      * Being sponsored by a terminal is rather like being discovered in a handbag but Contact Theatre in Manchester and Tara Arts are happy to receive a Pounds 35,000 package from Manchester Airport T2, the T2 standing for Terminal Two. The airport is proving a loyal supporter of local arts and is not afraid to back the experimental. Most of the money goes towards a production of Troilus and Cressida which will open in September and then tour the world. Contact's audience is young people and Tara is the UK's leading Asian theatre company, attacking its first Shakespeare.                             *       *      * Whitbread's love affair with the Edinburgh Fringe intensifies. It is putting in more than Pounds 100,000 this year, with most going behind the Stella Artois brand, which keeps things humming in the Assembly Rooms. In addition, Stella is sponsoring a Comedy Festival which embraces the three main Fringe venues, the Assembly Rooms, the Pleasance, and the Gilded Balloon. Whitbread's Boddington brand will again be backing the Dream Tent in the Meadows, and the Supper Room is given over to Murphy's. One unusual feature of the deal is that if the artists booked to star at the three venues, and Whitbreads, fail to get the television coverage anticipated some of the sponsorship money will be withheld. Meanwhile the Edinburgh Festival proper has again achieved its sponsorship target and - again - it is a record sum, Pounds 805,000, and an important contribution to this year's budget of Pounds 4.3m. Scottish Power has shot ahead as the leading supporter with Pounds 68,000. The search is on for a broader base of backers rather than a reliance on Scottish financial institutions and other locals. Jaguar made its first big contribution by hosting a party at which potential 1994 sponsors were met for the first time and entertained.                             *       *      * Barclays Bank is to sponsor, with Pounds 50,000, the spring 1994 tour of English Touring Opera (formerly Opera 80), which is taking La Boheme and L'Elisir D'Amore to fifteen venues in England. The money will go towards expanding the chorus. Barclays has a tradition of sponsoring a touring arts company which gives it opportunities for local corporate hospitality. It previously supported London City Ballet.</p>

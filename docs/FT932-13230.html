			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Central banks rush to defence of peseta SIX central banks intervened on the foreign exchange markets yesterday to buy the Spanish peseta after the currency plunged against the D-Mark inside the European exchange rate mechanism. The Bank of Spain, and the central banks of Ireland, Denmark, Belgium, France and Germany, joined to support the Spanish currency after it fell through its central rate against the D-Mark for the first time since devaluing in November last year. However, neither two rounds of currency intervention nor a rise in the Bank of Spain's official interest rates, for the second day running, could prevent a sustained speculative attack on the currency, pushing it to a low of Pta74.05 against the D-Mark. The unsuccessful attempt to maintain the peseta above its central parity fuelled speculation that Spain might have to devalue it or to ask the EC monetary committee to sanction the temporary imposition of exchange controls. The Bank of Spain was clearly attempting to avoid either option yesterday. A devaluation would cripple the credibility of the Socialist government, which is seeking a fourth term in elections scheduled for June 6. The prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, last night insisted his government would maintain the peseta's value. The Bank of Spain kept its benchmark intervention rate unchanged at 13 per cent yesterday, turning Spain into an outsider amid the general cut in European interest rates that followed the Bundesbank's decision to ease its official rates on Thursday. The bank also raised overnight rates close to 16 per cent, having raised them from 13.35 to 14 per cent on Thursday. Yesterday's operations by Europe's central banks came at the end of a week which has seen the Bank of Spain consistently spending its reserves in support of the peseta. Dealers remain uncertain as to how much the Spanish authorities have spent in recent days. There were rumours yesterday that reserves had fallen by more than 50 per cent, coming down as low as Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.9bn), against a reserve volume quoted earlier this month of Dollars 45bn. Operators in the London foreign exchange market believed a devaluation of the peseta would not have a knock-on effect on the ERM as a whole. Mr Steve Hannah, a director of IBJ International, said: 'At this stage the market would not see a peseta devaluation as a reason for another attack on the ERM.' He believes the falls in French and Danish money market rates in recent weeks are a sign of growing confidence in the hard core of the system.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with former Defense Minister Tengiz Kitovani by </F> Armaz Saneblidze: "They're Spreading Rumors About Me; At Least  They Remember Me"; in Moscow, date not given]    [Text] We are lazy and curious--a maxim I read  somewhere.    I met Georgian member of parliament and former defense  minister Tengiz Kitovani in Moscow, in the Georgian embassy, at  a time when people in Tbilisi were saying the Interpol had  arrested him in Germany.    [Saneblidze] Where are you now, Batono Tengiz, and what are  you doing?    [Kitovani] You're probably asking because the city is full  of  rumors about me. Naturally you are interested; so many changes  are taking place that.... I was in Germany and flew to Moscow.  There is a lot to do, because here in Moscow there are major  forces working against us, both politically and economically. We  should have been doing this work earlier. If you remember my  speeches in Parliament, I have always said that if we lose our  connections and fail to restore our good old traditions with  Russia, we will suffer both economically and politically. I have  said this many times to Batoni Eduard, but reactionary circles  in Georgia have to some extent blocked Georgian-Russian  relations.    [Saneblidze] In some circles people are saying that  Georgia's  joining the Commonwealth is tantamount to returning to the  Russian Empire. If you had attended the 1 March session of  Parliament, would you have supported the ratification?    [Kitovani] I am one of those who signed the Declaration of  Georgian Independence. I went into the government from the  national movement, I always fought for freedom, and naturally I  would have abstained in every way. I wouldn't have voted for  either one.    We should have signed it earlier, on 3 September, when  Russia  wasn't even demanding that we join the CIS. By signing then, we  would have signified that we were an independent country signing  a treaty with a neighboring state.    The whole world is divided into spheres of influence.  Creating the CIS does not mean restoring the Soviet Union, it  means shaping that sphere of influence. We should have known  that Georgia did not and could not escape that sphere. Some big  state would have swallowed up our little country, and neither  the United States nor Europe had the kind of influence on Russia  to keep us a separate entity, an independent country. We should  have accepted our fate of remaining under Russia's influence.    The examples of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan should  teach  us something. And Uzbekistan thinks that Russia is the guarantor  of peace in Central Asia. Russia would not let Georgia go,  because of our geopolitical position. History confirms this.    [Saneblidze] If I understand you correctly, a Georgia  without  Russia is inconceivable, a fantasy, mere populism. People are  saying that you have met with one party leader who refuses to  think of Georgia as an independent country and believes that at  best Georgia should be a Russian gubernia. Did you really meet  Zhirinovskiy?    [Kitovani] I did in fact meet Zhirinovskiy. I got a call  from  some friends in the Urals, including Sergey Lvov (they are all  old dissidents), who know him well, and through them he and I  met one another in the Mir Hotel, where he has an office. We had  an interesting conversation. Incidentally, he showed me the  Georgia-Russia Treaty document, which he was against; he is  especially against Russia helping Georgia. He said, "I can't  support that treaty; you said you want to quit, so go, and  Russia isn't going to give you any help. Our party, and our  faction in the Duma, will oppose ratification of the treaty in  Parliament."    [Saneblidze] Did you meet him to try to persuade him to  support the treaty in the State Duma?    [Kitovani] Yes.    [Saneblidze] He's against it....    [Kitovani] Yes he is. We knew that, and that's why I met  with  him. He gave me a copy of his book "Posledniy brosok na yug"  [The Last Surge to the South], where he presents a precise  outline of his conception of dividing up the world. Everything  he writes there is nonsense, but there is a lot behind that  nonsense. Zhirinovskiy is not alone; his allies are the  politicians who are interested in carrying out their policies  and suppressing Georgia.    [Saneblidze] Do you mean Georgian politicians?    [Kitovani] Yes, Georgians, and, in particular, others as  well. He is backed by a rather well known gang of four. I won't  name names, because some neighboring countries may take offense,  countries which are fighting us, smiling to our face and digging  our grave behind our backs. They also include people who have  been financing him.    [Saneblidze] This move of yours--talking with Zhirinovskiy,  which, for understandable reasons, was not advertised (our  readers only recently found out)--was it by any decision of some  parliamentary commission, an assignment by the government, or  your personal initiative?    [Kitovani] You know, as a member of Parliament who is  concerned for our country's fate I probably have the most right  to look into such a situation. I am not one of those deputies  who care only about being a deputy. You are well aware that when  the nation's fate was in the balance, I alone decided my  nation's fate; I had no ally to stand by my side, and I am still  making my own decisions. Our embassy's working conditions are  difficult; they don't know what's going on here, there's no  intelligence effort going on. For example, they don't know what  orientation local political circles are taking. There is much we  should have known earlier, because it is here that the fate of  various countries--and perhaps the world--is being decided.  Since Georgia's fate is being decided here, we ought to have  taken more interest in Moscow.    [Saneblidze] Do you think that the parliament vice speaker  and the group of parliamentarians who came to meet with their  Russian colleagues should have done that earlier?    [Kitovani] Of course they should have started that earlier,  back when we were at the pinnacle and had the Abkhazian  situation won. We lost time, we were too late. Meanwhile, people  like Zhirinovskiy consolidated their position, as did Ardzinba,  and powerful intermediaries financed them. Not one of our  politicians gave thought to the idea that many things could take  a turn for the worse against us in Moscow. Water wears down the  stone drop by drop, you know. It was like that here, exactly.  While the war in Abkhazia went on for a year and two months,  they were doing their business here. They had the press in their  pocket, and they did a lot of work with the military people. We  used to work with the military ourselves, but after that--well,  you know what happened.    [Saneblidze] On the subject of Abkhazia, I have a question.  During the Sochi negotiations, at a very critical time, General  Grachev offered our side the use of Russia's military forces. We  refused. If you had been Defense Minister then, what decision  would you have made?    [Kitovani] You're referring to the 10 September meeting.  Both  Karkarashvili and the head of state made a big mistake. They  admit that themselves. They should have accepted Grachev's  offer. Abkhazia would still be ours today. Russian troop units  would have come in as a force to stop the fighting, after which  we should have started talks to regain the territory beyond the  Gumista and place it under our jurisdiction. Of course they  should have accepted it. I learned from certain sources that  right after the refusal, Grachev flew off and immediately gave  the order for the troops to return.    [Saneblidze] Let's get back to Zhirinovskiy. There have been  press reports of a split in Zhirinovskiy's party and his  parliamentary faction, reports of serious opposition to him. Did  you also meet with representatives of the opposition?    [Kitovani] Of course I did. The opposition members are my  friends. Very serious efforts are being made against him, and  cracks have appeared in his policies and in the faction; one  group has split off and is fighting him. My reason for staying  here is to enlist these forces to put Zhirinovskiy in the same  fix which he planned for us. The democrats here have not yet  consolidated their positions, but the future is theirs.    Another reason for my coming to Moscow was to implement the  proposal to create CIS countries' peace-keeping forces. These  countries' military coordination center represents virtually  nothing. Each country will have to create such troops. We have  experience of that kind in Georgia, for example when we and  Russia together created joint peace-keeping forces in Samachablo.    [Saneblidze] Such troops need to have the necessary weapons  and equipment; we probably should join the peace-keeping troops  with our own share of weapons. What did you all leave to the  Georgian army?    [Kitovani] War destroys and wrecks everything.... I'll tell  you what we left the army--112 tanks, for example. There were  200 tanks in all of Transcaucasia. Half of them were ours. Also  12 aircraft, about 30 helicopters, about 24,000 or 26,000  machine guns, and ammunition for more than six echelons. Over  100 million rounds have been fired. Georgia had a pretty  powerful mobile force then.    [Saneblidze] You said that war destroys everything, but has  it really destroyed so much that practically nothing is left?    [Kitovani] The Abkhazians received quite a lot of power, and  with the confrontation of these forces a lot of equipment was  burned on both sides. The ammunition which we had was supposed  to be enough for a 500-kilometer zone. With that potential, we  should have been able to win anywhere.    [Saneblidze] The Defense Ministry's archives have been  sealed. Do you think some criminal actions might come to light?    [Kitovani] That's ruled out, because during my time the  Defense Ministry carried out no criminal transactions. I didn't  take part in any financial transactions. It is not a Trade  Ministry, with something to buy or sell. During my time, for  example, not a single ruble was spent to purchase weapons.  Everything we had was either a gift or had been transferred to  us.    The Abkhazian War cost about 75 billion rubles, and the  things which I acquired for the Georgian Army--this is the  truth--add up to more than 100 billion dollars. Every rocket  that flies costs 7,000 dollars, so you can imagine how many  dollars were shot off into the sky. The three air facilities  which fell into the hands of the Abkhazians each cost 7 billion  dollars. The equipment and weapons that were transferred to us  were worth a total of 105 billion dollars.    [Saneblidze] Irakli Batiashvili, the former chairman of the  former Information and Intelligence Service, stated emphatically  in IVERIA-EKSPRESI that General Sufyan Bepbayev--that is, the  Transcaucasian Military District--had turned dilapidated tanks  over to you.    [Kitovani] There were no dilapidated tanks. When we  retreated  from Abkhazia, we moved over into Svanetia in order to avert a  civil war, bypassing Zugdidi. Those tanks were operating at an  elevation of 3,600 meters. If they had been dilapidated they  couldn't have gone that high. But equipment requires  maintenance, repairs, someone to take charge. Without  maintenance your own car would fall apart.    [Saneblidze] He also says that during the events of  December-January you were armed by the Transcaucasian Military  District, so that you could fight the Gamsakhurdia regime, and  that it was they who dictated the idea of the coup to you and  had you carry it out.    [Kitovani] I beg your pardon! We began to oppose  Gamsakhurdia  when he sided with the communist putsch in August 1991. On 19  August the Guard refused to obey the red putsch and the orders  of the president, who disbanded the Guard and took to the woods.  Everyone knows that the military people took the side of the  GKChP [the State Emergency Committee during the coup of August  1991], and why would they help us in the fight against their  ally Gamsakhurdia? Our only goal was to defend democracy, and  ultimately democracy won in Russia and we won in Georgia.    [Saneblidze] He also said that Russian soldiers were  fighting  in your ranks in December-January....    [Kitovani] No way. Name one Russian who died in that--but  the  fighting sure took the lives of a lot of Georgian boys! Do you  think bullets don't hit Russians? At that time we had quite a  lot of money, Russian troops were demoralized and were selling  off everything while we bought machine guns and ammunition.    [Saneblidze] You used to have good relations with the top  brass of the Russian Army. Is that what people have in mind when  they talk about arming you?    [Kitovani] You know, Grachev was with me before he became  Defense Minister, and we had good relations. Human contacts like  that are much more effective than official ones. When they gave  us that tank division, did they give one to any other country?  It was for my sake, for the sake of forming a new Defense  Ministry, that they officially gave us the 108 tanks of the  Akhaltsikhe Division.    It is also not the case that we looked fondly upon them.  They  borrowed certain ideas from us too. I was the first one in the  territory of the former Soviet Union to use cannons in the  center of a city, when we fired on Government House. And last  October, when the Russian Army was having trouble in the battle  against Rutskoy's and Khasbulatov's forces ensconced in the  White House, they said, Let's use Kitovani's method. And, you  recall, they fired on the White House and made them give in.    [Saneblidze] When are you coming back to Georgia?    [Kitovani] In a while. Right now I have to go to the Urals;  certain people are waiting for me there. Incidentally, the  situation is tense there. I'll go, look around, and meet with  workers and Cossacks who have requested a visit from me and with  whom I have good relations.    [Saneblidze] Your travelling and your stay in Moscow take a  lot of money. Is someone financing you?    [Kitovani] Of course. I have friends who are helping me  financially. It's a little depressing that rumors are being  spread about me in Tbilisi, but maybe it's a good thing; at  least they remember me.    P.S. Back in Tbilisi I called him in Moscow:    "People are saying that you met Dudayev, Shanibov,  Kobalia...."    "Why would I do that?! Nothing of the kind took place.  I had gone to Yekaterinburg and Chelyabinsk. I came to Moscow  yesterday, the 22nd. There was a television report here about my  unofficial visit."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by AERA editor Shunji Taoka: "No One Knew North </F> Korea Had Test-Launched a Missile"]    [Text] On 29 May 1993, North Korea test-fired a ballistic  missile called "Nodong-I" into the Sea of Japan off the Noto  Peninsula. For about a week, the Japanese Government was not  aware of it. It did not know about it until it was informed by  the United States.    A flurry of activity was created in the Defense Agency [DA]  when the government officially announced the news on 11 June.  It immediately analyzed a tape-recorded radio report, and it  confirmed the test-launch about three days later.    The government has long been informed by U.S. Forces sources  of imminent test-firings of North Korean missiles. However,  unlike the United States, which is constantly watching North  Korea, thanks to its spy satellites, Japan has no such ability  to gather information by itself. All it can do is make a guess  from information released by the U.S. Forces and from the  activities of U.S. reconnaissance planes.    After the test-launch, the United States explained that the  development of Nodong-II -- a larger missile with an estimated  range of 1,300 km -- was already under way, by showing a picture  taken by one of its spy satellites. With an estimated range of  1,000 km, the Nodong-I cannot hit Tokyo. However, all Japanese  territory, including Okinawa, comes within the range of 1,300 km.    At that time, the United States, which had abandoned the  Strategic Defense Initiative, had been asking Japan for  assistance in research and development for TMD (Theater Missile  Defense).    "Perhaps, the United States has intentionally estimated the  range of Nodong-II at 1,300 km as a way to induce Japan to  cooperate in the defense system by providing funds and  technology," a senior DA official said, with a sour smile.  However, as long as Japan has no materials that contradict the  U.S. intelligence report, it must accept what the United States  has said as true, for the moment.    In 1994, North Korea, an Asian country near Japan, will  become the focal point in international affairs, being the most  unstable region of the world.    Remaining isolated from the rest of the world, North Korea  is  now in a fix due to an oil shortage and food insufficiency.  Once something happens in this country, Japan will be seriously  affected. Despite this danger, Japan has no other way but to  rely on U.S. intelligence.  <H3>  The Cabinet Information Research Office Is a Small  Organization Occupying Eight Rooms </H3>   We cannot but conclude that it is quite natural for Japan to  depend on the United States, by simply seeing the structure of  Japanese intelligence services.    The Cabinet Information Research Office [CIRO], which is  often described in fictions as a secret counterintelligence  service similar to the CIA, is just an organization occupying  eight rooms on the sixth floor of the small building of the  Prime Minister's Office.    It has a regular staff of 84 people, including drivers, as  well as officials who have temporarily been transferred from  other ministries or agencies, such as the National Police Agency  and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA]. In addition to  this, 30 officials belonging to other ministries or agencies  also work for the CIRO. It has an annual budget of 1.835  billion yen, excluding personnel expenses but including  administrative expenditures and electronic data processing fees.    There is a vast difference between the CIRO and the CIA,  which has a staff of 22,000 people and an estimated budget of  some $4 billion (about 400 billion-odd yen), as if the Japanese  organization were a cat and the U.S. agency a tiger.    CIRO is divided into seven departments: General Affairs,  First Domestic, Second Domestic, First International, Second  International, Economic, and Archives Departments. The First  International Department covers each part of the world, while  the Second International Department analyzes the tone of foreign  opinion.    Some 40 officials are in charge of analyzing regional  information gathered from newspapers and magazines: two people  for North and South America, three for Russia, four for China,  three for North and South Korea, three for Europe, three for  Asia-Pacific, two for the Middle East and Africa, three for the  world military situation, and 13 for the world economic  situation.    CIRO can get information from other ministries or agencies,  thanks to its staff members who originally belong to them. A  total of 11 organizations are under contract with CIRO to gather  and provide information. Some of the organizations are: the two  Japanese news agencies, KYODO NEWS SERVICE and JIJI PRESS; the  Research Institute of World Politics and Economics, which is  strong in North Korean affairs; the Southeast Asia Research  Institute; the Institute for the Study of Democracy; and  RADIOPRESS. However, what CIRO calls foreign information is  still a translation or a summary of general news reports.    Having only two staff members covering the entire American  continent, it is hardly thinkable that CIRO is capable of making  proper information analysis.    "At this time, no one can replace one of our experts who  is going to retire from office. Information-analysis ability  cannot be acquired immediately. The biggest problem for us is  how to secure talented men," said CIRO chief Yoshio Omori.    Meanwhile, MOFA has set 1990 as the beginning of a new era  in  Japanese diplomatic history, because of the end of the Cold War  following the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989. MOFA, which  had always adopted diplomacy in line with U.S. foreign policy,  has begun to take an independent diplomatic attitude in some  aspects.  <H5>  MOFA Establishes the Intelligence and Analysis Bureau </H5>   In August 1993, MOFA established the Foreign Policy Bureau.  At the same time, it reorganized the Information Analysis,  Research, and Planning Bureau to create the Intelligence and  Analysis Bureau. This reorganization shows the ministry's  willingness to become more independent.    Until now, the Information Analysis, Research, and Planning  Bureau had only two divisions: the Policy Planning Division, in  charge of general affairs; and the Analysis Division,  specializing in the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea. Under  the protection of the U.S. umbrella, the Information Analysis,  Research, and Planning Bureau had kept its eyes fixed on the  communist world. This bureau was the symbol of Japanese  diplomacy during the Cold War era.    Following the reorganization aimed at covering all parts of  the world, the Analysis Division was divided in two: the First  Analysis Division, covering the United States, Europe, and the  former Soviet Union; and the Second Analysis Division, dealing  with Asia, the Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa.    However, out of a total staff of 56 men employed by the  Intelligence and Analysis Bureau, only 22-23 work as analysts at  the First and Second Analysis Divisions.    Their information sources are Japanese embassies and  consulates. Japanese diplomats themselves receive information  from U.S. Embassies. They also have a strong tendency to rely  on judgments made by U.S. Embassies.    "It seems that in each country, the U.S. Embassy receives  information from the CIA. Moreover, U.S. Embassy officials can  easily make inroads into the other country's information  sources, because the United States is a superpower. Their  information is incomparably in-depth. Therefore, we cannot but  refer to the U.S. Embassy's viewpoint," a MOFA division chief  said.    The U.S. State Department Bureau of Intelligence and  Research  has a total staff of some 350 people, and it has access to  information gathered by other huge intelligence services.    A former MOFA information officer even said frankly:  "Information released by the U.S. State Department is the most  accurate, while information provided by Japanese private  citizens is of low reliability."    However, foreign countries release information to Japan only  when it is in line with their national policy or when it does  not act against their national policy.    In his farewell speech, George Washington warned people by  saying: "Nothing is worse than relying on the simple goodwill  of a nation toward another nation."  <H5>  More Than 1,300 Officials Work for the DA "Chobetsu" </H5>   The DA is capable of gathering information by itself. In  particular, the Ground Staff Office Intelligence Department  Special Division has an independent information-gathering  ability. This division, which goes by the name of "Chobetsu,"  has a total staff of 1,370 men. It has six radio monitoring  stations in various parts of Japan. It has mainly been  monitoring the exchange of radio messages by Russia, China, and  North Korea. Even if it cannot decode their messages, it can  grasp the variation in communications volume and the change in  the location of the sending stations, which are substantial  materials for judgment.    Sophisticated codes cannot be used, in particular, in the  case of radio communications from aircraft. This is why the  Special Division knew that North Korean pilots have only been  practicing takeoffs and landings because of a shortage of fuel.    In Wakkanai [in the northernmost part of Hokkaido], the Air  Self-Defense Force has an ELINT station, or electronic  intelligence station, to monitor radar beams from Russian Air  Force planes. It is also monitoring the exchange of messages.  It is able to identify the types of airplanes from the  frequency and type of radar beam. The ELINT station gained a  worldwide reputation in September 1983 when a Korean Airline  jetliner was shot down over Sakhalin.    A total of 38 defense attaches have been sent to Japanese  embassies in 30 countries. The military preparedness of each  country is grasped by them. However, in any country, it is a  habit with military authorities to emphasize the threat posed by  foreign troops, and to remain vague about their weakness, even  if they are aware of it. This is a way to secure a military  budget and recruit military personnel. For instance, in 1993,  the Japanese Defense White Paper wrote: "Modernization of the  Chinese defense forces is expected to be promoted gradually."  This is an expression invented by Japanese experts who are  fully aware that, far from increasing armaments, China can  hardly modernize them.  <H3>  The Public Security Investigation Agency Turns Its Eyes to  Foreign Information </H3>   The Public Security Investigation Agency [PSIA] has a  regular  staff of 1,798 men and an annual budget of 17.1 billion yen.  Until now, it has been devoted entirely to gathering domestic  information, with the Japan Communist Party as a target of  investigation. As the communization of Japan has become almost  unthinkable following the Soviet Union's collapse, some  government officials and conservative politicians are now  saying: "It will serve the best interests of the nation if we  abolish or scale down the PSIA and if we assign its personnel to  the task of gathering and analyzing overseas information."    The PSIA was renowned for its amazing secrecy. For instance,  its officials used to never give their namecards to others, even  to senior officials of other ministries or agencies.    However, as it is now facing the question of life or death,  the PSIA is directing its energies to publicity activities.    With a total staff of 149 men, the First Investigation  Department is divided into four divisions and one office: two  divisions covering the Japan Communist Party and the other two  dealing with radical extremists. With a staff of 118 men, the  Second Investigation Department is divided into three divisions  and one office: the First Division covering Russia, the Second  Division covering North Korea, the Third Division dealing with  rightist organizations, and the International Information Office  handling information on terrorism in foreign countries.    "In 1991, we provided 6,806 items of information to the  government: 3,670 items were related to international matters,  including 528 items covering North Korea; 1,744 items were  related to the Japan Communist Party; 928 items were on  radicals; and 454 items were on rightists. You see, the amount  of overseas information is now exceeding that of domestic  information," said Deputy Director General Makoto Matsuura. He  stressed his agency's international aspect by giving detailed  figures. Six agency officials are currently working at Japanese  diplomatic and consular offices in foreign countries. Several  others have been sent abroad for study.    "We should be able to make an objective analysis, because  unlike other ministries or agencies, our agency is not bound so  much to its own interests," Matsuura said. However, we just  wonder whether its officials, whose exclusive duty was to keep  an eye on the leftist factions, will be able to make an  objective analysis and forecast with no ideological bias. It  will not be so easy for the PSIA to become an international  intelligence service, if we consider that there will not be many  officials proficient in foreign languages and well informed of  the national affairs of countries outside the communist bloc.  <H3>  The Prime Minister Sometimes Receives Information Gathered  by the Japan External Trade Organization </H3>   The National Police Agency and each prefectural police  office  have a foreign affairs division in charge of counterespionage.  Each foreign affairs division is also gathering foreign  information inside Japan, but the number of police officers  involved is still kept secret.    The Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), which is  under  the jurisdiction of the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI], has 78 overseas offices in 57 countries. A  total of 301 officials are stationed abroad. They gather  economic information, while making efforts to increase Japan's  purchases of foreign products.    Their reports are all based on open information and  interviews. They are able to get deep information, because they  have close relations with Japanese-affiliated companies.  Sometimes such information is directly given to the prime  minister through MITI. As a matter of course, the JETRO does not  direct its attention to political and military matters that  might shake the economy from the bottom up.    During the Cold War era, Japan was part of a fleet, with the  United States as the flagship. She always followed exactly the  same course taken by the flagship. Although she had neither a  chief navigator nor a weatherman, she could somehow navigate by  looking to signals from the flagship.    In the past, Japan has been concentrating its energies on  domestic affairs and economic issues. This history is reflected  pointedly in the characteristics of Japanese intelligence  services: they are strong in internal security information as  well as economic information, while they remain weak in  international information, especially in information related to  noncommunist countries.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Guenter Schmidt from Brussels] </F>   [Text] Chancellor Franz Vranitzky is currently in Brussels,  where he has met with EU Commission President Jacques Delors and  other Commission members. They agreed that the EU summit in  Corfu should discuss the railroad line through the Brenner Pass.  According to Jacques Delors, the project stands a good chance  of being financed by the EU. Following the talks, Vranitzky met  the international press. He declined to answer questions about  Austria's ideas on the next institutional reform, or who should  succeed Jacques Delors as Commission president. He said he  would not comment on such matters before Austria was a member.    Other questions focused on Austria's security policy  concept.  Vranitzky said Austria had expressed its interest in helping set  up a European security system. Asked about the country's  possible membership of the Western European Union, the WEU, or  its participation in the Partnership for Peace program,  Vranitzky said that these were not urgent problems.    Regarding the WEU, Austria did not rule out a role as an  observer, the chancellor said. Time was not pressing, because  the 12 EU member states themselves still held differing views on  the future of the WEU, which, according to the Maastricht  Treaties, will become the WEU's defense arm.    Regarding Partnership for Peace with NATO, for which most  Eastern European countries and recently also Sweden and Finland  have opted, Chancellor Vranitzky said that Austria would closely  examine the matter in the second half of this year. Such an  examination could be made without any hurry; after all, Austria  has concluded similar peace-preserving agreements with its  Eastern European neighbors. Neutrality was no obstacle to such  partnership, because it was not a military alliance, the  chancellor said.</p>

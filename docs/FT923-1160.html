			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Britannia deficit up to Pounds 155,000 A reduced contribution from its construction activities led Britannia Group to report an increased deficit in the six months to June 30 and to pass its interim dividend. The Cheltenham-based construction and housing company saw turnover jump from Pounds 9.17m to Pounds 15.8m partly reflecting the sale of an industrial park and improved housing sales. Net interest charges, however, rose to Pounds 211,000 (Pounds 134,000) and the pre-tax deficit increased from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 155,000. Mr Chris Powell, chairman, said: 'Market conditions are extremely difficult with both margins and volumes being heavily squeezed . . . we believe that it would be foolish to chase construction turnover and forgo profits.' He was more encouraging on prospects for the housing side, particularly in the medium and long term. 'The dramatic events of recent days have, we believe, improved the prospects for a housing recovery,' he stated. The company sold 38 units from five sites in the first half of the year; from July 1 to date another 26 have been sold. Losses per share were 0.9p. The interim dividend is omitted (1p) as was last year's final.</p>

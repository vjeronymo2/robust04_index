			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Nafta Countdown: Mexico enjoys few alternatives MEXICO'S plan to expand trading relations with Europe, Latin America and Asia if the North American Free Trade Agreement is rejected by the US Congress today faces the problem that many non-Americans are less likely to invest in Mexico without it. In an effort to lessen its dependence on the Nafta, Mexico has already signed a free trade agreement with Chile, and plans to sign new accords with Venezuela and Colombia by the end of this year. The government hopes to become a full member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development by next spring, and is actively looking for bilateral investment agreements with Europe and Asia. Its threat to diversify trade away from the US has been used by President Bill Clinton as an argument in favour of signing Nafta. If Nafta was rejected, he said, Mexico might sign trade agreements with Japan or the European Union. 'That could change the purchasing habits of 90m Mexicans and hundreds of millions of people in Latin America,' he warned. However officials in Mexico City from the European Union and Japan say there is no interest in signing a special trade agreement with Mexico. Such an accord would be contrary to their policies of seeking multilateral trade agreements and would upset strategically more important countries, they say. Even if there were such agreements, the economic effect would be slight, given the small role their countries play in Mexico's economy, the officials say. 'Mexico has 70 per cent of its trade with the US, and will never have that with Europe and Japan,' says Mr Jacques Lecomte, the representative of the EU in Mexico City. From 1989 to August this year Mexico received more than 65 per cent of its foreign investment from the US, 18.7 per cent from the EU and 2.2 per cent from Japan. And the proportion of new investment from the US is growing. Businessmen and diplomats from the EC and Japan say a rejection of Nafta would probably have a negative impact on their trade and investment with Mexico. While Nafta discriminates against European and Asian companies in investment rules and tariffs, the treaty gives Mexico guaranteed access to the US market, and would increase growth, making the country more attractive to outside investors. 'Without the treaty in place it will be difficult to continue investing in Mexico,' says Mr Ryuhei Kato, the head of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Mexico City. 'It will change the whole perspective of the Japanese presence in Mexico.' Mr Masasumi Yamamoto, Japan's commercial attache in Mexico City concurs. 'Some Japanese companies are considering investing in Mexico to export to the US. In this sense the failure of Nafta would lessen interest in the country and affect investment negatively,' he says.</p>

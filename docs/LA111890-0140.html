			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE SCHOOL A MUST ON THE EDUCATORS' TOUR;  </P> <P> LEARNING: THE INNOVATIVE PROGRAM IS BEING DESCRIBED AS THE FRONT-RUNNER IN THE  EVOLUTION OF JUNIOR HIGHS.  </P> <P> It was a scene not unusual in Southern California: a tour bus unloading  sightseers from towns such as Cumberland, R.I., and Eau Claire, Wis.  </P> <P> But unlike most tourists, this group of 23 teachers and school administrators  was more interested in math lessons than movie stars. To heck with Hollywood.  They came to see heterogeneous grouping.  </P> <P> Northridge Junior High School was the main attraction Friday on a special tour  by members of the National Middle School Assn., in town last week for their  annual convention. Although the association scheduled visits to five other city  schools, Northridge is considered the shining star in the Los Angeles Unified  School District, far ahead of others locally in what education experts are  describing as the evolution of junior high.  </P> <P> Ten minutes into the tour it was clear that for most, junior high school was  never like this:  </P> <P> At Northridge there are no lockers. The 1,000 students enrolled at the school,  80% of whom are minority, get to pick at least two non-graded classes each  semester. Every week teachers counsel youngsters on matters from romance to  study habits. Smart kids and average kids sit side by side in just about every  classroom. Attendance is up, discipline problems are down and, on this day at  least, everybody is smiling, braces and all.  </P> <P> "The most important measure is the smile level," Principal Beryl Ward said. "Do  the teachers feel like they are respected and valued? Are they excited about  what they are doing? Are the kids happy to be here? Are they having a good  time?"  </P> <P> So far, so good, say faculty, students and district officials. Beginning this  fall, after some years of planning, Northridge started its middle school plan.  It is supposed to combine for the school's sixth- through eighth-grade students  the personal nurturing of elementary school with the academic choices of high  school.  </P> <P> "Junior high schools have been modeled after high schools, a structure designed  for 15- to 20-year-olds," said John Liechty, the district administrator in  charge of planning changes in the way junior high schools operate in Los  Angeles. "We need to restructure them for the needs of 10- to 15-year-olds. At  Northridge, I believe they are hitting on something that will make a dramatic  difference for those students."  </P> <P> The methods being tried at Northridge derive from studies of junior high  schools by the Carnegie Foundation and the state Department of Education, and  from others released in the past decade. Educators, especially in urban areas  such as Los Angeles, agree that problems such as high dropout rates and low  college eligibility are traceable to junior high school troubles.  </P> <P> "Students between 10 and 15 are social, emotional, physical and academic  beings," said John H. Lounsvury, publications editor of the National Middle  School Assn., a nonprofit research group that includes teachers, administrators  and academicians.  </P> <P> "Typically, high schools ignore, for example, their social interests," said  Lounsvury, a retired professor of education at Georgia College. "While school  is not a party, you have to make sure they are having a good time, remembering  that they are not children who will always do as they are told and not adults  who will operate independently."  </P> <P> Part of the fun at Northridge comes during seventh period on Mondays and  Fridays. That is when students have one of nearly 50 non-graded courses such as  knitting, ceramics, calligraphy and basketball. Students sign up every 10 weeks  for the classes, which are taught by teachers also responsible for recruiting  their enrollees.  </P> <P> "I jumped at the chance to teach sewing," longtime English teacher Walt Uchiek  said. "It's a great stress reliever."  </P> <P> One of his students, Carlos Basulto, 11, said it has been fun so far learning  how to use the school's sewing machines, which until this year had been stored  unused for nearly a decade. "I've made some cushions and pillows," Basulto, a  sixth-grade student, said.  </P> <P> Educators say students of junior high school age should be encouraged to try  different courses before high school, when college entrance requirements leave  little time for photography, music, poetry or crafts.  </P> <P> "Schools need to accommodate their growing curiosity and ability to experiment  before the hardball starts in high school," Lounsvury said.  </P> <P> Across campus, another group of sixth-graders is studying math and the metric  system by competing in games that require them to estimate the weight of  marbles, the distance between the stage of the school auditorium and the back  row, and the number of square centimeters in their own footprints. Watching  over the group are math, social studies and English teachers who form one of  the school's teaching teams, responsible for a group of about 120 students.  </P> <P> "By getting their hands on it, they can actually see math," math teacher Grace  Hutchings said. "I want them to be able to not only do the work on paper but to  eyeball distance and make estimations."  </P> <P> In accord with the team method at Northridge, Hutchings will help her  colleagues with their lessons later in the semester. Elsewhere at the school,  history teachers will teach about the Civil War while English teachers on the  same team will have students read the Gettysburg Address.  </P> <P> During seventh period on Wednesdays, students go to classes where they are  expected to do no more than make friends with each other and the teacher. The  purpose is for teachers to become acquainted with students who are not hustling  for a grade, but who may want advice on matters important to them, school  officials said.  </P> <P> "The students learn to set goals, as well as self-esteem building techniques  and conflict resolution," said Susie Shapiro, a Northridge coordinator and  teacher. "Teachers learn to be advocates for the students."  </P> <P> Students are also learning from each other, officials said. In what is known as  heterogeneous grouping, students are no longer divided according to ability,  which tended to keep gifted children away from average children. Instead,  students are mixed randomly by computer in all of the academic courses. The  idea is that bright children are not hurt by sharing courses with slower  students and slower students are helped a lot by having brighter students in  their classes, educators said.  </P> <P> School officials say discipline problems have declined this year. Most school  suspensions have been eliminated, replaced by so-called in-house suspensions,  in which a student is disciplined by being kept away from other students in a  room supervised by a campus employee.  </P> <P> The benefit of the practice is that most students hate it, and the school does  not lose any income from the state, which pays the schools based on daily  attendance, school officials said.  </P> <P> School officials eliminated the use of lockers, which in cities such as Los  Angeles have become repositories for guns and drugs. Students do not seem to  mind the change because they do not have to lug any books at all. The school  issues students a set of books for the classroom and a second for the home.  </P> <P> All these programs are extra work for teachers without extra pay. One benefit  of the new program for teachers, however, is an extra 80 minutes a week for  team planning sessions. Some of the teachers said they do not mind the extra  work because they believe it will translate into better achievement by  students.  </P> <P> Physical education teacher Marilyn Hayes said most are enthusiastic about the  new program because it was designed and carried out mostly by teachers. The  innovations being tried at Northridge come as schools districtwide are asked to  share greater and greater decision-making powers with teachers and parents.  </P> <P> It is ironic that Northridge made the most sweeping changes of any junior high  school in the district under past school district rules, which gave most power  to school principals, rather than under the district's shared decision making  councils.  </P> <P> Hayes and other teachers say it is because the principal has allowed them to  try new ideas. Principal Ward says innovation is good as long as everyone keeps  in mind the goal of providing better education for students.  </P> <P> "Teachers want to be the captains of their own ship, but I remind them they are  sailing with the fleet," Ward said.  </P> <P> After seeing Northridge, visitor Bob Wallace, a Cumberland, R.I., principal,  said, "This is a shot in the arm for me personally and a motivator."  </P></p>

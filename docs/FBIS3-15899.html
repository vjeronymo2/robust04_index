Gayane Arustamyan, Press-Secretary of the Nagorno-Karabakh  Supreme Soviet, told SNARK Azerbaijan is always violating the  international conventions demonstrating inhuman attitude to the  POW and hostages.    Ms. Arustamyan mentions the facts of non-extraditions of  bodies of those Armenians who were killed in prisons of  Azerbaijan, bringing as an example the case of Hrachik  Petrosyan, born in 1954, died as a result of tortures on January  5, 1994, in Baku.    The Azerbaijani authorities, underlines Ms. Arustamyan,  prevent the representatives of International Red Cross to get  acquainted with the conditions the POW and hostages live in. In  connection with it the international control should be organized  to keep strictly the rights of the POW and hostages.</p>

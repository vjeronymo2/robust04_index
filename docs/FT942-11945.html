			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / The Emerging Investor: Captivation with China by proxy Does the downward correction in Asian markets during the first quarter mean a hasty end to foreign investors' enthusiasm for them? Almost certainly not. Most economies are still set fair for such substantial growth that it will be hard to ignore them. The Asian Development Bank, which begins its annual meeting in Nice today, predicts 7 per cent growth rates for developing Asia this year and next. The region's expansion appears to some extent self-fuelling. Mr Satish Jha, the ADB's chief economist, says Asia has become 'its own most important and rapidly expanding market'. The intra-Asian share of Asian exports rose from 37 per cent in 1986 to 47 per cent in 1991, with the proportions for imports rising from 48 per cent to 55 per cent respectively. Speaking to a Financial Times conference on Asian capital markets in London last week, Mr Jha cautioned however that Asia's self-sufficiency should not be over-stated. A considerable amount of intra - regional trade was within individual industries - for example, a Japanese company shipping parts for assembly to a subsidiary in south-east Asia. Many 'exported' goods were destined ultimately for sale in the west, so 'Asian countries may be more dependent on markets outside the region than the trade data indicate'. Nevertheless, the 'flying geese' sequence of complementarity between Asian economies, with richer countries shifting manufacturing capacity to poorer ones, still has some way to run. Each rapidly growing country has a growing middle class with rising expectations as consumers. And most have huge domestic savings yet to be mobilised. Add to that the growth which could be released by further liberalisation in China, India, and even relatively advanced countries such as South Korea and Taiwan, still beset by bureaucratic control. Mr Edward Kim, general manager for international finance of Korea Development Securities in Seoul, told the FT conference the reforms of President Kim Young-sam - provided they overcome entrenched opposition from the Korean establishment - will put pressure on local companies to operate more efficiently, causing consolidation through mergers. But they will significantly reduce the government's control over the private sector and will foster economic prosperity. Given these prospects for Asia, there will be plenty of value to seek in stock markets, even though portfolio weightings have been re-adjusted in favour of the industrialised world. The question is not whether to invest, but how and where to find good value. Most Asian markets showed big rises last year, but in terms of cash invested it was largely a China boom. According to the US Securities Industry Association, net US purchases of Asian stocks doubled in 1993 to Dollars 17bn. Of this, Dollars 6.1bn was in Japan and an astonishing Dollars 6.2bn in Hong Kong, with Dollars 1.3bn in Korea. This left only Dollars 3.4bn for all other Asian markets combined. The figures underline US investors' sudden captivation with China and their use of Hong Kong as its proxy. The SIA figures are also, however, a reminder of the relative small size of other markets - and thus of their potential, given the right conditions, for growth. Mr Hugh Peyman, Singapore-based managing director of Kleinwort Benson Research (Asia), summed up those conditions as transparency and efficiency of markets, regulators who sought to develop rather than inhibit markets, good flow of information, and new listings. There are still a number of newer markets which remain immature and illiquid, and some which are so mature that adapting to the new world is difficult. Mr Robert Lloyd George, chairman of Lloyd George Management, a Hong Kong-based fund manager, said for example that investors had difficulties in trading stock during the recent shake-outs in the Philippines and Indonesia. India presents the biggest problems, despite which it is currently the pet of many fund managers who salivate over its 6,000 listed stocks and huge domestic investor base. Mr Lloyd George, who saw India as 'the emerging market of 1994,' nevertheless listed the headaches as inefficient custodian banks, over-long settlement periods, slow registration of shares, and a requirement for a capital gains tax audit before repatriation of funds. Leaving aside these problems, how do you select stocks? Even though there is now a wealth of research material on Asian companies, the biggest need is still for information. Disclosure requirements of many exchanges are far from stringent. There is plenty of insider dealing, even in relatively advanced countries. Most difficult of all, investors may not be confident that, even with a set of accounts which looks completely intelligible, they really have a handle on a company's operations. This is because of the opaque nature of many Asian businesses, particularly the largest conglomerates. Investors will naturally tend to look for the Asian companies which are the global forces of the future. There is a growing list of candidates. Mr Mark Mobius, Hong-based director of Templeton Investment Management, divided Asian multi-nationals into two basic types: the Japanese/Korean model, and the Chinese. Among characteristics he noted of Korean chaebol are authoritarian management styles, emphasis on size rather than profitability, and consequently - since all are competing to be big - a tendency towards over-capacity and price wars. Conglomerates run by ethnic Chinese in both 'greater China' and south-east Asia are perhaps more difficult for the investor to fathom. Many are using the fruits of success to diversify into unfamiliar businesses and territory. They tend to have both listed and unlisted arms, which tend to do a lot of business with each other. Control is often in the hands of one man, which may lead to a group making some risky bets. Companies are inscrutable to investors because 'too often the only person who knows how money is moving around the multitude of companies is the patriarch,' Mr Mobius said. But such companies can hardly be ignored. In Indonesia, for example, Mr Mobius noted that the Salim Group run by Mr Liem Sioe Liong is estimated to account for 5 per cent of the economy. For a man with Dollars 5bn under management, Mr Mobius was refreshingly candid, even resigned, about the risks. It was difficult not to be tempted to fund expansion of companies which had already been successful.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Friday  Week on week change Stock                       Country     close     Dollars   percent  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Usinimas (Pfd)               Brazil     0.0010    0.0002    33.10 Companhia Cervejaria (Pfd)   Brazil     0.2303    0.0500    27.69 Telebras                     Brazil     0.0276    0.0058    26.71 Tolmex                       Mexico    12.2477    2.5655    26.50 Grupo Finaciero Banamex (C)  Mexico     6.7278    1.3937    26.13 Grupo Finaciero Banamex (B)  Mexico     6.0612    1.2498    25.98 Telebras (Pfd)               Brazil     0.0356    0.0073    25.72 Grupo Carso                  Mexico    10.0153    1.9369    23.98 Banco Galicia             Argentina     8.0532    1.5545    23.92 Madeco                        Chile     2.9560    0.5633    23.54  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> E. GERMANY READY TO TALK ABOUT FREE ELECTIONS  </P> <P> East Germany's ruling Politburo on Wednesday proposed talks with opposition  elements about free elections, saying such negotiations could deal with the  organization of elections in which the party could be voted out of power.  </P> <P> The Politburo also said it is willing to discuss changes to the 1949  constitution, which enshrines the Communist Party's position as the major  political force in the nation. Members did not propose a specific date for the  talks, nor did they indicate which groups they were willing to bring into  discussions.  </P> <P> In addition to the Communist Party, with more than 2 million members, there are  four smaller political parties in East Germany. In the past, they had been  considered mere satellites of the Communists, but since the recent political  upheaval began they have been showing startling independence.  </P> <P> But other non-party opposition groups have sprung up recently, notably New  Forum, which now claims 200,000 followers.  </P> <P> According to the official news agency ADN, "The Politburo has proposed that the  political parties united in the coalition government should convene a round  table with other political forces."  </P> <P> The proposal in many ways resembles similar ones in Poland and Hungary, which  resulted in the ouster of the Communist Party as the sole political force.  </P> <P> Manfred Gerlach, leader of the small Liberal Democratic Party, told a news  conference Wednesday that his party is drafting an electoral law ensuring free  elections at all levels, including the national Parliament. He said the new law  should be put to a referendum, with the actual elections held late next year or  early in 1991.  </P> <P> East German leader Egon Krenz, who also heads the Communist Party, earlier had  spoken of a dialogue with opposition groups, but he had not gone as far as  offering formal negotiations, which was implicit in the Politburo announcement  Wednesday.  </P> <P> In an interview with Moscow News on Wednesday, Krenz was quoted as suggesting  that some of the ousted Communist Party leaders should be held to account for  their abuses of power.  </P> <P> "As far as the complicated processes taking place in this country are  concerned," Krenz said, "neither workers nor peasants nor civil servants are  guilty. The responsibility for everything has been taken by the party --  specifically, by those who retired from the Politburo and the government. I  advocate bringing to account those who are really guilty of the situation that  has arisen."  </P> <P> At the same time, a Defense Ministry announcement said East Germany will do  away with military parades that were characterized by goose-stepping soldiers.  </P> <P> "Parades for self-glorification are not necessary," Defense Minister Theodor  Hoffmann said.  </P> <P> Hoffmann said he planned to restructure the 172,000-member armed forces,  reducing the number of border guards.  </P></p>

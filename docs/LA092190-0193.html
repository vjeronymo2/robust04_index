			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IT'S LEONA'S TURN IN PLAYBOY -- DONALD IS A 'SKUNK'  </P> <P> Millionaire hotelier Leona Helmsley and real estate magnate Donald Trump are  having a war of words through Playboy magazine.  </P> <P> In an interview in Playboy's March issue, Trump called Helmsley, convicted of  tax fraud, "a disgrace to humanity" and a "vicious, horrible woman."  </P> <P> Helmsley had her say in an interview in the November issue, calling Trump "a  sick, sick, sick, sick boy" and a liar.  </P> <P> For example, Helmsley said Trump actually paid $78 million, not the $30 million  he claimed, for the St. Moritz Hotel in New York.  </P> <P> "The nerve of this S.O.B., the skunk," she said in excerpts of the interview  released Thursday. "I wouldn't believe Donald Trump if his tongue was  notarized."  </P> <P> Sentenced to four years in prison and fined $7.1 million, Helmsley is free on  $25 million bail pending her appeal.  </P></p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Baer Holding doubles income Baer Holding, the Zurich-based banking group, has reported consolidated net income for 1993 of SFr147m (Dollars 100m), more than double the SFr68m earned in 1992. Baer, which specialises in managing funds for institutions and wealthy individuals, said all areas of its business contributed to the 47 per cent rise in operating income to SFr628m, but income from trading was especially buoyant. Provisions for depreciation and bad loans were raised 54 per cent to SFr77m, leaving pre-tax profit of SFr206m, more than three times the SFr87m earned in 1992. Baer said its consolidated total assets stood at SFr7.7bn at the year-end, 23 per cent higher than at the end of 1992. Shareholders' equity jumped 36 per cent to SFr919m. Client assets entrusted to the Baer group, excluding those for which only global custody service was provided, were up 36 per cent to SFr45bn. Net assets of Baer investment funds soared 74 per cent to SFr5.4bn. The directors are recommending a 20 per cent rise in dividends on the bearer and registered shares plus a subscription right or option worth about twice the value of the dividends.</p>

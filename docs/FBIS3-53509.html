Dr. Najibollah Lefrai, state minister in  foreign affairs, told a Bakhtar Information Agency that an  Afghan special envoy, who has recently gone to Pakistan, has  delivered a message from the Afghan president to Pakistan's  president at a meeting. They talked about a permanent peace and  explained our principled stand.    Dr. Lefrai said the position taken by Afghanistan has not  changed. The conspirators should surrender their heavy weapons.  The Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] lead by  Golboddin Hekmatyar should give guarantees of no more war  against the state.</p>

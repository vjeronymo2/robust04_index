He said: The publication and distribution of Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping is a major event in  the political life of all party members and all nationalities of  people in the country. This book touches upon all the fields of  politics, economy, science, culture, education, military  affairs, and foreign affairs, and outlines the basic viewpoints  of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. A red thread running through this book  is the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking  truth from facts. This is precisely the quintessence and soul  of our theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. At present, grasping ideological line and  answering practical questions is a key issue that should be  truly grasped by cadres and the masses of all nationalities in  the region in studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping.    Comrade Wang Qun pointed out: Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping has expounded an important viewpoint  in the first place, that is, China must take its own way in  developing itself and must build a socialism with its own  characteristics. This simple and clear exposition has grasped  the essence of the development road of Chinese socialism. This  book has an extremely far-reaching significance in theory and  practice, has straighten out the tendency of deviating from  reality in the road of building and developing socialism, has  answered the doubts, misgivings, and censures from both of the  "left" and right fields, and has opened up the sole correct road  for our socialist modernization drive.    Comrade Wang Qun said: When stressing on "taking our own  road," we should on no account reject opening up. On the  contrary, we should all the more strengthen opening up and use  as reference and absorb all excellent scientific and cultural  achievements in the world. Without opening up, we cannot  achieve success in "taking our own road" and in building the  socialism with Chinese characteristics. When stressing on  "taking our own road," the only correct method is to "boldly try  everything and go ahead" to open up the new road of our own in  the places without roads.    He stressed: Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed the necessity of  "upholding the party's basic line without wavering for 100  years." It is the most important "political assignment" given  by Comrade Xiaoping to all comrades of the party and will be the  most important issue of practice our party and country will face  in the next scores of years. Only by constantly and  unswervingly upholding this basic line can we firmly grasp the  correct course and can we cope with a myriad changes by  remaining unchanged.    Upholding the party's basic line without wavering for 100  years is not only a correct conclusion discovered by our party  from the bitter historical experience but also the summary of  the experiences gained by our country from the tremendous  achievements in reform and opening up over the past 15 years.  It is internally related with our strategic goal of marching  forward in three steps and is an important guarantee for the  success in all items of our work.    Comrade Wang Qun pointed out in line with the reality of  the region: In the system of the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, the issue of development is a  major proposition being on the central position. The key issue  of the party's basic line is precisely the issue of economic  development and the key issue of the nationalities work is also  the issue of development. Therefore, a major issue facing the  people of all nationalities in the region is to seize the  opportunity and accelerate development. It is not only an  economic issue but also a political issue. Over the past 40  years or so since the founding of Inner Mongolia, particularly  since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central  Committee, the economy and society have developed very rapidly,  achievements have been tremendous, a new situation characterized  with developed economy, flourishing culture and harmonious  relationship among different nationalities has emerged, and,  what is more gratifying, a road of developing the economy and  society has been found gradually. It should be noted, however,  that we still lag behind some developed coastal areas, and we  cannot expect to catch up with developed areas in a short period  of time. However, we have the aspirations of exploiting our own  advantages through reform and opening up and through the arduous  struggle of all people, and have the aspirations of making full  use of the advantages and favorable conditions in the fields of  natural resources, geology, and policies to accelerate the  growth rate and improve the efficiency in order to realize the  magnificent goal of "joining the forefront" that was set forth  by Comrade Xiaoping.    Comrade Wang Qun pointed out at conclusion: Whether a leader  can always uphold the party's basic line is the practical  criterion to judge his leading ability and political awareness,  not only his ideological ability, problem-solving ability but  also his party style, work style, and political character. To  raise the theoretical level of the vast numbers of cadres  through the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping, all leaders are required to embrace the  scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts and the spirit  of dealing with concrete matters relating to work, to learn to  dialectically analyze and solve problems, to overcome  lopsidedness and absolutism, to create a kind of enterprising  spirit and risk-taking sense, and to actually give consideration  to the interests of the people in order to constantly push the  region's socialist modernization drive to a new stage.    Comrade Qian Fenyong presided over the semester-opening  ceremony. Wang Zhan, Geriletu, and Wuyunqimuge attended the  ceremony.    Also attending the ceremony were leading cadres of various  major leading bodies, responsible persons of various democratic  parties, and responsible comrades of various departments and  units directly under the provincial authorities.</p>

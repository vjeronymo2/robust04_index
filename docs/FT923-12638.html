			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / UN move to end deadlock in Iraq A SECOND senior United Nations envoy is joining efforts in Baghdad to break a 12-day deadlock involving UN weapons inspectors and the Iraqi authorities. Mr Rolf Ekeus, executive chairman of the UN special commission charged with overseeing the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, is joining Mr Douglas Englund, head of UN field operations, to persuade the Iraqi government to allow inspectors to enter an agriculture ministry building. But Iraq's official press yesterday stepped up its condemnation of the UN inspectors, who are seeking documents in the building believed to detail parts of Iraq's chemical weapons programme. The state-run al-Jumhouriyah newspaper accused Mr Englund of 'empty haughtiness', while other government papers called the UN inspectors 'deviants'. Iraqi officials say nothing related to its weapons programme lies in the agriculture ministry building and that a search by UN chemical weapons inspectors would insult the Baghdad government and breach Iraq's sovereignty. The US state department on Wednesday warned Iraq that failure to comply with the UN demands would threaten the Gulf war ceasefire resolutions, which established the special commission into Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The US said yesterday it was consulting allies about possible ways of forcing Iraq to honour the UN inspection demand. Although spokesmen at the defence and state departments left open the implied threat of renewed military action, a senior US official indicated such action was not expected. Both departments said the US was 'very determined' that Iraq give UN inspectors unimpeded access. However, Iraq has insisted that it will not permit the UN team entry the building - a limitation on inspectors' freedom to operate in Iraq which UN officials say would set a precedent potentially fatal to the whole task of monit-oring Iraq's weapons pro-grammes.</p>

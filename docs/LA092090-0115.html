			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE NFL;  </P> <P> KEITH JACKSON COMES BACK TO EAGLES  </P> <P> In a surprise move, Keith Jackson, Philadelphia's Pro Bowl tight end, ended his  two-month holdout -- in time to play against the Rams Sunday at Anaheim  Stadium. Jackson, who caught 144 passes in his first two pro seasons, had said  he would not report to the team until the final two years of his contract were  reworked.  </P> <P> The contract remains the same, but he came in anyway. . . . With kicker Mike  Lansford's right leg still aching, the Rams are leaning strongly toward signing  an extra kicker and having him in uniform Sunday. Coach John Robinson said he  wanted Lansford to try to kick but likely would sign one of three players as a  backup -- Teddy Garcia, formerly with the New England Patriots; John Carney,  formerly of Notre Dame and a Charger candidate this summer, and David  Browndyke, formerly of LSU. . . . The Raiders placed tight end Mike Dyal on  four-week injured reserve with a hamstring injury. Dyal was injured in Sunday's  17-13 victory over the Seahawks in Seattle. To replace Dyal, the team signed  free agent tight end Andy Parker, who played four years with the Raiders until  signing with the Chargers as a Plan B free agent in 1989. The Chargers cut  Parker during camp. . . . Quarterback Don Majkowski, who missed 45 days in a  contract holdout, will make his first start of the season Sunday for Green Bay  against Kansas City.  </P></p>

In the August 1, 1986, preamble to the original type B rule, the Department provided the following explanation for this restriction: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Ordinarily, option and existence values would be added to use values. However, section 301(c) of CERCLA mentions only use values. Therefore, the primary emphasis in this section is on the estimation of use values&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* Another related reason for this limitation is that more is known about the determination of use values than option and existence values. Option and existence values are less well-defined and more uncertainty surrounds their measurement. 51 FR 27719. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  held that the type B rule incorrectly established a strong presumption in favor of the use of market price and appraisal methodologies to estimate lost use values. The court also held that the Department had ``erroneously construed the statute'' with regard to the assessment of lost nonuse values. The court stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (S)ection 301(c)(2) requires Interior to ``take into consideration factors including,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> but not limited to <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  *&blank;*&blank;* use value.'' 42 U.S.C. 9651(c)(2) (emphasis added). The statute's command is expressly not limited to use value; if anything, the language implies that DOI is to include in its regulations other factors in addition to use value. 880 F.2d at 464. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The court went on to say that the Department <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> is entitled to rank methodologies according to its view of their reliability, but it cannot base its complete exclusion of option and existence values on an incorrect reading of the statute.

Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CV is currently the only method available for the express purpose of estimating nonuse values. Under the original type B rule, CV was listed as a non-market-based methodology for calculating either lost use or lost nonuse values.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  upheld the Department's inclusion of CV as a ``best available procedure.'' Id. at 478. However, the court did not require the Department to allow unlimited use of CV. Moreover, the court did not address the difference between use of CV to calculate lost use values and use of CV to calculate lost nonuse values. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The March 25, 1994, final rule leaves trustee officials free to choose among the listed valuation methodologies, including CV, when estimating lost use values. 59 FR 14285&hyph;86. The final rule provides a number of criteria to guide the selection of valuation methodologies, including a requirement that the chosen methodologies are reliable for the particular incident and type of damage being measured. The final rule renumbers &sect;&sect;11.83(b)(2) and 11.83(d)(5)(ii) of the original rule, which restrict the assessment of lost nonuse values to cases where lost use values cannot be determined, as new &sect;&sect;11.83(c)(1)(iii) and 11.83(c)(2)(vii)(B), respectively.

Contingent Valuation: Discussion and Rule Language Under Consideration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CV is a survey-based approach to the valuation of nonmarket goods and services that relies on a questionnaire for the direct elicitation of information about the value of the good or service in question. The value obtained for the good or service is said to be contingent upon the nature of the constructed (hypothetical or simulated) market and the good or service described in the survey scenario. In the natural resource damage assessment context, CV studies generally derive values through elicitation of respondents' willingness to pay (WTP) to prevent injuries to natural resources or to restore injured natural resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first published CV study, valuing outdoor recreation, appeared in 1963. There are now over 1,400 documented papers, reports, and books on CV. In recent years, CV has become one of the most widely used methods of nonmarket valuation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four basic elements common to CV questionnaires are: (1) An explanation of the structure and rules of the market in which the good or service being valued is either bought or sold; (2) a description of the good or service and how it is to be provided; (3) the value elicitation question; and (4) validation questions to verify comprehension and acceptance of the scenario and to elicit socioeconomic and attitudinal characteristics to interpret the variation in responses to the valuation question across respondents. There are no universal rules on how each of these elements of a CV questionnaire should be designed, since the appropriate formulation of each depends on the good or service being valued and its context and, consequently, will vary across applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CV surveys generally measure total value of a good or service, which includes both use values and nonuse values. However, nonuse values, unlike use values, are not linked to observable behavior and, thus, are more difficult to validate externally than use values. Therefore, criticisms of CV pertain primarily to its use in valuing the nonuse component of total value and the difficulty of external validation of that component of total value. Among the most commonly cited criticisms of CV studies of nonuse values are: The stated intentions of WTP in CV surveys may exceed ``true'' WTP; CV may produce results that appear inconsistent with the tenets of rational choice; respondents to CV surveys on nonuse may be unfamiliar with the good or service being valued and therefore may not have an adequate basis for articulating their true value; CV respondents may be expressing a value for the satisfaction (warm glow) of giving rather than the value of the good or service in question; and respondents may fail to take CV questions seriously because the financial implications of their responses are not binding. Most proponents of CV acknowledge that poorly designed and administered CV studies can produce results that reflect the potential problems identified above. However, proponents also assert that these problems are not inherent to the method and that well-designed and well-executed CV studies can eliminate them or render them inconsequential. Proponents further assert that survey design, development, and administration standards will improve quality control for CV surveys. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department received many, often conflicting, comments on the use of CV to calculate nonuse values. As the Department noted in the July 22, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, NOAA convened a panel of economic and survey experts (the NOAA panel), pursuant to its rulemaking authority under OPA, to evaluate the reliability of CV to measure nonuse values. The NOAA panel issued a report in January, 1993. 58 FR 4601 (Jan. 15, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon consideration of all comments received and the NOAA panel report, the Department is proposing to revise the type B rule to include standards for the use of CV to estimate lost nonuse values. The Department believes that standards to improve the reliability of CV surveys of lost nonuse values are needed in the Department's type B rule, because assessments performed in accordance with the rule will be given a rebuttable presumption in litigation over the specific amount of money a particular party must pay as compensation for liability. However, this same level of precision for CV surveys may not necessarily be required for other applications of CV, such as use of CV in regulatory cost-benefit analyses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / International Company News: Allianz and Dresdner condemn Berlin ruling ALLIANZ, Europe's largest insurance company, and Dresdner Bank, Germany's second largest bank, yesterday condemned the German cartel office's ruling that Allianz should reduce its shareholding in Dresdner and that the two should cut back their co-operation in the German life assurance market. For the first time since the end of March, when the Berlin-based federal cartel office ordered Allianz to cut its stake in Dresdner from more than 22 per cent to about 19 per cent, the two institutions spelled out their detailed objections to the office's findings. The Berlin move is seen as an attack on the heart of Germany's financial and industrial establishment. Yesterday's statement, couched in what for Germany is unusually confrontational language, means that there is likely to be a long battle as the two institutions fight the ruling in the courts. The two institutions insisted that their co-operation in the German life market - the biggest in Europe with annual premiums of more than DM50bn (Dollars 30.3bn) - was not anti-competitive. Dresdner had decided in 1989 that the best way to proceed in the life market was to team up with insurers, the statement said. There was no question that the link with Allianz was preventing it from setting up its own life company, as the cartel office has alleged. They rejected the authorities' charge that Allianz dominates the life market through its network of holdings in Dresdner and other life companies. 'Healthy competition reigns in the life market,' the statement declared, adding that there were plenty of other link-ups between banks and insurance companies which had not so far aroused the authorities' concern. Allianz said that its shareholding in Dresdner ought to be seen as an 'above averagely profitable capital investment' - by implication not a means to exercise unwelcome control over the bank's management. It said there was no way that Allianz could exercise a voting majority of Dresdner's shares, as the cartel office alleged. Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> 2 INNOCENT BYSTANDERS STRUCK BY STRAY BULLETS  </P> <P> Two Santa Ana men in their 20s were in stable condition Tuesday after they were  struck by stray bullets from a shooting in which they were not involved, police  said.  </P> <P> A Santa Ana police officer was writing a traffic ticket at about 7 p.m. Monday  at the intersection of McFadden Avenue and Raitt Street when he heard several  gunshots. Thinking someone was possibly shooting at him, the officer requested  assistance, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Collie Provence said.  </P> <P> When officers arrived in an alley near 700 S. Raitt St., they found Miguel  Rosas, 24, of Santa Ana, who had been shot once in the buttocks, Provence said.  Witnesses told police that another victim, Fredrico Briseno, 20, had been shot  in the neck and was taken by friends to a hospital.  </P> <P> "It appears that both victims had been hit by stray bullets fired by (people)  in an unrelated fight that the victims were not involved in," Provence said.  "(It also) appears that none of the gunshots had been fired at the officer, and  the gunshots the officer heard go by him were stray rounds."  </P> <P> Police believe that the weapon used was a small-caliber pistol. Officers did  not have any suspects, and the shooting was under investigation to determine if  it was gang-related, Provence said.  </P></p>

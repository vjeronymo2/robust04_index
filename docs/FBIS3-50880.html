Social Development Secretary Carlos Rojas swore in the  commission, which is made up of writer Eraclio Zepeda,  anthropologist Andres Fabregas, and Institutional Revolutionary  Party Senator Eduardo Robledo.    The commission "will have complete independence to evaluate  the situation and the problems that need to be resolved as well  as to make suggestions about options and actions to efficiently  face the problems in the conflict areas," it was reported.    Rojas said the commission members' backgrounds "and their  roots and identification with the people of Chiapas guarantee an  objective reflection of the prevailing situation in the state  and an intense dialogue with social organizations and  communities in an effort to improve living conditions."</p>

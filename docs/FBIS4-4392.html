			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Prime Ministers Morihiro  Hosokawa of Japan and Begum Khaleda Zia of Bangladesh issued a  joint press statement Thursday [31 March] saying Zia's official  visit to Japan has served to strengthen bilateral relations.  The statement said that in summit talks on Tuesday, Hosokawa  hailed Zia's efforts for democratization and economic  development.    Zia outlined her government's achievements in consolidating  democracy, implementing economic reforms and pursuing social and  economic development, it said. She explained her policies aimed  at alleviating poverty, creating rural employment and improving  primary education and basic health care.    Zia expressed gratitude for Japan's economic assistance to  date and for its new offer to cofinance a major bridge spanning  the Jamuna River, which should serve to promote economic  development in the northern areas of Bangladesh.    The statement said Hosokawa urged Bangladesh to take care to  ensure that Japan's official development assistance (ODA) is  implemented promptly and smoothly.    It said the two countries agreed to start negotiations on  concluding a bilateral agreement concerning the encouragement  and protection of investment.    Zia, who arrived in Japan on Monday for a five-day official  visit, reconfirmed Bangladesh's support for the permanent  membership of Japan on the UN Security Council, the statement  said.</p>

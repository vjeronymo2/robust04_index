			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: WASHINGTON BASKETBALL COACH QUITS  </P> <P> Andy Russo, presumably under fire after two consecutive losing seasons,  resigned as the University of Washington's basketball coach Wednesday.  </P> <P> Russo was not at a news conference called by Athletic Director Mike Lude to  announce the resignation.  </P> <P> Russo, 40, came to Washington after coaching Louisiana Tech to a 29-3 record in  1984-85. He had a 61-62 record in four seasons at Washington, but the Huskies  were 12-16 this season after going 10-19 in 1987-88.  </P> <P> The Huskies lost to Arizona, 116-61, and Arizona State, 121-90, on the road in  December and never recovered.  </P> <P> Relations between Russo and his players reportedly soured. However, in  Washington's final home game three weeks ago, the players wore T-shirts that  read, "We believe in our coaches."  </P> <P> Russo had two years left on his contract, worth $77,160 a year.  </P> <P> St. Mary's Coach Lynn Nance, who played for Washington in the 1960s, is  reportedly a leading candidate for the job. Other names mentioned as possible  candidates included Loyola Marymount's Paul Westhead, UC Santa Barbara's Jerry  Pimm and Evansville's Jim Crews.  </P></p>

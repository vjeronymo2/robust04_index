			<p>BFN     [Text] Brigadier General Silvano Colas Sanchez,  communications minister, has visited the Provinces of Granma and  Santiago de Cuba. In Granma, the general described several  Communications Ministry enterprises' work in installing new  television transmitters as very positive. This has upgraded  signal reception, mainly in Bayamo City. In Santiago de Cuba,  the minister discussed aspects of the project to install two new  television transmitters, which will be conducted shortly, and  the progress of expanding new telephone lines, which is being  conducted at the main telephone station in Santiago de Cuba.    During his extensive trip, the minister met with the workers  of each facility, discussed quality service indexes, and  criticized subjective problems that worsen the effect of the  resources shortage and the special period. Finally, he urged the  workers to improve telephone and postal services and to close  ranks against those who hurt the prestige of the workers of this  sector.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Rao intervened, says broker Mr Harshad Mehta, the Bombay stockbroker at the heart of India's Rs50bn financial scandal has claimed that the prime minister's office directly intervened to help his associate brokers on the stock market in January 1992, two months after Mr Mehta had allegedly given Mr Narasimha Rao Rs10m for his by-election campaign, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. Mr Mehta is being cross-examined by a joint parliamentary committee investigating the Bombay stock scandal. The stock-broker made a lengthy written submission detailing the number of telephone calls he had made to the prime minister's office before he was nailed as the man who started the financial scandal. He claimed that two of his associate brokers were saved from disciplinary action by the Bombay Stock Exchange board when the finance ministry's lone representative on the board reversed a unanimous decision of 21 directors to penalise the brokers at the behest of the prime minister's personal assistant. Mr Narasimha Rao, on a four-day tour of his home state of Andhra Pradesh, reiterated at a series of public meetings that he had not taken any money from Mr Mehta, and rejected opposition demands for his resignation.</p>

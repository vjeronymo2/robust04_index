			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FLICKS: FILM AND VIDEO NOTES;  </P> <P> BIG HIT FOR ROSE;  </P> <P> THE PLAYER'S JAIL SENTENCE HASN'T HURT THE POPULARITY OF "BASEBALL THE PETE  ROSE WAY."  </P> <P> The bloom isn't entirely off the (Pete) Rose. All the attention surrounding his  suspension from baseball for gambling, his conviction and five-month jail  sentence for tax evasion hasn't hurt the popularity of his video, dubiously  titled "Baseball the Pete Rose Way."  </P> <P> In fact, the week after Rose's sentencing, the video was checked out from the  Thousand Oaks Library. And librarian Mike Gilman said it has been rented  consistently over the last couple of years.  </P> <P> "Basically, it's an instructional tape and has nothing to do with his personal  activities," he said.  </P> <P> Jeepers Creepers . . . Here's one for all the science-fiction fans out there .  . . way out there. Tickets have gone on sale for the Ojai Film Society's Aug.  26 showing of the 1957 movie "The Incredible Shrinking Man." Following the film  will be a discussion on science-fiction movies past and present.  </P> <P> A panel of science-fiction experts will analyze the film and compare it to last  year's Disney film "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids." Among the speakers will be  Richard Matheson, who wrote the original "Shrinking Man" story and screenplay.  </P> <P> Film Society founders Sally and Mike Janover have arranged for special effects  expert Tom Smith to discuss his craft. He has worked on "Honey, I Shrunk the  Kids," as well as on two films in each of the "Star Wars," "Star Trek" and  "Indiana Jones" series.  </P> <P> Ventura's Tony and Nancy Lawrence, writers and producers of some "Twilight  Zone" and "Outer Limits" episodes, will also attend. This science-fiction fest  will be held at Ojai's Thacher School beginning at 6 p.m. Tickets are $10 in  advance, $15 at the door. Call 646-8946.  </P> <P> You may have noticed that unlike last summer the Ojai Film Society hasn't been  showing any movies the last couple of months. Why not?  </P> <P> "No one comes," said Mike Janover. "We found that there was too much  competition with the summer blockbusters. We tend to lose money anyway, but we  really lose money when no one comes."  </P> <P> A big problem, Janover said, is that he can only show his films at the Ojai  Playhouse on Sunday afternoons. "In summer the days are longer. The idea of  going to a movie at 4:30 in the afternoon when they could be playing golf . . .  they don't do it."  </P> <P> But beginning Sept. 16, with "Cinema Paradiso," the films will be playing once  again. On the schedule are "Time of the Gypsies," "Sweetie," "Women on the  Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," "Drugstore Cowboy," "The Man With Two Brains,"  "Raging Bull," "Longtime Companion," "Aguirre, Wrath of God," "Tom Jones" and  "The Adventures of Milo and Otis."

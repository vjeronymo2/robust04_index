			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / China cancels Pena trip over Taiwan visit China has cancelled a planned visit by Mr Federico Pena, US transportation secretary, to express its 'strong displeasure' over a trip he made to Taiwan last week. Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and insists the US and other nations have only unofficial contacts with the island. 'Under such circumstances, it is hard for us to receive Mr Pena in January,' the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said. Mr Pena was to visit Beijing and two other cities on January 7-17 to boost US-Chinese commercial relations. A US State Department spokesman said China had described the meeting as having been postponed rather than cancelled. 'They said it would not be convenient at this time,' he said, adding that Mr Pena's trip last week was consistent with US policy of maintaining unofficial economic, commercial and cultural relations with Taiwan. A Transportation Department official said there had been 'a shift' in US policy toward Taiwan in September, to recognise the island's democratic reforms and economic development. 'The White House asked Mr Pena to make the trip and the State Department was aware of it,' the official said.' China signalled its displeasure over the trip before Mr Pena went to Taiwan. An aerospace industry official said a US executive, visiting China within the last two months, was also warned by the Chinese information ministry against operating 'a two China policy' of parallel contacts with Beijing and Taipei, and was told that 'it would not go away as a problem' so long as such contacts with Taiwan were maintained. Mr Pena was only the second cabinet-level official to visit Taiwan since Washington switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1979. His spokesman said the White House received an invitation for a high-ranking official to speak at the US-Republic of China joint economic council meeting in Taiwan. Mrs Carla Hills, the then US trade representative, spoke to the group in Taiwan two years ago just two weeks before the end of the Bush administration. In 1991 Mr Sam Skinner, the then transportation secretary, addressed the group in the US. Mr Pena, however, went a step farther than his predecessors by meeting Taiwanese officials, including the president, and commending them for their recent elections. Despite the cancellation, China maintains that high-level exchanges with the US should be strengthened, the Beijing spokesman said.</p>

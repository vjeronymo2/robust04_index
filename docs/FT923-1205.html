			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Lecturers face tight limit on pay: Patten tells universities to improve productivity MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday gave universities a sharp warning that the expansion of student numbers will require tight limits on lecturers' pay and the squeezing of more from existing resources. 'Any irresponsible increases in pay would lead not to an increase in exchequer grant but to a loss of jobs,' he told vice-chancellors at their annual meeting in Exeter. He added: 'The only prudent basis for an increase in pay therefore is improvement in productivity and performance . . . I hope there will be maximum scope for individual institutions to settle the pay of their own staff locally within the resources available to them.' After his action in overriding the vice-chancellors' 7 per cent pay offer to lecturers earlier this year, Mr Patten's warning is tantamount to an instruction. He said there was 'no other way' than continued efficiency gains to ensure expansion towards the government's target of one in three 18-year-olds proceeding to higher education by the year 2000. Mr Patten also urged vice-chancellors to give students with vocational qualifications - particularly the General National Vocational Qualifications being piloted this year - parity of treatment with A Level candidates in the competition for places. 'The expectations of students will only be satisfied if higher education in general is seen to be making a positive response,' he said, adding: 'Before long it will not make sense to deal with higher-education entry on a basis which presumes a standard A Level route.' Mr Patten welcomed the decision of the Higher Education Funding Council for England to review the organisation of the academic year. Also addressing the vice-chancellors, Professor Graeme Davies, chief executive of the funding council, reinforced the government's message on efficiency. He said the funding council had asked Mr Patten to start discussions with the Environment Department about planning restrictions that limited expansion, and with the Treasury on the issue of universities using premises as security for commercial loans. Universities are limited in their capacity to use state-funded assets as security.</p>

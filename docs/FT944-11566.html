			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Transport efficiencies (1) Sir, Mr Richard Bird, in advocating road pricing (Letters, November 2), is voicing an apparent confusion in much of the public debate on the subject. The taxation of car ownership and car use is already levied by means of the vehicle licence and petroleum excise duty respectively. Increasing either, or both, of these would be cheaper to collect and, unlike road pricing, would not simply shift congestion from roads which are priced to those which are not.

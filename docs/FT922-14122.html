			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Bosnia's Serb minority declares independence: Two quit ethnically divided republic's collective leadership, sparking fears of deepening turmoil and bloodshed SERB leaders yesterday declared an independent Serbian republic within Bosnia-Hercegovina, the ethnically mixed Yugoslav republic, following the European Community's decision on Monday to recognise Bosnia's independence. Serbs in the republic, where there was further ethnic violence yesterday, fear becoming a minority in an independent Bosnia-Hercegovina, separated from Serbs elsewhere in the former federation. Yugoslav air force jets were reported yesterday to have launched two strikes against targets in western Bosnia. Five people were killed when jets attacked the predominantly Croat towns of Listica and Citluk, according to emergency council officials in Siroki Brijeg, in the south-west. The federal air force said the attacks were launched in response to provocations on 'hostile military targets' controlled by local Croat units. Radio Sarajevo reported fierce clashes around Mostar, 20 miles north-east of Listica, where the federal army said the airport came under attack. The resignation of Serbs from Bosnia's collective leadership yesterday sparked fears of deepening turmoil. Mrs Biljana Plavsic and Mr Nikola Koljevic, the two Serb representatives, resigned after declaring an independent Serbian republic. They said the Serbian Republic would remain in Yugoslavia, joining Serbia and its ally, Montenegro. The resignations cast doubt on the continued participation of Serb leaders in EC-brokered peace talks due to resume on April 10. The UN Security Council last night strongly endorsed EC efforts to end the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The council decided unanimously that UN peacekeeping troops in Yugoslavia, some of which are already in place, be brought to full strength of 14,000 as soon as possible. Yesterday the US joined the EC in recognising the independence of Bosnia-Hercegovina, and of Croatia and Slovenia. The EC decided on Monday to recognise Bosnia and to lift sanctions against Serbia. Dozens of Moslems, Serbs, and Croats - Bosnia's main ethnic groups - have died in the past week as Bosnia's national leaders have failed to agree on a constitution. Most Serbs, who make up a third of the 4.4m population, oppose an independent Bosnia. The Moslems and Croats favour independence. European observers yesterday agreed the Serb-controlled army will play a key role in determining the course of events in Bosnia amid growing signs that the army has distributed weapons and redeployed troops in Serb-populated areas. Meanwhile Sarajevo, the capital, was placed under curfew.</p>

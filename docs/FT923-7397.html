			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Presidential hopefuls take long view on prospects: The Republican party's convention is a proving ground for those with ambitions for 1996 WHATEVER happens in November, George Bush will not be the Republican party's presidential nominee in 1996. This makes the Houston convention something of a proving ground for those who have eyes on the prize four years from now, writes Jurek Martin, US Editor, in Houston. The list is long - very long for a party not known for great diversity of opinion. But it can be divided conveniently into two: those not in Houston or, if so, not much in evidence; and those jockeying for public exposure. In the first category, naturally, are Mr James Baker, still secretary of state until Sunday, and Mr Dick Cheney, the secretary of defence. Reflecting the pressure of other business, with Iraq, and the tradition that these two cabinet positions should be reasonably above partisan politics, neither will address the convention, although Mrs Lynn Cheney will do so in her capacity as head of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Also absent is Governor Pete Wilson of California, attending to his state's budgetary crisis. He might, in any case, have found Houston uncomfortable, given that he supports freedom of reproductive choice and that the party platform is calling for a constitutional amendment to ban abortion. The stakes are probably highest for those who have been given prominent speaking roles. Chief among them are Vice-President Dan Quayle, Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, Senator Phil Gramm from Texas, and Mr Pat Buchanan, Mr Bush's erstwhile primary challenger. Also very much in the frame and on the podium are Mr William Bennett, the former education secretary, Mr Lamar Alexander, who now holds the job, and at least four governors - Mr William Weld of Massachusetts, Mr Carroll Campbell of South Carolina, Mr Pete du Pont of Delaware and Mr Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin. And the last may not have been heard from the Rev Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who made a run four year ago. Some are obviously long shots for 1996. If Mr Quayle is defeated with Mr Bush in November he will not be a contender. Even if he wins he can expect to be challenged, if for no other reason than he stands in the way of Mr Baker's presumed ambitions, not to mention some others on the right. Nevertheless, Mr Quayle will be extremely visible this week, with a dozen public appearances and his own acceptance speech on Thursday night. He knows he is being compared unfavourably with Senator Al Gore, Mr Bill Clinton's running mate, but he remains popular with conservatives. It is on the right where the battle for succession is the hottest. Mr Buchanan, an early convention speaker last night, has expressed an interest in 1996 but recently underwent heart surgery and has, in any case, probably been overtaken in the outsider conservative sweepstakes by the likes of Mr Kemp. The housing secretary - a conservative renegade within, and frequently semi-detached from, the Bush cabinet - had to lobby even to be given a speaking slot at the convention. Having won his point by threatening to stay away, he is among the most visible in Houston, pushing the cause of a more radical tax-cutting agenda in a second Bush term. Mr Bennett, among the most articulate conservative critics of the president, is putting Mr Quayle's name in nomination tomorrow night, but, in the opinion of those who know him, will use this speech as his own springboard. Conservatives are also becoming increasingly attracted to Mr Weld of Massachusetts. He fails two litmus tests - he supports both abortion and gay rights - but his uncompromising fights with his state's Democratic legislature over taxation go down well with the right. The 'moderate' with most to gain and lose this week is Senator Gramm, whose keynote address tonight will probably be the most important speech he gives. First elected to Congress as a Democrat, he was co-author of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget act of 1986 which sought, and failed, to control government spending. Mr Gramm has an owlish demeanour, but, with a sharp tongue, is a formidable debater; he has this week already criticised Mr Kemp for trying to force the president's hand on economic policy. Although he is up for re-election in 1996, Texas law allows him to contest national and state elections simultaneously and he has a Dollars 5m-plus (Pounds 2.6m) war chest left over from his last campaign. Except Messrs Quayle, Baker and Cheney, and possibly Mr Buchanan, none of the above has enjoyed great national exposure. Even Mr Kemp, visible this year in the wake of the Los Angeles riots, is a closed book to seven out of 10 Americans, according to a recent New York Times poll. The convention offers all a chance to make a mark, and to be better known among the faithful at the innumerable parties that sometimes seem to be the real business of the week.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Multimedia in handcuffs Multimedia technology has the potential to spawn large new markets in entertainment and education, but a battle between copyright holders and multimedia publishers threatens to obstruct the emerging market. Multimedia developers see great potential in the use of CD-Rom discs to store thousands of audio, video, graphics and text clips. Organised as an interactive encyclopedia, adventure game or as a multimedia history of Christopher Columbus, for example, they become powerful educational and reference tools, allowing users to steer through enormous amounts of information easily and quickly. But developers of such applications complain that copyright holders are asking large fees for the use of small snippets of existing audio or video from tape and film libraries and that the copyright licensing process is complex and time consuming. In turn, copyright holders are worried about the integrity of their work, which when transformed into digital form can very easily be copied or modified. Writers, film-makers, artists and photographers fear they might lose control of their works and their ability to collect future royalties. The US Office of Technology Assessment has recognised the problem. In a report issued last year, it warned that the development of multimedia programs could be hurt by current copyright regulations that are not well suited to the new technologies. Multimedia title developers say they are willing to pay for copyright clearances, but simply locating copyright holders is a big problem. Warner New Media, for example, when developing a multimedia title on the Berlin Wall, wanted to use a clip from the musical film West Side Story. This involved obtaining and paying for copyright clearance from the film company, the musicians, the music composer, the actors and the writers. But Warner missed a copyright, held by the choreographer, and could not use the clip. One loophole some multimedia developers have successfully used is the 'fair use' provision of US copyright law. This allows use of a copyrighted work 'for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, including multiple copies for classroom use, scholarship, or research'. However, US courts have interpreted fair use in unpredictable ways. Last year, for example, a US federal court ruled against Texaco which had argued that in photocopying scientific papers, it was protected from copyright infringement allegations since the papers were used for research. With fair use vaguely defined by US courts, many multimedia applications developers are looking for copyright-free material. The largest source of copyright-free text is Project Gutenberg. It offers 50 copyright-free publications in digital form, known as 'etexts'. These include classic books such as Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan. Michael Hart, founder of Project Gutenberg, says it will offer 10,000 etexts by the end of the decade. Multimedia title developers can also turn to a growing number of CD-Rom disks full of music clips, photographs and video footage, all available without copyright fees. None the less, copyright-free or public domain material is a limited resource. A copyright clearance mechanism is needed that allows copyright holders to tap into the potentially lucrative multimedia applications market without surrendering control over their work. Multimedia title producers, in turn, need an easy way to reach copyright holders and negotiate copyright clearance fees. One solution could be the creation of copyright clearance centres that would represent the works of artists, musicians, photographers, video producers and authors. Such centres would allow multimedia developers to shop for content and pay a reasonable fee for the material used. The benefits of such a system would be to remove roadblocks to a new industry that could provide consumers with a wide range of multimedia titles.</p>

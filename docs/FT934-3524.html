			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Whirlpool in Dollars 106m Italian deal Whirlpool, the world's largest white goods producer, is selling its Italian compressor business to Embraco of Brazil. The unusual Dollars 106m deal will create the world's second-biggest compressor producer after Matsushita of Japan. Whirlpool is transferring its factory at Riva di Chieri, which makes Aspera brand compressors, to the Brazilian company, a long-time strategic partner in which it holds a minority interest. The deal includes a five-year agreement to provide compressors - one of the basic components of refrigerators - to Whirlpool Europe. Embraco already supplies them to Whirlpool in South and North America. The sale fits into Whirlpool's overall strategy of making more effective use of its global network. The two formerly-separate manufacturing units - Riva, near Turin, and Embraco's plant in Joinville, Brazil - will work together to enhance their position in the world compressor market. Mr Miguel Etchenique, Embraco's chairman, said the purchase would assure his company an important presence in Europe, the world's largest home appliance market.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (9): The game of ripping off the foreigner - Why you need to be on your guard in eastern Europe THE SPREAD of lawlessness in former eastern Europe has been well enough publicised to put every business traveller on guard, yet the great game of ripping off the foreigner flourishes unabated. A rampant underworld has taken hold in eastern Europe since the demise of communism, taking the form of racketeering, prostitution, drugs and arms dealing and protection rings. Violence often erupts as opposing gangs fight for control. Corruption and bribery remain a reality of everyday business life. A phenomenal haul of weaponry turns up regularly in traffic checks in Moscow, while there have been deaths on the streets of Prague as Mafia-style gangs take control of taxi stands. One taxi driver was recently murdered in the middle of the day on Wenceslas Square after a passenger had been ejected from another taxi, whose driver thought her destination was not profitable enough. The best advice in Prague is not to use the taxi stands in the city centre - at least, not at Wenceslas or Staromestske - but to ask staff in the office that you are visiting to call a taxi. In any event, always check that the taxi meter has been turned on and that it is on level 1, otherwise you will be charged twice the amount it should be. Ignore demands for a flat fare; inevitably it will be more than a metered ride. This is particularly so for the run-in from the airport to downtown, some 20km. It should cost no more than Kcs300-400 (Pounds 7-Pounds 9). The city itself is very compact and the business district cramped into Praha 1, so most of it is walkable. Alternatively the metro provides the quickest mode of transport for longer journeys; it is clean and simple to understand. The three-line underground system is coded by colour, letters and the end-station name. A one-day, all-transport pass costs just Kcs30, a five-day Kcs100. Remember to validate the tickets in the yellow machines inside the station before you travel, otherwise you are liable to be fined. Hotels in the city are generally soulless and impersonal, many of them being large, modern structures, such as the Atrium and Forum, which nevertheless charge western prices. Cosier in size and more stylish is the Palace (rooms from Dollars 280) while the Inter-Continental (remember to request new rooms), Diplomat and Praha Penta are about Dollars 50 less and offer a good standard of service. Note that there is an enormous 23 per cent tax on hotel rates. There is also an outsize bureaucracy, so do not expect to do your business in a rush. And it is essential to take an interpreter in a country where new laws have yet to be tested. Much the same can be said about doing business in Moscow. You need a lot of money and time, as well as a long view while the economy stabilises and the legal framework is set up. Visitors can at least stay in comfort while they wait as hotel standards in the city have improved enormously as good, privately-run hotels have gradually replaced the depressing Intourist-run establishments. There are no bargains though; expect to pay at least Dollars 200 a night, plus an array of extras which anywhere else would not be charged for. Some of the top hotels are the Radisson Slavyanskaya, Baltschug Kempinski, Metropol (run by Inter Continental), Savoy, Palace and Penta. The ones to avoid are the Moskva, Izmailovo, Cosmos and Rossiya. Getting around Moscow has got progressively worse; traffic congestion has forced more people to use the metro, which is cheap and quick but seriously overcrowded. A better bet is the tramway; more comfortable still would be your own car. It is not advisable to get a taxi downtown from the international airport, Sheremetyevo Two - it can cost up to Dollars 60. Robberies and extortion are commonplace. Your hotel may provide a taxi service; better still, insist that you be collected by car by the company with which you are dealing. Alternatively, Wagons-lits Travel offers a 'meet and greet' service which includes transfers to and from the international and domestic airports, use of private car and driver, assistance with customs and immigration formalities at the domestic airport, a visa invitation letter, English-Russian interpreter service and sightseeing and theatre trips. Prices start from Pounds 35 for a one-way transfer. In Warsaw, foreigners are recommended to stay in the open areas of the Polish capital, to dress down and watch their wallets. On the plus side, hotel standards are good, starting with the butler-serviced and luxurious Forte Hotel Bristol, the Warsaw Marriott (go for corner rooms for bigger bathrooms, or its executive floor), Victoria Inter-Continental or cheaper Orbis Holiday Inn. Many hotels offer airport transfers. Bureaucracy here is a problem and a Polish partner is essential to garner local sympathy. Travelling from Ferihegy airport into Budapest, a 25-minute journey, is best done by airport bus. Buy a ticket (Ft400) in the arrivals hall and it will drop you anywhere in the city. The taxi ride is liable to be a rip-off; it should be Ft800-1,000 but drivers regularly charge twice that amount. Choosing where to stay in the city is an altogether easier affair, though booking ahead is advisable particularly if you are visiting in spring or autumn. The Grand Hotel Corvinus Kempinski is the finest of all, followed by the Atrium Hyatt and Forum. The Gellert is also good but definitely in need of its planned refurbishment while great things are expected by end-1994 after Marriott's redecorations at the Duna Inter-Continental are completed. Single rooms in these hotels are around the DM300 mark, although the Hilton is only DM250. Finding suitably dedicated staff is one problem faced by foreign companies in Hungary, another is office rents that are higher than those in Vienna. Be warned that pickpockets are a constant irritant. Berlin suffers less of the problems associated with emerging business destinations; it is boom time in the new German capital so hotel reservations need to be made well in advance. The appositely-named Grand is situated on Unter den Linden, the old embassy district in former east Berlin, and is perhaps the best, though some prefer the Bristol Kempinski on the Ku'damm or the Schweizerhof. Others in the top league are the Inter-Continental, Grand Hotel Esplanade Berlin and the Hilton, which is located next door to the Treuhand. Taxis are expensive, around DM3.60 per km. But help is at hand in the form of an inexpensive and efficient mass transit network, the S-bahn train, the U-bahn underground within the city limits and the bus system. Individual tickets cost DM3. Taxis from Tegel international airport to downtown - a journey of around 30 minutes - cost around DM30 in metered cabs. The 109 bus does the trip every five to 10 minutes.</p>

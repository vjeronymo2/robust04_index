			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES: GRATIS CONCERTS GROW AT IAOJA FEST  </P> <P> When International Assn. of Jazz Appreciation founder and president William J.  Coffey Jr. envisioned a jazz festival in Los Angeles a few years ago, he wanted  to have a half a dozen or so free events at venues scattered throughout the  Southland. He's getting closer to his dream.  </P> <P> This year, the association's third annual International Jazz Festival has three  free concerts, up from one in 1988 and two in 1989. "Hey, it's growing," said  Coffey. The gratis events -- all to be held Saturday, noon-3 p.m. -- will  feature trombonist Luis Bonilla and guitarist Phil Upchurch at Barnsdall Park  (4800 Hollywood Blvd.); bassist Larry Gales and saxman Rickey Woodard at Jim  Gilliam Park (4000 S. La Brea Ave., Baldwin Hills), and the IAOJA "Jazz Goes to  School" Band and violinist Susie Hansen at UCLA's Westwood Plaza (near parking  lots 4 or 6 on Westwood Boulevard).  </P> <P> "We think these events are very important to what we do, in terms of educating  the public and making jazz music accessible and affordable," said Coffey. "A  $20 ticket, or having to travel a long way for an event, cuts a lot of folks  out."  </P> <P> The free shows will be followed by two ticketed concerts to be held Saturday  and Sunday, 7-11 p.m., at UCLA's Royce Hall. Singer Dianne Reeves, pianist  Dorothy Donegan and Gerald Wilson's Orchestra of the '90s are on tap Saturday,  and keyboardist Joe Zawinul's Syndicate, singer Dwight Sills and organist Joey  DeFrancesco -- CBS Records artists all -- will appear Sunday. Tickets are  $9-$20. Information: (213) 825-9261.  </P> <P> Reeves, Zawinul and DeFrancesco are among those donating their services for the  performances, proceeds from which benefit the "Jazz Goes to School" program, a  seven-week course covering the history and culture of jazz as it relates to the  history and culture of America. In February, the course will be presented at a  dozen Los Angeles area schools for the fourth year.  </P> <P> "When I was in high school in Denver, we had people like (saxophonist) Oliver  Nelson and (trumpeter) Clark Terry come by and lecture and play and that  heightened our awareness of, and curiousity for, jazz," said Reeves. "Then  later, performing with a school band at the National Assn. of Jazz Educators  convention in Chicago, that started my career. With IAOJA going into the  schools, I wanted to be a part of that because something similar made me aware  of a wonderful and sophisticated music."  </P> <P> "It's important to keep jazz out there," said Zawinul as to why he was  participating.  </P> <P> Coffey says that the thrust behind his jazz-in-school program is simply to  build and maintain an audience for his favorite art form.. "If students become  familiar with, and hopefully appreciate, jazz, then when they become adults,  perhaps they'll support it since they've had prior exposure," he said. "If only  1% of all (high school) graduates appreciated jazz music, it would enough  broad-based support for musicians to do what they like to do -- which is play.  Most jazz artists can't make a living at what they like to do."  </P> <P> WRITE ON: John Lewis, David Murray, George Russell and Steve Lacy are among the  jazz musicians who have been given composition grants (ranging from  $11,000-$21,000) by the Meet the Composer/Reader's Digest Commissioning Fund,  which operates in partnership with the National Endowment for the Arts. Lewis,  of Modern Jazz Quartet fame, will compose a piece for guitarist Charlie Byrd  and the Annapolis Brass Quintet; saxophonists Murray, Hamiet Bluiett and Oliver  Lake will write a work for saxophone quartet and three African drummers;  pianist/bandleader Russell will concoct a piece for his Living Time Orchestra,  and soprano saxophonist Lacy will write a work for 16-18 players that will be a  portrait of jazz masters who influenced him. Other grantees: Craig Harris, Mary  Watkins and Muhal Richard Abrams.  </P> <P> FESTIVAL SCENE: Freddie Hubbard, Michel Petrucciani and Henry Butler headline  at Jazzin' the Park, held Sept. 9, 4 p.m. at Libbey Park in Ojai, (805)  646-7230, (805) 646-8156. . . .

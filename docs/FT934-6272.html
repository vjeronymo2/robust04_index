			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (1): An austerity route agreed - Belgium has long been home to the European Community's political institutions, but do the country's many financial institutions have the clout to survive and prosper in the competitive single market which 'Brussels' has created? Since Belgium took over the presidency of the European Union in July, the country has often seemed like a storm-tossed miniature replica of the 12-nation community over which it presides until the end of next month. Belgian industry has been on the rack of recession, its sufferings exacerbated by fading competitiveness. Strikes have disrupted daily life; and perceived weaknesses in the country's public finances - notably looming budget and social security deficits - have made the Belgian franc, once considered a surrogate for the D-Mark, a prey to fierce speculation on the bond and foreign exchange markets. Sometimes the authorities' only defence appears to have been to lash the currency to the D-Mark and hope for the squalls to blow out. But at a time when other European currencies have cut free, and apparently profited from their liberty, that policy has itself been blamed for aggravating some of the country's problems. Early on the morning of November 17, however, Belgium's coalition of Christian Democrats and socialists found what should prove to be a more constructive way out of their difficulties. After weeks of wrangling, and in spite of the abandonment of the original three-way talks with unions and employers, ministers finally agreed an austerity plan - a series of measures to limit social spending and wage increases, improve competitiveness and tackle unemployment. It is easily the most far-reaching recovery programme in Belgium since the second world war. The plan - inevitably compared to the European Commission's planned white paper on competitiveness, growth and employment, due to be presented at next month's Brussels summit of EU leaders - had an instant and dramatic impact on the financial markets. The Belgian central bank responded immediately with a bigger than expected cut in leading interest rates; the Bel-20 index of leading Belgian stocks rose sharply; the yield gap between Belgian franc and D-Mark denominated bonds narrowed; the franc itself strengthened. The Belgian coalition - which constructed the plan in the teeth of actual and threatened strike action - will be justifiably pleased with this reaction. But it is not clear whether the short-term market rally can be sustained and the risk of continuing industrial action by unions seen off. What, then, will be the medium-term impact on Belgium's public and private finances? Belgian public finances are overshadowed by debt which stands at more than 120 per cent of gross domestic product. Gradual cuts in interest rates will fit in well with the government's existing strategy to reduce the cost of its borrowing by refinancing its debt. Cuts of about BFr75bn in spending on health benefits, family allowances and pensions will also help restrict the overall rise in borrowing. The austerity plan will also strengthen Belgium's chances of meeting the goals set out in its programme for convergence with other EU economies. The government's own forecast of how Belgium will meet the Maastricht treaty target of cutting its budget deficit from 6.9 to 3 per cent of GDP by 1996 depends on a delicate balance between GDP growth and falling interest rates. The plan should improve both those. The impact on private sector savings is more difficult to predict. Included in the plan - partly as a way of offsetting the edginess of socialist coalition partners about cuts in social spending - are revenue-raising measures which could penalise certain investments. For example, the government plans to increase withholding tax on interest income from 10.3 per cent to 13.4 per cent, while withholding tax on dividends should come down from 25 per cent to 13.4 per cent. The question of withholding tax is particularly sensitive for Belgium's financial sector, which in the past has lost savings business to neighbouring Luxembourg with its limited taxes and banking secrecy laws. One of the original recommendations of the experts who laid the groundwork for the austerity plan was that Belgium should find a way to accelerate plans for Europe-wide harmonisation of withholding tax, but that seems no more than a long-term objective. A more reliable, and quicker way for Belgian banks to overcome the attractions of the Grand Duchy (most of them have profitable Luxembourg subsidiaries too) is to find new means of persuading the wealthy ordinary Belgian to invest at home. 'Ordinary' Belgian bank customers are not small fry. A recent survey showed that with average savings of BFr600,000, Belgians lagged behind only the inhabitants of Switzerland, Japan and Singapore as savers. Separate surveys show that at the end of 1991, Belgian households topped the world league with net household savings taking up 17 per cent of disposable income. Belgians are also extremely well off for banking branches, and daily banking transactions have attained a sophistication which is only just being matched by many other European countries. A nationwide system of cash and debit cards - many linked to the Eurocheque network - means that Belgians can pay for goods at most retail outlets with just a card and their personal code number. In some cases, most notably at petrol stations, the outlet does not even have to be manned. Paradoxically, however, although the big banks provide a blanket service, with branches in every village, their bid to persuade cautious customers to branch out into investments more complex than low-interest savings accounts is relatively recent. Liberalisation and increasing competition - both at an EU and national level  -is beginning to open up the market and all the main participants in Belgium's private financial sector are trying to get involved. For example, the Brussels stock exchange is trying to promote the attractions of ordinary shares - likely to be helped by the proposed reduction in withholding tax on dividends - while listing new products such as warrants. Belfox, the growing futures and options exchange, has a nationwide roadshow aimed at persuading more sophisticated Belgian investors to switch some savings out of low-interest accounts into stock options. Banks, meanwhile, have expanded their range of high-interest accounts, and offer a widening range of Sicavs, a form of unit trust for shares, bonds or currency. They are also rapidly branching out into the potentially lucrative field of bancassurance. By trimming the state's comparatively generous pension benefits, the austerity plan may help accelerate that process by persuading more Belgians that it is worth investing in simple life insurance products, sold through the dense banking network. As Mr Valere Croes, a director of Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch financial services group, says: 'Total saving is as high or even higher than in other countries, but the share of life insurance isn't high enough.' This is where analysts expect most changes to take place. Fortis recently stole a march on its competitors by buying half of CGER-ASLK, a network of savings and insurance branches, from the government, in the first stage of a modest BFr85m four-year privatisation programme. But both insurers and bankers say existing competition between companies already established on the Belgian market will make it difficult for foreign financial institutions to set up from scratch. The privatisation programme - focused at the moment on state-owned credit institutions - is one way into Belgian financial services for outsiders. The rapid evolution of financial services in Belgium is unlikely to slacken off, even if last week's austerity plan is only partially implemented. But if the Belgian government does indeed manage to turn what looked like becoming a winter of discontent into a glorious summer of economic revival, Belgian banking and finance can only benefit.</p>

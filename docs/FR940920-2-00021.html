			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For all transactions made by Floricola, we based FMV on CV in accordance with sections 773(a)(2) and (e) of the Act, because it did not have sufficient sales of such or similar merchandise in the home market or in any third country markets during the POI. Additionally, we based FMV on CV for a portion of Arbusta's and Guaisa's transactions, because these sales had no matches of such or similar merchandise in the third country markets in the same period as the sales made in the United States. For a further discussion, see the ``Third Country Sales Versus Constructed Value'' section of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For all CV transactions, for general expenses, which includes selling and financial expenses (SG&amp;A), we used the greater of the reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of cultivation. For Arbusta's and Guaisa's profit, we used the greater of the weighted-average third country profit during the POI or the statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of cultivation and general expenses, in accordance with section 773(e)(B) of the Act. For Floricola, we based profit on the statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of cultivation and total general expenses, in accordance with section 773(e)(B) of the Act. We based the amortization expense upon amounts normally recorded by each company in their usual recordkeeping. We rejected adjustments that respondents made to the amortization expense solely for purposes of this investigation. We also made specific adjustments to respondents' CV data as described below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Guaisa <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Guaisa, we 1) reallocated general and administrative expenses among products based upon the area under cultivation; 2) removed the effect of a special adjustment made to eliminate the costs associated with a severe windstorm; and 3) reallocated financial expenses among products based upon the area under cultivation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Floricola <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Floricola, we removed the reported net interest income credit from the CV calculation because we only allow interest income to offset the interest expense. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to calculate FMV, we made company-specific adjustments as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Arbusta <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Arbusta, we based FMV on packed prices to unrelated customers in Argentina and Germany. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For third country price-to-purchase price comparisons, we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from FMV under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56. This adjustment included home market inland freight. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For third country price-to-ESP comparisons, we made deductions for foreign inland freight and credit expenses. We also made a deduction for inventory carrying costs based on an inventory carrying period of seven days, as was done for the calculation of USP. We disallowed Arbusta's claimed indirect selling expense adjustment because Arbusta failed to provide an adequate narrative description or a worksheet showing its calculations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We recalculated credit expenses using Arbusta's POI short-term interest rate as discussed in the ``United States Price'' section of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For all price-to-price comparisons, we deducted third country packing costs and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. We recalculated packing expenses in both markets to exclude depreciation on one of Arbusta's packing facilities. In addition, we recalculated these expenses on an annual basis because Arbusta's monthly calculations contained adjusting entries which were not properly matched with the month in which the expense was incurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For CV-to-purchase price comparisons, we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For CV-to-ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We also deducted from CV the weighted-average third country market indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs, up to the amount of the greater of related party commissions or indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). We added U.S. packing expenses, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

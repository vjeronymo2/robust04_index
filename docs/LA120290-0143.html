			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 3 SHOT IN FRACAS AFTER TRAFFIC ACCIDENT  </P> <P> Three Navy seamen were shot during a melee that erupted after a man backed his  car into another car at a Church's Fried Chicken restaurant in the 3100 block  of Main Street, police said.  </P> <P> Thomas Cathcart, 22, was shot twice in the head and remained in serious  condition Saturday at UC San Diego Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said.  Another Navy man, Arnold Coston, 21, was treated at UC San Diego Medical Center  for a gunshot wound in the groin and released Friday afternoon, a hospital  spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The third victim, Kendall Gault, 22, drove himself to Balboa Naval Hospital  after the shooting and was treated for a gunshot wound in the leg, said Lt.  George Saldamando of the police gang unit. Before he was released from the  hospital, San Diego police arrested Gault for his alleged part in the shooting,  Saldamando said.  </P> <P> The Naval Intelligence Service arrested Robert Johnston, 21, and Derick  Robinson, 18, at the 32nd Street Naval base Friday in connection with the  incident. The NIS is working with the gang unit because of the number of  sailors involved in the shooting, Saldamando said.  </P> <P> The police gang unit was called in to investigate because it was first believed  that the shooting was gang related, Saldamando said.  </P> <P> The shooting began about 9:30 p.m. in the parking lot of Church's Fried  Chicken, Saldamando said. About half an hour earlier, a man in the  drive-through line backed up and hit the car behind him, he said.  </P> <P> The occupants of the rear car, all sailors, reportedly got out and began  yelling at the man. One seaman punched the man in the mouth, Saldamando said. A  group of bystanders, also Navy personnel, then intervened, telling the sailors  to leave the man alone, he said.  </P> <P> The first group of sailors got back into their car, saying they would return,  said Saldamando. The man who had originally backed into their car drove off.  Police are looking for him for questioning, he said.  </P> <P> The first group of sailors later returned to the restaurant, and a fight broke  out, Saldamando said.  </P> <P> Johnston reportedly produced a gun, but fell to the ground during the scuffle,  Saldamando said. Gault then retrieved the pistol, firing several rounds into  the crowd, Saldamando said.  </P> <P> Robinson, who also had a gun, fired twice into the crowd, Saldamando said. When  police arrived, they retrieved two shotguns with folding stocks and two  9-millimeter handguns, he said.  </P> <P> Johnston was booked into County Jail downtown on suspicion of assault with a  deadly weapon. Robinson was booked on suspicion of shooting at an occupied car,  and Gault was booked on suspicion of two counts of assault with a deadly  weapon, Saldamando said.  </P> <P> The gang unit on Friday was still interviewing more than 20 people who  witnessed the shooting, he said.  </P></p>

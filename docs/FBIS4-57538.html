			<p>BFN     [Text] Congress has approved the provisional measure  creating the URV [real value unit] and the real. Early on 19  May, Congress approved Provisional Measure 482 creating the URV.    The bill, which was introduced into the Chamber of Deputies  by Deputy Neuto de Conto, was approved by a vote of 281 to 76,  with 3 abstentions. In the Senate the provisional measure was  approved in a symbolic vote.    The provisional measure could be approved only after  negotiations between the government and the rural bloc, which  did not back the bill.    Deputy Nelson Marquezelli, chairman of the Agriculture  Committee, allowed bloc members to vote for the measure because,  according to him, 80 percent of the bloc's demands were granted.    Leftist parties attempted to obstruct the vote because they  wanted the measure to provide for compensation of salary losses  that occurred before implementation of the URV, a minimum salary  of $100 by December 1994, and free collective bargaining.    Brazilian Social Democracy Party lawmakers, however, have  claimed that the provisional measure does grant the last  request, provided salary increases are not transferred to  prices. The measure creates an index for adjustment of prices  and salaries in reals in case of inflation, sets 1 July for  circulation of the new currency, and establishes a single index  for adjustment of prices and for financing agricultural  production.</p>

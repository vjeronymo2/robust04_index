			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMMIGRANTS URGED TO TRY ONE MORE TIME FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM  </P> <P> Maria Ester Contreras, a 29-year-old immigrant who claims to have been tortured  by the military in El Salvador, said she was furious when a U.S. immigration  agent "laughed in my face and made fun of me" as she applied for political  asylum.  </P> <P> "The way they treated me was very bad," she said. "There was a total lack of  respect."  </P> <P> After her application was denied last year, she considered returning to El  Salvador or perhaps living in Los Angeles as an illegal immigrant. But a  federal judge's action gave new life to her asylum application.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Campaign Aimed at Immigrants  </P> <P> Although Contreras has decided to seek political asylum a second time,  representatives of the Central American Refugee Center and other immigrants'  rights groups said they fear others may not. They announced a campaign Friday  to encourage the immigrants to resubmit their applications and forget the "bad  experiences" of their first interviews.  </P> <P> "The message they've gotten is that they don't qualify for political asylum,"  said Linton Joaquin, an attorney with the refugee center. "It's important that  they get the message that they can reapply."  </P> <P> On May 15, U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. ordered a halt to  deportation proceedings against Contreras and an estimated 23,000 other  immigrants who had applied for asylum in Los Angeles in the last year. He also  granted them the right to plead their case in a second interview.  </P> <P> The action, effective over 90 days, was made in response to complaints from  immigrants' rights groups that asylum applications by immigrants from war-torn  Central America were being summarily denied by the Immigration and  Naturalization Service after only cursory review.  </P> <P> In a suit filed earlier this year, the National Center for Immigrants Rights  alleged that immigrants applying for asylum had no access to interpreters  during their interviews with INS officials. The suit further alleged that many  interviews were conducted in only a few minutes, without giving the applicants  any meaningful chance to argue that they faced persecution in their homelands.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Counseling Available  </P> <P> Joaquin said the refugee center and other groups, including El Rescate and the  Immigrants Rights Organization, will open their offices to counsel the  immigrants about their rights in the wake of the judge's decision. Political  asylum applicants have the right to bring witnesses to their interviews, to  present documents supporting their cases and to request work permits, Joaquin  said.  </P> <P> The judge's order affects those who have applied for asylum in Los Angeles  since June, 1988, when INS officials created a task force in Los Angeles to  deal with thousands of "frivolous" applications for asylum. The immigration  officials argued that the applications were filed by immigrants who were  fleeing their countries not because they were politically persecuted but  because they sought to escape poverty.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Interview Procedures  </P> <P> Officials have denied that the task force processed the immigrants'  applications unfairly. But at the judge's request, they submitted a plan  earlier this month to change how asylum interviews are conducted.  </P> <P> Pilar Luna, assistant regional counsel for the INS, said the plan includes  provisions for a "permanent cadre of trained asylum examiners" and the  preparation of a new procedures manual for officials who conduct the  interviews.  </P> <P> Despite the new procedures, Contreras is still pessimistic about her chances.  She said she was targeted for persecution in El Salvador apparently because of  her brother's activities at a university in eastern El Salvador.  </P> <P> "I'm not very hopeful, but I have to keep on fighting," she said. "I can't go  back to my country. There's a war going on there."  </P></p>

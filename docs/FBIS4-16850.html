			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir </F> Gavrilov]    [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- The Tajik opposition delegation is  holding a conference in Moscow today to draw up its proposal on  the venue and date for the next round of talks with  representatives of official Dushanbe. It is expected to be held  either in Islamabad or in Tehran. According to the Tajik  Embassy in Moscow, the opposition does not insist on Emomali  Rakhmonov, chairman of the republic's Supreme Soviet, being  there.    The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from the same sources  that by and large the Dushanbe delegation positively assesses  the results of the first round, at which agreement was reached  with the opposition not to allow hostile actions on the  Afghan-Tajik border.    The sides have expressed their determination to continue  dialogues and to seek a compromise, even though their stands on  the agenda remain unchanged. Thus, the Dushanbe delegation  still believes it is advisable first to ensure peace on the  Afghan-Tajik border and the return of refugees, and then to hold  a referendum on the Tajik constitution and presidential  elections. On the other hand, the opposition will come to the  next round with the same package of documents as before  concerning the refugee problem, political settlement in the  country, the revocation of the ban on the activities of  political parties and movements, setting up a State Council made  up of independent persons, and a referendum on the constitution.    The first round of talks between the Tajik authorities and  the opposition has been taking place in Moscow since 6 April.  On 17 April Hoji Akbar Turajonzoda, one of the eminent  opposition leaders, arrived from Islamabad to take part. Also  present has been Muhammadsharif Himmatzoda, chairman of the  Islamic Rebirth Party. The talks have been conducted with the  assistance of Ramiro Piriz Ballon, the UN secretary general's  special envoy in Tajikistan.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> UNION CRITICIZES CONTRACT OFFER  </P> <P> A union representative for about 200 employees of the Ventura County Community  College District, who have been working without a contract since July 1, said  Monday that union leaders are unhappy with the district's latest contract  offer.  </P> <P> Gregory Cross, field representative for the local chapter of the Service  Employees International Union, said the union is dissatisfied with salary  increases and benefits offered by the district.  </P> <P> The union represents secretaries, librarians, laboratory technicians,  maintenance workers and other classified employees. The three-year contract  currently under negotiation would affect more than 400 employees at Moorpark,  Oxnard and Ventura colleges, although only half of those workers are  dues-paying union members.  </P> <P> Jerry Pauley, the district's associate vice chancellor for personnel and one of  the district's chief negotiators, declined to comment Monday on details of the  offer.  </P> <P> But Cross said the offer includes a 3% raise, effective immediately, another 3%  raise next January, and a 4% salary increase next July. However, he said, the  union is seeking a 4% raise immediately, a 3% increase next February and a  negotiable increase in July, 1991.  </P> <P> Another sticking point is a district proposal to put a $445.70-a-month cap on  health insurance premiums, Cross said. If premiums increase beyond that amount,  employees would have to pay the difference. "People are not happy about that,"  he said.  </P> <P> Two other college district employee groups, the 390-member teachers group and a  supervisors group, have also been working without contracts since July 1,  Pauley said. The district is also negotiating with those groups. ADRIANNE  GOODMAN  </P></p>

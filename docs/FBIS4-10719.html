			<p>BFN     [Text] An initial deposit of $2.8 billion, which the  government will make today for repaying its foreign debt, will  be the start of a marathon of disbursements which will permit  rescheduling the debt's principal over a 30-year period. In the  final analysis, however, how much will Brazil pay in interest to  foreign creditors over the next few years? It is difficult to  know the exact figure. Almost 55 percent of the debt  certificates that are being exchanged are fixed earning papers  with an annual ceiling of 8 percent interest. Yet in the case  of fluctuating rates, payments will be subject to the variation  of interest abroad.    Michael Gartenkraut, economic affairs secretary during the  Jose Sarney government, estimates that the debt agreement will  permit the government to economize around $2 billion per year.  He says that the savings will stem from the reduction in  principal and interest.    Gartenkraut says: "These are preliminary figures, as they  depend on the creditor banks' decision to choose fixed or  fluctuating interest rates. In addition, they will also depend  on the level of interest abroad."    According to Carlos Langoni, former Central Bank president  and current director of the FGV [Getulio Vargas Foundation]  World Economy Center, the debt agreement could increase  remittances abroad in the long term, but will make payments  regular.    Langoni says: "This agreement is much more advantageous than  the previous ones, as it will effectively reduce the principal,  setting more reasonable repayment periods."    Langoni agrees with Joel Korn, executive vice president of  the Bank of America, who believes that the Brazilian foreign  debt problem has been resolved. According to him, considering  that Brazil has a good reserves level and increasing exports,  the debt will no longer be an obstacle for economic growth.    "With the reduction of the so-called Brazil risk, the  country  will be able to obtain money abroad at a much lower cost. In  addition, risk investment in the private sector will grow,  especially by countries like Japan," Langoni says.    Not everyone agrees. Economist Gerald Medley, of Pactual  Bank, believes that as far as obtaining money is concerned, the  external market is in very poor condition. According to him,  the reason is the lack of definition of interest rates in the  United States, and the uncertainties in the stabilization of the  Brazilian economy.    "Banks do not want those papers in their portfolios. Even  countries that have already concluded a debt agreement, like  Mexico and Argentina, are finding it difficult to obtain money.  The time is not right," he says.</p>

The studies  were performed on free bronze consisting of copper plus 11  weight percent tin and 2 weight percent gallium after  homogenization at 700C for 20 hours, as well as on a single  filament of Nb/Cu plus 11 weight percent tin and 2 weight  percent gallium after hot compaction and on a composite  consisting of 7,225 filaments of the same composite that had  been subjected to diffusion annealing at 700C for 72 hours.  The study specimens were examined under a JEM-200 CX  transmission electron microscope and JCXA-733 scanning electron  microscope/microanalyzer. The addition of gallium to the study  composites was demonstrated to cause an increase in the number  of twins and _e_-phase formations in the bronze matrix due to a  decrease in packing defect formation energy. During the course  of diffusion annealing, the gallium diffused into the  Nb[.sub]3[/]Sn layer and was partially preserved in the  bronze matrix. Gallium was also found to increase the grain size  in the superconducting layer and to not facilitate any increase  in its thickness. The dissolution of gallium in  Nb[.sub]3[/]Sn in large quantity during the course of  diffusion annealing was found to result in an increase in the  electrical resistance of the said phase in its normal state and,  consequently, in an elevation of the upper critical field. This  result is in turn associated with the higher current-conducting  capability of gallium-alloyed conductors in high magnetic fields  versus that of their nonalloyed counterparts.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Housing Forum has given the go-ahead  for the 90 billion rands housing scheme for the poor which was  announced by the government three weeks ago. The forum, which  put the final touches to the plan yesterday, said a subsidy  policy would be in place for individual, collective and rental  ownership. The plan would also provide for a mechanism to  obtain mortgage and nonmortgage-based finance.    The forum's decision to support the government's housing  subsidy scheme has been welcomed by Housing Minister Louis  Shill. Mr. Shill caused a stir several weeks ago by announcing  the scheme while it was still under discussion.    In a separate development, the government has approved the  provision of funds to begin the construction of the flood  attenuation [as heard] dam outside Ladysmith. The funds, which  will form part of the department of water affairs and forestry  budget, will become available on the first of next month.</p>

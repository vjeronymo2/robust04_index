			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Management: The China syndrome - Increasing numbers of Hong Kong manufacturing companies are leaving the colony in pursuit of cheap land and labour 'WE USED to enjoy taking people over our factories, but not so much now,' says William Ho, finance director of Video Technologies (Vtech), a Hong Kong-based manufacturer of computers, telecommunications and educational toys. 'They are so empty.' Ho looks along a line of women assembling and testing 'mother boards' for the company's latest desktop computer and says: 'We'll be moving this all to China in the near future. We will then use the space for conference rooms and places for customers to meet our salesmen.' At another company, Steven Lam, managing director of Truly Electronics, a toys, calculators and much else besides manufacturer, is in full flight, extolling the industry of his fellow Chiu Chow compatriots. 'Working 10 hours in a day is nothing for a Chiu Chow person: 16, 17, 18 hours a day is more normal; and no holidays,' he says. In 1984, Lam set up a factory in Shanwei, a town on the south coast of the Chiu Chow-speaking region of Guangdong which boarders Fujian province. His family comes from the town and his 72-year-old father, Tam Tak Ming, has resettled there to oversee a burgeoning family business which today employs 3,500 people. A quiet business revolution is underway in southern China. In the continuing search for lower costs and higher productivity, a new division of labour is being created. Hong Kong's manufacturers are exporting their production facilities wholesale to Guangdong, the province of China which borders the colony. Truly moved all its manufacturing capacity to Shanwei in 1988. Currently Vtech makes 95 per cent of its toys and educational games in Dongguan, south-east of Guangzhou (Canton), 50 per cent of its telecommunications equipment and 30 per cent (soon to be 70 per cent) of its computers there. These manufacturers, and thousands like them, are taking advantage of the cheap land and labour in southern China, and the new-found willingness of the communist Chinese to permit capitalist enterprise in the mainland. Truly recently acquired a 99-year lease on 2.2m square feet of land adjacent to its present factory in Shanwei for Dollars 1.2m (Pounds 620,000). 'The land is virtually free of charge,' says Joe Lok, Truly's finance director. He points out that in Hong Kong, Truly would spend more than that in rent in less than two years. The cost of labour is also a fraction of Hong Kong levels. Vtech employs 6,500 workers at its factories in Dongguan. Many come from other provinces so it undertakes to house and feed all the people it employs. In addition to wages, it also pays a per capita management fee to the Dongguan authorities. The total of all the costs comes to HKDollars 700 (Pounds 47) a worker a month - just 23 per cent of the wage bill for a similar worker in Hong Kong. But costs are not the only reason for locating in Guangdong. The local authorities do not interfere in the running of factories and are less stringent about health, safety and environmental limits to corporate growth. 'Contractually, Vtech subcontracts the assembly of its products to the factory which is owned by Dongguan Foreign Investment Development Corporation,' says Ho. 'Practically, they don't have any people there; it's all run by us.' China is seen as a source of cheap labour - which it is - but 'cheap' also suggests lack of skill. Not so, say Vtech and Truly. Vtech has hired 70 engineers who have recently graduated from some of China's top universities. For Alan Wong, Vtech's chairman and founder, 'one of the biggest resources in China that is overlooked is its large pool of good engineers. 'Engineers are our biggest need. Product cycles are getting shorter and shorter and you need a lot of engineers to turn out new products and ideas. You can't do that in Europe and the US because engineers are so expensive.' Vtech pays its local engineers Yuan 800 (Pounds 76) a month - three times what they would earn if employed by one of China's state industries. Similarly, Truly's factory in Shanwei is managed by local people; only the top engineers come from abroad. There are 14 Hong Kong engineers and six Swiss engineers advising on the manufacture of parts for watches which are then exported to Switzerland. Truly owns Ernst Borel, a Swiss watch manufacturer, and it is marrying Swiss engineering to the low costs of southern China. The six Swiss engineers are in China to teach local engineers the finer points of watch making. But doing business in China, even for the Chinese, is not always successful. Vtech first dipped its toe in the water with a HKDollars 10m investment in Shenzhen, a special economic zone which runs the length of the Hong Kong-China boarder, but it failed. 'Our partner was a northerner who followed too many rules and red tape,' says Ho, a southerner who was born and bred in Hong Kong. 'The first moment we talked to the Dongguan authorities we saw that they were open minded and very business-like. They impressed us from the very first meeting. They also came to us when the agreements were ready to be signed; our previous partner had asked us to go to him to sign.' Relationships, or guangxi, are key to doing business in Guangdong, and China more generally. Truly has gone as far as to have a dedicated team, consisting of seven executives - one of whom was a senior communist party official - who do nothing other that make and cement relationships with government officials throughout China. 'Everything is relationships; without relationships you can't do anything,' says Lam. 'If you are not a local person you can't make relationships. If you want to invest there, you have got to be Chinese. Communication is easier and city officials prefer to deal with Chinese. 'When we want to develop a city, then we send the team there first. In the south if you send an official a television set, he will turn up his nose; in the north they are content with a radio.'</p>

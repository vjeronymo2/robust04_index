			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHAWN MORAN'S JOURNEY HOME HAS BEEN ROUGH  </P> <P> Shawn Moran, a speedway motorcycle racer from Huntington Beach, hopes he's more  successful tonight on the 190-yard oval at the Orange County Fairgrounds than  he was traveling from London to Southern California to participate in the U.S.  Speedway championship.  </P> <P> Moran was unsuccessful in reserving a nonstop flight from London's Heathrow  Airport to Los Angeles after a race at Cradley Heath and opted for a layover in  New York on Monday morning instead.  </P> <P> But his flight from New York was canceled after a two-hour delay on the runaway  when the plane encountered fuel problems. Moran and Ronnie Correy, who also is  scheduled to ride at 8 tonight, were bumped on another flight from New York and  had to accept a flight to St. Louis before arriving in Los Angeles nearly 24  hours after departing from London.  </P> <P> "I'm a little tired," Moran said. "Normally we don't have problems coming home  to race, but you never know."  </P> <P> Moran's travel delay was typical of his 10th season of racing in the British  Speedway League. Earlier this year, he was banned from all world championship  events by the governing Federation of International Motorcyclists after testing  positive for alcohol during a qualifying race for the world long track  championship in West Germany.  </P> <P> The ruling meant that Moran, one of the top five riders in the world, was not  allowed to compete in the long track world final, team cup and pairs  championships. Saturday, Moran earned a measure of success in an otherwise  disappointing season when he became the first U.S. rider to win the British  League Riders' Championship.  </P> <P> The race pits the top scoring rider from each team in the league, with 16  riders competing in five scratch races. That format will be used tonight at the  Orange County Fairgrounds to determine the national champion.  </P> <P> In the British championship, Moran was tied with Hans Nielsen after four rounds  of racing and they met in the final heat of the meeting. Nielsen drew the pole  position, with Moran starting on the outside and two riders sandwiched between  them.  </P> <P> Moran guessed correctly that Nielsen, the newly crowned world champion, would  drift outside to a layer of dirt through the first turn, and he slipped  underneath Nielsen to gain the victory in the four-lap race.  </P> <P> "It was my world championship," Moran said. "The race is more difficult to win  than the world championship. You generally have a couple of riders in the world  championship from Eastern Bloc countries who would never qualify for this race.  It was great winning on my home track."  </P> <P> Moran has ridden only once at Costa Mesa. He said adjusting to the fairgrounds'  smaller track won't be easy.  </P> <P> "You're talking about a distance of maybe 30 yards from the starting gate  through the first turn at Costa Mesa, while we have about 80 yards on the  tracks in England," Moran said. "The starts are so important here."  </P> <P> Moran adjusted just fine in 1982, when he won the U.S. Championship after  spending the season in Europe. But he was a champion in absentia, opting to  return to Europe. If Moran wins tonight, will he decide to stay home and race  in Southern California next year?  </P> <P> "I've given that a lot of thought," he said. "Initially I thought about riding  here next year. I've spent 10 years in England . . . that's a long time to be  away from home. But I've decided to go back next year.  </P> <P> "I'm going all out to win here, I'm going to do my very best. I'm not just  showing up to get some more Mexican food and then go back to England."  </P> <P> Speedway Notes  </P> <P> In the 21st season of racing at the Orange County Fairgrounds, total attendance  for 27 weeks was 104,477. The average attendance was 3,869. . . . The leading  scratch riders for the season at Costa Mesa were Mike Faria, Billy Hamill and  Alan Christian, all with five victories. Bobby Schwartz, the top qualifier for  the championship with 107 points at five tracks, won only two scratch mains. .  . . The prospects of Steve Lucero repeating as champion are slim. Only two  riders -- Bruce Penhall and Kelly Moran -- have repeated in the 1980s.  </P> <P> PAST CHAMPIONS  </P> <P> 1969 Steve Bast  </P> <P> 1970 Rick Woods  </P> <P> 1971 Mike Bast  </P> <P> 1972 Rick Woods  </P> <P> 1973 Mike Bast  </P> <P> 1974 Steve Bast  </P> <P> 1975 Mike Bast  </P> <P> 1976 Mike Bast  </P> <P> 1977 Mike Bast  </P> <P> 1978 Mike Bast  </P> <P> 1979 Mike Bast  </P> <P> 1980 Bruce Penhall  </P> <P> 1981 Bruce Penhall  </P> <P> 1982 Shawn Moran  </P> <P> 1983 Kelly Moran  </P> <P> 1984 Kelly Moran  </P> <P> 1985 Alan Christian  </P> <P> 1986 Bobby Schwartz **  </P> <P> 1987 Brad Oxley ***  </P> <P> 1988 Steve Lucero  </P> <P> * Bast defeated Mike Konle in a runoff.  </P> <P> ** Schwartz defeated Robert Pfetzing in a runoff.  </P> <P> *** Oxley defeated Bobby Ott in a runoff.  </P></p>

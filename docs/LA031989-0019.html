			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: TRUTH -- OR TRASH?  </P> <P> Stephen J. Cannell and co-producers are getting ready to shoot a  "docu-re-creation" of the personal story of director Peter Bogdanovich and his  wife, Louise Stratten -- over their objections. It will be one of five segments  of an ABC reality-TV special, "Scandals," in the works for May sweeps. The  couple has let it be known "they consider it an invasion of privacy," said  Bogdanovich's attorney, Bill Peiffer.  </P> <P> Hugh Hefner and the late Dorothy Stratten will be also be depicted in scenes  re-creating moments from their lives; casting for look-alikes is under way,  with production to begin this week.  </P> <P> Bogdanovich, 49, who was romantically involved with and wrote a book about  murdered Playboy centerfold Dorothy Stratten, recently married the late  actress' younger sister, Louise, 20.  </P> <P> Peiffer said he has informed the "Scandals" producers -- Loreen Arbus and  Meredith MacRae in association with Cannell -- that "neither Mr. Bogdanovich  nor his wife will be cooperating or participating in this project." He added  that no legal action will be considered until his clients have viewed the  special.  </P> <P> Arbus told us: "Everything we're doing is a matter of public record."  </P> <P> She said that the segment relies on interviews with persons close to the  couple, including Louise's closest friend. "Every statement made, every scene  re-enacted is validated by a first-hand or credible published source."  </P> <P> Arbus further insisted: "By no stretch of the imagination can this be  associated with tabloid or -- God forbid -- trash TV. Stephen Cannell would  never be associated with anything that was not legitimate and neither would I.  For one thing, my parents would disown me."  </P> <P> Arbus' dad is the legendary Leonard H. Goldenson, founding father of ABC. From  Stacy Jenel Smith  </P></p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / ICI cuts size of Zeneca rights IMPERIAL Chemical Industries has cut the size of the rights issue for Zeneca, the bioscience business being demerged from the chemicals group. However, the price is expected to be towards the top end of forecasts at about 590p to 600p. A meeting of the board and underwriters to confirm the terms will be held today. They will be announced at 7.30am. It is expected that the issue will have been priced to raise slightly less than the Pounds 1.3bn originally planned, as the stock market has become concerned at the level of cash calls on it. The government's BT 3 sale, likely to raise over Pounds 5bn, is due in July. Rather than the expected 1-for-3 issue, the terms will probably be set at 3-for-10. That could cut the amount raised to around Pounds 1.25bn after expenses. The main difficulty in pricing the issue has been that the demerged shares of new ICI and Zeneca have yet to start trading, giving no base to value the rights shares. There were still doubts that the issue would be warmly received. 'At 600p this looks like a second division player being sold at a first division rating,' a pharmaceuticals analyst said. Institutions said they would be unwilling to sub-underwrite the issue at more than 610p. They wanted the price set to give a yield above the market average to offset Zeneca's perceived low growth prospects. The company has already said it will pay a 27.5p net dividend this year. Grey market trading in the demerged and the rights shares will start at 2.30pm today, when the sub-underwriting should have been completed. It also coincides with the start of business in New York. Official dealings in the new shares are due to start on June 1, so long as ICI shareholders approve the demerger at a special meeting on May 28. A plan to 'recycle' rights shares, through an international syndicate of brokers, is expected to meet only modest demand. US investors, one of the main target audiences for Zeneca's roadshows, are thought to be more interested in the new-ICI business. At present, US investors favour cyclical rather than drugs stocks. The latter have been hit by uncertainty over US health care reforms. Lex, Page 20</p>

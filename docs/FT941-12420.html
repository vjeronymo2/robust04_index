			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Israel and PLO close to a deal: Arafat and Peres to pursue self-rule agreement at meeting in Cairo Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation last night said they were on the verge of a breakthrough agreement which would allow for an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, and Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said after a marathon session of talks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that further work on the draft agreement was needed, but that they would meet in Cairo in a week. 'There is more than a fair chance that we can complete our work,' Mr Peres said, adding it was the first time he had forecast a timescale for conclusion of the agreement on implementing Palestinian self-rule. Mr Arafat said the 'main principles' had been agreed on but more time was needed for drafting the deal. Neither side gave details of the draft deal, but Israeli officials in Jerusalem said the critical breakthrough in Davos had been broad agreement on security at border crossings between Gaza and Egypt and between Jordan and Jericho. The issue, along with disagreements over the size of the Jericho area and the security of Israeli settlers, has dogged moves to implement the initial Israeli-PLO accord signed last September. Israeli officials said the two sides agreed that although most Israeli security checks of Palestinians crossing the borders would be conducted 'invisibly' by electronic means, Israel could still retain the right physically to check Palestinians suspected of security violations. The PLO had withdrawn its demand to control the roads leading to the crossings in return for an Israeli concession to grant the Palestinians access corridors from the self-government areas to the border crossings. Officials said a copy of a draft wording on the border issue had been sent to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and returned largely approved but with some reservations to Mr Peres for last night's negotiating session. Israel also conceded safe passage of Palestinians by land corridor to the religious site of Nebbi Mussa and to the northern Dead Sea where Israel and the PLO will establish a joint-venture tourist resort. On the second substantive obstacle - the size of the Jericho area - an area of about 60 sq km had been agreed, the officials said. Israel had previously offered 25 sq km and the PLO had demanded 345 sq km. Officials said last night's talks focused on the last important outstanding issue - the security arrangements for Jewish settlers who will remain in Gaza. Israel has demanded a wide area of operation - up to 46 sq km - to protect Israelis in their settlements and on roads between the settlements and Israel. Earlier yesterday, Mr Arafat and Mr Peres had saluted each other warmly on the platform at Davos in front of 800 international business leaders. Mr Arafat thanked Mr Peres 'for his positive stance which I had felt and touched during these talks'. Mr Peres paid tribute to Mr Arafat's 'supreme effort to bring our two peoples together in the domain of peace and hope'. He invited business leaders from the US, Europe and Japan to come to a regional economic conference which is being planned for Amman later this year to help 'to build the new Middle East'. Both men emphasised the need for building 'an economic platform' on which an enduring peace in the region could be erected. Israel's health minister may quit, Page 4</p>

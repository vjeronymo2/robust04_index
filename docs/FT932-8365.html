			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Diploma shows improvement to Pounds 8.1m DIPLOMA, the electronics, building products and special steels group, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 8.1m in the six months to March 31. However, the advance was flattered by the restating of last time's figures to conform with FRS 3 accounting standards. As reported, the previous profits emerged at Pounds 6.2m; restated, the losses of Pounds 1.1m on a disposal and Pounds 2.6m on goodwill have now become exceptional charges. Mr Christopher Thomas, chairman, said that the six months under review had been one of 'two contrasting quarters, with considerably greater buoyancy in the more recent period'. He said that 'the worst of the long, deep recession appears to be over, if our own experience over the last few months is indicative'. As previously, there were two star performers. Macro, the active components distributor, made profits of Pounds 3.2m on turnover of Pounds 29m out of the electronic division's Pounds 5.7m and Pounds 49m totals. It lifted its own profits and sales 75 per cent and 35 per cent respectively. Mr Thomas added that the smaller Nortronic also performed well, with profits up 50 per cent. The other star was IG Lintels, which made Pounds 2.5m of the building products division's Pounds 2.7m, though the first quarter had been 'unexciting'. However loss-making Norwood Partitions had to be reorganised and its workforce halved to 30, resulting in an exceptional debit of Pounds 1.1m. Again oil sector uncertainty affected steels, though the reorganised H Whitham increased profitability. Group turnover was Pounds 74m (Pounds 61.9m) and operating profits Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 5.1m). The interim dividend is hoisted to 3.5p (2.75p), payable from earnings per share of 10.7p (7.3p).</p>

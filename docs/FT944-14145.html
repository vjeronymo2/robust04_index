			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Investor watchdog hints at review of heavy fine tactic A shift away from the use of heavy fines for financial organisations which fail to meet regulatory standards was signalled yesterday by Ms Colette Bowe, chief executive of the Personal Investment Authority. Speaking at the Chartered Insurance Institute, Ms Bowe said one task facing the PIA, the new watchdog to protect the private investor, was to develop its own approach to discipline. 'My own personal view is that massive fines which, in the case of a mutual, end up being paid by existing policyholders, are not always the most appropriate form of discipline,' she said. Her comments appeared to contrast with the views of Lautro, the watchdog's predecessor in regulating life companies. The record penalty imposed by Lautro rose this year from Pounds 180,000 levied on Legal &amp; General in February to Pounds 300,000 on Premium Life and Norwich Union in April. Ms Bowe seemed to favour a more clear focus on individual responsibilities in errant organisations - which would require the watchdog to introduce registration of individuals as well as companies. The regulator plans to issue consultation papers on both registration and discipline early next year.</p>

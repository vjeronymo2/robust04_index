			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALSO WORTH WATCHING  </P> <P> Annette Funicello joins the cast of Make Room for Daddy (next Sunday at 1 a.m.  on Nickelodeon) as Gina, an exchange student from Italy. That was in 1959,  before her Beach Party days.  </P> <P> For once, Mason and Hamilton Burger are on the same side on Perry Mason  (Tuesday at 7 p.m. on KDOC). The defendant in "The Case of the Prudent  Prosecutor" is the D.A.'s friend, so he disqualifies himself and asks Mason to  defend him.  </P> <P> The harmless ending of The Dick Van Dyke Show was controversial back in 1963,  when it first aired. In "That's My Boy??" (Tuesday at 1 p.m. on KDOC) Rob is  convinced that the baby he and Laura have brought home from the hospital isn't  theirs. The kicker that explains why Rob needn't have worried almost didn't  make it on the air.  </P> <P> Ex-Angel Farrah Fawcett returns to Charlie's Angels (Wednesday at 2 p.m. on  KTLA) as Jill Munroe long enough to help rescue her on-screen sister Kris  (Cheryl Ladd) from kidnapers.  </P> <P> Later in the week, a pre-Angel Ladd is in safer hands with Richie Cunningham,  who wins a date with her on Happy Days (Saturday at noon on KTLA). Arnold  becomes a theatrical star in Hooterville and heads West to become a Hollywood  ham, in a two-part Green Acres (Monday and Tuesday at 9 p.m. on Nickelodeon).  </P> <P> The second Star Trek pilot, "Where No Man Has Gone Before" (Wednesday at  midnight on KCOP), was the one that sold the series to NBC.  </P> <P> Those pesky little creatures, "The Invaders," go after Agnes Moorehead in The  Twilight Zone (Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. on KTLA).  </P> <P> Nickelodeon will add the old, half-hour Alfred Hitchcock Presents to its  lineup, beginning Saturday. It will air Monday through Friday at 11 p.m. and  Saturday and Sunday at 11:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Simka (Carol Kane) makes her debut on Taxi (Thursday at 11:30 p.m. on KTLA) and  falls for Latka.  </P></p>

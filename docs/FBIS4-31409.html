			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article compiled by Sabina Augustynowicz: "The Securities </F> Commission Has Been in Operation for Three Years Now; We Are  Waiting for Institutional Investors"]    [Text] The Securities Commission [Komisja Papierow  Wartosciowych, KPW] has just ended its third year of existence.  KPW Chief Leslaw Paga, while proposing a toast, said that one  does not drink to the health of children, but one can make an  exception in order for the stock market to continue to develop  as successfully as it has thus far.    According to many people associated with the stock market in  various ways, the capital market in Poland has been developing  correctly. That does not mean, of course, that no changes are  needed that would guarantee the market's correct development.    Professor Grzegorz Domanski, chief of the Council of  the Securities Stock Market: The Polish capital market has  been developing in the same way as a majority of institutions of  the market economy in our country. There is no reason for the  market to deviate from that general pattern. After all, the  capital market is an integral part of the entire economic  system, so it progresses along with the system. The rate of  reforms we have been witnessing in the entire economy is  directly reflected in the rate of changes in the capital market  and also in its development. Despite being a very young market,  it has already undergone changes. First, it has undergone a  substantial calming down, and anyone who influences its  regulatory shape and feels morally responsible is very happy  about it. Currently, we are counting very much on two things: a  speeding up of the development of brokerage houses that have  clearly been becoming a bottleneck in the stock market's  development, and, second, we want our securities market to stop  being a market for individual investors and petty money grubbers  and to become, instead, a market of institutional investors. We  are already witnessing some symptoms of the changes. So, if we  manage to invite institutional investors into the game, and if  we manage to strengthen brokerage houses, we have a very bright  future ahead of us.    Andrzej Celinski of the Freedom Union: I am not a  professional. I am just a politician who is interested in  economics. From my nonprofessional standpoint, the capital  market in Poland has been developing correctly, although perhaps  somewhat too cautiously. Perhaps the development of the Warsaw  Stock Market does not meet expectations or needs. Besides,  institutions dealing with the capital market have a too limited  array of services. In Poland, not only is the stock market too  "thin" and small, with new companies entering it too slowly, but  we also do not have new economic institutions with the necessary  infrastructure for development of the capital market--for  instance, property rights insurance. It is an institution that  is known to every outside investor. But those investors do not  find it here in Poland. This makes the investment processes  very difficult, especially those that require changes in the  ownership of, for instance, land or industrial premises. In my  view, another issue is the array of offers of different  financial services, which continues to be limited. Practically  speaking, there are no venture capital [preceding two words in  English] organizations in Poland--that is, with capital that  requires the kind of investors using primarily their own ideas,  unique expertise, and knowledge, and looking for deep gaps in  the market as the basis. Countries that are developing at a  fast rate--and Poland is definitely becoming such a country--and  that are quickly changing ownership structures need offers going  beyond the traditional offer of bank credit as a necessary  ingredient for development of young entrepreneurship. Generally  speaking, the stock market is developing a bit too slowly, but  we understand the position of those who guard it against  misfortune.    Stock Market Chairman Wieslaw Rozlucki: It is  difficult to be my own judge, but I think the first three years  were good. We managed to avoid major mistakes. Some things are  just beyond our control. The stock market's management cannot  control the market itself or prices that either rise or fall too  quickly. These issues are beyond our capabilities. I think the  fundamental assumptions stood their test. In the beginning,  there was nothing like a major involvement of interests and  money that currently determine the shares' value. I am afraid  that, unfortunately, the next three years will not be as good in  the sense of avoiding conflicts or settling problems  professionally. Of course, there are a few things that should be  changed. We are waiting for institutional investors, better  advisers, and better services provided to our customers. In my  view, company analysis, fundamental analysis, and investment  counseling remain the bottlenecks. But, as everybody can see,  those bottlenecks keep changing every few months, followed by  new problems that we try to overcome, and, in this way, the  market is gradually developing.</p>

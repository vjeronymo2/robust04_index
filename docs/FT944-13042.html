			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Locking not a good step Sir, Christopher Jackson's assertion (Letters, October 26) that 'Given adequate convergence, the idea of irrevocable locking of member currencies at an earlier stage than domestic use of the Ecu seems increasingly attractive' is wrong headed, for the following reasons: The divergence of member countries' inflation rates, tax rates, and national debt is far too great for convergence to be realistic. Even if the member nations manage their affairs sufficiently well that the (Eu)topia comes about, then convergence will be natural and formalities unnecessary. 'Irrevocable locking' is tantamount to the single currency. It would remove the present ability of different areas to devalue or revalue the currencies continually and automatically, thereby adjusting factors of production and maintaining the balance of trade. The result of locking will be additional depressed areas and endemic unemployment, particularly in the areas where such conditions already exist. The Maastricht treaty already allows for this by creating 'cohesion funds and structural funds' for the rich areas to patronise the poor areas. Your interview with Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute ('Single currency should be delayed, says EU bank chief', October 24) is a timely reminder that the threat of the single currency is ever present, even after the ERM debacle.

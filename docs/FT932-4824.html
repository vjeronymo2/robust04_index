			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Berlusconi facing pressure totrim sails INTERNATIONAL media magnate Silvio Berlusconi is under rising pressure to scale down his broadcasting activities in Italy, as reform of the country's crowded television and broadcasting frequencies has unexpectedly moved up the political agenda. The government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, prime minister, is planning to re-examine the Mammi law, named after a former posts and telecommunications minister, which is increasingly seen as excessively favouring Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest company. Ministers recognise the complex and controversial nature of broadcasting reform means any new rules will have to be pushed through well before the general election expected this year. The sense of urgency has been heightened by the belief that likely electoral reform may loosen party discipline, further complicating efforts to rewrite the braodcasting rules. The electoral success yesterday of the autonomist Lega Nord (Northern Leagues) in local elections is also likely to add to calls for greater regional devolution of some of the state-controlled broadcasting media. Although a recent parliamentary attempt by the Lega to transfer one of the three state television channels to Milan from Rome was overturned, it received considerable support from MPs. Fininvest controls three television channels and accounts for about 45 per cent of the total audience. Three other channels are held by the RAI public sector broadcasting group, while the remaining six national channels are divided among various private broadcasters. The Mammi law has also been attacked by hostile newspaper proprietors, who claim it gives Fininvest a dominant position in broadcasting and unfairly distorts the advertising market in favour of television. Demands for change have gathered steam as the recession has hit advertising revenues, which have fallen particularly sharply for printed media. Fininvest denies that the Mammi law is biased in its favour. It argues that Mr Berlusconi was obliged to give up control of Italy's three pay-TV channels, in which Fininvest now has only a minority stake, and of a national newspaper to meet its requirements. However, the group has come under growing fire after the arrest of Mr Davide Giacalone, an adviser to the erstwhile minister, in connection with political corruption investigations. Mr Giacalone negotiated a lucrative L420m (Pounds 184,000) contract as a consultant to Fininvest, after leaving the posts ministry. Fininvest spokesmen argue the contract was entirely above board.</p>

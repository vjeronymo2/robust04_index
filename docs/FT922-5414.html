			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Labour urged to seize Rio agenda LABOUR must seize the environment and development agenda of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro this week as central themes for the 1990s, Mr John Smith, the favourite to win the party leadership, said last night. In a campaign meeting in Newcastle upon Tyne, the shadow chancellor fleshed out his vision of an international 'green' alliance between less-developed and industrialised countries to devise solutions to Third World needs. Mr Bryan Gould, his rival for the leadership, speaking in his Dagenham constituency, defended the importance of the public sector. He insisted that standards must be maintained and jobs, wage rates and working conditions defended under compulsory competitive tendering or privatisation. Mr Smith's speech is intended to underline his personal commitment to development as the principal priority in foreign policy. Expressing fears that disarray among the industrialised countries meant the Rio summit would fail to make any real advances, he said environmental and development issues were inextricably linked. Similarly, it was essential for the wealthy north to promote development in the southern hemisphere, both on ethical grounds and in its own interests. The developing world's issues, such as foreign debt burdens, access to capital and technology and trade barriers, had to be allied to other questions such as education, women's rights and improved resource management. 'These are not simply what some people would condescendingly describe as Third World issues. Rather, they are global concerns which matter to everyone . . . ultimately as important to our own community as they are beginning to be to the community of nations,' he said. Mr Gould attempted to reinforce his backing among public-sector employees by emphasising his record as shadow environment secretary in pointing up the defects in policy on compulsory tendering. Acknowledging that tendering and privatisation would continue under the Conservatives, he said Labour's task was to ensure that private-sector employers matched the standards of the public sector. 'Privatisation and CCT should not be allowed to operate as pretexts for doing a bad job with inadequate, badly trained and badly paid staff,' he said.</p>

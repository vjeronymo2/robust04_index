			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain Valeriy Russu: "Talks on Withdrawal of </F> 14th Army Continue"]    [Text] The eighth round of Russian-Moldavian [Moldovan]  talks on reconciling the text of an agreement on the legal  status, procedure, and time-table for the withdrawal of units of  the 14th Army, stationed in the Dniestr region, has ended in  Kishinev. Despite some progress, the talks were difficult. The  stumbling block is the agreement's second article, which deals  with the time-table for withdrawing the 14th Army from Moldavia  [Moldova]. Differences over it have yet to be overcome.    As is known, the Moldavian [Moldovan] side is insisting that  the army be withdrawn by July 1 of this year, while Russia would  prefer to resolve this issue only after the special status of  the Dniestr region has been defined and social guarantees  provided for former servicemen and members of their families.  The delegations exchanged new texts of the article in Kishinev  and decided to continue its discussion in the next round.    Anatol Tsaran, the Republic of Moldavia's [Moldova's]  ambassador to the Russian Federation and the leader of the  Moldavian delegation to the talks, said at a press conference  that the Moldavian side had proposed a new time-table for  withdrawing the units of the 14th Army over one year or a  maximum of two years. The Russian side disagrees with this and  is proposing a longer period of time on account of the social  and housing problems involved in withdrawing the troops and, to  a certain extent, the unresolved Dniestr region issue. So far,  the talks have for the most part succeeded in resolving only the  issue of the troops' status.    During the just-ended round the delegation chiefs initialed  a  draft agreement between the two countries on issues of  jurisdiction and mutual legal assistance with respect to matters  relating to the temporary presence of Russian Army units on the  territory of Moldavia, as well as an agreement between the  Russian and Moldavian governments on social guarantees and  pensions for former servicemen and members of their families.    As regards the 14th Army's property and weapons, the Chief  of  the Russian delegation at the talks, special ambassador Vladimir  Kitayev, stressed all of it is owned by Russia. Representatives  of the Dniestr region participated in the talks, as they had  done in previous rounds. The next round is to be held in May in  Moscow.</p>

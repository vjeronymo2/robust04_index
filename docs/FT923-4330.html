			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Kazakhstan calms Israeli N-weapon fears MR SERGEI TERESCHENKO, prime minister of Kazakhstan, said during a visit to Israel yesterday his country had no intention of selling any of the nuclear arsenal it inherited after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Israeli leaders were understood to have voiced their concern to Mr Tereschenko that none of the central Asian republic's nuclear expertise or weaponry, which includes multi-warhead SS-18 ground-to-ground missiles and nuclear bombers, should fall into the hands of Iran or Arab states hostile to Israel. Kazakhstan has entered an agreement, along with Ukraine and Belarus, to return its nuclear arsenal to Russia by the end of 1994. Mr Tereschenko said fears that economic difficulties might tempt Kazakhstan to sell some of its arsenal 'to Iran or any other country' were unfounded. The prime minister's three-day visit is the highest-level exchange so far in a growing effort by the Jewish state to develop trade and diplomatic links with the former Soviet Moslem republics. Israel is anxious to blunt the influence of Iran and Arab countries over the newly independent regimes, as well as lay the groundwork for what it hopes will be lucrative long-term trade ties. It has made considerable progress with Kazakhstan, run by secular former communists. Mr Tereschenko, who was due to sign several agreements covering trade, technology and cultural exchanges during his visit, held talks with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli premier, and Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister. They decided to set up a committee to study joint economic projects. Two Israeli private-sector companies, Merhav and Mr Shaul Eisenberg's Israel Corporation, have together already established contracts in Kazakhstan, mainly in upgrading agriculture, worth about Dollars 65m (Pounds 33m) a year, officials estimated. A joint US-Israeli team is now in Kazakhstan studying possible agricultural aid schemes.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon completion of a reconsideration rulemaking, EPA may: (1) Reinstate subpart T on a programmatic basis if EPA determines, based on the record, that NRC has significantly failed to implement and enforce, in significant part, on a programmatic basis, (a) the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or (b) the operating license requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> flux standard; (2) reinstatement subpart T on a site-specific basis if EPA determines, based on the record, the NRC or an affected Agreement State has significantly failed to implement and enforce, in significant part, on a site-specific basis, (a) the regulation governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or (b) the operating license requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of replacing a permanent radon barrier will not achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard; or (3) issue a finding that NRC is implementing and enforcing on either a site-specific or programmatic basis the regulations operating license requirements described above and that reimbursement of subpart T is not appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations establish an obligation for the Administrator to reinstate subpart T as applied to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites if the Administrator determines by rulemaking, based on the record, that NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed on a programmatic basis to implement and enforce, in significant part, the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard. The Administrator also shall reinstate subpart T on a site-specific basis as applied to owner and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites if the Administrator determines by rulemaking, based on the record, that NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed on a site-specific basis to achieve compliance by the operator of the site or sites with applicable license requirements, regulations, or standards implemented by NRC and the affected Agreement States. Under today's proposal, EPA shall reinstate subpart T only for the failures enumerated in the preceding sentence that may reasonably be anticipated to significantly interfere (i.e., more than de minimis) with the timely emplacement of a permanent radon barrier constructed to achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard at uranium mill tailings disposal sites. EPA intends ``in significant part'' to mean that in rescinding subpart T, EPA must find that NRC or an affected Agreement State is implementing and enforcing, on a programmatic and a site-specific basis: (1) The regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC consistent with the MOU and settlement agreement and (2) the tailings closure plan (radon) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> pCi/m2-s flux standard in a manner that is not reasonably expected to materially (i.e., more than de minimis) interfere with compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control of the licensee). Reinstatement would require an EPA finding that NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed to implement and enforce in this manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Request for Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA requests comments on its proposed determination that the NRC regulatory program protects public health with an ample margin of safety, including comments on whether: (1) EPA has effectively promulgated appropriate revisions to 40 CFR part 192, subpart D; (2) NRC's regulations at 10 CFR part 40, appendix A either already adequately and appropriately implement the revisions to EPA's regulations, or may reasonably be expected to do so prior to rescission of subpart T; (3) the revision of NRC and affected Agreement State licenses reflect the new requirements of subpart D; and (4) any judicial or administrative challenge to EPA or NRC regulations is expected to present a significant risk of interference with full compliance with the MOU and the settlement agreement. Additionally, EPA requests comments on the proposed reconsideration provisions described above and included in a new section 61.226 added to subpart T. In particular EPA requests comments as to whether these provisions effectively implement the regulatory approach of the MOU and settlement agreement, especially the terms providing specific time periods for a reconsideration rulemaking. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

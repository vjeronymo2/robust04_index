Vybornov, candidate of military </F> sciences]    [Text] The Advanced Research Projects Agency [ARPA] was  established in 1958 and bore that name right up until 1972, when  it was renamed DARPA (the "D" added to the initial abbreviation  signifies Defense) to emphasize the military direction of its  work. Direction, coordination and financing of RDT&amp;E having a  high degree of technical risk on the one hand and promising a  potentially very high return on the other hand became the  mission of this Agency, which is independent within the  framework of the Defense Department. The Agency, which is  independent of the Armed Services, received the opportunity to  work immediately under the direction of the highest echelons of  the Defense Department on the most promising directions of  science and technology, having as the primary objective the  winning and holding of U.S. technological superiority in the  military area and providing a timely warning of sudden  military-technical breakthroughs on the part of the probable  enemy. The previous name, ARPA, was returned to the Agency in  March 1993.    Despite the fact that the question of transfer to the  civilian sector and commercialization of dual-purpose  technologies has not yet been raised in the United States, this  organization's powerful potential was identified very quickly  specifically in the area of developing such science-intensive  technologies. This was facilitated above all by the Agency's  successes in developing such important directions of science as  computer engineering, communications equipment and new  materials. Many authoritative U.S. specialists believe that  positive results the country achieved in the area of information  technologies (in which the civilian sector presently has  significantly outstripped the military sector in a number of  areas) are chiefly to ARPA's credit. Agency investments in  military RDT&amp;E contributed to development of the following  dual-purpose technologies: computer networks, artificial  intelligence, supercomputers with parallel architecture and  others. It also organized the first university laboratory in the  United States for creating advanced materials, which led in  particular to development of light, composite materials having  the broadest spectrum of application in civilian and military  areas. The Agency played a significant role in commercializing  certain technologies for production of semiconductors and laser  communication links.    Western specialists note that the primary RDT&amp;E task  being  conducted right up until recent times was to develop  technologies needed for creating new arms. In addition, this  RDT&amp;E supported military-technical breakthroughs in such  areas  as phased-array radars, air defense systems, precision weapons,  low-signature aircraft, technical reconnaissance equipment, and  C[.sup]3[/] systems.    In the opinion of the ARPA leadership, because of this  Agency's organizational structure it functions in such a way  that it has no analogues either in the Defense Department or in  U.S. federal agencies. There is not a single research  establishment in its makeup, and RDT&amp;E is conducted under  contracts with industrial firms, universities and state  laboratories. The Agency's authorized strength level as of the  beginning of 1993 was 185 persons, including 109 scientists.    In contrast to heads of Armed Services programs, ARPA  employees can finance RDT&amp;E in advanced areas under a  simplified  scheme. Each Agency program head carries on work valued at  $10-50 million, 80 percent of which is allocated for project  development and 20 percent can be directed toward realizing  advanced ideas in a particular area, and the right to make the  final decision on beginning or ending work remains fully with  the program head.    As a rule, ARPA begins financing of RDT&amp;E long before it  becomes possible to determine its feasibility. Participation  financing of RDT&amp;E initiatives by industrial firms and  universities is widely practiced.    Within the framework of the new U.S. Defense Department  weapons acquisition policy announced in January 1992, the  director of defense RDT&amp;E of this department received  considerably broader powers to monitor the ARPA  scientific-technical program. Moreover, in October 1992 the  Deputy Secretary of Defense signed a memorandum according to  which the above official has the right to monitor the progress  and direction of the entire military scientific-technical  program. In connection with this, many U.S. specialists express  fears that such excessive centralization will have a negative  effect on Defense Department capability to react quickly to  achievements of S&amp;T progress.    ARPA has the following structure: directorate, chief  adviser's section, special assistant's section, and ten offices  devoted to a specific subject (basic defense research, advanced  systems, computers, electronics, land systems, microelectronics,  nuclear monitoring research, software and intelligent systems,  naval engineering and special projects).    This Agency presently oversees a rather large number of  projects providing for creation of new technologies in producing  integrated circuits which will involve fundamental changes in  the semiconductor industry; large-powered computers (in  particular, machines already have appeared with a capability of  10[.sup]11[/] operations per second); power sources with high  density of stored energy having 100 times greater storage life  than existing ones; and a number of others connected with  development of dual-purpose technologies.    In November 1992 ARPA formed a consortium which set about to  create high-resolution displays. Together with twelve of the  largest U.S. firms, the Agency plans to make considerable  investments in developing a new generation of flat  high-resolution displays for use in computers, high-definition  television and advanced weapon systems. Despite the fact that  this technology appeared for the first time in the United  States, at present Japan dominates the world market of flat  displays. (Sales volume was $3.5 billion in 1992 and supposedly  will reach $7 billion by 1995).    During development of the experimental X-31 fighter and a  VTOL aircraft under ARPA direction and financing, unique  technologies were created which are now being transferred for  further development and subsequent use in the area of civilian  aircraft construction.    Despite the ongoing reduction in the U.S. military budget,  ARPA appropriations have risen considerably of late (see Table  1).    Table 1 - ARPA Budget in FY 1990-1993   (in $ millions)   Item                 1990          1991          1992          1993   Basic research       82.6          83.0          115.8         112.5   Exploratory          510.5         676.6         740.4         848.3  development   Development of       589.5         633.5         667.6         1,239.6  advanced  technologies   Administration and   34.0          62.4          68.5          52.8  support   Total                1,216.6       1,455.5       1,592.3       2,253.2         the whole, in the period from 1988 through 1993, U.S.  Defense  Department appropriations for RDT&amp;E dropped by 13 percent in  constant prices, while the ARPA budget rose almost threefold  ($800 million in 1988).    In FY 1993 Congress increased the ARPA budget by $959  million  compared with what the administration requested. Approximately  $581 million of that amount consists of supplementary  appropriations for developing science-intensive dual-purpose  technologies connected with realization of measures for  conversion of the defense complex (Defense Conversion  Initiative). The U.S. military-political leadership believes  that this program will permit shifting from the transitional  process of transferring technologies from the military into the  civilian sector to full integration of the country's civilian  and military scientific-technological bases.    Data on basic programs being coordinated by ARPA as well as  on development and financing of dual-purpose technologies are  given in Table 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------         This data illustrates the pressure Congress puts on the U.S.  Defense Department in the direction of expanding the practice of  joint development of dual-purpose technologies together with  industry, universities and other federal scientific research  organizations, instead of implementing the traditional process  of transferring technologies into the civilian sector for their  commercialization.    Initially, in 1986, Congress gave ARPA the right to organize  joint programs with private business, conclude cooperation  agreements and set up consortiums for conducting RDT&amp;E in  precontract stages in developing dual-purpose technologies.  These rights were to have been used primarily in those cases  where it was a question of work with a vague end result. Such  relationships with private business, universities and nonprofit  organizations differ from the usual practice of letting  contracts with a greater guarantee of rights of intellectual  property of the developers of technologies (under the usual  procedure the state simply became the owner of the developed  technology).    The following is a typical example of an agreement on  developing dual-purpose technologies concluded by ARPA with a  private firm and of conditions set forth in it. ARPA allocated  four million dollars to the Gazelle firm to develop high-speed  transceivers and corresponding technologies of important  military and civilian significance. The firm received full right  to sell the product produced both to commercial organizations as  well as to the state. An Agency representative became part of  the firm's board of directors with the right of deliberative  vote. Invested funds are returned by one of the following  methods: Either by deducting 1-3 percent from the amount of a  specific product's sale over 15 years, or by receiving a  corresponding block of firm shares. If the firm should decide to  sell technologies or rights to produce a product to a foreign  company, ARPA retains the right to locate a domestic client. In  case work stops for reason of the project's lack of prospect,  the Agency gets back no less than the entire amount it invested.    This agreement proved successful. The firm developed and  sold  a considerable number of transceivers both to ARPA clients as  well as to other government agencies. It is believed this  practice should be expanded.    ARPA's work in developing dual-purpose technologies is  evaluated as very effective. At the same time, U.S. specialists  note that bureaucratic procedures adopted in the U.S. Defense  Department largely interfere with fully realizing the rights  Congress granted the Agency. The procedures for approval of  agreements already concluded and sanctioned by Congress can last  months. The Defense Department leadership recently transformed  such agreements into the traditional form of contracts. The ARPA  leadership in turn adheres to the viewpoint that the Federal  Acquisition Regulation cannot be applied at all when it is a  question of developing advanced technologies inasmuch as in this  case it is very difficult to define the subject itself of  acquisition.    In recent years serious differences have arisen between the  president's administration and Congress regarding ARPA's role in  developing dual-purpose technologies. The administration  constantly attempted to limit its role in developing dual and  primarily civilian-purpose technologies, but Congress would  restore or even increase the volume of financing of such  programs.    Thus, in the Defense Department budget law for fiscal year  1993 (PL102-484), Congress directly ordered ARPA to engage in  developing dual-purpose technologies. This document notes that  the following is required of the Agency:     -  support and stimulate development of a national  technological base serving both military as well as civilian  purposes through use of common technologies;    -  direct and carry  out basic and applied research in those areas where S&amp;T  breakthroughs are possible and which are of great military  significance, including advanced civilian technologies.       The developers of this law believe that by remaining in the  Defense Department structure and fulfilling its new tasks, ARPA  should assist the country's military department to implement new  state technological policy aimed at integrating the country's  civilian and military scientific-technological bases.    The question of organizing a civilian analogue of ARPA has  been discussed widely in the United States in recent years.  Proponents of creating such a department in the United States  assert that it will be able to fully realize those properties  which make the functioning of the Defense Department's ARPA so  effective -- minimal bureaucratization and flexibility of  organizational structure. It is presumed that the new department  will be financed by government and private business on a parity  (fifty-fifty) basis. Like the existing ARPA, it will have to  rely on intellectual potential and other resources of industrial  firms, universities and federal establishments, including state  scientific research organizations, in its work of increasing the  effectiveness of the innovation process in the area of  developing and commercializing "critical technologies."    Opponents of creating a civilian analogue of ARPA believe  that the existing Agency has given a sufficiently good account  of itself in solving the problem of development and transfer of  dual-purpose technologies, and therefore it makes no sense to  organize a new one. Some opponents point out that one of the  very important factors of ARPA's success is its work with a  stable and homogeneous client. A potential client in the private  sector is very heterogeneous and has different and quickly  changing interests and needs, which inevitably will contribute  to reduced effectiveness of the proposed organization's work.    The U.S. administration plans to remove developments of a  number of key dual-purpose technologies from the purview of the  Defense Department and ARPA, in particular, and transfer them  (with corresponding appropriations) to civilian federal  scientific research establishments. Critics of this decision  believe that it will do considerable harm to ARPA's work and  make it difficult for the Defense Department to use dual-purpose  technologies developed in the private sector. Proponents of the  proposed measures, to the contrary, point out that ARPA will not  be able to effectively realize a portion of the programs within  the scope of the Defense Conversion Initiative (see Table 2).  ARPA employees also are troubled by the absence in the Agency of  corresponding specialists of industry, who do not wish to go  over to state establishments as a result of a substantial  difference in pay in the private sector and government agencies.  Presently only 20 percent of Agency employees have come from  industry and 80 percent from state establishments.    Another negative point, in the opinion of opponents of a  change in ARPA's role, is the tendency which has become apparent  toward reduced attention given by the Agency to the support of  basic research. In FY 1993 only $112.5 million from an overall  budget of $2,253.2 billion were allocated for such research.  Such a concentration of efforts on applied research and  development of dual-purpose technologies promising a quick  commercial return did not allow ARPA to fully organize  long-range basic work.    The opposite viewpoint also exists, that an expansion in  ARPA's role and inclusion of technologies primarily with a  civilian orientation in its sphere of development allegedly will  permit the Defense Department to acquire and master more easily  what are as a rule less expensive and more reliable civilian  technologies.    Certain specialists of the National Academy of Sciences  believe that the Defense Department is not a department capable  of elevating the level of civilian (dual) technologies, and they  propose to create a semigovernmental civilian technologies  corporation for this purpose.    As pointed out in a recent Defense Research Institute  report,  the greatest effect can be provided by using ARPA to build up  scientific-technological potential and develop general-purpose  technologies, not to develop specific technologies. This does  not mean the Agency is incapable of performing the latter task  but, in the opinion of authors of the report, Congress must  restore the balance between high-risk advanced research and  applied work.</p>

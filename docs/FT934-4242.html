			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK markets Yesterday's 10-point gain in the FT-SE 100 index shows London is still determined to take a positive view of the Budget, despite disappointing subsequent news from big companies like Hanson and GEC. In part that must stem from the prospect of lower interest rates, which loom a little closer after Continental cuts helped push sterling over DM2.56 yesterday. It helps, too, that the Budget was so positive for gilts. New gilt issues will be markedly lower in 1993-94. That should fuel demand just as base rate hopes buoy up the short end of the market and make funding even easier. At some point, though, the equity market will have to respond to the earnings outlook. According to BZW, more companies have been reporting results below expectations than above them in recent weeks. This unusual phenomenon may reflect companies' reluctance to guide forecasts down ahead of results, but it also suggests the market is working on false premises. Nor does it seem to have factored in the risk to consumer confidence once tax rises start to bite next year. With low interest rates reducing the attraction of cash, that creates something of an investment dilemma. The safest haven may be shares with a relatively high yield and secure prospects of dividend growth. That would explain the outperformance of water and electricity shares since Tuesday, not to mention the euphoric response to Royal Bank's 25 per cent dividend increase.</p>

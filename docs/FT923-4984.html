			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: TNT repeats shortfall of ADollars 200m TNT, the Australian transport group, has suffered its second consecutive annual loss of nearly ADollars 200m (USDollars 143m), but claimed that two years of restructuring had put it in 'a strong position to return to profitability'. The results, issued yesterday amid stock market confusion over the timing of the announcement, showed TNT lost a net ADollars 195m after abnormal items on an equity accounted basis in 1991-92, against ADollars 199m last time. The worse-than-expected result, together with the decision to maintain maximum liquidity by passing the dividend, pushed the shares down three cents to ADollars 1.24. Equity accounted net operating losses increased from ADollars 61m to ADollars 100m, partly because of reorganisation and redundancy costs of ADollars 33m. The operating loss increased in spite of a fall in net interest expense from ADollars 167m to ADollars 110m, reflecting lower interest rates and a reduction in debt to ADollars 1.1bn from ADollars 2.4bn. TNT said the bottom line loss was struck after net abnormal losses of ADollars 95m, including ADollars 35m against the start-up costs of GD Express Worldwide, a joint venture with European and North American post offices. However, TNT made a net profit of ADollars 4.5m on a consolidated basis, which excludes the group's investments in associated companies, compared with a net loss of ADollars 15m the previous year. The group's share of losses from Ansett Transport Industries, the Australian airline business jointly owned with News Corporation, declined to ADollars 66m from ADollars 102m. Analysts said the result suggested that Ansett was recovering from the effects of recession and a price war which followed deregulation of domestic aviation in 1990. However, airline competition is likely to strengthen again following the launch of a new domestic airline this month. TNT said losses on its 50 per cent investment in the Eastwest regional airline group rose from ADollars 21m to ADollars 71m, including an abnormal loss of ADollars 36m to write off goodwill. The group said Eastwest was expected to achieve 'a significant improvement' in earnings in the current year. Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services (AWAS), an aircraft leasing group jointly owned with News Corporation, contributed ADollars 1m to equity accounted profits, compared to ADollars 2.4m in the previous year. Revenue declined to ADollars 3.6m from ADollars 4.8m on a consolidated basis, and from ADollars 6.6m to ADollars 6m on an equity accounted basis.</p>

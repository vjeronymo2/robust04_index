			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (16): Austerity and common sense - Ceara is becoming the envy of reformists and winning plaudits from international agencies / Three states tackle economic and social problems with a variety of approaches Brazil's backward and usually corrupt north-east is an unlikely place to encounter balanced budgets and good government. But thanks to both these factors and a bit of luck, the state of Ceara is becoming the envy of reformists in the region and winning plaudits from international agencies. Ceara's fortunes started to turn with the 1987 election as governor of a young businessman, Mr Tasso Jereissati, who decided to confront the cosy system of patron-and-client politics responsible for much of the north-east's poverty and problems. His main achievement was to balance the state's previously anarchic budget with a mixture of austerity and common sense. About 40,000 public employees, political appointments under previous regimes, were sacked. Tax collection was tightened and corruption attacked. These ideas, fundamental to most governments, are still controversial in much of Brazil and Mr Jereissati was ostracised by much of the state's elite. With the budget balanced, and corruption under wraps, businessmen started to invest and the economy began to prosper. Growth in gross domestic product has outstripped Brazil's by a factor of five. Per capita income rose 30 per cent to a still very low Dollars 1,300 while in the rest of the country it remained stagnant. Mr Jereissati, who had joined the centrist Brazilian Social Democrats (PSDB) of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former finance minister, was followed as governor by his chosen successor Mr Ciro Gomes, who took over in 1991. Both men sought to attract Brazilian and foreign investment. Textiles company Grupo Vicunha is building two new factories in the state at a cost of Dollars 450m. These could create 5,000 new jobs by 1997. Other companies, such as shoemaker Grendene and plastics company Petropar are also investing smaller amounts. A consortium of Taiwanese businessmen is investing as much as Dollars 32m in various light industry ventures in the interior of the state, attracted by low labour costs and government incentives. Ceara is a long way from being a paradise and still faces huge problems, including areas of extreme poverty, rapid urbanisation and an overlooked rural sector. Illiteracy remains stubbornly close to 40 per cent of the population above 14 years old. Infant mortality has been cut dramatically by an internationally praised health scheme, but in rural areas it remains unacceptably high. Even critics welcome the cleaning out of public accounts and say the government's new credibility has brought investment from business and multilateral agencies such as the World Bank, pleased to see money reaching desired targets rather then syphoned off to corrupt politicians. But there is concern about who has gained from eight years of PSDB rule. Ms Maria Cleide Bernal, a local union leader, says there has been a lack of investment and good policies in areas such as agriculture and the urban shanty towns, the favelas. 'The benefits haven't gone to the majority of the people, but to the elites,' she says. Other critics say both governors have made expert use of public relations to take credit for schemes which communities have started themselves. Dr Adalberto Barreto, a psychiatrist who works in the giant shanty town of Pirambu, says most health and welfare services are still provided by residents. 'The government is capitalising on this. It is the communities who are making the changes,' he says. Mr Jereissati, who is likely to stand for governor again in this year's elections, admits that much remains to be done, and that achievements so far are building the base for future reforms. 'We need to jump forward, especially with social development. We need to start integrating the poor into society,' he says.</p>

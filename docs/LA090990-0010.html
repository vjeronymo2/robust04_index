			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROTHERS MENENDEZ  </P> <P> Lyle and Erik Menendez came of age in a society that worshiped material excess  from the crib. If you didn't have everything you wanted by the time you reached  puberty, you were a failure.  </P> <P> They and their spoiled, brat-pack friends drove $50,000 cars before they could  shave; cribbed someone else's arduously written school papers or had their  mothers write them; spent more on clothes in a month than whole families spend  for food and shelter in a year; dated glamorous 30-year-old models; dined in  the best restaurants. In short, as teen-agers they had the good life many of us  strive for but rarely reach, even if we live to 100.  </P> <P> Perhaps we have-nots are in the long run the richer. For these young victims  are as impoverished and needy as the lowliest Calcutta street beggar. The  animal imagery, the driving force behind their father's success, became twisted  and bent in the next generation. But Jose paid his dues before becoming king of  the jungle he lived in. His sons, perhaps borrowing a page from recent history,  wanted to be lionized without experiencing the necessary but humbling years as  cubs. It took but a few minutes to kill their parents and they would have it  all now.  </P> <P> How many more needless crimes of avarice before this nation returns to some  good old but recently maligned Yankee horse sense and values?  </P> <P> CAROL LAW  </P> <P> Leucadia  </P></p>

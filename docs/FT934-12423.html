			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Clinton seeks Dollars 10bn in cuts PRESIDENT Bill Clinton sent to Congress yesterday an additional Dollars 10bn in spending cuts over the next five years and unveiled a simplified government procurement programme that officials said could save as much as Dollars 22.5bn over the same period. Both proposals and their claimed economies are likely to meet stiff challenges in Congress. A bipartisan group under Congressman Tim Penny, the Minnesota Democrat, is pressing for an extra Dollars 100bn spending cuts, while Mr Leon Panetta, budget director, conceded congressional experts believed the changes in purchasing rules might yield only Dollars 3bn-Dollars 5bn. Under the Clinton proposal, Dollars 1.5bn would be saved by cutting existing programmes, such as ending federal subsidies for wool, mohair and honey production. The rest would come from assorted savings across government, most notably in the Department of Agriculture, brought about under the auspices of the National Performance Review directed by Vice-President Al Gore. The first part of yesterday's package is incomplete, officials said, because Congress has yet to finalise four appropriations bills for the current fiscal year, which began this month. Further cuts of Dollars 1bn-Dollars 2bn will be sent to Congress when the bills have passed. Mr Clinton sounded defensive on the size of the spending cuts, saying: 'If they aren't passed, I'll come back with more.' But he waxed more eloquent on efficiency savings, claiming they could free funds for greater law and narcotics enforcement. He signed an executive order under which federal agencies will begin accepting contract bids by computer, with the ultimate goal that this will apply to all the estimated 20m contracts worth a total Dollars 200bn the government signs each year. It is also intended that all federal salary and pension payments be made by electronic transfer. Changed purchasing rules would also increase to Dollars 100,000 from Dollars 25,000 the size of contracts that can awarded without extensive auditing procedures. This, the president claimed, would open up many opportunities to small businesses. But the main target was simplifying defence procurement, with the aim of obliging the military to buy supplies off-the-shelf at best prices.</p>

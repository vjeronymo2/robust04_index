			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> OIL SPILL BILL MUST BE WATERED DOWN  </P> <P> A proposal to impose hefty fees on oil companies to build an oil spill cleanup  fund and to make company employees and officials criminally liable for spills  suffered a major setback in a state Senate panel. The Natural Resources  Committee, which generally is friendly to environmental causes, approved the  measure to keep it alive, but with the understanding that the author will  present a new, less stringent bill. The decision upset the plans of the  measure's Democratic backers -- Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy and Controller Gray  Davis -- who wanted to move it through the Legislature quickly so oil companies  would have less time to pick it apart.  </P></p>

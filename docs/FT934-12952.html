			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Minister for a Day: Guns blazing on the 6pm news - The start of a new series in which we ask prominent people to imagine themselves as a government minister for a day. General Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley imagines what he would do if called on to become defence secretary I HAVE scarcely sat at my desk before one of the assistant secretaries enters with a huge pile of briefs; reading material that would occupy the whole day. I select only the summary of departmental cuts and consequences asked for in advance. The conclusions are chilling. When the chiefs of staff and permanent secretary come in, I suggest that we lack resources to meet the commitments published in the 1993 Defence Estimates. Setting aside the case of general war, the ability to respond to lesser contingencies seems to assume that these will arise conveniently, one at a time. What would be the effect, I ask, of the following arising simultaneously: the requirement for a British division in Bosnia-Hercegovina, with neighbouring sea and air elements, as part of an international policing operation; increased violence in Northern Ireland, for example, random battles between armed Protestant and IRA groups; and the provision of, say, a fire service as in the firemen's strike in the late 1970s? My tentative conclusion is that this triple demand would exhaust the complement of field engineers and logistic units. While accepting that enough ships, battalions, and air elements might be scraped together to meet the initial bill, it would be difficult to find replacements for them after a tour of duty, say six months. Looking further into present circumstances, I note that units of the field Army are mostly moving from one active commitment to another, leaving little time to train for the roles they are expected to fill, from gendarmerie operations to general war. Is this equally true for the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force? I ask the chiefs to send me observations on these points this afternoon, not later than 3 pm. They leave rather wearily, spending hours with their staff in such pursuits, often fruitlessly. I hope to offer them some return on this occasion. The permanent secretary remains behind. As chief accounting officer, he duels with the Treasury. I make it clear that I am looking either for a reduction in commitments or an increase in resources. We agree that the government is strapped for cash and that party pressure is not going to ease that position. I put this point to him: facts and figures persuade me that the helter-skelter reduction of the armed forces began with an irresponsible - almost a mischievous - ministerial minute concluding that the collapse of the Warsaw Pact removed the necessity of maintaining rounded defence forces. This inevitably opened a breach for Treasury exploitation. Why do we continue to deny that the defence cuts are Treasury driven? All departments are properly subject to funding constraints. He reminds me that he cannot answer for former ministers. Meantime, details concerning defence equipment have been brought in. I ask my private secretary to hold off callers while I study them. I agree to hold a press conference at 5pm. The Options for Change policy promised improvements in equipment programmes to mitigate cuts in defence manning. This is abandoned in the current plan. Contracts bind the ministry to continuing procurement, but these will simply replace outworn or obsolete items. I reflect that, if money is short, this is probably as it should be. It will pay the services to sweat out lean years with a sufficiency of seasoned men and pay for their retention by trimming equipment demands. Unfortunately, the equipment savings have been made without benefit to manpower. Eschewing a haggis sandwich left by a predecessor, I eat hard cheese. This reminds me of a fuse I intend to light. Personal allowances continue to be sacrificed to savings, transferring public expenses to private pockets. Moreover, those extant are often subject to extraordinary accountability, not because there is growing evidence of fiddling, but in order to satisfy penny-pinching qualifications. My guess is that we have disposed a host of scrutineers whose collective wages exceed any savings accrued. I order a review of this entire subject. At 3pm the chiefs answer to the queries I made this morning. They confirm my apprehensions. Even if we send a brigade rather than a division to Bosnia-Hercegovina, we shall be in immediate difficulties should concurrent claims arise. I write an advisory note to my colleague, the Foreign Secretary. At 5 pm, I tell the press that the armed forces cannot meet the commitments declared to parliament. I have therefore cancelled the remaining Options for Change and have opened a defence review. Disengaging myself from questions, I drive home. My wife is just answering the telephone. It is the prime minister. He has been listening to the early evening news . . .</p>

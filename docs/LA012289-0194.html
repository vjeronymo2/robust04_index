			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT;  </P> <P> NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> MAN-MADE MARSH: The Anaheim Wetlands has something that sets it apart from  marsh restoration projects elsewhere in the county, such as Bolsa Chica, Upper  Newport Bay and the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve at UC Irvine: It was  built from scratch.  </P> <P> Composed of three freshwater ponds along the Santa Ana River southeast of La  Palma Avenue and Weir Canyon Road, the Anaheim Wetlands was created in 1985 as  mitigation for the loss of a 10.2-acre marsh at Ball Road and the Orange  Freeway. That site was chosen as the location of a string of car dealerships.  </P> <P> Cathy Glasgow, supervisor of Oak Canyon Nature Center in Anaheim Hills, is also  in charge of the Anaheim Wetlands. She said the site is looking "pretty good,"  with the vegetation planted along the pond shores now well established.  </P> <P> "Birds (especially waterfowl) do come in and use the area for feeding," Glasgow  said, but it is not yet known if any birds are using the site for breeding. The  old marsh, which was at the bottom of an abandoned gravel pit, was used by  about 150 species of bird, and in 1985 was described as the only coastal  nesting area for the great-tailed grackle and the yellow-headed blackbird.  </P> <P> "The shame of it is that the area that was lost was so viable," said Glasgow.  It will take time for the new marsh, which is smaller than the old one, to  establish itself and attract wildlife.  </P> <P> Permits are required to enter the site, which is not currently set up for  visitation (although there is an observation deck along the Santa Ana River  bike path). Glasgow said the city may eventually develop educational programs  for the site and enlist volunteer work crews to help keep water channels clear  of vegetation. A stream connects the three ponds with the river.  </P> <P> For information on the site, call Oak Canyon Nature Center, (714) 998-8380.  </P></p>

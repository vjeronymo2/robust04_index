			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Warning at Quaker Oats QUAKER Oats, the Chicago-based food, beverage and pet foods company, warned yesterday that its third-quarter earnings per share, for the three months to end-March, could fall by 10-15 per cent from the previous year's figure. The company, which saw earnings per share of 82 cents in the third quarter of 1990-91 and net profits from continuing operations of Dollars 63.1m, blamed the downturn on lower sales volumes for its ready-to-eat cereals and its Gatorade sports beverage. Higher marketing expenditures in the US and Europe compounded the problems. Quaker stressed that it expected results for the first nine months of the year to be up on the previous year. In the first six months, the company reported earnings from continuing operations of Dollars 1.12 a share, compared with 85 cents in 1990-91. On Wall street, its shares took the news fairly calmly, easing Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 52 1/4 , in early trading.</p>

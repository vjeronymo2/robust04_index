			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belgian General Francis Briquemont, former </F> commander of the UN Protection Forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, by  announcer Jacques Bredael and correspondent Philippe Lamair in  the studio -- live]    [Excerpts] [Bredael] Good evening, General Briquemont. You  have just heard [U.S.] Senator Biden saying: "Let them die their  own way if we don't have the courage to help them live." Is this  also your way of looking at the situation?    [Briquemont] The least that can be said is that the senator  makes himself quite clear. But I think -- as it has been widely  admitted over the past few weeks -- that one will have to choose  between the logic of war or the logic of peace. If one wants to  lift the arms embargo, the fighting eventually will intensify;  this might correspond to the attitude of the Bosnian Government.  But I stress again vigorously that if the three warring sides  keep on fighting, the 10,000 Blue Helmets will not be able to go  on providing humanitarian aid. One will have to choose: either  there is an agreement in a few days or in a few weeks, or there  is no agreement. In the latter case I believe that one will  head toward intensified fighting. The situation will need to be  thoroughly reassessed.    [Lamair] General, public opinion understands less and less  the Bosnian issue and wonders why it is still impossible after  20 months of war to put an end to it. What are the obstacles to  a settlement to the conflict?    [Briquemont] Well, listen, I do not think that such a  conflict will ever be solved with packages of resolutions;  actions have to be envisaged. The first of these perhaps should  be to make it possible for those on the spot to be able to apply  the UN Security Council resolutions. Another aspect also seems  important to me: We always apply our concepts, our Western,  West European concepts to other societies which absolutely do  not handle problems as we do. It always strikes me to hear some  generals and also some political leaders saying: "You know,  conflicts here are solved by force." Maybe one should understand  what is happening over there before thinking that anything in  which we believe in Brussels, in Washington, or elsewhere can  materialize in that region [Bosnia].    [Lamair] Your successor, British General Michael Rose, has  the same mandate, the same number of troops. Would it not be  necessary, for him to succeed, to change the mandate and, if  nothing changes, well, to withdraw the Blue Helmets?    [Briquemont] Change the mandate? Well, I do not know if it  is necessary to change it now. Simply, I would say that we  should be given the means to implement the UN Security Council  resolutions -- as I have been saying over and over again for  weeks together with General Cot: "Give us the troops we need to  carry out our mission successfully." The other problem is to be  able to use the troops within the framework of the resolutions  of course, but also in a way that the military chiefs deem  necessary. I will not hide my deep shock when a battalion  commander refused to execute an order because his government, or  the governments of Nordic countries, refused to deploy a company  in Srebrenica. I was deeply shocked because Srebrenica is a  sensitive spot in Bosnia, and a key point of one of the most  important UN resolutions -- Resolution 836. I thus believe that  the contributing nations must accept the UN mandate, but it is  far too easy to decide to send troops while saying at the same  time: "I wish to use them here or there only for this or that  purpose." This shocked me deeply and I can tell you that this  battalion commander also was very ill at ease because refusing  an order from one's commander is very serious for a soldier. I  think this represents an intolerable intrusion by the political  [leaders] in the conduct of operations. This must change and my  successor has raised the issue in New York, but in the meantime,  the governments of the contributing nations must admit that.  Unfortunately, I do not believe this will happen anytime soon.  [passage omitted]    [Bredael] This is another vision of everyday reality in  Sarajevo. General, have you experienced these desperate efforts  by the population to preserve the life it had before [the war]?    [Briquemont] I experienced them intensely and you know the  admiration I have for the Sarajevo population. And they were  grateful to me because I probably did a little for them. You  would not believe all the efforts made by the UNPROFOR to  provide those people with a little water, electricity, and gas,  all the efforts made so that those artists could come and  perform. But the population also taught me lessons. I deeply  admired their dignity, their resistance, and as I have already  said in several interviews, I admired the women of Sarajevo.    [Lamair] General, judging from the report we have just seen,  do you think that it is still possible for Sarajevo, and for the  whole of Bosnia, to be a multiethnic region in the future?    [Briquemont] Yes, but... we probably have reached the most  remote limit of that possibility. I believe that the fighting  must stop very soon because if it does not, Sarajevo will no  longer be that multicultural fortress and all the sides will  become radicalized and Sarajevo will lose this multicultural  feature. I believe that the city increasingly will become a  Muslim city.    [Bredael] Do you mean that the Muslims are now also carrying  out an ethnic cleansing?    [Briquemont] I do not know if I can call this ethnic  cleansing, but if the fighting continues, the Muslims will want  to turn Sarajevo into their capital and it then could be a kind  of administrative cleansing.    [Bredael] Well, thank you, General, for your comments.</p>

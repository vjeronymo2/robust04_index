			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Dixons slips but remains optimistic Dixons, the UK's largest electricals retailer, yesterday provided further evidence that consumer spending has picked up since the April tax increases. 'Over the last few weeks there have been more encouraging signs that customers are coming back,' said Mr John Clare, group chief executive. Dixons had a weak second half of the year to April but in the first nine weeks of the current year sales are ahead 11 per cent with like for like growth of 3 per cent. Last year sales rose 10 per cent to Pounds 1.58bn. Profits before tax and exceptional charges slipped from Pounds 76.7m to Pounds 73.3m, in line with the company's warning in January following disappointing Christmas sales. The shares, which had been weak ahead of the figures, recovered 19p to 189p. Earnings per share, excluding exceptional items, rose to 11.6p (9.8p) helped by a lower tax charge and there is a final dividend of 4.9p for a total up 6.5 per cent to 6.6p. After total exceptional charges of Pounds 238.5m the group recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 165.2m. Most of the charge relates to goodwill previously written off to reserves following the sale of its loss-making US chain Silo to Fretter. There is also a Pounds 20m provision for closing more high street stores in the Currys chain and Pounds 4.5m for the costs of consolidating administrative functions. Operating profits from UK retailing slid to Pounds 72.3m (Pounds 77.0m) caused largely by a reduction in gross margins in Dixons and Currys. In addition to the sharp fall in retail prices of computer games consoles before Christmas there was aggressive competition and higher sterling purchase costs. But the pressure on margins did ease towards the end of the financial year. Mr Clare said that Comet and some of the regional electricity companies in particular had been chasing market share. But he added that early evidence suggested the new warehouse clubs were having limited impact on the group's local outlets. Sales of extended warranties increased and Mr Clare said he was relaxed about the Office of Fair Trading inquiry into the subject. The Currys superstores again performed well with like for like sales up 7 per cent - compared with a 1 per cent decline in the high street shops - and the shift towards cheaper out-of-town sites is being accelerated. There were 158 superstores at the end of the year, an increase of 27, and a further 35 are due to open this year. Since the year-end 74 high street Currys stores have gone and a further 61 closures are planned by the end of this year, largely completing the process. In the Dixons chain like for like sales were down 3 per cent, reflecting the steep fall in sales of computer games consoles and camcorders. Mr Clare said that Dixons had seen strong growth in sales of mobile phones 'which has become a consumer market in the last few months'. He is optimistic about the prospects for multimedia hardware and software products. Lex, Page 22</p>

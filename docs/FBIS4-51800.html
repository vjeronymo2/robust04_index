			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Chin-wan on interview with newly </F> appointed Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok in Seoul on 30 April]    [Text] Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok was interviewed by  reporters immediately after his inaugural ceremony at the Grand  Assembly Hall of the main government complex in Seoul on 30  April, in which he repeatedly stressed harmony. He said,  "Harmony is important not only among the cabinet members. I  will see to it that state affairs are managed through our  exchange of views with as many personages as possible from  Chongwadae [presidential office] staff, outside figures, and  those in the journalist circles."    He made an extra effort to deny his image as a  `conservative'  and said, "The proof that any person or a group is alive is that  such a person or a group is supported by his or its effort for  change and reform," thus introducing himself to be a reasonable  realist in pursuit of change and reform.    The following is a compilation of the questions and answers  in the interview.    [Kim Chin-wan] As deputy prime minister of unification, you  chaired the Unification and Security Policy Coordinating  Committee meeting. Will you be standing aloof from the meeting  as prime minister?    [Yi Yong-tok] The Unification and Security Policy  Coordinating Committee meeting is supposed to be chaired by the  deputy prime minister according to the presidential order. I  think this is sufficient. I will involve myself in it as prime  minister only upon request.    [Kim] The former prime minister instructed that the agenda  of the Unification and Security Policy Coordinating Committee  meeting should be reported to the prime minister. Are you  revoking this instruction?    [Yi] When I was deputy prime minister, I did not neglect  reporting to the prime minister on it even before the  instruction was issued. Irrespective of an instruction,  reporting to each other and exchanging views with each other for  the sake of harmony will help bring forth smooth operation.    [Kim] What is your opinion of the worries about the  weakening of the prime minister's office?    [Yi] I do not think so. I do not know legal affairs much,  but the prime minister is supposed to control the cabinet  receiving orders from the president.    I will see to it that things are pushed forward vigorously,  taking care that self-control and creativity are respected.  Harmony among the departments is important.    [Kim] What will be the nature of the third cabinet?    [Yi] It is a cabinet of reform in harmony.    [Kim] What is your feeling about the stormy passage through  parliamentary ratification?    [Yi] It is not appropriate that an official from the  government should comment on what happened in the National  Assembly. The conflict between groups will last longer than the  conflict between individuals. I personally feel that the past  one week was a very memorable period of time.    [Kim] Do you not have a plan to maintain the present senior  officials of the prime minister's office for the sake of harmony?    [Yi] (Looking to the senior secretary and the administrative  coordinating director of the prime minister's office) What  shall we do? I have these two dependable aides. I should  continue getting help from these two gentlemen, shouldn't I?  (laughter).    [Kim] What is your opinion of the ethos of the present  government officials? Are they excessively passive? If so,  what are the measures to overcome this situation?    [Yi] I do not think so. I think the government officials  have firm resolve to carry out state affairs, though the degree  of the resolve may vary between individuals. However, the  reestablishment of official discipline may be necessary.  Reestablishing official discipline, we ought to boost their  morale at the same time. What is needed here is self-control.</p>

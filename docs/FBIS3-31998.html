Prime Minister Dr. Cheddi Jagan also announced Thursday that the  government had concluded the sale of the Guyana Stores retail  outlet chain; the Guyana National Engineering Corporation, a  company reputed for shipbuilding; and government's shares in the  Guyana Bank for Trade and Industry.    Addressing donors from more than 30 countries and 15  international lending institutions, President Jagan restated his  government's commitment to a healthy private sector. The  Guyanese president acknowledged that government's pace in  privatisation had been slow, but he defended this on the grounds  that the process of identifying state companies suitable for  divestment could not be short circuited.    "There is absolutely no ground for scepticism as regards the  orientation... And commitment to a strong and healthy private  sector," the prime minister said. "Whatever we do, the people of  the nation will not be compromised," he added.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: SEC issues warning over derivatives operations THE derivatives operations of investment banks are in danger of slipping outside the jurisdiction of securities regulators, Mr Carter Beese, a commissioner of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, warned yesterday. Speaking at a conference arranged by Risk magazine, Mr Beese said he was concerned that 'current SEC capital rules have created an incentive to run over-the-counter derivatives books out of unregulated affiliates'. He said there was anecdotal evidence that securities firms had been shifting derivatives business offshore, where regulatory regimes were less onerous, or into off-balance sheet derivative units, out of the reach of regulators. While recognising there is 'a fair argument to be made' that segregating risks into entities that do not hold customer funds and securities is a good policy, he warned that 'if we follow current practice, regulators will end up stubbornly standing guard over a shrinking core of the retail-related markets, while ceding growing portions of institutional and cross-border finance to the unregulated arena.' While a few specialist derivatives vehicles have been established so far, over half a dozen US banks and securities houses are considering setting up such units next year. Last summer, the SEC adopted risk assessment rules which give it new powers to look at the scope and nature of risks in such affiliates. Under the new rules, which come into force next year, firms have to file quarterly summaries that include a breakdown of their exposure in off-balance sheet deals. Speaking at the same conference, Mr Pen Kent, an executive director of the Bank of England, said concern over extra risks created by the growth of the derivatives markets had been overstated in some quarters. Derivatives markets 'have on balance reduced rather than increased risk,' he said.</p>

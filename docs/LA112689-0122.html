			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> REBUILDING PROCESS BEGINS AT MARYLAND UNDER WILLIAMS  </P> <P> There was a symbolism of sorts to the reconstruction and refurbishing that  began recently in the basketball offices at the University of Maryland,  symbolic not only because the Terrapins are in the midst of starting a new  season, but because they are also starting a new era.  </P> <P> New Coach Gary Williams already has put his stamp on a team that finished 9-20  last season under former coach Bob Wade, but the ink has yet to dry.  </P> <P> The kind of team Williams hopes Maryland will become in the months ahead is  much the same as the teams he has had during the past 11 years at Ohio State,  Boston College and American University -- hard-nosed overachievers with a  passion for defense and a penchant for upsets.  </P> <P> "They've worked hard. That's all you can ask for," said Williams, 44, a  Maryland alum. "They've shown some improvement (since the start of practice) in  terms of intensity. If we're going to be competitive this year, we're going to  have to work as hard, or harder, than any other team we play."  </P> <P> The legacy Williams inherited when he took the job in June, a month after Wade  was forced to resign, was that of a team that often played down to the level of  the competition when it came to weaker, non-conference opponents and rarely won  a game it wasn't supposed to.  </P> <P> Though Maryland has more talent left over than when Wade came in four seasons  ago, this year's team is not typical of the ones Williams has coached in the  past.  </P> <P> "Our teams have been more guard-oriented," said Williams, who played the point  for three years at Maryland during the mid-1960s. "This year, the predominance  of our talent is in the frontcourt."  </P> <P> Junior point guard Teyon McCoy is a good long-range shooter, but he does not  penetrate the way Michael Adams did at Boston College or Jay Burson did at Ohio  State. Sophomore forward Jerrod Mustaf, who added 20 pounds of muscle over the  summer, still has a habit of pulling up from 17 feet rather than clearing a  path for himself to the basket.  </P> <P> Sophomore swingman Walt Williams, 6-foot-8, certainly the most flexible player  on the team, has yet to figure out if he's a forward who can shoot outside or a  guard who can climb for back-door dunks. And senior forward Tony Massenburg,  once he returns from his two-game penalty for selling Atlantic Coast Conference  tournament tickets, has to become for Maryland what Tom Hammonds used to be for  Georgia Tech.  </P> <P> In a word, consistent. The same can be said for Maryland.  </P> <P> "We're going to have to keep getting better," said Massenburg, who, along with  reserve forward Rodney Walker, is expected to return Tuesday. "We can't slip  back, like we did last year. Coach Williams won't allow it."  </P> <P> Williams won't allow a lot of things. When sophomore guard Jesse Martin started  missing classes during the preseason, Williams suspended him indefinitely --  the suspension was lifted Wednesday -- despite a lack of backcourt players with  any college experience.  </P> <P> When the Terps started feeling cocky last week after beating a weak Venezuelan  National team by 32 points, Williams quickly brought them back to reality.  Though pleased with the improvement his players had shown from their first  exhibition game, Williams wore a pained look the next day.  </P> <P> "I do get on edge," he said. "You can't afford to waste a day."  </P> <P> But what Williams will allow, and even encourage, is for the Terps to run and  shoot and not look over their shoulders. That kind of attitude already has paid  off in the improved play of junior center Cedric Lewis and in the confidence  McCoy displayed in the first exhibition game.  </P> <P> "A lot of the players seem more relaxed," said McCoy, who has missed much of  the last two weeks with a pulled groin muscle. "They don't have the pressure  that was on them before. Coach Williams tells us, 'You're going to make  mistakes, but the important thing is to learn from them.' "  </P> <P> Said Lewis: "Coach Williams gives us a lot of confidence. He says, 'There's  nothing you can't do if you work at it.' "  </P> <P> It doesn't mean the Terps will challenge North Carolina and Duke for the ACC  championship. It could mean that Maryland might surprise some teams along the  way.  </P> <P> "People have to be realistic," said Williams. "We won one game in the ACC last  year and were picked to finish last this year. If we keep everyone healthy,  which we haven't been able to do so far, that will help us."  </P> <P> Williams has refused to make predictions, for he is not quite sure how much  talent his players have, and how much of themselves they will leave on the  court.  </P> <P> "I don't know how good we are," he said.  </P> <P> So, for now there are no grand dreams, just little ones. In time, they will  grow as the Maryland basketball program, like the offices upstairs, is  reconstructed and refurbished under the watchful eye of Gary Williams.  </P></p>

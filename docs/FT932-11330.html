			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Plea for Channel tunnel peace MR NEVILLE SIMMS, the new British co-chairman of the Channel tunnel builders Transmanche Link, last night called for co-operation between TML and Eurotunnel, the operators. Mr Simms, Tarmac's chief executive, said the two sides, at loggerheads over costs for the Pounds 8.4bn project, should 'walk the last mile hand in hand'. The anticipated cost of the project has escalated from Pounds 4.8bn in 1987.</p>

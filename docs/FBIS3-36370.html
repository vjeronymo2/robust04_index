An exception was made only  to a representative of the newspaper ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA.    This action was reported by ITAR-TASS. It noted that  correspondents of news agencies and the television were not  allowed to attend a meeting of the Russian Government for the  first time in the past two and a half years.    Dwelling on the motives behind this decision, Kvasov told  the  newspaper ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "The accreditation of journalists  was all muddled up lately. Absolutely unknown people come to  the Presidium. And then various assessments, views and critical  remarks appeared in the press even before we began to discuss  this or that problem. After all, a government meeting is not a  show. It is serious, hard and responsible work".    Touching on ways to allow the mass media to objectively  cover  the work of the Russian Government, Kvasov noted: "We are ready  to furnish them with all the necessary materials, but only after  a final decision is made on the discussed problems."    Speaking about the February 3 meeting, Kvasov noted that "it  continued for almost six hours, while some other meetings were  even longer. And this time is sufficient for this or that  minister to say quite a lot. Why must we disclose our kitchen.  No other government permits this. Just try to come to such a  meeting in France or Britain. This will, mildly speaking, evoke  surprise."    Asked by the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA whether journalists would  henceforth be barred from meetings of the government's Presidium  and whether this was fair, Kvasov stated:    "Whenever some restrictions are imposed, we are immediately  accused of encroaching upon the freedom of speech. There is no  such ban in the true sense of the word. We must merely put  everything in proper order. Representatives of the ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA will be allowed to attend all the meetings, because it is  a government publication. This refers also to ITAR-TASS. The  other newspapers, the radio and the television will be allowed  to attend such meetings in accordance with a newly endorsed  list. But they will have limited access. The presence of  representatives from these publications will depend on the  agenda. We shall invite everybody to broader meetings, and only  the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and ITAR-TASS To other sessons," Kvasov  stressed. "The other publications will get all the necessary  materials from the government's press service," he added.</p>

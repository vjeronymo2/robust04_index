			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Indecision strains Japan coalition THE SEAMS in Japan's seven-party coalition are already showing, with the parties disagreeing over appointments to a new cabinet expected to be installed formally this week. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the coalition's candidate to become prime minister, returned from a mountain retreat yesterday to find the parties unable to decide on senior ministerial posts. This is partly because they have known only life in opposition and are daunted by the thought of running the country, according to a senior official of one of the coalition parties. The seven groups range from the left-leaning Social Democratic party to parties comprising former members of the Liberal Democratic party. Mr Hosokawa's difficulty in putting together a cabinet has stirred public concerns that the coalition could lurch from indecision to indecision after taking office. A new prime minister will be chosen at a parliamentary session on Thursday, and the seven parties have the numbers to ensure that Mr Hosokawa will form a cabinet. SDP officials, already under attack from within the party for joining the coalition, do not know where to place influential ideologues entitled to a senior post but who could create policy chaos in a job such as that of foreign minister. The party has suggested that Ms Takako Doi, former SDP leader, should become speaker of the lower house of parliament, but she has declined, suggesting that she is 'not appropriate' for a position of such heavy responsibility. Mr Hosokawa, leader of the Japan New party, will be standing against Mr Yohei Kono, the new LDP leader, in the parliamentary vote on the premiership. Unless the coalition falls apart in the next few days, the LDP will be joining the Japan Communist party in opposition. Mr Hosokawa has asked Mr Ichiro Ozawa, former LDP secretary-general, to join the cabinet, but the latter said yesterday he did not want a position. 'In theory, the government should last for four years, but we will have to see,' said Mr Ozawa, who is generally thought to be planning for another poll within a year. But Mr Ozawa insists that he is dedicated to overhaul a national electoral system prone to corruption, though he suggested that the redrawing of electoral boundaries will be relatively simple. 'The difficult thing will be change political thinking,' he said.</p>

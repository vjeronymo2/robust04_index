			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wojciech Zaluska] </F>   [Text] Lech Walesa is willing to be reelected but he  has no political backing. Currently, he can only count on the  weak Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms. And it is becoming  increasingly clear that his rapport with the party makes no  sense. A divorce before the elections is possible.    So far, Walesa's attempts to win the favors of "Solidarity"  have come to nothing. The president blocked popiwek [enterprise  tax on above-normative pay] but the trade union did not agree.  And it may never. There are both enthusiastic supporters and  fanatic opponents of Walesa in "Solidarity." The former are  blocking the latter's measures, and so far -- successfully.    So what is the president counting on? Most probably, he is  counting primarily on television. Through television, he wants  to reach out to society ... over the heads of politicians. So  he is fighting like a lion for access to television.  <H5>  Competitors Are Waiting </H5>   Walesa's most serious competitors -- Aleksander Kwasniewski  with 16 percent and Waldemar Pawlak with 9 percent -- have so  far not submitted their candidacies. They will definitely try  to postpone the decision until the last moment. By declaring  their participation in the race, they will initiate a war with  the Belveder. The war will paralyze the government's routine  proceedings, so the later it begins, the better.    Being front-page politicians, Kwasniewski and Pawlak do not  have to rush things. They are popular, and they have strong  party structures to back them.    Could they give up trying to win the presidency for  themselves? Yes, they could. There are more candidates waiting  in the back room: In the Democratic Left Alliance, it is Sejm  Speaker Jozef Oleksy (3 percent), while in the Polish Peasant  Party -- Deputy Sejm Speaker Jozef Zych.  <H5>  Party Primaries </H5>   Among post-"Solidarity" parties, the slogan of having just  one candidate of the post-1980 August Poland is popular. But so  far, not much has happened -- it remains just a slogan.  "Primaries" are taking place in the parties and coalitions.    Only the Alliance for Poland (Christian-National Union,  Center Accord, Peasant Accord, Movement for the Republic,  Conservative Coalition) has come up with a candidate. It is  Supreme Court Chief Justice Professor Adam Strzembosz (4  percent).    In the Freedom Union [UW], two names appear most often:  Leszek Balcerowicz (4 percent) and Jacek Kuron (4 percent).  Each man has different ideas for reforms. By choosing one of  them, UW members will choose the party's image. If they decide  in favor of Balcerowicz, then UW will become a party of "friends  of the market" while if they choose Kuron, then UW will become a  party of "friends of the people."    It is a choice which a large part of UW members wants to  avoid making. Balcerowicz is "too liberal" while Kuron is "too  social democratic" for them.    So it cannot be ruled out that it will be... Hanna Suchocka  again. It could also be Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Bronislaw  Komorowski, or Andrzej Zoll.  <H5>  Whose Names Does "Solidarity" Whisper? </H5>   "Solidarity" is also talking about some candidates. The  names of Zbigniew Romaszewski and Jan Olszewski are being  mentioned. Both of them have been involved in establishing a  "Solidarity"-type political party. Their campaign could help  promote such a party.    But Marian Krzaklewski, the trade union's chairman, is not  among enthusiasts of such a party. He is strong enough to  successfully block both candidacies. Will he submit his own  candidacy?</p>

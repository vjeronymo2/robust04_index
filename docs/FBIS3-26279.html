Ai Pishan, chief of the provincial public security department  attended and addressed the meeting. He stressed: As the Spring  Festival is approaching, public security institutions at all  levels should devote much attention to cracking criminal  offenses and improving social order to ensure that the people  will spend the Spring Festival peacefully and harmoniously.    He pointed out: Last year Shaanxi made gratifying  achievements in cracking down on crime. But serious crimes will  still remain prominent for a period of time to come. Public  security institutions at all levels in the province should  continue to persist in the policy of severely cracking down and  striking relentless blows at all criminal offenses. Particular  attention should be paid to cities and towns where major crimes  frequently occur, and to factories, mines, and economic  development zones along railways and highways where the  situation in social order is complicated. Great importance  should be attached to severe crackdowns on crime in Xian and  Baoji. [passage omitted]</p>

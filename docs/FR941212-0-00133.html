(See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;26.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Offset actions against NTS contractors. When an NTS contractor is liable and a satisfactory settlement cannot be reached, the claims office will forward the file to the Regional Storage Management Office (RSMO) responsible for administering the Basic Ordering Agreements for storage in that geographic area.

When any claims office determines that a packing and crating contractor is liable and a satisfactory settlement cannot be made, a copy of the complete claim file will be forwarded by letter to the local contracting office administering the contract, requesting offset action. The contracting officer will conduct a careful review of the claim file and will make a determination on the issue of contractual liability on the information contained in the file and on personal findings of fact in accordance with the contract involved. (Also see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;26.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Title 4 CFR 102.3(b)(2) affords a carrier or contractor certain procedural rights prior to offset. A JA/claims attorney will certify to the contracting office that the Army has complied with 4 CFR 102.3 if requested to do so. The JA/claims attorney will give the carrier/contractor:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Written notice of the nature and amount of the debt, and the agency's intention to collect by offset if the debt isn't paid. The DD Form 1843 or demand letter provides this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The opportunity to inspect and copy agency records pertaining to the debt if requested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The opportunity to obtain review within the agency if the carrier/contractor requests this. If requested, the JA/claims attorney will review the file prior to offset. No oral hearing is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the agency to repay the debt. A carrier/contractor will normally be allowed 45 days to follow up a settlement offer with a check. If a satisfactory check is not received within the 45 days, the JA/claims attorney should offset the carrier/contractor without delay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) In accordance with 4 CFR 102.3(b)(5), the head of an area claims office or claims processing office may effect offset prior to completion of any or all of the procedures in paragraph (d) above if failure to promptly offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.198  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Compromise or termination of recovery actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subject to the limitations contained in this subpart, the Commander, USARCS, is delegated authority to compromise or determine collection action on claims against third parties in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3711.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.199  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Terms and abbreviations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions of terms and a glossary of abbreviations frequently used in recovery actions are in DOD 4500.34&hyph;R, in the definitions section, beginning at page XXXIV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.200  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Required references.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each claim office will maintain copies of the following references for recovery purposes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) DA Pam 27&hyph;162. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Personal Property Traffic Management Regulation (DOD 4500.34&hyph;R). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Domestic and mobile home personal property carrier approvals.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

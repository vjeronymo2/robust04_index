Narcotics Police Division sources say they are David  Sylvester Foster, 29, a higgler, who died on December 9 at the  Aruba Hotel in Panama City, while preparing to catch a COPA  flight to Jamaica.    Autopsy report shows that he died from an overdose of  cocaine  after a packet in which he had ingested the drug burst in his  stomach.    The other victim has been identified as Yvette Tores, who  died at the airport in Panama City on December 16. She fell ill  as she was about to board a COPA flight for Jamaica and later  died.    She too died of cocaine overdose when the plastic wrapping  in  which she swallowed the cocaine burst and poisoned her system,  local Narcotics Police Division source said. Her body and that  of Mr. Foster are still in Panama.    And an autopsy done at the Cornwall Regional Hospital in  Montego Bay on December 22 on the body of Mrs. Sonia  Whitley-Anderson, 38, of Kendal, Hanover, revealed that she too  died of a cocaine overdose. When on December 9, she collapsed at  Sangster International Airport, Montego Bay, aboard SAM flight  506 on its arrival from San Andres, Colombia, five packets of  cocaine were found in her brassiere.    The post-mortem examination on Tuesday showed that she had  78  packets of cocaine in her stomach. Also, an empty plastic  wrapping was found in her stomach, indicating that it had come  loose and the cocaine in it had killed her.    Cocaine experts say that "mules" hired to smuggle cocaine  into Jamaica in their stomachs, usually swallow between 1 lb.  and 1 1/2 lb of the drug. Medical experts roughly estimate the  death-producing dose of cocaine to be 1.2 grams, but much  smaller doses have been known to cause fatalities. A gram is  roughly equivalent to the weight of a paper clip. When cocaine  is ingested it disrupts the heart rhythm and depresses the  respiratory centre, causing immediate death.</p>

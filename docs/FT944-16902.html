			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kone to purchase US elevator group for Dollars 280m Kone, the world's third largest elevators group, has agreed to buy Montgomery Elevator of the US for Dollars 280m in a large expansion of its North American business. Montgomery, based in Moline, Illinois, is the fourth largest supplier of elevators and escalators in the US with annual sales of Dollars 400m and 3,800 employees. Dr Gerhard Wendt, Kone president, said the acquisition - the biggest it has made - would assist Kone in its 'long-term goal of becoming a major force in the important North American elevator market'. It will double Kone's North American market share to about 20 per cent while increasing the North American share of group sales from less than 10 per cent to about 25 per cent. The purchase follows a disposal programme which has concentrated Kone's operations on its core lifts business. Over the last 12 months it has sold MacGregor-Navire, a supplier of shipboard cargo handling equipment, Kone Cranes and Kone Wood. It is a clear sign of commitment to the business by the Herlin family, which controls about 40 per cent of Kone's capital and 70 per cent of the votes. In May, there was speculation that the Herlins intended to sell out after talks with Germany's Thyssen Group. Montgomery Elevator has five factories in four US states - Illinois, Kansas, Arkansas and Texas - and nearly 170 branches and sub-branches throughout the country. Kone plans to merge its own Kentucky-based Armor Elevator unit with Montgomery to maximise synergy benefits. It wants to lift Montgomery's annual profits to Dollars 25m-Dollars 35m from Dollars 15m-Dollars 20m. Dr Wendt said the two companies operations fitted well geographically, with Chicago and California the only large areas of overlap. 'Montgomery should fit into our international organisation like a hand in a glove,' he said. The purchase expands Kone's maintenance business, which it has relied on to maintain profitability at a time of a sluggish growth in new elevator sales. Montgomery maintains 48,000 elevators and escalators, taking Kone's total number of units under maintenance to 410,000. Montgomery and Kone have operated a joint venture in Canada since 1985. Mr Dan Blount, Montgomery president, said: 'During ten years of working closely with Kone personnel in Canada, we felt our companies were a good match in terms of corporate philosophy and ways of doing business. Becoming part of Kone is the best assurance for Montgomery's continued success in this tough international marketplace.' Last year Kone achieved a FM328m (Dollars 61m) profit after financial items, on sales of FM10.8bn.</p>

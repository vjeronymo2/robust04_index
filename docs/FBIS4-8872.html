			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ljupco Trpevski, minister without </F> portfolio, by Vasko Eftov and M. Bozinovska; place and date not  given: "Strong Measures Lead to Strong Currencies"]    [Text] The final verification of the agreement between the  Macedonian Government [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] and the World Bank will take place in the next  two to three days. It should result in an $80 million loan. This  will complete talks, which have lasted more than a month, by a  Macedonian team headed by Dr. Ljupco Trpevski, minister without  portfolio.    [VECER] Mr. Trpevski, last Tuesday the board of directors of  the World Bank accepted a structural adjustment program drafted  by the Macedonian Government. What are the initial impressions  concerning the possible results?    [Trpevski] Last Tuesday, the World Bank Directors approved  the development policy letter relative to the structural  adaptation program, as agreed upon in the final months of last  year with the World Bank. The International Development Agency  approved a loan of $40 million and the World Bank approved a  loan of $40 million. It is expected that some time around 14  February the agreements will be signed and that we shall start  to repay first all of the $107 million owed, so that we may  subsequently use the loans. We have already drafted  documentation submitted to the World Bank for an immediate loan  of $30 million from the IDA [International Development Agency]  from imports for the past four months. The balance of up to $80  million will be received subsequently with a monthly submission  of import documents. The first $30 million will be used to  settle the old debt while the balance will go to increasing  foreign currency reserves and meeting current commitments to the  World Bank and to the other so-called privileged international  financial institutions.  <H5>  Precise Figures </H5>   [VECER] A number of figures have been mentioned on the  amount  of loans we need, totaling $200 million. Is it possible now,  after the adoption of the program by the boards of directors of  the International Monetary Fund and the Bank, to cite a specific  figure of the dollar sum on which we could safely rely?    [Trpevski] We can rely on a loan of $80 million from the  World Bank. Furthermore, we have secured a loan of $35 million  from the International Monetary Fund, $17.5 million of which  will be used to repay the amount owed to the bank. The remaining  $17.5 million will be received toward the middle of the year,  based on our meeting the stipulations agreed upon with the Fund.    [VECER] Therefore, let us mention precise figures: as a  result of this program we could expect $80 million from the Bank  and the balance of $50 million if we regularly supply  documentation on imports, and $17.5 million from the Fund.  Therefore, at best, we can safely rely on obtaining $97.5  million. The specially stipulated conditions will have to be met  for us to obtain the balance of up to $200 million.    [Trpevski] This will depend on the way we implement the  program. It will determine obtaining the remaining $17.5 million  from the Fund. In the next few months, we shall resume talks  with the World Bank on a loan for structural adaptation, for $60  million. Meanwhile, a very positive initiative was launched,  involving us. We were recently informed of it through a variety  of channels: a Japanese Government's decision to put together an  economic package for Macedonia, a substantial share of which  will be planned jointly with the World Bank, which will  participate as a co-financier. The World Bank will collect the  funds which will be subsequently lent to us. Now one of the main  sources for investments in Macedonia by the World Bank will be  Japan.    [VECER] Let us look at the other loans. To begin with, is it  necessary to initial a new standby arrangement and obtain the  second half of the loans from the World Bank, or else will the  implementation of the present program suffice?    [Trpevski] No, we shall initiate talks about a standby  arrangement but this is not strictly related to the balance of  the loans. Actually, from our point of view, we would be  interested in signing a standby or ISAF [expansion unknown]  arrangement, providing that it is kept, for we know that the STF  [system transformational loan] arrangement is a preliminary for  a standby arrangement. Even with the signing of a standby  arrangement we appear as a country pursuing a stable economic  policy.    [VECER] To sum it up: Does it mean that the standby  arrangement is not a prerequisite for obtaining the balance of  the loan from the World Bank?    [Trpevski] It is not. The loan depends on whether we meet  the  conditions stipulated for the first half of the year.    [VECER] Shall we be able to meet these conditions? Inflation  has already substantially exceeded the projections by something  like 15 percent.    [Trpevski] Inflation is not a parameter. In terms of the  dynamics of inflation we must apply the other parameters, such  as wages.    [VECER] The second condition is that the privatization must  yield results. Naturally, when it is a question of obtaining the  second loan of $60 million, a certain share will be used to  improve the situation of the banks. However, in the  privatization area something is obstructing developments.    [Trpevski] It is accurate that one of the conditions set by  the World Bank is that we must show privatization results. I  believe that there will be no problems, for, based on what we  have agreed upon, this year essentially the enterprises should  submit plans for privatization, and the privatization achieved  so far must be checked. With the control and the approval of the  privatization carried out so far, certain results will become  immediately apparent.    [VECER] However, circles close to the government have  indicated that the content of the Privatization Law does not  meet the full approval of the World Bank.    [Trpevski] The World Bank rated the concept most highly. Its  main remark is that privatization is developing slowly and that  the bank believes that it must be faster and more extensive.  <H5>  A New Arrangement </H5>   [VECER] The signing of a standby arrangement depends to a  certain extent on the timing--from the second half of this year  to the start of the next. What is the basis for the government's  optimism that it would be able to meet the stricter requirements  earmarked with such an arrangement, if it can be reached prior  to the elections?    [Trpevski] The optimism is essentially based on the fact  that  in terms of the conditions we have agreed upon with the Fund for  concluding an STF arrangement there will be no major difference  between it and the conditions stipulated in the standby  arrangement.    [VECER] Does the government consider the STF arrangement  much  more liberal?    [Trpevski] This seems to be the case, based on the  agreements  concluded by the Fund with other countries. Meanwhile, we have  agreed with the Fund on a framework which is much stricter than  the usual standards, so that we should not expect the standby  arrangement to stipulate conditions much more difficult than the  present ones. The difference lies in the consequences of the  nonfulfillment of the STF or the standby arrangement. In terms  of the standby arrangement, the Fund is stricter: the agreement  becomes invalid if the conditions are not met.    [VECER] In such a case, would it be politically wise for the  government to make a standby arrangement before the elections?    [Trpevski] It seems to me that the main talks will be held  during the period of elections. My job is to work on concluding  the arrangement and let those involved in the political aspects  determine whether this is wise or not.    [VECER] The question inevitably arises whether the  government  needs the loans which, with an STF arrangement, will lead to  concessions that go beyond the usual standards applicable in the  case of such arrangements.    [Trpevski] Generally speaking, these are not concessions.  They express the belief of the government about the economy, to  the effect that this is the best way for resolving the situation  in which we find ourselves, bearing in mind the interests of the  state and not narrow party interests. The state interest is for  this country to have a stable economy, for that is the only way  in which it could participate in international affairs.    [VECER] What about the interests of the economy?    [Trpevski] They should be the same. It is in the interest of  the economy to work under conditions of stability and there can  be no stable conditions if inflation is high.    [VECER] You said that we had rejected selective loans to  finance agriculture, without any pressure on the part of the  International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The budget will  reduce its financing of agriculture and this entire burden is  now being shifted to the banks, which are as yet to improve  their situation. To what extent would they be able to do so, and  how much would go to agriculture?    [Trpevski] Let us be clear about one thing, to begin with.  The worst solution is to finance any kind of production by  printing more money. In most countries, agriculture is given  some protection. However, all such protection is based on real  sources. Only thus could we have a healthy noninflationary  economy. If we agree on this point, I think that there would be  no problems and we should not raise the question of whether we  should have selective loans or not. This would mean that such  selective loans could be abandoned and ensure support from  budget funds.    [VECER] Will there be less budget support?    [Trpevski] It is the same as last year's.    [VECER] Is this a suitable time for such an operation?    [Trpevski] If we wait, tomorrow will be more difficult.  Postponing this step for the future has brought us to a  dead-end, and we can no longer go on like this.    [VECER] Does such an impasse force us to borrow more to be  able to repay the old loans?    [Trpevski] Yes. In the eyes of the international financing  institutions we must be viewed as paying old debts regularly. It  is only thus that we can improve our chances in holding  discussions with the other two creditors: the Paris and London  Clubs, in order to settle our debts to them. Such conditions  must be met before we sit down to talk with the Paris Club. We  are not in a position to impose upon them our own conditions. To  begin with, we must have an arrangement with the Fund. The  second condition is to solve problems related to repaying the  amounts we owe to these privileged international financial  institutions. We are doing this. There is also another condition  that has as yet not been settled (it was settled by Slovenia and  Croatia). It is the matter of $3 billion of the so-called  nonallocated share of the debt of former Yugoslavia, so that our  share would be the one agreed upon according to the quotas  assigned by the International Monetary Fund. As a government, we  have not stated our position, but we must do so quickly, for  without this there will be no talks.  <H5>  False Dilemmas </H5>   [VECER] Does this not indicate that, once again, the economy  will be burdened with new loans?    [Trpevski] Let us clear up this issue. We owe the World Bank  $107 million, which we must repay if we wish to obtain new  funds. Currently we are repaying this debt in such a way that  $25 or $30 million will be paid by someone else (the donors).  This means that in the worst case we would be owing less to the  bank. Second, one share of the debt, let us say the loan from  the International Development Agency, is interest-free and we  repay debts which are interest-bearing so that, if nothing else  were to happen, at least the interest on the debt has been paid.  Another share of the loan is repaid from loans granted by the  Fund and the World Bank under the same or somewhat better  conditions than we had in the past.    [VECER] However, there is a stipulation according to which  we  have substantially exceeded the level of indebtedness.    [Trpevski] With the conclusion of the arrangement with the  Fund and settling our obligations to the World Bank and the  other privileged institutions, as well as membership in the  International Development Agency, we are engaged in talks with  the Paris and London Clubs with a view to finding a way to  reduce our indebtedness. They may agree to this. This is a way  to relieve the economy. Chances are good that as a result of our  steps the indebtedness coefficient will be lowered.    [VECER] Is it a standard option for IDA members to expect a  lowering of their indebtedness between 35 and 50 percent in the  course of their talks with the Paris and London Clubs?    [Trpevski] At this point I cannot be more specific. I will  insist on the need to appoint an expert team for the talks. In  general, this is not a question of any kind of party  involvement, for if such were to be the case I would give up.    [VECER] When should we expect such talks to begin?    [Trpevski] The moment we clear the problems with the World  Bank and reach an agreement within the government concerning the  third problem, which is assuming a share of the unallocated  debt. At that point we shall be prepared to begin the talks,  above all with the Paris Club.    [VECER] What is the latest plan for repaying the $107  million  owed to the World Bank?    [Trpevski] This is based on the funds supplied by the  donors,  estimated at about $25 million. However, the final answer will  be known by the 14th of this month. For example, Turkey has  indicated that the $1 million it has pledged will be given to us  somewhat later. That is why we shall have to use more of the  funds coming from the Soros Loan.    [VECER] The use of the Soros Loan is probably a forced step,  for the government believed that this option is much more costly  than the use of foreign currency reserves.    [Trpevski] Yes, this option is more costly. However, we have  already transferred $24 million from the currency reserves, $25  million from donors, $17.5 million from the Fund, $30 million  from the IDA and between $11 and $15 million from Soros.    [VECER] In the system of repaying our debts, the Netherlands  is playing a rather sensitive leading role. However, it is  unclear why, let us say, the European Union was so strict and  did not allow the FARE [expansion unknown] and the EKO  [expansion unknown] funds to be used to pay a share of the debt?    [Trpevski] In my view, there are three reasons. First,  bureaucracy is not slow only in Macedonia but virtually  throughout the world, which also means the European Union. The  second reason is the budget problems which are affecting all  members of the European Union, above all due to the deep  recession. In this case we should also take into consideration  the influence of our southern neighbor.    [VECER] Finally, are you getting ready to be the first  Macedonian representative to the International Monetary Fund and  the World Bank?    [Trpevski] The Macedonian quota is so small that we can have  no representative at the Fund or the World Bank. For example, in  our World Bank group the executive director comes from the  Netherlands, and his deputy from Romania; the representative in  the Fund is from Ukraine.</p>

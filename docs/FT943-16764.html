			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices The recent decline of the dollar and rise of commodity prices in general have strengthened many spices markets, reports Man Producten. The currency effect is straight forward. The relation ship of advances in coffee and oil and others to spices is more subtle. Farmers and exporters in the source markets tend to grow and handle a variety of materials. In Indonesia for example, if coffee is active, the traders naturally concentrate on it. Cassia which they may also sell, will not be cut or arrive from the mountains. As a result shortages can develop. Alternatively, farmers may take profits in coffee and hold spices which appears undervalued in comparison. The nutmeg and mace markets were steady this week at levels that remained very low compared with a few years ago, while a shortage of cassia supplies from the interior of Sumatra kept prices high.</p>

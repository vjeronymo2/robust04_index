			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Bosnian leaders agree to talks WINTER storms yesterday gripped Bosnia as leaders of the three warring parties agreed to attend a last-ditch meeting aimed at salvaging the emergency relief effort in the republic. Political and military leaders of the Moslem, Serb and Croat communities will meet tomorrow in an attempt to secure access for convoys serving about '3m people who are totally dependent on humanitarian aid for survival', said Ms Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The onset of heavy snow has highlighted the importance of the one-day meeting in Geneva, which coincides with growing calls within the UN operation in former Yugoslavia to pull out of Bosnia rather than risk further attacks on relief workers and UN soldiers escorting aid convoys. The convoys are faced with constant blockades despite guarantees of free movement from local military commanders, especially Serb leaders. The UN last month suspended aid convoys destined for about 1.5m people in central Bosnia after a Danish driver was shot dead. The Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, and his Croat counterpart, Mr Mate Boban, have reportedly agreed to attend the Geneva meeting. However, the Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, will reportedly send a delegation in his place. The freezing winter weather did not silence the guns in Bosnia yesterday. Serb forces stepped up their offensive on Olovo, north-east of Sarajevo, and some 8,000 Bosnian Serb soldiers massed east of the nearby town of Vares, which fell to Bosnian Moslem forces earlier this month.</p>

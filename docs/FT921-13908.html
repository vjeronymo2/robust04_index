			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: More BES offers THE Business Expansion Scheme is back, write John Authers and Paul Cheeseright. New offers include: Auction Raider, a 'scavenging' company from Neill Clerk, which will buy repossessed properties at auctions; Cavendish Home Investments, sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson, which will buy properties as part of a mortgage rescue scheme for The Mortgage Corporation; Kerrington Developments III, a North London property company sponsored by Johnson Fry; London Repossessions Fund, sponsored by Close Brothers, which will buy repossessed homes within the M25 area, and Johnson Fry Cash Backed High Growth Scheme, which will buy accommodation for the University of Ulster. This has tried to address worries about the security of BES companies by arranging for the university to buy a five-year Certificate of Deposit to cover all liabilities to BES shareholders. There is also one trading company - Racom Electronics, a Newbury-based company specialising in car alarms and electronic systems. It is now rare for manufacturers to use the BES, but Racom plans to raise the maximum Pounds 750,000 permitted, without a sponsor. It is already trading, and in the financial year to March 1991, it made pretax profits of Pounds 48,000 on turnover of Pounds 2.15m.</p>

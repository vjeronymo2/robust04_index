			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Books: Musician's troubled heritage AMARYLLIS FLEMING by Fergus Fleming Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20, 293 pages An affectionate family memoir. But what a family] Half-sister of Ian and Peter Fleming, the cellist Amaryllis is the daughter of Eve (a widow who never remarried because that would have meant losing a considerable amount of money) by Augustus John. The child was born in 1925 and Eve passed her off as an 'adopted' daughter, while the position of Augustus John - the affair with Eve was not long-lived - was supposedly that of a dear old family friend. When, at the age of four, her mother told Amaryllis she was adopted, the child believed the lie until she was in her early twenties. Her mother's treatment of her tended to confirm the falsehood, for Eve was, by all accounts, a dreadful, selfish parent. Extravagant in satisfying her own whims, in other situations, she pinched pennies until they - and all around her - screamed. One of Amaryllis's duties as a little girl was to take wilted flowers, removed from the vases in Eve's grand house, and deliver them to the deserving poor. Both Eve and her deceased husband Val came by their eccentricity naturally. Val's mother, the senior Mrs Fleming, was one of those rich eccentrics considered delightful by all except their criminally underpaid and overworked servants. Eve had at least one saving quality: she loved music and when Amaryllis's talent was discovered, her mother encouraged her. It is at this point that Fergus Fleming (nephew of his subject) is able to write more interestingly. The book picks up as it describes the slow process of becoming a serious cellist, the studies (and affair) with Pierre Fournier, and further lessons with the dramatic Guilhermina Suggia (subject of a great Augustus John portrait) and Pablo Casals, seen here very much in his bedroom slippers. To the younger generations of music-lovers, Amaryllis Fleming will be little more than a name, if that; for she made no commercial recordings (at least none that have remained in the catalogue), and did not have a spectacular career. She was, in her biographer's evaluation, 'a musician's musician'. And yet, her intense life illustrates not only the struggles of the musician's career but also the satisfactions. Amaryllis was not just a performer: she was an explorer. Doggedly she investigated the five-stringed cello, long obsolete, and after tireless research and expense, managed to have one made to her exacting requirements. Then she was finally able to play Bach's cello suites as she thought they were meant to be played. She became passionately interested in the then little-known baroque repertory, and she appeared chiefly as the guiding member of the Parikian-Fleming-Roberts Trio; when its violinist Manoug Parikian died in 1987, Amaryllis lost the will to perform. A by-pass operation and then a stroke put paid to any idea of public appearance, though she continued taking a few pupils. In addition to talent, being a musician requires courage. This Amaryllis evidently possessed to a remarkable degree. Fergus Fleming's biography makes her life sound like a wonderful achievement; and despite a troubled heritage and many setbacks, it also sounds like fun.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEADLINE NEARS FOR FILING IN SENATE ELECTION  </P> <P> Would-be candidates have until Monday to file papers allowing them to run in a  special election to fill the state Senate seat vacated by the resignation of  Joseph B. Montoya, who was convicted on corruption charges.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), the only elected official  expected to vie for Montoya's seat, is likely to emerge as the leading  candidate in the heavily Democratic 26th State Senate District.  </P> <P> Calderon will have to pick up more than half the votes in the April 10 special  election or face a runoff June 5. The special election will determine who  serves the remainder of Montoya's term, which expires in December.  </P> <P> Also scheduled for June 5 is the primary election to determine who will  represent the district for a full four-year term, starting Dec. 3. Each party's  top vote-getter will compete in the November general election.  </P> <P> Candidates who have filed declarations of their intention to run in the June 5  primary election are Democrats Calderon and Richard S. Gonzales of Baldwin  Park, Republican Joe Aguilar Urquidi of Alhambra and Libertarian Kim  Goldsworthy of Rosemead.  </P> <P> Montoya, who was elected to the Senate in 1978, was convicted Feb. 2 of  racketeering, extortion and money laundering. His conviction grew out of an FBI  sting investigation into corruption in the capital.  </P> <P> The 26th Senate District stretches along the southern part of the San Gabriel  Valley from Monterey Park to La Puente. Democrats outnumber Republicans more  than 2 to 1.  </P></p>

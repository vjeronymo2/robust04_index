			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: Andersen attacks writ over Magnet buy-out ARTHUR ANDERSEN, the accountancy firm, yesterday strongly rejected charges in a writ issued against it for its role as adviser to the Pounds 629m management buy-out of Magnet, the kitchen retailer, in 1989. Mr Roy Chapman, managing partner, said: 'The claim borders on fantasy. This is yet another case of those having lost money in a high-risk venture turning to accountants for restitution.' The comments follow confirmation from Bankers' Trust, the lead financiers to the Magnet deal, that it had launched legal action against the firm at the start of April on behalf of the creditors and shareholders of Airedale Holdings, the name by which Magnet is now known. The troubled MBO, one of the largest which had taken place in the UK at that time, was delayed by resistance from shareholders and then ran into difficulty with the banks, who found themselves unable to syndicate their exposure to financing the deal. The Bankers Trust action is for an unspecified amount.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Waste tip opponents claim risk to aircraft Opponents of a planned waste dump near Cardiff Airport warned yesterday that it would increase the risk to aircraft of bird strikes. They said that the 3m tonnes of waste a year that would be dumped on the site would attract flocks of scavenging gulls. Blue Circle Industries is seeking consent lasting 30 years to fill a disused 150-acre quarry at Aberthaw, South Glamorgan, with household waste. Mr Graham Greaves, managing director of Cardiff Airport, said the proposals presented a 'wholly unacceptable' risk of bird strike. 'The safety of air passengers must be paramount,' he said. He alleged that the dump would create only nine jobs, yet threaten the future of more than 5,000 people who depended on the airport for their livelihoods. 'Even the risk of accident could affect our business and cause air companies to withdraw their interest in our airport,' Mr Greaves said. Blue Circle says netting measures endorsed by experts in the defence ministry and Civil Aviation Authority will be designed to keep the birds away. The company first sought planning permission for the dump in March 1992, but Mr David Hunt, who was then Welsh secretary, referred it to a public inquiry.</p>

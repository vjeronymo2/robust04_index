			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Policies may cut terrorism cover INSURERS are likely to exclude cover for terrorism from commercial insurance policies following action by the Association of British Insurers, the industry's main trade body. The ABI has made available to its members the wording for a clause to exclude risk of damage due to terrorist action from commercial insurance policies. Most insurers are expected to include it in their policies because they are otherwise unlikely to be able to obtain reinsurance cover. Domestic policyholders are not affected by the change. The ABI also said it has prepared a separate wording that would allow companies to buy separate cover for terrorism up to a limit of about Pounds 100,000. This facility is designed to meet the needs of small businesses. However Mr Mike Jones, ABI chief executive, said: 'Commercial policyholders may unfortunately be left uncovered.' Mrs Ruth Rooley, director-general of the British Insurance and Investment Brokers' Association, said that some companies would be placed in an 'impossible situation'. The ABI said that the change had been forced on the UK market by 'worldwide reinsurers' in the light of considerable losses earlier this year in serious bombing incidents and the continuation of terrorist action in the UK. Reinsurers are expected to meet a substantial part of the Pounds 800m claims bill stemming from two IRA bombs in London in April and have pressed UK insurers to come into line with practice elsewhere in Europe.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: De La Rue De La Rue's impressive cash generation is not confined to the money spinning from its printing presses. Circumstances have conspired to make the last half particularly favourable. Yet the underlying rate of cash inflow is such that the decision to tap shareholders for Pounds 160m two years ago looks even odder now than it did at the time. The acquisitions which were to follow Inter Innovation have yet to materialise, and idle talk of share buy-backs only emphasises the embarrassment of riches which the company's Pounds 200m cash pile has become. Still, the management's impressive track record deserves some patience and negotiations to buy privately owned businesses can be protracted. It would make little sense to return money to shareholders now, only to ask for it back in two years' time. There are two obvious areas for expansion. Privatisation of banknote production in Europe could bring in useful extra revenue. Given the lukewarm attitude of the Treasury and the Bank of England to market-testing their own services, however, progress may well be slow. In any event, with banknote production only growing slowly, such contracts would not solve the problem. Currency-handling machinery is the longer term hope. Expansion there will depend on how long it will be before the banks get fed up with paying clerks large amounts to count money.</p>

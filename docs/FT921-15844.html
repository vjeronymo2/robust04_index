			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Letter: Commitment to better quality statistics Sir, Mr John Smith is quite correct when he suggests that the government's economic decision-making has been affected detrimentally by the deteriorating quality of official statistics. His criticisms echo those of many of us who for years have been concerned about the quality of statistics provided by government, not only in economics but in all fields of social policy. Indeed, I have yet to meet anyone outside the government and the Government Statistical Service (GSS) who does not believe that there is a problem. John Smith's proposed solution, whereby an independent statistical service is set up, may well be a long-term answer and should be the subject of further public debate. Such a radical change, however, would cause a great deal of upheaval and could take time to become established. Any government seriously wishing to restore public confidence in official statistics would do well in the short term to set up an independent national statistics council to act as a watchdog, as we in the Social Science Forum have consistently argued. For such a body to be effective, it would have to be independent of government, reporting directly to parliament, as the National Audit Office does. It would have the responsibility of providing a mechanism through which interested parties could contribute to decisions about the content of official statistics and of adjudicating where accusations of political abuse were made.

Economic recovery must begin with engineering industry, the  foundation of which was arms production, he said. It is  necessary to draw up a production program for exportable goods  based on existing structures, he went on.    "The problem of re-expanding arms production is so complex  that it is more than illusory to speak of producing new defense  systems," he emphasized.    The problem of Slovak arms producers' indebtedness was  resolved last year by granting loans funded by the National  Property Fund and from commercial bank reserves, but it is  difficult for arms producers to find new creditors, Magvasi  explained.    As for the firm Armex, founded by Meciar's government and  specializing in arms trade, there exist in Slovakia more  qualified and capable companies involved in the same activities,  he said. Armex's activities will have to be re-evaluated in the  context of the government's new economic policy, Magvasi said.    The government decides who can participate in deals on arms  exports by requiring that arms exporters obtain licenses, he  said, adding that he did not want to favor any particular firm.  Obviously, most arms producers are still state property, Magvasi  added.</p>

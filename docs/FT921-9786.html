			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Asylum bill warning MANY genuine asylum-seekers will be denied natural justice and could be returned to countries where they face imprisonment, torture and death unless the government's Asylum Bill is amended, the Law Society warned yesterday, Robert Rice writes. Proposals in the bill scheduled to have its second reading in the Lords shortly would create 'a barrier to justice' by requiring asylum-seekers to apply for leave to appeal before they could challenge a refusal of refugee status, the society said. Applications for leave to appeal would be considered without an oral hearing. This would deprive asylum-seekers of the chance to present their case at the vital point of entry into the appeals system. This denial of natural justice would be compounded by the extreme speed of the new system, the society warned. Many asylum-seekers would have as little as two days in which to prepare and present their case for leave to appeal. The society said this was an insufficient period in which to prepare their cases properly, particularly if they were in detention and found it difficult to contact a legal adviser. If they were refused leave to appeal there would be no further appeals and they could face immediate removal from the UK.</p>

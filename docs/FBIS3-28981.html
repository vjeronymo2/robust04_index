			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Defence Ministry has asked the Cabinet to speed  up an agreement on bartering agricultural products for a fleet  of six Italian G-222 aircraft before the price soars out of  reach, a source said yesterday.    The source said the Cabinet, on 2 November last year,  resolved that the Ministries of Defence, Commerce, Agriculture,  and Foreign Affairs negotiate with the Italian government to  barter farm produce for six G-222 planes on behalf of the Royal  Thai Air Force. But to date, the ministries have not been able  to finalise details of an agreement with the Italians and  further delay will likely mean that the price of the aircraft  will become too expensive.    The aircraft, worth about 3.4 billion baht including spare  parts and the cost of training, would be accounted for in the  fiscal period to 1998.    To accelerate the barter process, the Defence Ministry has  proposed the Cabinet assign the ministry to handle the task.  Alternatively it suggested waiting until the four ministries  come up with some solutions, but this would have to be soon.    According to the source, the Defense Ministry preferred  forwarding the issue for debate by the Cabinet, so as to avoid  further delay.</p>

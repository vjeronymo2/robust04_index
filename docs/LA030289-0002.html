			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 3 MIGRANT FAMILIES GO FROM HOOCHES TO JACUZZI  </P> <P> Paloma Rodriguez stood in the kitchen of her modern Carlsbad apartment, looking  into an empty living room, and exclaimed, "All of this is either a dream or a  miracle; maybe a little of both."  </P> <P> It was understandable that Rodriguez and her family felt as if they were living  a dream. Twenty-four hours earlier, her family was living next to a county  landfill, in a crude third-world-like hooch made of scrap wood. The dirt-floor  shack and others like it housing migrant workers were built against a canyon  wall, among the sagebrush and manzanita.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Comfortable Apartments  </P> <P> Rodriguez, her husband, Lorenzo Santos, and their three sons had lived as  squatters in Encinitas for more than 18 months. But now, with the help of the  some North County church leaders and other supporters, her family and two  others will live in a comfortable apartment.  </P> <P> Guadalupe Mojica Elizondo, Ruben Pina, and their two sons have run open-air  restaurants in migrant camps since coming from Mexico five years ago. Now, they  can cook for themselves on a gas range in a kitchen that has more modern  conveniences than the family knows how to use.  </P> <P> Maria Zavala and her husband, Rutilio Fuentes Sanchez, from El Salvador, have  lived in the North County migrant camps eight months.  </P> <P> Because the three were the only families left in the camps, the North County  Chaplaincy made finding shelter for them a priority. At one time there were as  many as a dozen families living in the largest of the camps.  </P> <P> Last month, all of the families and others were forced out of the Valle Verde  migrant camp -- situated on a ridge across El Camino Real from La Costa -- by  county health officials, who declared the camp a health hazard and ordered it  closed after many citizen complaints.  </P> <P> Undaunted, several dozen migrants moved a few miles south to the landfill,  where they built new plywood shacks and A-frames covered with plastic sheeting.  However, it took neighbors less than a month to pressure the county health  department and Encinitas city officials into closing down the new camp. The  migrants, who were told the camp was about to be closed, left the site on  Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Modern Amenities  </P> <P> But, for the three families, the eviction from the canyon happened on the same  day that the North County Chaplaincy, an interfaith denominational group  devoted to aiding migrant workers, found each of them apartments in the same  complex in Carlsbad, complete with a Jacuzzi.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the families were getting acquainted with the modern amenities  that many Americans take for granted, like a dishwasher, bathtub, thermostat,  oven and a gas fireplace. But, for the moment, each of the apartments is  without furniture. The migrants, including Maria Zavala, who is eight months  pregnant, are sleeping on the carpeted floor.  </P> <P> "We're sleeping on the floor but we're in a real home. . . . Last night the  kids ran all through the apartment, touching walls, flipping switches and  opening doors," said Rodriguez. She noted that each of the two bedrooms is  bigger than the primitive shack that housed all five of them.  </P> <P> The gas fireplace, complete with fake logs, was of particular interest to  Rodriguez's precocious 5-year-old son, Jairo. Minutes after occupying the  apartment, the youngster flipped a switch and jumped in terror when flames  began licking the fireplace.  </P> <P> "He came running, yelling, 'Momma, fire comes out of the hole in the wall,' "  said Rodriguez, laughing. "We used firewood for cooking when we lived in the  wilderness. These logs light without matches and don't burn."  </P> <P> On Tuesday night, the family bathed in an outside shower with cold water before  they were driven to their new home. Little Jairo was still shivering from the  previous night's shower when he awoke Wednesday morning on the floor of the  family's new home, Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'World Was Crumbling'  </P> <P> Jairo and his 7-year-old brother, Antonio, had never been in a bathtub until  they walked into their new bathroom. Rodriguez said she put the two boys in the  tub and turned the water on.  </P> <P> "They were amazed that the water was hot. They played in the tub for almost an  hour before I finally pulled them out," said the laughing mother.  </P> <P> For Rodriguez and her husband, who hail from the interior of Mexico, their new  living quarters were a godsend.  </P> <P> "Our whole world was crumbling around us on Friday, when we were evicted from  the camp. . . . But, all of a sudden, it was as if God intervened and said,  'All of you have suffered enough,' and found these three apartments for us,"  said Rodriguez.  </P> <P> The three apartments are within 30 feet of each other, in a complex that  includes a mixture of races and ethnic groups. The families are being housed  under a federal program that requires them to pay 30% of their net income for  housing while the government subsidizes the rest.  </P> <P> The adults in two of the families have qualified under the Immigration and  Naturalization Service's amnesty program, while Zavala's husband, who is from  El Salvador, has applied for political asylum.  </P> <P> More than anything, the decent housing affords Rodriguez hope.  </P> <P> "Now that we live in a real house, I'm going to send my children to school. I  want them to better themselves so they can have a better life than what we have  given them so far. But, if they grow up to have good educations and good jobs,  I want them to always remember when we lived in the wilderness. That's nothing  to be ashamed of. . . . We are poor but honest and do the best with what little  we have," Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> The woman, whose hands and face reveal the hard life she has known, looked in  wonderment at her modern kitchen.  </P> <P> "They tell me that this is a dishwasher," she tells a visitor. "Tell me, is it  true that it washes dishes automatically? Will you show me how it works?"  </P> <P> Suddenly, she burst out laughing and turned toward her husband. The couple's  oldest son, Jose, 15, went to San Diego with a friend on Friday and does not  know of the family's new home.  </P> <P> "We better call his friend and tell him where we live," she said. "Otherwise,  Jose is likely to go to our old home and not find us. He'll think that the  migra has arrested and deported us to Mexico. Wait until he sees this place,  even if it is without furniture. He'll think that we're rich now."  </P></p>

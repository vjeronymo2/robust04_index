			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (5): E-mail moves away from mainframes - Emma Woollacott finds local area networks are now playing host to electronic message systems ELECTRONIC mail is changing fast. A few years ago, it was largely the preserve of mainframe-based systems, and notoriously difficult to install and manage. But nowadays an increasing number of large corporates are downsizing to local area networks and are phasing out host-based e-mail systems in favour of LAN systems. Mr Mark Hassall, Microsoft's product marketing manager for Mail 3.0, says: 'LAN-based e-mail can give all the things people were looking for in mainframe systems. But users of things like Profs and All-in-One are paying exorbitant maintenance fees. There's a 10-to-one ratio between those costs and the costs of a LAN system'. BP Oil has recently switched from a mainframe-based environment towards Unix and PCs. Mr James Cunningham, project leader at BP, says: 'It was particularly attractive in the early days to our European associates, where it would be less easy to justify the cost of huge pipes to tap into an IBM mainframe.' LAN e-mail packages have also become more secure and flexibility and connectivity are improving. The main suppliers are beginning to introduce global naming, a feature which allows every server on a wide area network to distribute a list of all its users to every other server. This feature already exists in Banyan's Vines system, and will be included in Novell's next release of NetWare, NetWare 4.0, early next year. Combined with suitable gateway connections to other messaging systems, it allows a server route to make calls right across a WAN. There are now approximately 10m e-mail users worldwide, of whom around half are using a PC LAN-based system. Figures from market researcher Romtec suggest that some 90,000 UK users hooked up to a new PC-based e-mail system during the first half of this year. This makes e-mail one of the fastest-growing software areas and one which is winning a lot of attention from suppliers. The most important innovation is the emergence of the mail-enabled application. Whereas sending a mail message currently involves calling up the e-mail program separately, and creating a text-only message, in future 'Mail' will simply be a menu option in virtually any program, similar to the 'Print' command. Users will be able to create a spreadsheet in Excel, for instance, and mail it to any other user running Excel on the network, adding comments, graphs, even sound. Gateways will allow messages to be sent from PC to Mac to Unix workstation, even a fax machine. Mr Gavin Lennox, Lotus' product marketing manager for cc:Mail, describes a demonstration where sales reps used pen-based portable PCs out in the field to fill in electronic forms and then sent the information back to the office LAN instantly, using a wide area radio network, where it was automatically routed and processed. This type of application takes the emphasis away from simple messaging and into the area of workgroup computing, where groups of users can work collaboratively on shared information. E-mail conferencing becomes possible. Work flow can be automated so that, for example, an electronically-created expenses form can be filtered by the system and automatically routed to a manager for approval if the total exceeds a certain amount. Mr Allan Paterson, director of planning and control at Bass Breweries, is in the process of introducing Microsoft Mail throughout the organisation. Over 6,000 users worldwide will be added to the system over the next two years, and there will also be gateways to the e-mail systems of the company's principal customers and suppliers. 'It's improving productivity already,' he said. 'And in the last couple of weeks we've put it on the most senior desks, and we've found once they've tried it people are asking 'can you put it into my home?', or 'can you add such and such a person?' A me-too attitude soon builds up.' The snag in this vision of collaborative working is in the lack of a standard covering how the mail-enabled applications communicate with the messaging back-end, and how that back-end controls the addressing and routing of calls. Many mini and mainframe e-mail systems, in particular, make no distinction between the application and the back-end. In fact, few of the several hundred e-mail 'standards' currently in existence even agree on the definition of a message, let alone a common way of addressing and routing calls. Standards body CCITT has published a messaging standard, X400, but suppliers have found this so limiting that they have tended to implement their own versions of it, leading to a distinct lack of compatibility. Novell's Message Handling Service (MHS) has become something of a de facto standard for communication between different LANs, and is supported by most e-mail suppliers, but up to now there has been no standard way of mail-enabling applications. Until now, each e-mail transport system has had a different API and software developers have had to produce different versions accordingly. Two groups of suppliers have taken it on themselves to put an end to this confusion by producing a standard for writing applications programming interfaces (APIs) to allow developers to mail-enable applications. Microsoft is pushing the Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI), and has support from Digital Equipment Corp (DEC), Basnyan Systems, Hewlett-Packard and others. Meanwhile Lotus, Apple, Borland and IBM have teamed up to produce the Vendor Independent Messaging (VIM) standard. Novell is a member of both camps, and has promised that it will adapt MHS to support both. Users have pressed each group to include support for the other's standard, but so far with little success. The best bet for compatibility is the fact that both MAPI and VIM have been submitted to the X400 API Association, which is expected to produce a compromise Common Application Call Set in the near future. Once this happens, mail-enabling can really take off in earnest, although this won't happen overnight. Both Microsoft and the VIM consortium will take some time to bring their APIs into line, and the chances are that, just as with the original X400 standard, developers will add their own elements. And until a true mail-enabling standard emerges, users will be restricted to packages from either Microsoft or the main VIM members. As Lotus' Mr Lennox says, 'both groups are in around the same position - and that's close to the starting block'.</p>

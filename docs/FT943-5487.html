			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pay day for Man employees One director of ED&amp;F Man, one of the world's largest commodities traders, could net up to Pounds 6.7m as a result of the group's Pounds 500m flotation next month. Mr Dan Rosenblum, 49, heads Man's US sugar business and is the largest shareholder on the board with 9 per cent. The directors, many of whom incurred substantial debt to acquire the stakes, are widely expected to sell between 10 and 15 per cent of their collective 50 per cent holding. Some 50 employees will become millionaires - on paper at least - as a result of the flotation. The company will remain under employee control, however, with only 30 per cent in public hands. Man said trading was 'comfortably ahead' of last year, in spite of a sharp drop in the group's substantial fund management business. Last year the group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 70.7m (Pounds 50.5m). Man also named Mr Glen Moreno, former chief executive of Fidelity International, and Mr Garth Ramsay, former deputy chairman of Ivory &amp; Sime, as non-executive directors. About 75 per cent of the shares to be sold will be placed with institutions and the rest offered to the public. The shares, which will be priced on September 22, are likely to trade on a historic multiple of about 12 times, against a sector average of 14. The flotation will raise Pounds 90m, half of which will be used for the early repayment of preference shares.</p>

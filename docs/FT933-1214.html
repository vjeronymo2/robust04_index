			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (10): Resilience in a tough climate - France FRANCE'S venture capital industry, like a child, may find that it grows up more quickly in a more difficult environment. The recession which has hit French industry over the past year has limited the resources available to venture capital funds while making life much more difficult for small and medium-sized companies. So far, the industry has been resilient to the harsher economic climate which is expected to bring a contraction of about 1.5 per cent in Gross Domestic Product this year. Mr Dominique Peninon, president of AFIC (the French Association of Capital Investors) says that in 1992 - the latest year for which industry-wide figures are available - the total amount of new investment in venture capital projects slipped only slightly to FFr6.63bn, from FFr6.9bn in 1991. 'This was surprisingly high in the face of economic conditions' said Mr Peninon. 'It suggests investors continue to have confidence.' This was particularly the case in the technology and consumer goods sectors, which were the largest recipients of funds amongst the 1,888 venture capital investments in 895 separate companies. The current year, however, is proving more difficult. Insurance companies and banks, the principal providers of external finance for venture capital in France, have been tightening credit in response to problems in the property market and their expansion plans. 'Insurance companies feel they cannot afford to invest in unquoted high-risk investments at the moment,' says Mr Denis Mortier, director for France of the European venture capital association. Despite leaner times, some venture capital activities remain fairly brisk. 'Buy-outs are fairly active,' says Mr Mortier who adds that the need for replacement capital has also been boosted by the need on the part of institutional investors to realise capital gains. The ability to exit from investments, however, has become more difficult - 'from the end of 1992 it started to become more and more difficult to realise investments,' says Mr Peninon. He blames the weakness of Paris' secondary stock market as well as the slowdown in the economy and in mergers and acquisition activity for the trend. THE various pressures facing the French venture capital industry may well accelerate its pace of development. 'There are going to be very big changes in our industry over the next two to three years,' says Mr Mortier. One such change will be an increasing consolidation of the number of venture capital firms. There are more than 150 venture capital firms in France, more than in the UK. But the value of money they manage is about half of the UK total. The discrepancy reflects the fact that the French market is less mature than its UK counterpart - 'in a younger market you have a lot of funds,' says the manager of one venture capital group. 'It is only when investors can recognise the quality companies that the number is limited.' The difficult conditions now being experienced are expected to hasten the trend to a fewer more powerful players through the failure or merger of struggling funds. Most members of the French venture capital industry welcome such a process. But they argue that further reforms are necessary to ensure the continued development of the industry in France. The two most important are the development of pension funds and the creation of a stronger market on which venture capital investments can be floated. The weakness of the French pension fund industry is perceived as an important problem by venture capital firms. 'It deprives us of a source of finance which is available to counterparts in the UK and US,' says one investor. Mr Motiet estimates that the difference between the FFr7bn received as external funds by UK venture capital companies in 1992, and the FFr3.2bn received by French businesses in the same year, is accounted for almost completely by the strength of UK pension fund investments. Moves are afoot in France to encourage the development of a pension fund system, prompted by the crisis in the state pensions system. The implementation of new laws, tax incentives and regulations is expected to be a gradual process. But, as Mr Peninon, points out, even one per cent of the funds which go towards pensions in France would represent an enormous stimulus for the French venture capital industry. ANOTHER boost for the industry is sought in the area of stock markets. After a brief flurry of activity in 1986 and 1987, venture capital companies have found it almost impossible to float their investments on the French stock markets. 'There is no appetite on the stock market at the moment,' says Mr Peninon, who argues that investors were disappointed by the first wave of venture capital listings on France's secondary market. The solution, according to many of the players in the industry, is the creation of a 'European Nasdaq' - a computerised off-market trading system. They argue that this would resolve the weaknesses of Europe's secondary stock markets, raise liquidity, and tempt international investors, particularly from the US. For the moment, however, the industry must continue to struggle with the grim economic conditions. Even here, some industry members see benefits. 'The crisis has forced venture capital managers to become much more 'hands-on,'' says Mr Mortier. 'It will create much more experience investment teams.'</p>

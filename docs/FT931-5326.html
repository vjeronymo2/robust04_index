			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Go-ahead for Pounds 200m Manchester retail plan A Pounds 200m scheme for one of the largest out-of-town shopping centres in the UK yesterday won planning permission from Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary. The 300-acre Trafford Centre at Dumplington near Manchester, which will have 1m sq ft of shopping and sports facilities, will be the largest retail project in the north-west of England. The decision was greeted with dismay by local authorities, developers and retailers who fear it will further increase already fierce competition, to the detriment of the many shopping centres in the greater Manchester area. Work on the centre is expected to begin within two years and is likely to be completed by 1997. Property experts said it was likely that the centre would be the last large shopping centre to win planning approval. Very few property schemes have been initiated since the property market went into decline three years ago but Mr Robert Hough, chairman of Manchester Ship Canal Company, the developers of the site, is confident of attracting finance and tenants. He said: 'It is a greenfield site, linked to three motorways with a large conurbation on its doorstep. It will be a magnet into the north-west.' More than 7m people live within an hour's drive of the site which is bounded by Trafford Park, the M63 and the Manchester Ship Canal. Critics of the scheme said the decision appeared to cut across draft planning guidelines issued by the government at the end of last year. These favoured planning restraint for out-of-town shopping centres to protect existing centres. A consortium of eight of greater Manchester's 10 metropolitan district councils and five large property developers, which oppose the proposal, is considering whether to mount a High Court challenge. Mr David Kaiserman, senior assistant city planning officer for Manchester City Council, said: 'We see development of this type making it even more difficult to achieve regeneration in the inner parts of the city. A large peripheral development appealing only to people who have cars is not doing anything at all in our view in net terms for urban regeneration.' Mr David Brown, president of the Manchester Chamber of Trade and manager of the city's Arndale Centre, said: 'Something like this will have an effect on all levels of trade in the city of Manchester and other surrounding towns and will inevitably lead to job losses in the city centre. It will affect the big multiples and the small guys.' Mr Brown said there was already a 'massive choice' of retail outlets in Manchester and the 10 large towns in an outlying 10-mile radius. The consortium opposed to the scheme includes P&amp;O, owners of Manchester's Arndale Centre, MEPC, Land Securities, Norwich Union and Shudehill, a company formed by the Co-operative Insurance Society and the Co-operative Wholesale Society. Shudehill has planning permission for a 500,000 sq ft retail development on a site beside the Arndale Centre. Mr Kaiserman said Shudehill had indicated it would have to reconsider its plan. Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council, which covers Dumplington, welcomed the decision to give the go-ahead for the centre. Mr Michael Crawley, senior assistant director for plan-ning, said it would contribute to regeneration at Trafford Park and complement rather than adversely affect other centres.</p>

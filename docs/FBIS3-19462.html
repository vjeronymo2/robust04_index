			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Copenhagen, March 16 (AFP) -- Danish Prime Minister  Poul Nyrup Rasmussen on Wednesday [16 March] blasted Britain's  insistence on maintaining current minority blocking rights  within a future European Union (EU) expanded to 16 members.    He said in a communique that he regretted that "a technical  issue, the size of the blocking minority, destroys our joy at  seeing Norway join the other countries (Austria, Finland and  Sweden) that have signed agreements on procedures for their  admission to the EU."    Britain, with some backing from Spain, demands that the  entry  of those four countries should not dilute the ability of bigger  EU members to block decisions they do not like.    Currently, 23 out of 76 votes divided up among the present  12  members are enough to block majority-approved decisions. Most  members want to maintain this 30 percent level, but Britain and  Spain think this would go against their interests, since those  two countries could no longer combine with one smaller member to  constitute a blocking minority. Other members favor a shift to  27 out of 90 votes.    The Danish prime minister said that Denmark could not agree  with the British stand "because a successful conclusion to  enlargement (of the community) is an absolute condition for  letting the European Union meet the next and decisive challenge:  integration of the new democracies in Central and East Europe.    "The future of Europe is at stake here, neither more nor  less. We expect the British Government to recognize the fact  that the next meeting of (EU) foreign ministers, in Brussels on  March 22, is really becoming a last-chance meeting."    Earlier in the day, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg  Petersen called the British stand "untenable," adding that "I  don't like to use the word `crisis,' which has been overused in  the past, but this time the EU really finds itself in a deep  crisis" because of the British demand.    Opposition leader Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, a former foreign  minister, joined the criticism, saying that "It is  incomprehensible that Great Britain has chosen to isolate itself  in a corner by adopting an indefensible attitude that weakens  the power of decision of a Europe enlarged by several members.    ``The British cannot at the same time be firm advocates of  enlargement and make the EU's decision-making process even more  difficult.''</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Tokyo's ruling coalition gets WTO ratified Japan yesterday ratified the establishment of the World Trade Organisation, the climax of a prolific parliamentary session, ending today, the results of which will be felt for many years. In passing the WTO bills, the three-party ruling coalition of conservatives and socialists has defied its critics. Many thought it would be too divided to govern effectively when it seized power at the end of June, ending the Liberal Democratic party's humiliating year in opposition. The government has in its first full 10-week session since taking office passed laws to bring significant changes to the political and electoral system, tax, pensions and farming. The LDP's skill in cajoling and coercing its socialist partners enabled it to dominate important parliamentary committees, where agreements are prepared in private before public adoption in the chamber. The session's achievements, obscured by the political wranglings of the past few months, include: Political reform. Japan's discredited old method of choosing members of parliament, a unique multi-seat constituency system where politicians could win a seat with as little as 10 per cent of the vote, switches on December 25 to a mixture of single-seat and proportional-representation districts. Many MPs are uncomfortably aware that, as a result, they may now be sitting out their final term. Farming. Rice imports are to begin in January, breaking a historic taboo on regular (rather than emergency) sales of foreign rice. This is to happen in small stages, starting with 4 per cent of the market. It shows how the balance of power has shifted from once influential farming communities to cities, where consumers rather than producers are king. To get agreement on this, the LDP had to resort to traditional methods - a Y6,010bn (Pounds 38bn) pay-off, officially to help farmers adjust to cheap international competition, also agreed during the last session. But first, it needed the support of the Social Democratic party. The price of that was another pay-off, to be enacted today, of Y100,000 per family to those still suffering from the effects of the 1945 atomic bombings. Nuclear victims constitute one of the few traditional left-wing causes that the socialists still uphold. Tax. An income tax cut, needed to stimulate demand as the economy enters a painfully slow recovery, is to be followed by an equally important rise in consumption tax, from 3 per cent to 5 per cent in 1997, needed to compensate for an expected decline in the income tax base. A botched attempt to achieve this contributed to the collapse of one Japanese government over the past year. Pensions. An increase in the pensionable age, from 60 to 65, plus a rise in national pension scheme premiums, against opposition from a weakened union movement. This is needed to reduce demands on Japan's rising budget deficit from the growing number of elderly. More than one in four Japanese will be over 65 by the year 2020, up from around 13 per cent now. Yet the performance has won little thanks from voters. The sales tax increase is understandably unpopular. Accordingly, the coalition's approval rating has plummeted during the session, to 29 per cent according to the latest poll, five percentage points lower than a previous survey published just before the session opened in September.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Case of the 1.3-Trillion-Rupiah Loan </F> Becomes Even More Murkier"]    [Text] The crisis which has hit the world of banking,  primarily in the aftermath of the 1.3-trillion-rupiah illegal  loan, a case which is becoming murkier and murkier, this week  seems to have turned into a national problem requiring the  serious attention of the monetary authorities.    The case of the loan illegally granted by the Indonesian  Development Bank (Bapindo) to Eddy Tansil, alias Tan Tju Hong,  the head of the Golden Key Group, cannot be considered trivial,  because it is closely tied to the credibility of national  banking in the eyes of the international banking community. It  is really a matter of "life or death" for national banking.    What is even more disturbing is the allegation that the  illegal lending, which has been going on for the past two or  three years, stems from a "magic letter" from an important  figure in the bureaucracy to the monetary authorities, who are  also the agents for Bapindo stockholders. That is why the  1.3-trillion-rupiah illegal loan "smells of collusion".    Meanwhile, the Bank of Indonesia (BI) itself, as the central  bank which has the authority to oversee executor bank  activities, was unable to do very much in this case. This is  because the mechanism of checks and balances between the Bank of  Indonesia and the Department of Finance was not running very  well.    But now, in this era of openness which keeps on rolling  along, it seems that the monetary authorities, both the governor  of the Bank of Indonesia and the minister of finance, have  agreed to a thorough disclosure of non-performing loans,  especially those with BUMN (State-Owned Corporate Bodies) banks.    Because they are determined to carry out a thorough  investigation of all non-performing loans, the monetary  authorities must not fail to investigate down to its very roots  the case of the loan which Bapindo illegally granted to the  businessman Eddy Tansil. Whoever is behind that illegal loan  must also be uncovered to public view.    As a state bank, and therefore a bank belonging to the  people  of this country, Bapindo is obliged to disclose the problem of  the 1.3-trillion-rupiah illegal loan which has now become a  national problem. The people must know what is happening in the  BUMN banks because in fact the funds in those state banks belong  to the people.    Therefore, the minister of finance and the governor of the  Bank of Indonesia in the previous cabinet must give us a clear  explanation of how so much credit could have been granted to  this businessman whose bona fides are not so good, so that the  case of the illegal loan can truly be opened up.    At a hearing which Commission VII of the DPR [Parliament]  specifically held with Bapindo in Jakarta on Thursday (10  February), the illegal loan could not be disclosed thoroughly.  The procedure for granting the loan and the process for settling  it became even murkier because it was covered up by an  "explanatory veil," i.e., bank secrecy.    It seems that some bankers use Banking Law Number 7 of 1992,  which includes regulations about bank secrecy, as a "shield" to  cover up large-scale non-performing loans.    Up to now, in fact, very few large-scale non-performing  loans  have been thoroughly disclosed, especially if there is even a  hint that these problem loans are tied to the names of certain  important figures in the bureaucracy.    Nobody can deny that the world of national banking is "sick"  right now. The period of consolidation, part of the effort to  repear the weak conditions resulting from the application of a  tight-money policy, isn't even over yet, and now national banks  are hit again by the disaster of trillions of rupiahs in illegal  loans.    To heal the national banking world again and to restore the  confidence of international banking the only option for the  nation's economic regulators, monetary authorities and  law-enforcement agencies is to carry out a thorough  investigation of the 1.3-trillion-rupiah illegal loan.    Everyone thought to be involved must be scrutinized. It is  important to uncover the part or the process of granting such a  large-scale loan which violates the regulations or is considered  illegal.    The government must take a firm stand in dealing with the  1.3-trillion-rupiah illegal loan which Bapindo granted to the  businessman Eddy Tansil. If it is proved that there was an  important figure in the bureaucracy involved in collusion,  action must be taken against him as quickly as possible, for no  other reason than to restore the image of national banking in  the eyes of the people of this country and of the international  banking community.</p>

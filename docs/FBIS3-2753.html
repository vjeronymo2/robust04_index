			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO correspondent He Jiazheng (0149 0502 2973) </F> and XINHUA correspondent Chen Yun (7115 5366)]    [Text] Beijing, 28 Feb (XINHUA) -- At a discussion session  this afternoon at the Huairentang Hall with participants of a  special seminar for managers of large state enterprises, State  Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua said: During the current  transition from the old system to the new system, there are many  contradictions and problems which require a process of breaking  in. The role of large and medium state enterprises is to do  everything possible to smooth and shorten the break-in process.  He added: China's reforms will be promoted if large state  enterprises carry out the central government's reform programs  and measures in an exemplary manner.    The "Special Seminar for Managers of Large State  Enterprises," cosponsored by the Organization Department of the  CPC Central Committee and the State Economics and Trade  Commission, was inaugurated on 21 February. At the seminar, 40  managers from 40 large state enterprises from all across the  country studied in depth the guidelines of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the major reform  programs to be launched by the central government this year, as  well as discussed the difficult and crucial points related to  the establishment of a modern enterprise system.    Vice Premier Li Lanqing chaired today's discussion. He began  the discussion by saying he was very happy to attend and listen  to views on behalf of Premier Li Peng. Then Zhao Zongnai,  deputy director of the Organization Department, gave a briefing  on courses studied at the seminar. He was followed by Vice  President Li Yunmao of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company,  President Chen Jie of the Beijing Peony Electronics Group, Party  Secretary Gao Rumao of the Datong Mining Bureau, Deputy Party  Secretary Xu Kaicheng of the Jinshan Petrochemical Corporation,  and Deputy Party Secretary and Vice President Zhao Guangjie of  the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, who gave reports on their  understandings gained from the study.    After listening to speeches by seminar representatives, Zou  Jiahua praised the Organization Department and the State  Economics and Trade Commission for cosponsoring the seminar  which has benefited its participants. He said: During the  great historical period of reform and establishment of a  socialist market economic structure, many of the previous  measures for a planned economy are no longer in use and are  replaced by brand new rules and regulations. Therefore, our  primary task is study; managers of large and medium state  enterprises in particular must study diligently. Enterprise  managers should first study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics; second, new  rules, regulations, and policies; and third, new knowledge and  skills. In organizing study classes, it is necessary to  mobilize all forces that can be mobilized to manage classes,  including party schools, educational academies of cadres, and  training centers of various departments, local governments, and  enterprises. Particular attention must be paid to managing  short-term intensive study and training classes oriented to  entrepreneurs of the new period. We must comply with General  Secretary Jiang Zemin's instruction on more time for study and  less time for socializing, never relaxing our efforts at study  regardless of work schedules. This is the basic requirement of  entrepreneurs in the new period.    Zou Jiahua stated: Presently the State Council is selecting  100 enterprises for pioneering the reforms, and is studying  measures to further improve the external environment of  enterprises. However, they should pay greater attention to  their internal environment, continue to implement the  "regulations" for changing the operating mechanisms of  enterprises, and strengthen their internal management. The new  measures for the reforms adopted by the government aim at  helping state enterprises transform their operating system,  enabling the enterprises to utilize their advantages to take  part in market competition. Party organizations and leading  cadres at all levels in enterprises should enhance their  confidence, increase ideological work, and unite and lead the  vast numbers of workers and staff to work hard together so that  our large state enterprises will shine once again in market  competition.    Wen Jiabao was present at the discussion.</p>

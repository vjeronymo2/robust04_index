			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> BRITISH BAND ROACHFORD ALL MIXED UP AT THE PALACE  </P> <P> To enjoy the Roachford show at the Palace Wednesday night, you had to do some  serious fantasizing.  </P> <P> Mainly, you had to imagine what this black British band -- fronted by  singer-keyboardist Andrew Roachford -- would sound like with properly mixed  sound.  </P> <P> The set was maddening. Sometimes, for instance, you couldn't hear the drums.  Then when you heard the drums, you couldn't hear the vocals. It all had a  distancing effect on the frustrated audience, which didn't get fully involved  no matter how hard the band was trying.  </P> <P> But there were enough snatches of brilliance -- particularly in Andrew  Roachford's singing -- to grab your attention and make you curious about seeing  the band under better audio circumstances.  </P> <P> Roachford's up-tempo music is rock-based, with assorted overlays of funk, blues  and pop. Though rock-based, the music's funk and soul elements stood out in  concert -- especially the derivative ones. Motown and James Brown influences  were everywhere, and Roachford's vocals often slid into that helter-skelter  phrasing that Jimi Hendrix often used.  </P> <P> Besides the sound, the other annoying aspect of Roachford's set was all those  soul-revue cliches, which tended to cheapen the performance.  </P> <P> What is most unusual about this band is its use of rock -- still rare for  blacks, British or otherwise. Roachford is popular in Britain but its Epic  Records debut album, "Roachford," featuring the fast-rising "Cuddly Toy"  single, is just out in this country. Breaking Roachford into this country  should be easier since Living Colour broke the color barrier in rock. DENNIS  HUNT  </P></p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway to streamline gas policy NORWAY yesterday announced sweeping reforms to gas policy designed to give foreign oil companies greater influence over their natural gas reserves and to facilitate more efficient gas resource management. Speaking in Oslo to delegates of the Seventh European Gas Conference, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, said that foreign oil companies would be allowed representation in gas sales negotiations with potential buyers. Hitherto, gas sales negotiations have been conducted solely by the Gas Negotiating Committee (GFU), comprising Statoil, the state oil company, Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum, the other Norwegian oil companies. Mrs Brundtland said although she was pleased with the achievements of the GFU, adjustments were necessary to gas policy. The changes would enable closer links between resource management and sales activities to be forged in order to accommodate a more efficient system for gas disposal, she explained. She also unveiled a new system in which gas fields would be designated as sources of supply for contracts under negotiation. Under the new scheme the energy and industry ministry would decide which gas fields would supply a given contract before its conclusion, instead of after. Mr James Allcock, head of gas purchasing at British Gas, said he was pleased by Norway's announcement. 'The GFU itself was formed to deal with some unsatisfactory elements in the negotiation relationships and now we see its structure evolving in the light of experience. As gas buyers we welcome the decision covering the sources from which contracted gas will come and we believe this will assist our negotiations,' Mr Allcock said. British Gas is at present negotiating with the GFU on contracting annual Norwegian gas supplies of 5bn cubic metres. Gas price renegotiations between Norway and Germany covering supply from the giant Norwegian North Sea Troll field have become protracted and arbitration could be used to resolve the issue. Ruhrgas, the big German distributor, has contracted 14bn cu m of gas from the Troll field and has an option that must be exercised by 1995 to take on an additional 7bn cu m. The GFU is calling for higher prices because of the advantages of gas over competing fuels.</p>

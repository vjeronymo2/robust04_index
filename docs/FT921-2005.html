			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Middle managers could still work under Mr Smith - If Labour wins, would its tax increases demotivate managers and damage the economy? BY RAISING the top marginal tax rate for employees from 40 per cent to 59 per cent, Labour's tax increases are almost a mirror image of those in Mr Nigel Lawson's 1988 Budget, when he cut the higher rate of income tax from 60 per cent to 40 per cent. A research study on the effects of the 1988 cuts provides some clues to the likely effect of Labour's proposed increases. The study by the late Professor Chuck Brown and the author was based on interviews with 316 accountants in private practices spread across London, the south-west and mid-Scotland. The response rate was 69 per cent. Accountants were chosen because they were mostly higher-rate taxpayers, knowledgeable about tax and in a position to vary their workload. They were asked whether there been any change in their working hours, holidays, the amount of work taken on outside the practice and the amount turned down in the practice. Those over 45 years old were asked about any changes in retirement plans. The interviews took place in 1989-90 and the questions concerned the year before and the year after the 1988 Budget. In the initial stage, tax was not mentioned by the interviewer. On balance, there had been more hours worked, more holidays taken and more work turned down. Of those who had changed their retirement plans, five times as many were proposing to bring forward their retirement as to postpone it. However, only seven out of 316 gave tax as a reason for a change in behaviour, and these were almost equally divided between those for whom tax cuts had provided an incentive and those for whom the opposite was true. At the end of the interviews, respondents were asked direct questions on the effects of the tax cuts on their behaviour and on that of their clients. Nearly a quarter of accountants whose tax rates had fallen by at least 5 per cent said they had spent more and a similar proportion said they saved more. On clients' behaviour, the most significant response was that 30 per cent said clients were now less concerned with tax avoidance and more concerned with the economic merits of investment decisions. How far can these findings be reversed in respect of the Labour party proposals? Clearly, the world is not the same as it was in 1988; nor are Labour's proposals a precise reversal for top income-tax payers of the 1988 cuts. Nonetheless, the 1988 findings are very relevant. There is no reason to doubt the central message of the 1988 findings - that there will be some disincentive effects and some incentive effects  - but the net effect on work effort is unlikely to be significant. This conclusion is supported by earlier research findings. Many of the 'middle managers', about whom top businessmen have spoken with such passionate concern, may well wish to work more, not less, in order to pay their high mortgages and their school fees - if, that is, they are in a position to increase their pay by working more. Of course, many managers cannot respond in this way. This is less true for the self-employed, but so far Labour has made no proposals to raise their national insurance contributions. The top marginal tax rate for the self-employed under Labour would be 50 per cent, not 59 per cent. It is also necessary to maintain a sense of proportion. Even at 59 per cent, the combined rate of National Insurance contributions and top income tax would be lower than the rate which has applied at any time since the second world war, except for the period 1988-92. On the other hand, many other countries have cut direct tax rates in recent years; 59 per cent represents a relatively higher rate in 1992 than it did in the early 1980s. Our analysis suggests that the most potentially damaging effect would be to increase tax avoidance, which might distort investment patterns, as well as reducing expected tax revenue. The tax avoidance effect, however, should be mitigated by the fact that returns on savings and investments will not be affected by extra national insurance contributions: the proposed top rate on investment income is 50 per cent. In recent years, many tax-avoidance loopholes have been closed, and since Labour plans to tax almost all fringe benefits to employers' national insurance contributions, one obvious potential opportunity has also been discouraged. But Labour has not said what it proposes on capital gains tax (CGT). If it continued to be charged at the taxpayer's top marginal rate of income tax (50 per cent), it would be exceptionally high by international standards, and would be likely to encourage investors to lock in to their investments, to the detriment of capital mobility. On the other hand, if the link with income tax were broken and capital gains tax left at a maximum 40 per cent, new possibilities of tax avoidance - through conversion of income to capital gains - would emerge. But too much should not be made of this. Because of the separate CGT threshold, the present link is not watertight; and, throughout most of the life of CGT we have lived with much bigger differences between the rates of income tax and CGT. All in all, the evidence from our study suggests that the increases proposed by the shadow chancellor would be highly unlikely to cause significant disincentive or other serious detrimental effects.

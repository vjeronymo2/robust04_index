			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Ministry to investigate stockbroker JAPAN'S ministry of finance is to investigate an alleged loss-compensation guarantee by Yamatane Securities, a second tier broker, in connection with manipulation of a client's investment account. Mr Nobuhiko Matsuno, head of the ministry's securities bureau, said they would search for a written contract guaranteeing compensation, which is outlawed by last year's Securities and Exchange Law. If such a written guarantee is found, Yamatane will be the first offender of the revised law. Brokers manipulated clients' accounts in order to help dress losses by transferring loss-making investments from one client to another. Brokers, under great pressure from clients, transferred investments in the hope that the stock market would eventually recover. The continuing slump in prices has broken the cycle, with investors refusing to accept loss-making portfolios. Clients left holding the loss-making investments have started to demand the brokers take the stock off their hands and pay damages.</p>

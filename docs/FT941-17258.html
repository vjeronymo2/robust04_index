			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: New structure and sectors of the All-Share Index The UK stock market tables published in today's FT are the first to use the revised FT-SE Actuaries classification, writes Peter Martin. The traditional All-Share categories have been given their first thorough overhaul in two decades, to yield sectors that more accurately reflect the shape of today's market. Sectors have been merged or subdivided as their relative importance has changed. The new classification system is of special interest to FT readers because it shapes the layout of the paper's share price listings, the London Share Service. As a result of the changes, several hundred of the 3,000 or so securities quoted on the pages change sectors. To ease the transition, yesterday's FT provided a full alphabetical list of shares carried in the London Share Service. Readers may wish to use it for reference so as to find their way easily around the pages. There is one particular change worth noting. Foreign stocks which are not part of the main classification - those categorised as Americans, Canadians, etc - move from the beginning of the classification scheme to the end. We regret any inconvenience caused to readers by the change of sectors, and hope that it will be short-lived as the new structure becomes familiar. Though we believe that the service is improved, we are conscious that disruption to long-established habits brings its own costs. After this burst of activity, we are hoping for a period of greater stability. The structure of the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index (formerly the FT-Actuaries All-Share) is shown below. It contains three tiers: Economic groups, Industry sectors and Sub-sectors. Each company has been allocated to the industry sub-sector whose definition most closely describes the nature of its business. More detailed information on the new FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification System, including a set of the Classification Ground Rules, can be obtained by writing to: The Secretary, FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee, Financial Times, One Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL.

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices Prices of all grades of pepper rose considerably this week, reports Man Producten. Indonesian shippers were most reluctant to offer any white pepper because of disappointing and delayed arrivals of new crop and this helped to push prices up by USDollars 250 to Dollars 300 a tonne. Spot white was on offer at Dollars 3,300 and prompt shipment at Dollars 3,150, c and f. Black pepper prices were also firmer across the board. Rising demand coupled with limited supplies from most origins pushed prices to new highs. Black pepper of fair average quality for spot delivery reached about Dollars 1,850 a tonne and better grades were traded at about Dollars 2,000. In the US market the spot price exceeded 90 cents a pound.</p>

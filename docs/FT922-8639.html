			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Offices planned for prime London site PROPOSALS to build a 680,000 sq ft office and residential complex on the site of the Westminster Hospital close to the Houses of Parliament were yesterday submitted for planning approval. The existing buildings on the 4.6-acre site south of Horseferry Road will be demolished when the hospital moves next year to the Westminster and Chelsea Hospital being built on the site of St Stephen's Hospital in Fulham Road. The site will be put up for sale to the highest bidder once planning consent has been granted. The application, which concerns the Westminster Hospital and the adjoining Queen Mary Nurses' Home and School of Medicine, was submitted by the British Land Company, North West Thames Regional Health Authority and the Special Trustees of Westminster and Roehampton Hospitals. It follows last year's appointment by the health authority of British Land and Terry Farrell and Company, architects, as development consultants. British Land was asked to design an office building with a residential element in a style that reflected the site's prominent location. The proposals include 395,000 sq ft of offices, 232,000 sq ft of homes, and 12,000 sq ft of mixed-use space.</p>

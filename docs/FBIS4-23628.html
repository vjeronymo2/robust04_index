			<p>BFN     [Text] The Nigeria Police Force has declared Chief Moshood  Abiola wanted, and has asked anyone who knows his whereabouts to  volunteer such information to the police or any security agency  nearest to him as a matter of urgency.    In a statement signed in Lagos this evening by the force  public relations officer, Superintendent (Sebanas Yo), the  police said it was established that the activities of Chief  Abiola and his supporters transcend the political quest for the  actualization of the June 12 mandate. The police said it  believed the activities of Chief Abiola stem from well laid down  plans to cause public disorder and forceful overthrow of the  Federal Military Government.    The police also said it has established that the activities  enjoy the tacit support of and have linkages to some foreign  missions in Lagos. The police statement said certain press  premises which are suspected to be storing some arms as part of  a grand design to force a change of government are now being  investigated. The police said efforts made invite Chief Abiola  to clarify issues on current investigations have failed as he  has refused to give himself up for interrogation.</p>

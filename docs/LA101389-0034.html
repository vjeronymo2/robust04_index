			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Nikolaus Lehnhoff, who created and produced the San Francisco Opera's "Ring of  the Nibelung" four years ago, has pulled out of the company's planned 1990  revival of the Wagner cycle because of what he termed an unworkable rehearsal  schedule. Lehnhoff, in a letter to company general director Lofti Mansouri,  said the schedule made it impossible to achieve "even a blueprint" of the 1985  original production. The San Francisco Opera has booked four presentations of  the four operas that make up the "Ring" next June and July. Mansouri said he  would personally supervise the production team to mount the revival. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

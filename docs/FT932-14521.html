			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Sink or swim as currency storm abates NOW that the storms afflicting the European exchange rate mechanism have quietened, the survivors appear to be pulling up the gang planks on the unfortunates swept overboard. Meanwhile, the hunt started by Britain for 'fault lines' in the ERM seems to have reached a dead end. This is likely to place a possibly permanent barrier to the UK goal of re-entering the system some time after the end of this year. These conclusions follow from the spate of mostly-secret government inquests into the currency crises which reach a new stage today and tomorrow. In discussions in Basle, Switzerland, governors from the 12 European Community central banks plan to finish a report to be handed to EC finance ministers next month on what caused the turmoil and lessons from it. The talks will centre on the outlook for Britain and Italy, whose currencies were forced to leave the ERM last autumn. There seems little chance that either sterling or the lira will re-enter in the near future, given that other countries led by Germany appear disinclined to bend the rules to allow weaker currencies greater support. Also worried about the future are Ireland, Spain and Portugal, all of which kept their positions in the ERM only through devaluation. They would probably be in the firing line if new ERM selling pressures were to emerge. Denmark, France and Belgium saw their currencies emerge bloodied but essentially unbowed by the turmoil, leaving Germany and the Netherlands the only countries in the system to emerge with their currencies unscathed. Even so, now that all currencies still in the ERM are trading comfortably above their lower limits against the D-Mark, the EC govenors' inquiry has lost some of its initial impetus. The consensus from this study - and from a parallel inquiry by the EC monetary committee of officials from finance ministries as well as central banks  - appears to be that big reforms of the system are neither desirable nor likely. Mr Lamberto Dini, deputy governor of the Bank of Italy, says: 'A number of views have been expressed (about ERM strengthing) but there is no intention of changing the existing system.' Mr Dini is the chairman of yet another working party - from the Group of 10 industrial nations, which includes Japan and the US as well as European representatives - which is also examining fallout from the ERM storm. The group is doing this in the context of a wider look at world currency fluctuations and will present its report to ministers in Washington on April 30. Much of the discussion in all three committees has been about how to ensure all the countries in the mechanism help out currencies under threat. Current ERM rules put the obligation on the strongest and weakest countries to take action, either by currency intervention or changes in interest rates. An innovative UK proposal - under which all countries would share the profits and losses of buying weak currencies in the effort to prop them up - has found little favour. This has been on the grounds it would reduce pressures on weak countries to take avoiding action by a devaluation. The disapproval has been led by the Bundesbank, which in recent months has taken an increasingly hard line on making sure countries stick to existing ERM rules based around D-Mark supremacy. This is the case even though a 'burden sharing' arrangement might help the Bundesbank avoid a repeat of its heavy losses last autumn, arising from its spending of an unprecedented DM90bn on buying weak currencies such as lira and sterling.</p>

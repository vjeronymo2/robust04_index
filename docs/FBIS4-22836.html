Kapitsa. Three lectures on the topic of  femtosecond pulses and their usefulness in physics were given:    1. ``Current Trends in Research on Femtosecond Pulses and  Possibilities of Their Use in Experimental Studies Pertaining to  Nonlinear Quantum Electrodynamics'' by P.G. Kryukov;    2. ``Nonlinear Propagation of Femtosecond Pulses Through  Fiber-Optic Waveguides'' by Ye.M. Dianov, A.M. Prokhorov, and  V.N. Serkin;    3. ``Generation of Ultrahigh-Intensity Optical Fields by  Powerful Femtosecond Laser Systems Including Excimer-Laser  Amplifiers and Experiments Relating to Emission of Ultrashort  X-Ray Pulses'' by V.M. Gordiyenko, N.I. Koroteyev, and V.T.  Platonenko.    In this report is summarized the content of the third  lecture, which relates to development of ``desktop'' terawatt  lasers emitting femtosecond radiation pulses of only 0.01-1 J  energy. The mechanism of the process includes ``inertial  conservation'' of the laser-induced plasma during its expansion,  heat transfer deeper into the target mainly by diffusion being  the main factor which limits the plasma temperature. When the  radiation intensity exceeds the  10[.sup]18-[/]-10[.sup]19[/] W/cm[.sup]2[/], then light  pressure exceeds thermodynamic pressure while the plasma  temperature climbs to thousands of electron-volts and the  electron concentration reaches 10[.sup]23[/]-10[.sup]24[/]  cm[.sup]-3[/] under pressures of 10-100 Mbar. Under these  conditions the motion of free electrons shifts into the  relativistic mode, which imparts unique properties to a  femtosecond surface plasma so that it becomes a new object of  basic research. This applies particularly to the electrodynamics  of interaction of high-intensity radiation and a rapidly  expanding steep high-temperature plasma front, also to the  emission of x-rays by such a plasma. The laser facility built at  the Moscow State University under the late S.A. Akhmanov  includes solid-state visible lasers with a 1-10 GW power rating  and an molecular XeCl excimer laser with a 10-100 GW power  rating which emit 570-630 nm radiation and 308 nm radiation  respectively, in pulses of about 40 fs duration. Proper focusing  makes attainable a radiation intensity even higher than  10[.sup]16[/] W/cm[.sup]2[/] at the target surface. Owing  to the low optical density of a surface plasma, most of its  x-ray emission energy lines within the resonance lines of its  ions. With the aid of multilayer resonance mirrors it therefore  becomes possible to extract strong narrow-band x-ray pulses and  especially so from plasmas with hydrogen-like or helium-like  ions. Theoretical analysis of the x-ray emission mechanism  indicates that thin-film targets of about 100 nm thickness form  laser-induced plasmas which make effective sources of hard  x-rays. In this the heat is retained at the target, because the  dissipation mechanism is inactive here, so that a less than  usual intensity of the ``heating'' laser beam will be adequate.

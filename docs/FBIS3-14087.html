Three of them claimed that they had  heard shots fired from more than one direction, and suggested  that Barukh Goldstein did not carry out the killings by himself.  One of them said he heard the sound of hand grenades, as well  as automatic gunfire. A fourth witness said soldiers prevented  people from leaving the cave after the massacre and even raised  their weapons, but the worshipers ignored them and went on their  way.</p>

The difficulty of U.S. and European access to Japanese  markets does not reflect the "peculiarity" of the Japanese  market as widely argued, said Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice  international trade and industry minister for international  affairs. The trade imbalance between Japan and the United  States, for example, is more the result of differences in supply  and demand structures in each country than of the allegedly  closed nature of the Japanese market, Okamatsu said in a speech  at the Japan National Press Club.    He also said that trade among European Union (EU) nations  should be classified as domestic rather than international trade  in view of the integrated nature of their economic relations.  The ratio of imported products consumed in the EU, currently at  18.1 percent, would be only 4.9 percent if intrabloc trade was  treated as domestic based on this concept, Okamatsu said, noting  the figure is close to the 3.4 percent import ratio for Japan.    Okamatsu also dismissed U.S. claims that Japan's auto market  is closed to U.S.-made automobiles by pointing out that until  recently U.S. automakers did not sell a single right-hand drive  car in the Japanese market where such cars command a 98 percent  share.    A lower import share for a particular product does not mean  that the country's market for the product is closed, he said,  noting the U.S. aircraft industry, with almost no import record,  is not branded as exclusive.    Any country with product competitiveness in a certain area  tends to score a trade surplus in that area, he said, adding  that the U.S. has much black ink with Japan in globally  competitive service sectors.    Okamatsu, the chief negotiator in the recently collapsed  Japan-U.S. trade framework talks, said the U.S. demand for Tokyo  to set numerical trade targets is based on an erroneous  evaluation of Japan's trade situation.    Japan adamantly rejects such targets in order to prevent the  idea of managed trade from "spilling over into the global trade  arena" in defiance of free trade rules under the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), he said.    Okamatsu said Japan will not repeat "the painful experience"  it had following its semiconductor accord with Washington, which  he claimed developed into a political issue after Tokyo failed  to achieve "nonbinding expectations" of a 20 percent foreign  market share in the Japanese chip market.    Tokyo will never sign an accord that "has a possibility of  leaving trouble in the future," he said. But he added it might  be better to map out an import plan on an individual and  voluntary basis.    Okamatsu said it is "impossible" for the Japanese auto  industry to extend its plan to expand purchases of U.S.  components in 1995 and beyond, in view of the severity of the  industry's slump.    The plan worked out by Japanese carmakers during then U.S.  President George Bush's visit to Japan in 1993 called for an  average annual growth of a sharp 20 percent in parts purchases  from 1990 to 1994, Okamatsu said.</p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: BATMANIA  </P> <P> Here's a new bit of trivia for Batfans. In Dallas, a securities dealer named  Stephen Batman has an assistant named Robin, and his life has become so crazed  with crank calls since a certain new film came out that he may have to get his  batphone unlisted. Although he may change his phone number, he says he  definitely will not change his name. Originally from Dodge City, Kan., not  Gotham City, Batman's grandfather did a study of the unusual family name, which  originated in England, and found about 300 Batmans in the United States.  Batman, 33, was a grade-schooler when the television series came out and his  own popularity rocketed as a result. Now, he says, "I take a lot of kidding. I  have a 3-year-old batson, my newborn baby is a batbaby, I have a batdog, and  everybody at work says I drive a batmobile." As for the new "Batman" movie,  Batman thinks it's "very good . . . And I think it will do wonders for my own  career." He's also a baseball fan and was off to see a Texas Rangers game,  because, well . . . it was bat night. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Favored Aliysa broke away from the field in the final two furlongs to win the  English Oaks turf race for fillies in near-record time at Epsom, England.  </P> <P> Aliysa, the 11-10 choice ridden by Walter Swinburn, stumbled coming out of the  gate and was boxed in along the rail for much of the race. But she sped past  front-running Mamaluna in the final straight and won by three lengths over Snow  Bride.  </P> <P> Aliysa's time of 2:34.22 was only one-hundredth of a second off the Oaks record  set by Time Charter in 1982.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA MERCHANTS CASHING IN ON LOCAL STUDENTS' SPRING FLING  </P> <P> Unfazed at the prospect of scholar-sunbathers out on a spree, seaside merchants  in Ventura County Monday bid welcome to spring break.  </P> <P> The reason:  </P> <P> Vacationing college students double and triple the merchants' income and signal  the beginning of their busy season.  </P> <P> "We look forward to spring break," said Dorothy Miller, who owns the Bikini  Shack, a shop two blocks from the beach in the Pierpont area of Ventura.  </P> <P> Her business has doubled since the spring intermission began on Friday, Miller  said. Fringed bikini bottoms are popular with girls this year, she said.  </P> <P> Boys too, presumably.  </P> <P> By 2 p.m. about 300 people had wandered through the Village Kite and Toy store  in Ventura Harbor, employee Ed Back said. On most weekdays it gets three or  four at a time.  </P> <P> "It's an incredible difference," Back said. "It's like I can't get my work  done."  </P> <P> At Charlie's Seaside Cafe and Restaurant, which sits near the San Buenaventura  State Beach, about 25% more customers are expected to order breakfast, lunch  and dinner this week, Assistant Manager Traci Hook said.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of activity out on the beach, a lot more movement and  sunbathers," Hook said.  </P> <P> The county's miles of beaches have not yet joined Palm Springs and Fort  Lauderdale, Fla., as meccas for collegians. Most of the beach-goers are from  Ventura County.  </P> <P> There were some exceptions, including Scott Harris, 20, and Anthony Silva, 20,  who were motoring to Palm Springs when their car broke down.  </P> <P> The adaptable Cal Poly San Luis Obispo sophomores peeled off their shirts,  grabbed two drinks from their seven cases of beer and settled onto the beach.  </P> <P> "This week is for girls, beer and fun," Silva said.  </P> <P> Eight freshmen from Cal State Northridge continued a three-year tradition by  camping at McGrath State Beach in Oxnard.  </P> <P> "You don't have to fight with smog," said Anthony Granato, 18, of Westlake  Village. "It's quiet and peaceful, unlike Palm Springs."  </P> <P> That is not to say that Ventura's spring break is without problems.  </P> <P> In the three days since schools let out for vacation, rangers at state  campgrounds between Oxnard and Carpinteria have received complaints that youths  are disturbing the peace, said Andy Zilke, a supervising ranger. Six groups of  about eight people each had been evicted from campsites by Monday morning.  </P> <P> "They just got a little carried away," Zilke said of one group of roisterers  that critics said were swearing, throwing beer cans and relieving themselves  publicly.  </P> <P> Campgrounds throughout the county, which can hold about 4,000 people, are  almost all full.  </P> <P> Zilke said about 20% of the campers are unsupervised students between 18 and 25  years who are searching for the typical spring break.  </P> <P> "We're full to the brim," Zilke said. "The weather seems to be very conducive  to a pre-summer fling."  </P> <P> Authorities added eight lifeguards to the area's beaches, bringing the total to  10, in anticipation of big crowds and out-of-shape students mixing suds and  surf.  </P> <P> So far, the ocean has been calm. Lifeguards have rescued one person caught in a  riptide and treated three minor injuries.  </P> <P> "There are hardly any waves, and the rip currents are really small," said  lifeguard Jon Silver, 29, glancing at the bodies baking around him. "It's a  real good day to break them in for spring vacation."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, deputy foreign minister and </F> the Russian president's special envoy to former Yugoslavia, by  Mayak observer Vladimir Pasko on 24 February in Moscow --  recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] The situation in Bosnia is attracting  attention even after the elimination of the Sarajevo crisis.  Will it prove possible to extend the cease-fire around the  Bosnian capital to other flashpoints in the country? This  question formed the subject matter of a conversation between our  observer Vladimir Pasko and Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy  Ivanovich Churkin, the Russian president's special envoy, who  was in Sarajevo at the height of the crisis and subsequently  held consultations with representatives of the United States,  the European Union, and United Nations Organizations in Bonn.    So last Thursday he returned to Moscow and, immediately  after  reporting to the Russian leadership on the work he had  accomplished, he received a Mayak representative.    [Pasko] Vitaliy Ivanovich, it was not the first time that  you  had been to Yugoslavia, Belgrade, and Sarajevo. What is going  on there? How do you see things, not as a man burdened by tasks  of some kind, but as a simple observer?    [Churkin] If one is to talk about change, then, visually,  the  most noticeable changes have probably occurred in Sarajevo. My  last two visits to the city over the past seven days contrasted  sharply, of course, in atmosphere with what things were like  earlier. I was first in Sarajevo in May 1993, later I was there  on two other occasions, and now the fourth and fifth trips have  taken place during the last seven days.    Well, the city is calmer now. Snipers are still firing, but,  even so, in the streets, in the main street, children were  running around, since it was covered with snow. They tried to  slide about on something remotely like skis, clung on to a car  and slid over the snow. There were more people in the streets.  In other words, the situation is moving away from being a war  one.    During the last trip, I had to spend a night in Sarajevo for  the first time -- that famous night of the 20-21 . Although we  slept in quite a comfortable flat that night, there was no  electricity -- electricity is a rarity. The water comes on for  an hour or two during the day, and one can fill up in the  bathroom. Needless to say, there is no...    [Pasko, interrupting] And the water is ice cold?    [Churkin] Needless to say, there is no hot water. It is more  than cool in the apartment.    [Pasko] What about food?    [Churkin] Well you see, the city's population is supplied  through the United Nations, the Red Cross, and other  humanitarian organizations. The rations are extremely meager.    During one of my trips, I was taken to a bakery. It is the  only bakery in Sarajevo. Incidentally, it is of interest, and  it is important, that the bakery operates on Russian gas. When  people throughout the world talk about humanitarian aid to  Bosnia-Herzegovina and to Sarajevo, it is somehow not mentioned  that, throughout these months, albeit with interruptions,  Russian gas has been getting through to Sarajevo, and, if it had  not been for Russian gas, the city might simply have perished,  since that is the only source of any kind of heating. It is the  only source of power for the only bakery in the city.    But, in general, one can see that people do not have enough  to eat, and that life is very hard. It is easier for the UN  people. There are special food supplies for the United Nations.  Meals at UN headquarters are pretty good -- you get a first,  second, and third course. UN back-up is quite good. It is  simply impossible to feed the city on the same level, of course,  since airborne supply is the only source of provisions, and  disruptions are not uncommon.    So, the fact that it has proved possible, nevertheless, to  carry out the operation to place heavy weapons -- both Serbian  and Moslem -- under control or to withdraw them is not just a  qualitative military-political turnabout; it is also an  extremely important humanitarian action. We now hope that it  will be possible to advance further toward normalizing the  situation in the city. At the moment, in many districts there,  one can only drive along in an armored personnel carrier or in  an armored jeep. It is still dangerous. There are checkpoints  everywhere between the Croatian and Moslem districts of the  city. In other words, there is still a very long way to go to  normality. We will have to do some special work on that now.    [Pasko] Vitaliy Ivanovich, as far as I recall, Sarajevo is  mainly a Muslim city. Of the 360,000 population only 40,000 are  Serbs.    [Churkin] Yes. The Serbs that there are rather more. If I  am not mistaken they say 60,000. There are also Croats there,  10-20,000 of them, but indeed, there are mainly Muslims and  Serbs. The problem is that in some places in the city - although  they all lived together just as they did throughout the country  -- there are quite clearly defined Serbian areas of the city.  Grbavica area, for example, where our battalion is now  stationed along with the French, is a Serb area of the city.  And the demarcation line passes between Muslim and Serb areas.  And the reason why this cross-fire and the exchange of  artillery strikes took place recently is that as soon one of the  sides made an attempt to change the front line in the city --  quite often this was the Muslims who have a superiority in  infantry -- then the Serbs responded with powerful fire from all  of their weapons against the city. The result is that the city  has been destroyed to a very large extent.    The Serbs have now withdrawn their weapons or put them under  UN control. The Muslims have also handed over about 50 heavy  weapons. They simply had less of these in the city, but they  have also put them under UN control. Now neither of the sides  has the capability of firing.    [Pasko] What surprises me here is the statements made by  some of the Bosnian leaders who represent the Muslim community  and, in particular, the Bosnian representative in the United  Nations, attacking our initiatives and the fact that our Russian  battalion has appeared there. That is, clear dissatisfaction is  being expressed when it would seem that the reaction should be  quite different.    [Churkin] As for the specific person that you have referred  to, I can say that he is a totally irresponsible man who is  distinguished by the fact that throughout the crisis he has made  the most disgraceful statements, taking advantage of the fact  that he speaks English well. There are also people who are not  so keen on naked propaganda but who have also recently made  similar statements. I have had contacts with the people who make  these statements. I know them quite well. There are  considerable differences between their positions and ours. We  are aiming toward peace while they are aiming toward war. It is  as simple as that.    I do not consider that this is the position of the whole  Muslim leadership or -- as it is now usually referred to in  international contacts -- the Bosnian Government. For example,  Izetbegovic, the number one and Silajdzic, the number two, in  the Muslim leadership, occupy a more pragmatic position and I  still proceed on the basis that they understand that it is  necessary to reach a political accord.    You only have to talk to those other people and it becomes  totally clear -- and they do not even conceal this -- that they  want to fight the whole war over again.    [Pasko] If there are disagreements among the Bosnian  leaders,  how can it be hoped that they will agree to a peaceful  settlement and how can it be hoped that an external diplomatic  interference being discussed at the moment will be successful?    [Churkin] Well, you have touched upon a most painful issue.  This is one of our biggest difficulties. Admittedly, there is  no unity among their leaders and this is clear to everybody.  Therefore, conditions should be created whereby the people  supporting extremist approaches would be isolated, so that they  should understand that nobody is going to add fuel to the war  and that the time has come to conclude a peace agreement. I  think that such moment is likely to come. The settlement  documents themselves need some further improvement, but on the  whole, the time will come when the positions of people with more  pragmatic views in the Muslim government will become stronger,  but this is one of the most difficult tasks -- how to isolate  extremists among the Muslims.    [Pasko] To what extent can we count on U.S. assistance in  this matter? After all, a strange statement was issued after  the recent talks in Washington between U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher with Haris Silajdzic.    [Churkin] Well, these statements seem clear enough to me.  You know, I think that statements should be taken at their face  value. On the whole, Americans tend to say reasonable and  correct things. There is nothing wrong if the Americans have  decided to work in closer contact with the Muslims and, to some  extent, with Croatians, and to come up with some new sensible  proposals regarding the settlement. The stress should be laid  on the word sensible -- I said this to the Americans and then  repeated it at the multilateral meeting in Bonn, and everyone  seemed to agree. The important point is that the Americans are  now saying that, like the Europeans and like us, they proceed  from the assumption that borders should be drawn on the basis of  a key criterion -- that a republic with the Muslim majority is  to get 33.3 percent of the territory. Now this criterion has  been consolidated in the U.S. approach. If the Americans, as  they help the Muslims with this business -- this is a very  complicated job, you have to read the map and calculate on the  computer all the time the percentage [of parts of territory due  to each side], and to take into account a number of various  parameters -- if they really arrive at some sensible proposals  that can be accepted by the other sides, then I can see  absolutely no harm in this. After all, we can help the Serbs to  take a realistic stance -- why cannot the Americans help the  Muslims do the same? If they succeed, they will deserve fame  and glory. All the more so that we have an understanding, the  Americans have assured us that they intend to work in the  closest possible contact with us, and I am in fact quite pleased  with the personal and professional relations I have developed  with U.S. Special Envoy Charles Redman. So, my attitude to all  this is calm. But it is important that all these agreements and  intentions expressed both publicly and privately should be  implemented in the same form in which they were declared.    [Pasko] Vitaliy Ivanovich, now the last question. We -- I  mean President Yeltsin -- have suggested holding a summit on the  Bosnian settlement. Knowing all that you know, how did your  partners in the former Yugoslavia settlement talks react to this  proposal, in your opinion?    [Churkin] Well, for instance, I have just seen the British  statement that welcomes this proposal. When I say partners, I  mean a broader circle of partners involved in the settlement of  this conflict. So here is the first unequivocally positive  response, but there is something I would like to add. Of  course, as far as I know, the proposal does not imply that the  meeting could take place tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, or  next Sunday. It is desirable to have it within some deadline,  so that we do not lose the impetus gained through resolving the  political crisis around Sarajevo, but intensive work will of  course be necessary to achieve this. I must say that right now  we are involved in extremely intensive work on political  settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Second, we do not think that this is the only possible  format  of such meeting. There can be some other forms of a summit. So,  although this was stated formally and authoritatively by the  president, we are open to suggestions. I would like to finish  this with a little joke: We are against any kinds of ultimatums.</p>

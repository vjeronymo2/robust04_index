			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is reasonable to anticipate that persons living near  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major thoroughfares and in inner cities, often among the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economically disadvantaged Americans, will be disproportionately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represented among persons with higher manganese exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, there is reason to believe certain subpopulations such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the young, the elderly, and persons with certain preexisting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, might be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> susceptible to any adverse effects of manganese exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain occupational groups who work in proximity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicular emissions such as toll takers, parking garage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attendants, traffic policemen, taxi dispatchers, and service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> station attendants, are represented in the Agency's exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates only to the extent of their prevalence in the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population. These occupational groups would likely experience  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manganese exposures attributable to MMT use near or even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeding the highest predicted exposures <FOOTCITE>84</FOOTCITE> . I realize that if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl is granted the requested waiver, MMT would not be utilized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately in all congested urban areas. Some of the urban  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas with higher vehicular usage are areas which will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to begin using a cleaner gasoline referred to as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``reformulated gasoline'' beginning in 1995. If Ethyl were to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain the waiver under section 211(f)(4) which is the subject of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this decision, MMT could not be used in reformulated gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless and until Ethyl obtained an additional waiver under Clean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air Act section 211(k)(2)(D). However, I am nevertheless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned about the effects of potential MMT use in areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to utilize reformulated gasoline, both because a waiver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 211(f)(4) of the Act is a necessary prerequisite to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of MMT in either conventional or reformulated gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and because Ethyl has made it clear that it does not seek the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present waiver solely to permit use in conventional gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 84 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency realizes that exposures to manganese deemed acceptable in particular industrial or occupational contexts will often significantly exceed the levels considered by EPA to pose acceptable risks for the general population. The establishment of appropriate limits for occupational exposures to manganese is an entirely separate process from the establishment of an RfC for the general population. Nevertheless, I do not believe it would be appropriate to completely disregard the likelihood of substantial incremental additions to manganese exposure for certain categories of working Americans where such increased exposure would be attributable solely to approval of MMT use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I have concluded based on the assessments prepared by EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientists that, if I were to approve use of MMT in unleaded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline at the specified concentration, a significant number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons could thereby be exposed to manganese concentrations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ambient air which approach or exceed the current RfC or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> candidate RfCs described in the risk assessment. Although all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk assessments have some degree of uncertainty, in some cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is reasonable to conclude that the risk of adverse health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects is either very great or very small because estimated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure levels are either far above or far below a potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health effect level. However, this is not the case with MMT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although it is not possible based on the present information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to conclude whether specific adverse health effects will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with manganese exposures in the vicinity of or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeding the RfC, neither is it possible to conclude that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse health effects will not be associated with such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposures. Moreover, it is likely that, if adverse effects do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur as a result of MMT usage, such effects will be subtle and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to detect. In these circumstances, I am very reluctant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to conduct a massive experiment in which the citizens of numerous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American cities are subjected to the additional exposures to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particulate manganese associated with MMT use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I am aware of the proposal by Ethyl that EPA conditionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant its waiver application for HiTEC 3000, with conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which would require Ethyl to develop in a specified period the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional health effects and exposure data necessary to address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present uncertainties in the risk assessment, require Ethyl to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct ambient monitoring of particulate manganese levels in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain cities where unleaded gasoline containing MMT would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sold, and provide for prompt withdrawal of HiTEC 3000 from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market in the event that ambient monitoring were to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airborne manganese levels exceeding a specified level of concern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g. 0.1 &mu;g/m3). However, I believe that the additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on health effects and exposure necessary to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater assurance that manganese emissions from MMT use will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardize public health should be provided before I decide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether to expose Americans to such emissions on even a temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis. Moreover, Ethyl's proposal to monitor ambient exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels would not assure that personal exposures exceeding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified threshold do not occur. The EPA risk assessment makes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it clear that a substantial portion of the population exposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airborne manganese as a result of MMT use would be expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience personal exposures exceeding measured ambient exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

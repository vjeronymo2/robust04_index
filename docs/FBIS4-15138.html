			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 06, BNS -- The men who shot a Russian  border guard and wounded two on the Estonian-Russian border on  Apr. 1 supposedly fled to Russia, said the head of the Estonian  Border Guard Department, Tarmo Kouts.    But he added that this was only what the investigators say  most likely happened, and that there were several other versions.    Kouts said the suspects had not been caught yet. Russian  border guards say the shooters were two men who spoke Russian  without foreign accent.    The incident happened when a Russian patrol unit of three  about 3.50 stopped two men some 300 meters from the border with  Estonia. The men opened fire from their TT pistols and fled  when a patrol car called from the Russian cordon approached the  site. One member of the Russian patrol was killed and two were  taken to a hospital with serious bullet wounds.    Estonian Ambassador Juri Kahn was called in by the Foreign  Ministry in Moscow the same day, where he received an appeal  addressed to the Estonian law enforcement bodies to help find  the criminals. Kahn said the Russian side had no doubts that  the incident was of a criminal character.    Kahn said he had been made clear that the Russian Foreign  Ministry leadership did not regard the incident as a provocation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 5 (CTK) -- Czech Prime Minister  Vaclav Klaus and his Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin  signed a Czech-Russian agreement on the support and protection  of investments in Moscow today.    At the same time, they agreed that by the end of May their  finance ministries would prepare the final agreement on the  timetable for the liquidation of Russian debts to the Czech  Republic and the methods to be used.    Representatives of the Czech Ministry of Trade and Industry  and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Trade signed an  inter-government protocol on mutual supplies of goods this year,  in the premiers' presence.    Chernomyrdin, who earlier spent three and a half hours with  Klaus at their unofficial "introductory meeting," said after  today's talks that Russia was "very interested" in Czech  economic reform. He said the Czech Republic had proceeded in  its reform "further than all other East European countries."  "This is not just our opinion but a general one. Russia has  much to learn from the Czech experience," Chernomyrdin said.    He described today's talks as "good and positive." Relations  between Russia and the Czech Republic would now be formed on a  new basis," he added.    "I believe that we have essentially managed to define the  main feature of the process regarding the Russian debt. The two  countries' finance ministries have to prepare a definitive  document by the end of May in which the dates and the methods of  its solution will be defined," Klaus said.    Russia who has assumed responsibility for the former Soviet  Union's debts, owes the Czech Republic a total of three billion  U.S. dollars, to which may be added claims worth almost $400  million which Czech partners have towards Russian firms.    According to a high-ranking Czech diplomat, Moscow, unlike  in  the past, today accepted all Russian debts towards the Czech  Republic. Part of them will apparently be repaid on the  principles of the Paris Club, the rest by deliveries of goods  and through Czech participation in Russian privatization.    For the first time talks on debts have got moving and have  proceeded from the level of general talks to the level of  solving specific problems, the diplomat said. He said the fact  that Russia has recently come to an approximately similar  agreement with Hungary was encouraging.    Russian supplies of raw energy materials were also the  subject of discussion, the diplomat said. The Russians  expressed the desire to conclude a long-term agreement on oil  supply with the Czech Republic. Klaus accepted the offer,  adding that the question will for the time being be dealt with  by experts from the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade and the  Russian Ministry of Fuels and Energy.    According to a protocol on trade exchange signed today, this  year Russia will deliver to the Czech Republic seven million  tonnes of oil and 6.9 billion square meters of natural gas at  world prices.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Kohl hits at SPD 'secret promises' Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, and his Christian Democratic Union yesterday stepped up accusations against the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), suggesting they had undermined the process of German unification with secret promises to the former East German government. The latest SPD leader to be accused is Mr Rudolf Scharping, the party's challenger for the chancellor's post and current state premier in the Rhineland-Palatinate, Mr Kohl's home state. The Welt am Sonntag newspaper yesterday published documents from the former East German Communist party, claiming that Mr Scharping had agreed to recognise East German citizenship on a trip to the country in 1987. West Germany always insisted that East Germans enjoyed automatic West German citizenship, a key factor in allowing Hungary to open its borders in 1989, and precipitate the exodus which ultimately destroyed the East German regime.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, June 18 (TURAN)--A letter of U.S. State  Secretary Warren Christopher sent to Gasan Gasanov, Azerbaijan  Foreign Minister reads that Christopher appreciates adoption by  Azeri Government the last proposal of CSCE Minsk group, which  provides ceasefire and location of observers in the region.  Christopher notes in the letter that the Azerbaijan agreement  with CSCE proposal witnesses Azerbaijan's intention to peaceful  settlement of Karabakh conflict. "We demanded from Armenia and  Karabakh Armenians to accept this proposal as well", notes  Christopher.    The letter reads that representatives of U.S. Government,  addressing at the Congress expressed their unsatisfaction by  Article 907 of the Act support of freedom. According to  Christopher "despite that, it would be very difficult to take  away limitations imposed by Congress on the providing assistance  to Azerbaijan". Christopher also supported U.S. readiness to  help the CSCE Minsk group.</p>

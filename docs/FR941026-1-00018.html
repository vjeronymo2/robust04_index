This  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, and a concurrent notice in the local newspaper in the vicinity of the site, announces, the initiation of a thirty day comment period. The public is asked to comment on USEPA's intention to delete the site from the NPL. All critical documents needed to evaluate EPA's decision are generally included in the information repository and the deletion docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon completion of the public comment period, if necessary, the EPA Regional Office will prepare a Responsiveness Summary to evaluate and address comments that were received. The public is welcome to contact the EPA Region V Office to obtain a copy of this responsiveness summary, if one is prepared. If USEPA then determines that deletion from the NPL is appropriate, a final notice of deletion will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Boise Cascade/Onan/Medtronics Superfund Site covers 183 acres and is located in the City of Fridley in Anoka County in the state of Minnesota. From approximately 1921 through 1961, National Pole and Treating Company and its affiliate, Minnesota and Ontario Paper Company (M&amp;O) operated a wood treating facility at the site. Initial operations included the use of creosote treatment of wood for the manufacture of railroad ties and utility poles. In approximately 1958, pentachlorophenol (PCP), another wood preservative, was also used for treating lumber. Wood-treating operations ceased in early 1961. In 1964, M&amp;O merged with the Boise Cascade Corporation (Boise). Boise sold the site in 1967. Subsequently, Medtronics, Inc. acquired 50 acres of the Boise Cascade property located to the west and south, and Onan, Inc. acquired 133 acres of the site to the north and east.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1979, Onan began excavation for construction purposes and encountered large quantities of creosote and PCP saturated soil. Similar deposits were subsequently discovered on the Medtronics portion of the Site. Wood-treating operations had contaminated soils and groundwater with creosote and PCP by spillage, dripping, and wastewater disposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Boise Cascade site was placed on the National Priorities List on September 21, 1984, at 49 FR 37066&hyph;37090. In conjunction with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), Boise conducted extensive soil and groundwater investigations from 1979 through 1982. Because the Site's ownership is divided between two different companies, Site investigations at the Boise Cascade Site were conducted separately within the individual property boundaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the Onan property the analyses verified that the major contaminants of concern were creosote derived polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS) and phenolic compounds (phenolics are also derived from PCP). The heaviest concentrations of these substances were found on two areas where significant aspects of the tie treating process had been conducted: (1) The area where the ties were pressure treated in the retorts; and (2) the area where the ties were left to cool and dry after they were removed from the retorts and before they were loaded onto railroad cars for shipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

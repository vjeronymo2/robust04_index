			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek by Edouard Van </F> Velthem in Brussels; date not given: "Slovene Rapprochement With  NATO and Europe"]    [Text] [Van Velthem] You are in Brussels to sign the NATO  offer of Partnership for Peace, yours being the first  independent republic of the former Yugoslavia to be involved in  that initiative. Do you believe that it provides sufficient  security, or do you expect more from the alliance?    [Drnovsek] We are rather satisfied...no doubt because we are  fairly realistic. We were not expecting more at this time  because we know that the alliance is a complex organization,  comprising a large number of members, and that there are  questions of coordination to be settled for the implementation  of the concept of enlargement.    However, this flexibility is an advantage for us, because it  will enable us to progressively become involved in the process  of common defense and security. We have made a firm decision to  continue in this vein, and we are sure that the final stage, in  the years to come, will be full membership of NATO for Slovenia.    [Van Velthem] At the same time, you are also asking for the  arms embargo still imposed on the whole of Yugoslavia to be  lifted...    [Drnovsek] The embargo was imposed right at the start of the  Yugoslav crisis, from which Slovenia escaped nearly three years  ago. However, it was no doubt much easier for the superpowers  and the United Nations to leave the decision in place, for any  modification in terms of moving toward lifting the embargo  threatened to snowball toward Bosnia-Herzegovina and the other  war zones.    Today, beacuse of such inertia, Slovenia remains a victim  trapped by that measure for no reason whatsoever. However, we  are pragmatic and do understand the actual state of affairs  within the region. So we are waiting, confidently...    [Van Velthem] Willy Claes and Alain Lamassoure have both  successively visited Ljubljana: Slovenia is accelerating its  rapprochement with the European Union (EU).    [Drnovsek] The EU is a natural partner for us. Sixty percent  of our trade is already conducted with the union. The  cooperation agreement in application today was signed at the  beginning of last year. It is satisfactory, but we intend to go  beyond it in the very near future, all the more so since we  believe we have already made much more progress than certain  other countries which already benefit from associate status.  The talks on this subject will start in May, and provided that  everything runs as scheduled, it should be possible to sign by  the end of the year.    [Van Velthem] How did the Slovene economy transform itself  following the dismantlement of the former Yugoslavia?    [Drnovsek] The economy is making good progress. Admittedly,  in the wake of achieving independence in 1991 we found it  difficult to adapt after losing the domestic markets and  experiencing a drop in industrial activity. However, since  1993, more rapidly than even we had predicted ourselves, we are  once again experiencing positive growth, and have brought down  inflation sharply -- indeed, it dropped from 270 percent when  our currency, the tolar, was introduced to approximately 20  percent last year.   <H5>    We Will Pay Our Debts </H5>   [Van Velthem] And tourism, formerly an appreciable source of  revenue for Slovenia?    [Drnovsek] It is starting to develop again. Above all for  people from neighboring countries, such as Italy, Austria, or  Germany, increasing numbers of whom are coming to Istria and the  Adriatic coast. On the other hand, tourists from further afield  are still more cautious, perhaps because they still picture  Slovenia as being directly involved in the Yugoslav conflicts.    [Van Velthem] Nonetheless, the republics have yet to share  out the debts and assets of the former Yugoslavia...    [Drnovsek] That is true. We are not at all satisfied with  the slowness of progress on the question of Yugoslav succession  at the Geneva conference. Admittedly, up to now most of the  other republics have been saddled with other problems. Slovenia  did not expect a definitive agreement on this question: We have  already settled our financial relations with the IMF, the World  Bank, or the Club de Paris, and we are negotiating with the  international banks the share of the commercial debt of the  former Yugoslavia that has been assigned to us. We want to  present a very clear bill of health of our financial situation.  So the only thing that will remain to discuss with our former  partners is how to share out our common heritage, especially the  embassies and other buildings that Yugoslavia had abroad.    [Van Velthem] Do the Bosnian refugees who were flowing  toward  Slovenia at the start of the war still represent a major burden,  both financially and socially?    [Drnovsek] It is not as worrying a problem for us as some  demagogues are attempting to make out. There are still  something like 30,000 refugees, and we have done everything  possible to ensure that they can lead as normal an existence as  possible in terms of housing, food aid, and psychological  support. It is our elementary duty to show such solidarity.  <H5>  Need for Domestic Stability </H5>   [Van Velthem] The night before you came to Brussels, the  Slovene Parliament dismissed Defense Minister Jansa from office.  Is the coalition government, comprising your Liberal Democratic  Party, the Christian Democrats led by Mr. Peterle, and the  Social Democrats led by Mr. Jansa now threatened?    [Drnovsek] I do not think we are heading for a domestic  crisis. The defense minister was replaced in the wake of a  specific incident, and if the Social Democrats leave the  government, then we are prepared to continue with the Christian  Democrats alone. Following this option would just enable us to  retain the majority.    [Van Velthem] So there are no plans to hold elections, which  would plunge the country into a state of uncertainty?    [Drnovsek] I do not think so. And I have good reason to  believe that: If elections were held today, then the polls show  that my own Liberal Democratic Party would emerge as the main  victors. Consequently, the other political groups are in no  hurry to return to the ballot box. Above all, the entire  country first needs continuity and stability. After all, we are  in a good position to know what a political crisis and power  vacuum can mean....</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y move to pay off overdue debt OLYMPIA &amp; York, the cash-strapped Canadian property developer, is expected to raise several hundred million dollars over the next few days to help meet overdue debt obligations. The Toronto-based company was expected to announce late yesterday or today that GW Utilities, its 89 per cent owned subsidiary, would immediately provide O&amp;Y with a short-term loan pending the receipt of CDollars 158m (USDollars 132.7m) in special dividends from GWU on April 14. The dividends are being financed from GWU's sale last month of its controlling interest in Interprovincial PipeLine, a large oil pipeline operator, for CDollars 655m. GWU is itself arranging a substantial loan secured by the second instalment from the Interprovincial sale, totalling CDollars 277m, which is only due to be paid by buyers of the shares in March 1993. This receivables financing will, in effect, give GWU immediate access to the full proceeds of the Interprovincial sale. In addition, O&amp;Y is understood to be within days of concluding the sale of Exchange Tower, a Toronto building which houses its own head office and the Toronto Stock Exchange. O&amp;Y is due to present an interim plan for the restructuring of its estimated CDollars 20bn debt to its creditors in Toronto on April 6. A report by RBC Dominion Securities, Canada's biggest securities firm, has put O&amp;Y's exposure to Canadian banks at CDollars 2.6bn, which is somewhat higher than earlier estimates. Proceeds from the Exchange Tower sale and the GWU loan will be used to retire two O&amp;Y CP programmes. Repayments under these programmes have come to a virtual halt since O&amp;Y revealed on March 22 that it was suffering a liquidity crisis. The amount of commercial paper outstanding remains at about CDollars 380m. O&amp;Y has gained further breathing space thanks to what is described as an 'informal' standstill agreement with a group of financial institutions on a CDollars 450m loan to finance construction of the 68-storey Scotia Plaza complex in downtown Toronto. O&amp;Y failed to make a principal payment on the loan due on March 31. The lenders refused O&amp;Y's request for a one-year rollover, but a source close to the company said they had agreed not to take precipitate action to enforce repayment. Mr Michael Goldberg, Dominion Securities' banking analyst, said yesterday that his figures of the banks' loans to O&amp;Y were based on 'educated estimates'. Mr Goldberg puts the exposure of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, O&amp;Y's biggest creditor, at CDollars 1.1bn, which is higher than other estimates published so far. Royal Bank of Canada's exposure is estimated at CDollars 700m, Bank of Nova Scotia at CDollars 450m, Bank of Montreal at CDollars 200m and National Bank at CDollars 150m. The sixth Canadian bank, Toronto-Dominion, last week said that it has no direct exposure to O&amp;Y.</p>

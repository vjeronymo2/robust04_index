			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VODKA AND CAVIAR GONE WITH TROOPS, BUT INFLUENCE REMAINS;  </P> <P> SOVIETS' LEGACY LINGERS FOR AFGHAN 'CHILDREN OF WAR'  </P> <P> Abdul Raouf, 14, has a pen pal in the Soviet Union. He has been there twice, he  says, on government-sponsored summer camp trips for rest and relaxation.  </P> <P> When Abdul thinks of his future -- he says he wants to be a doctor -- he thinks  of going to Moscow to study.  </P> <P> His room in a dormitory at the Orphanage of the Homeland here mirrors his  thinking. On the window ledge are a dozen pamphlets entitled "The Heart of  Moscow," which extol the virtues of the Soviet capital and its government.  </P> <P> "The Soviets are good; they are the only ones who are helping us," said Abdul,  whose father, a government doctor, was abducted by Afghan rebels six years ago  and has not been seen since. "The Americans," the boy continued, "are the  imperialists who are giving arms to the extremists."  </P> <P> In many ways, Abdul Raouf and the thousands of other Afghan children the  government has cared for in 10 years of civil war are living examples of the  Soviet legacy here, which is likely to affect the social and political scene in  Afghanistan for decades to come.  </P> <P> In Kabul, which was the Soviets' military headquarters from 1979 until they  withdrew the last of their troops from the country in February, there is little  evidence that the Soviets spent almost a decade helping the Afghan government  try to put down an insurgency by the Islamic guerrilla force known as the  moujahedeen.  </P> <P>  The Brezhnev Bazaar -- once a thriving downtown market where Soviet soldiers  sold local merchants everything from uniforms to truck parts -- is gone,  bulldozed to make way for a planned government office complex.  </P> <P> On Chicken Street, lined with shops that catered to the Soviets, the shelves  are all but empty -- no more Russian caviar, no more crab meat, pickles and  vodka.  </P> <P> Increasingly, in Kabul's markets and dwellings, the Afghans, a fiercely  independent people, can be heard complaining bitterly about the years the  Soviets spent here.  </P> <P> "We are very happy the Russians are gone," Sher Mohammed said the other day,  even though the merchant, who had a shop in the Brezhnev Bazaar, saw his  profits plummet after the Soviets left. "This is our country, and no amount of  profit is worth sacrificing our independence," he said. "Allah will provide for  us now."  </P> <P> A retired police officer, who spent years under the control of Soviet advisers  and who asked that he not be identified by name, beamed proudly as he recalled  the time he killed a Soviet soldier.  </P> <P> "The soldier was looting a shop," he said, laughing. "I shouted, 'Halt!' but he  kept running with his loot. So I emptied my machine gun at him, and he fell  dead. I felt no guilt. I felt, well, good."  </P> <P> In explaining this sort of attitude, a spokesman for the government of  President Najibullah, which continues to get enormous military and economic  support from Moscow, said the Soviet issue is the most sensitive in the country  today.  </P> <P> "We are very independent people," he said. "We see our culture and our history  dating back four or five thousand years. Soviet history began when? The 7th  Century? Of course, we must be grateful to the Soviets for all they have done  here. Since Mr. Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s, the Soviets have been helping  us develop our energy, and Afghanistan has cost them dearly in money and in  lives of their own. But the anger you hear from our people is the voice of  Afghanistan."  </P> <P> The anger is heard largely from the older generation, men and women who  remember Kabul as an open, international city before a series of coups and  countercoups in the late 1970s touched off the war and opened the door to the  Soviet military presence.  </P> <P> According to independent analysts, the Soviet influence is likely to last  longest among the children -- "our children of war," an official at the  orphanage called them.  </P> <P> Another 14-year-old, Kabir Ahmed, has been at the orphanage for two years. Like  many others at the compound on the outskirts of Kabul, he has not lost his  parents, but his mother is a peasant and his father is in the army, so the  state has been caring for him.  </P> <P> Kabir, asked if he would like to study abroad, replied, "Yes, I would like to  go to the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> Why?  </P> <P> "Because the Soviet Union is our friend," he said. "They have done good deeds  for us in Afghanistan. And the Soviet Union is a good place."  </P> <P> How do you know that?  </P> <P> "Because we have books. We read in our textbooks about the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> Do you also read about America?  </P> <P> "America? What is that?"  </P> <P> The orphanage, which is one of the cleanest and most efficiently run  institutions in this impoverished country, is only part of the story. Of the  1,500 schoolchildren sent to the Soviet Union each year, only 200 are from the  Orphanage of the Homeland. The rest are selected from Kabul's public schools.  </P> <P> Massoma Esmati, chairman of the All Afghanistan Women's Council, helps in the  selection. Her group has helped care for hundreds of thousands of widows and  children affected by the war.  </P> <P> Esmati, who has a master's degree in education from Northwestern University in  Evanston, Ill., and is one of two women in Najibullah's Cabinet, said in an  interview that the foreign study program should be regarded as a step toward  development, not political indoctrination.  </P> <P> "Of course, the Soviet military presence in Afghanistan was not something  admired by all," she said, "but this does not mean that the desire for  advancement and development has stopped. The Soviets are more advanced  technologically and educationally than we are. And we share a long border with  them. They have offered their help, and we have accepted.  </P> <P> "I myself have learned that all encounters in the world between human beings  have two sides. There are some negative consequences and some positive ones.  </P> <P> "For example," she said, "when I came from my studies in the United States, I  brought with me some concepts that were useful. I kept them with me and am  developing them still. But there were certain aspects I did not like, and those  I left behind when I came home."  </P> <P> It is not clear whether the thousands of Afghan children studying in the Soviet  Union are capable of making the same choice. When they come home, Esmati  conceded, "I am sure they will bring both the good and the bad."  </P></p>

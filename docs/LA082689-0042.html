			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WIRE: WITH 18 OPENINGS, BROADWAY PLANS FOR A BUSIER-THAN-USUAL SEASON  </P> <P> Broadway only offered 30 shows last season, a new low. The new season promises  to be busier, at least until Christmas. Eighteen productions will have opened  by then.  </P> <P> Actually, the season has already started, with "Mandy Patinkin in Concert," and  a revival of "Shenandoah." Autumn activities will start Sept. 24 with Vanessa  Redgrave in Peter Hall's revival of Tennessee Williams' "Orpheus Descending."  </P> <P> This is the first of two productions from the new, transatlantic Peter Hall  company. Hall will also restage his London version of "The Merchant of Venice"  with Dustin Hoffman and an new, all-American company. (Nov. 23)  </P> <P> Some other productions:  </P> <P> "Grand Hotel," a musical version of Vicki Baum's novel that Civic Light Opera  patrons saw in 1958 under the title of "At the Grand." The new version has been  reworked, of course. Tommy Tune directs. (Oct. 29)  </P> <P> "Threepenny Opera," retranslated by Michael Feingold, staged by John Dexter and  starring Sting. (Nov. 2)  </P> <P> "Meet Me in St. Louis," a redo of the old Judy Garland movie musical. (Nov. 2)  </P> <P> "Secret Rapture," Joseph Papp's production of David Hare's play, a hit last  season in London. (Nov. 6)  </P> <P> "The Circle," a revival of Somerset Maugham's 1921 comedy with Rex Harrison,  Glynis Johns and Stewart Granger "in his Broadway debut." (Nov. 11)  </P> <P> "Gypsy," the Tyne Daly revival seen this summer at the Music Center and the  Orange County Performing Arts Center. (Nov. 16)  </P> <P> And so on. As Variety notes, most of these are familiar titles and/or star  packages -- almost a must these days on Broadway. But at least there's  activity. Last year at this time, only six shows were set.  </P> <P> JUST WONDERING: The new paperback edition of Jean-Claude Carriere and Peter  Brook's "The Mahabharata" is emblazoned: "NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE." Has  anyone ever admitted making a minor motion picture?  </P> <P> QUOTE OF THE WEEK: Theatrical cartoonist Al Hirschfeld to Tony Vellella in  Theatre Week magazine: "A young artist doesn't need encouragement. He's going  to do it anyway."  </P></p>

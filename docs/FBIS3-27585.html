			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shanghai has unveiled an ambitious and  comprehensive plan to replace Hong Kong as the most important  financial centre in Asia over the next 15 years.    Measures include persuading all Hong Kong-based red-chip  conglomerates to relocate their headquarters to Shanghai,  opening doors to foreign brokerages and rating agencies and  setting up various specialist short-term fund markets.    Shanghai, which outshone Hong Kong in the 1940s, has long  been talking about regaining its past glory. But this is the  first time that the city has come up with concrete measures to  match its words. And it has enlisted an important ally in the  People's Bank of China.    The country's central bank had urged the government, in a  comprehensive report, to allow Shanghai to realise its dream by  the year 2010, the Beijing-backed HUANAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL  reported yesterday.    The newspaper did not say how the government had responded  to  the report.    According to the People's Bank report, Shanghai would try to  persuade the Hong Kong- and Beijing-based China Merchant Group,  China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC),  China Everbright Group, Bank of China and others to relocate to  the city.    It would also try to get all the new national financial  institutions to set up bases in the city, and the People's Bank  would like to station a deputy governor permanently in Shanghai.    In an attempt to link-up with international financial  markets, the city would allow foreign brokers or joint-venture  brokerages into the Shanghai Stock Exchange.    Two international rating agencies, possibly Moody's and  Standard &amp; Poor's, would be allowed in to assess Chinese  companies for domestic and international listings.    The city would soon abolish restrictions to allow free trade  in A and B shares. At present A shares are traded solely by  domestic shareholders while foreign investors can only trade B  shares.    Shanghai would step up efforts to attract foreign banks,  insurance companies and other financial institutions, and  broaden its business scope. Foreign banks have been lobbying  for the right to accept yuan deposits from mainlanders, whose  savings in Chinese banks total 1.4 trillion yuan (about HK$1.243  trillion).    The city plans to set up several specialist short-term fund  markets in the hope of linking with other international  financial markets.    These include markets for commercial notes, inter-bank  borrowing, short-term loans, bank discounts, one-year Chinese  state-treasury bonds, Euro money and international currencies.    The Shanghai bourse plans to expand its issues of new stocks  and bonds in a bid to increase its market turnover to 65 percent  of national volume by the end of next year. In the short term,  it plans to increase its membership to 800, with 3,000 trading  seats.    To attract foreign investors, the city would introduce more  financial instruments such as foreign-currency and interest-rate  options, share buy-back arrangements, convertible bonds, mutual  funds and loan securitisation.    A report in the Beijing-controlled Hong Kong newspaper, TA  KUNG PAO, said yesterday that about six international companies,  including Mercedes-Benz, were still negotiating for secondary  listings in Shanghai, and a breakthrough was expected this year.    The report said the Shanghai exchange was negotiating to buy  a telecommunications satellite.</p>

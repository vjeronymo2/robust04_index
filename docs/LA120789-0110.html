			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN FINDS SON AND LOST LOVE AFTER 27 YEARS  </P> <P> A Federal Express letter from Temple City last month changed Adolph A.  Szameit's life.  </P> <P> Szameit, 59, a retiree living alone in Pensacola, Fla., had long ago given up  hope of finding his lost love, Betty Benson Szameit, and their son, Randy. He  last saw them in Seattle 27 years ago, when Randy was 2.  </P> <P> But the letter, from Randy Szameit's wife, Alison, changed all that. In less  than a week, Adolph Szameit has been transformed from a bachelor to a father  and grandfather.  </P> <P> Szameit was planning to marry Randy's mother before going back to Florida,  packing his belongings and returning to join her in Pasadena.  </P> <P> "I didn't want to leave without us being a family again, even a short time," he  said.  </P> <P> The family members separated years ago because of circumstances beyond their  control, Adolph Szameit said, adding that to say more might hurt other people  involved.  </P> <P> Through the years, Szameit, a manager for a high-technology firm with worldwide  offices, searched in vain for his son, even asking the company's branches to  help.  </P> <P> But he ran into dead end after dead end.  </P> <P> "My big worry was that he may have been hurting and needed me," Adolph Szameit  said, his voice breaking. "You never stop wondering."  </P> <P> Through the years, Randy Szameit said, he also wondered about his father, who  he thought had abandoned the family. But he didn't ask his mother for fear of  upsetting her.  </P> <P> It wasn't until Randy's son, Shaun, was born four years ago that he and his  wife began thinking more about finding the senior Szameit.  </P> <P> "We were wondering what Shaun's background is," Alison Szameit said.  </P> <P> At that point, her mother, Norma Gutierrez -- a genealogy buff looking for her  own brother, who had been adopted by another family -- joined the search.  </P> <P> Every time they were at the library, Alison Szameit said, she and her mother  would peruse the out-of-town telephone books. "We'd look to see if there's  another Szameit."  </P> <P> Eventually, with help from Social Security officials, the two found Adolph  Szameit's address in Pensacola. Alison Szameit immediately sent an overnight  letter with photographs of herself and her husband.  </P> <P> "I read the letter and I said, 'This is some kind of hoax,' " Adolph Szameit  said. "I thought it's some kind of scam to take advantage of retired people. I  came this close to throwing it in the trash."  </P> <P> But the letter mentioned Randy Szameit's half-sister, now living in  Pennsylvania, and Adolph Szameit decided that it might be for real. He  double-checked by calling directory assistance in Temple City and discovered  that there was indeed a resident named Randy Szameit.  </P> <P> After a few tearful telephone calls, Adolph Szameit decided to head West.  Although usually a private person, he said, he couldn't help telling everyone,  from the travel agent to fellow passengers and the airline crew on his flight  to Los Angeles, that he had found his son.  </P> <P> "The stewardesses were crying," Szameit said. And so did the Pensacola travel  agents, who made special arrangements to get him economy seats in less than 24  hours.  </P> <P> "We were so into the whole reunion," said Patrice Adams of Today's Travel in  Pensacola. Her entire office "just got kind of all choked up."  </P> <P> Last month, in a joyous and tearful reunion at Los Angeles International  Airport, Adolph Szameit hugged and kissed his family. He cradled his son's and  grandson's faces, gazing at them in half disbelief.  </P> <P> "Oh, God," he said, "I'm so glad to see you."  </P></p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Improved margins help Mid Kent rise to Pounds 7.2m MID KENT Holdings, the water supply company whose 250,000 customers have endured a hose pipe ban for more than three years, yesterday announced an effective 16 per cent increase, to Pounds 7.2m, in pre-tax profits for the year to March 31. Turnover increased by some 15 per cent to Pounds 29.1m, mainly due to average price increases of 18.7 per cent. These were based on Mid Kent's K number - the percentage above the rate of inflation prices can be increased - of 9 per cent. High K numbers were allowed by Ofwat, the industry regulator, to make water companies needing large capital expenditure programmes attractive to investors. Next year Mid Kent's K number will fall to 2.5 per cent. Mr Bob Atwood, finance director, said operating margins improved from 15 per cent to 21 per cent, reflecting cost improvements. Net interest receivable fell to Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 2.38m) due to lower interest rates and a Pounds 2m reduction in net cash to Pounds 26m. Earnings were 31.7p. The company is recommending a final dividend of 5p to make a total distribution of 9.5p. Because of the change in year end, no comparative figures were given, although the dividend is effectively 12 per cent higher.</p>

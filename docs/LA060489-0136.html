			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS OF BARBERING TRIM ODDS OF FAILURE  </P> <P> It's mid-morning on 11th Avenue near Broadway. A few drug peddlers and junkies  stand in front of a boarded-up pool hall looking for prospective customers or  buys. Down the avenue, Richard Garcia's clippers are buzzing while Ray Martsolf  watches and gives advice.  </P> <P> "Be sure to go with the grain of the hair, otherwise a mistake could really  show up," says Martsolf, as Garcia guides the whirring clippers over the skull  of a 10-year-old boy who wants his close-cropped Afro to have "cuts" like those  favored by many professional athletes.  </P> <P> Garcia, 29, a former heroin addict, concentrates on the boy's hair and tries  not to think about the availability of drugs down the street.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Daily Temptation  </P> <P> "I get tempted every day," he says. "When I leave at night, the peddlers will  ask: 'Do you want weed, dope, crack?' But if I come in here strung out, I  wouldn't be able to keep my hands steady when I have to cut or shave. I'm not  interested in that life anymore."  </P> <P> Garcia wants to be a barber. There are 13 of them in his family.  </P> <P> It's been about a year and a half since he gave up guns, knives, his brutal  heroin habit and the leadership of an Oceanside gang for a pair of shears and a  chance to learn the trade he hopes will support his wife and four young  daughters.  </P> <P> Garcia, who will take the state barber license exam in June, is one of the 31  students who are learning the trade from Martsolf and instructor Warren Norman  at the Associated Barber College downtown.  </P> <P> The students' reasons for trimming hair, shaving faces and performing facials  are vastly different.  </P> <P> Garcia's reason was a way out of the vicious world of drug abuse and violence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Proud of It'  </P> <P> "If you stay in gangs, you'll either be dead or end up in prison," he said.  "I've been to prison three times, and I'm not proud of it."  </P> <P> He says he committed his first burglary at age 10. At age 15, he was charged  with the attempted murder of four men he stabbed. The last sentence he served  was four years for cocaine trafficking.  </P> <P> Now, however, the barrel-chested Garcia, whose arms are covered with tattoos,  gives advice to youngsters who sit in one of the college's 32 green Naugahyde  barber chairs while he clips their hair.  </P> <P> "I tell them, you can be a tough guy and still be good," Garcia said.  </P> <P> Martsolf, who owns the college and has seen thousands of students over the last  23 years, says his motivation for staying in business comes from seeing the  transformation of barbers-in-training like Garcia.  </P> <P> "The biggest majority of my students come from families that have barbers  somewhere along the line," Martsolf said. "But I've had all types. I've had  them out of the penitentiary and out of drug rehabilitation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Variety of Students  </P> <P> Not all of his students have tainted pasts. A few chairs down, Marisa Flores is  shaving a customer's face with a straight razor, after applying hot towels and  shaving cream.  </P> <P> Flores, 29, a recent widow with three children who just became a U.S. citizen,  wants to be a barber "because I want to support myself and I don't want to live  off of welfare." She laughs when she says it took an hour and a half the first  time she shaved a customer.  </P> <P> "I was very nervous, and the man was very understanding, even though I nicked  him a few times," Flores said.  </P> <P> With a spot waiting for her at one of her brother-in-law's two shops, Flores is  honing her barber skills while waiting to take her exam in October.  </P> <P> For 66-year-old Victoria Smith, a barber's license will strengthen the  cosmetology license she has held since 1949.  </P> <P> "I want to revise my shaving skills," she said. "My father had 19 children, and  we learned to shave from him because we all took turns. But I know barbers have  a different way of shaving."  </P> <P> And Arsenio Ortanez yearned to learn the barber trade so he could escape what  he called the office politics and frustration of being an electrical draftsman  for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.  </P> <P> Ortanez, 23, hopes to work in his aunt's barbershop in San Francisco until he  can buy his own shop.  </P> <P> "The work you do you take full credit for," Ortanez said. "Here, it's like an  art."  </P></p>

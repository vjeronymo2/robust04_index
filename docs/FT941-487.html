			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Health pay put first in line for treatment: The new chief executive of the NHS tells Alan Pike of his plans One of the first challenges for Mr Alan Langlands, who becomes chief executive of the National Health Service on Friday, will be to put a strategy for introducing local pay bargaining in place by early autumn. Last month's reports from the pay review bodies for medical staff called for the devolution of pay determination to local level. The review bodies and the government see this as an inevitable consequence of the 1991 NHS reforms, but most hospitals and health authorities have been slow to take up the challenge of dismantling the service's centralised pay structures. Mr Langlands said in an interview with the Financial Times that this year the NHS management would have to give the review bodies a 'convincing explanation' of what changes could be achieved in 1995. 'Our initial evidence to the review bodies in the autumn will have to reflect very significant progress.' Transitional arrangements were likely to be proposed, rather than trying to change the existing structure in a single leap, he said. He was also concerned that local managers taking on the new responsibilities should understand that human resource management involved more than just pay. Attention must be given to wider terms and conditions, communications, training and staffing structures. 'It is not just a case of sending a brief signal saying: do it. It is about getting managers to understand the importance of harnessing the workforce for the good of the organisation. This has got to be a two-way street. Employees have got to get something out of it as well.' Mr Langlands is, like Sir Duncan Nichol - his predecessor to whom he was deputy - a career NHS manager. He takes over as chief executive exactly three years after the government's health reforms restructured the service around an internal market. Although Mr Langlands acknowledged that the quality of NHS managers continued to vary, he said the reforms had liberated them from much of the service's old hierarchy and increased opportunities for effective management at local level. One of his early tasks will be to issue new codes on corporate governance, prepared in the wake of examples of serious mismanagement and abuse of procedures in Wessex and West Midlands regional health authorities. Drafts of the codes had, said Mr Langlands, produced positive comments from the Audit Commission, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and Mr Robert Sheldon, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee. The Labour party published a health policy consultation document last month which, while pledging to abolish the market principles of the government's reforms, retained organisational separation between the purchasing of healthcare and its provision. Mr Langlands believed this is one of a number of examples of growing political consensus on health policy, which he welcomed. One area where there is no consensus, however, is the GP fund-holding scheme, which Labour and the British Medical Association say has led to some family doctors gaining fast-track hospital treatment for their patients. Mr Langlands said that while he recognised the concerns of some doctors, most criticisms of fundholding had related to single, anecdotal cases. He believes the overall fairness of the scheme can be demonstrated.</p>

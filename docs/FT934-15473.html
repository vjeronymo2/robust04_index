			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Business overdraft law may change THE OFFICE of Fair Trading is considering recommending changes to the law to ensure that many more small businesses with overdrafts of up to Pounds 30,000 would be entitled to at least seven days notice if their banks wanted to withdraw facilities. Mr John Mills, the OFT's director of consumer credit, said yesterday that the proposal was one of a number of possible changes to the Consumer Credit Act that might affect small businesses. Under the act, banks are required to give indi-viduals and sole traders at least seven days notice before withdrawing facilities of up to Pounds 15,000. Mr Mills said the OFT was considering raising the limit to Pounds 30,000 and removing the anomaly that means incorporated companies are not currently covered by the act. Ironically, the changes emerge from an OFT review of the Consumer Credit Act that was inspired by the government's attempts to push back the boundaries of regulation. If the changes are accepted, it could extend statutory protection for many businesses. Alternatively, the changes might restrict the degree to which banks are willing to lend to companies on overdraft. Barclays Bank said the needs of individuals and small businesses were very different and regulation through the Consumer Credit Act was not appropriate. 'There are plenty of regulations covering lending to small businesses and we do not need any more,' it said. As part of the review of the act, the OFT will conduct public hearings on October 27-28 on the way consumer credit is regulated. The review is examining whether the act and the regulations under it impose greater burdens on the providers of credit than are necessary for effective consumer protection. Mr Mills said: 'We have to resolve whether detailed and prescriptive regulations developed in the 1970s remain appropriate or necessary for the 1990s and beyond.'</p>

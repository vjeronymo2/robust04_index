This was announced by the  Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief, Feliks Gromov, at a meeting of  the government's commission led by Chairman of the State  Committee for Control over Atomic Safety, Yuriy Vishnevskiy, on  the settlement of the issue concerning radioactive waste  products.    The state committee's press service told INTERFAX that the  commission's meeting decided to set up a specific working group  for examination of the situation with radioactive waste products  in the Far East. This group is to work out a report for the  Russian government.    The commission also discussed the operations schedule within  the scope of the special federal program for 1994 on processing  and utilization of radioactive waste products and used nuclear  substances.    This problem became especially significant after the  incident  in October, 1993, when radioactive waste products were dumped  into the Sea of Japan. This caused protests from Japan, South  Korea and the environmental organization Greenpeace.</p>

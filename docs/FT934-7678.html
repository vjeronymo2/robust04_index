			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (8): Alarm bells ring - Public finance even to the point that the government bond market until recently was chronically dull - have recently found things going badly wrong. In 1990, the aggregate deficit of all three levels of government was a piffling SFr1.9bn, or about half of 1 per cent of gross domestic product. This year it will exceed SFr11bn and government leaders are starting to ring the alarm bells. The main cause of the soaring deficits is the high level of unemployment which has forced governments to sharply increase their welfare payments. In previous recessions, unemployment tended to stay relatively low as guest workers went home, women retreated from the labour market and many men were too embarrassed to register for the dole. Ashamed of their treatment of guest workers, the Swiss authorities have eased the conditions under which they could obtain permanent visas. The result is that few have gone home during the current recession, and the unemployment rolls have swelled from a few thousand in 1990 to 170,000 today. If that were the end of the story, everyone would attribute the bloated deficit to cyclical factors and not worry too much about it. But simultaneously a structural deterioration in public finance has also occurred. According to Mr Otto Stich, the federal finance minister, only half of this year's federal deficit, which is now expected to exceed SFr7bn - more than double the initial estimate - is attributable to the recession. 'Even after the economy recovers, the deficits will remain high,' he complained at a recent press conference. The problem has been one common to governments everywhere, with politicians approving popular spending programmes without checking to see if the funds are available. The federal government undertook a round of belt tightening last year. It is also counting heavily on public support in a referendum on November 28 to boost revenue by introducing a modest but universal 6.5 per cent value added tax to replace a more selective turnover tax. But even with these measures, Mr Stich warned that the prospect for the next few years was for total public sector deficits in the order of 4 per cent of GDP and the net public sector debt hovering around 40 per cent of GDP. While these ratios are still relatively modest by international standards, Mr Stich, a socialist, raised the awful spectres of the government's credit rating being questioned and its financing requirements crowding out more worthy private sector borrowers. The former may be plausible, but the latter is most unlikely given the extraordinary size of Swiss capital markets. Certainly, the government's large current demands have not prevented long-term interest rates from falling to close to four per cent, and no one apart from Mr Stich seems worried about a reversal of the trend. In any event, the federal government is now embarking on another cost-cutting programme, this time focused on some of the more sensitive items in the budget, including transfers to the cantonal governments and the indexation of public servants' salaries. The cantonal governments are now expected to put pressure on the communes, but they will point out that some 70 per cent of their spending is determined by cantonal laws. Mr Stich claimed the new proposals would reduce the annual deficit by SFr1.5bn by 1997 and by SFr2bn in the longer term. With this kind of zeal being displayed so early in the descent into excessive debt, it seems unlikely that Switzerland will ever become a concern of the International Monetary Fund. But the last word, as always in this country, will be with the voters.</p>

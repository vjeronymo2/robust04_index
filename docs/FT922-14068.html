			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Arts: Back up the hearse The full title of William Gaminara's first play is Back up the hearse and let them sniff the flowers, a phrase familiar to those high pressure door-to-door salesmen who can sell steak tartare to vegans, but obscure to their victims. It means frightening someone into buying. Gary (Paul Bown) heads the local branch of Virgin Waters, bringing the dubious benefits of an expensive water filtering system to doubtful householders. In his team are two stars, the current champion salesman Steve (excellently played by Danny Webb), who could, and would, sell his granny to the white slavers, and Brian (James Purefoy), who is hitting the households hard and is on target to snatch from Steve the month's incentive prize (unbelievably, it's a colour TV). Then there are Andy (Wilbert Johnson) and Angie (Debra Gillet), who have yet to make their first sale. The duplicitous office manager is Sharon (Lesley Dunlop). It is a world made for drama, as the sales team humiliate potential customers and themselves - in a strong scene Brian talks open a closed door by raising the spectre of a sick child if the mother does not buy a filter, while Andy allows himself to be sexually assaulted to make his first sale. But (groan, groan) it is, of course, also a metaphor for Thatcher's Britain. Suddenly, as Steve clinches a sale to an impoverished couple, he relents, and tears up the contract. He's been struck by an attack of conscience. We soon find out why. Before discovering the joys of cut-and-thrust competition, he was an enthusiastic Trotskyite. His half-brother Des (Christopher Fairbank), who suffers from a wasting disease, still is. In an ending to warm Stalin's heart, and the fade-out for innumerable propaganda movies, Gary lies beaten up and broken in the arms of Des, murmuring 'Is there really nothing else?' To be answered with a reassuring 'Of course, there is'. Until imposing his politically correct Hampstead ending, Gaminara's play grips and convinces. As an exploration of human weakness - all the characters but Sharon crack up in one way or another - and human exploitation (the sales team trample on each other as vigorously as they batter the customers) it is spot-on. John Dove directs a splendid cast around Robert Jones' adaptable stage with great conviction and gives us one of the most frightening fight scenes I have ever witnessed. At the Hampstead Theatre until May 9</p>

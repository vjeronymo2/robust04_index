			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] Governor Chris Patten said yesterday he would delay  introducing the second part of his electoral reform bill so  China would have time to change its mind. On his return from  London, where he secured the support of the Cabinet, Mr Patten  reiterated Britain's will to resume talks with China.    But the British gesture was not greeted by the Chinese side.  A senior official of Xinhua (the New China News Agency), Zheng  Guoxiong, reiterated the call for the withdrawal of the whole  Patten proposal as a prerequisite for China's return to the  negotiating table.    Mr Patten said there was a pressing timetable for  implementing legislation for the coming elections and a "step by  step" approach would give room for further talks. Noting that  the Chinese side had changed its mind at the opening of the  bilateral negotiations early last year Mr Patten said: "It's  giving the Chinese side the time, if they wish to take it, to  have second or third thoughts."    Another reason for not moving the second and more sensitive  part of the bill was due to the "legislative reality". "I don't  think the Legislative Council would welcome it if, while they  were considering this bill we were to bring forward another  bill," Mr Patten said.    Responding to the Cabinet meeting decision, Mr Zheng said he  was not surprised at all by its support for Mr Patten.</p>

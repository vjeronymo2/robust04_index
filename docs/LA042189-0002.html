			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRAYER RESOLUTION  </P> <P> With the Senate and Assembly of California having approved Sen. David Roberti's  resolution for three days of prayer for victims of violent crime, church  leaders have been placed in a curious position (Metro, April 8).  </P> <P> On the one hand, they have no quarrel with widespread prayer. But are they not  discomforted by its being designated by the governing body of the state? Have  religious observances suddenly become the business of government legislators?  What has happened to separation of church and state as guaranteed by the  Constitution?  </P> <P> ROSETTA LIVINGSTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TROUPE DANCING TO ETHNICALLY TRUER DRUMBEAT  </P> <P> For 15 years, the Samahan Philippine Dance Company has been a bastion of what  it thought was authentic dance from the Philippines. Under Lolita Carter's  direction, the troupe showcased everything from primitive tribal rites to  stately court dances in its attempt to bring the legends, ceremonials, folklore  and social life of the Philippines to San Diego audiences.  </P> <P> However, this weekend, when the troupe celebrates 15 years on the San Diego  scene, the Samahan ensemble will be sporting a new look and dancing to a new  sound.  </P> <P> Paradoxically, these innovations should bring the dancers closer to ethnic  authenticity than ever before. And, as its founder stressed in a recent  interview, the music makes all the difference.  </P> <P> "To tell you the truth, the person who taught our percussion music was not  truly authentic, so our dances were always kind of watered down," Carter said.  "All we had to base them on was variations of variations that were handed down.  Now we're learning the way it should be done directly from natives.  </P> <P> "We have two people working with our group since January who are really  experts," she said. "They're both world-class musicians. With their knowledge,  we're trying to get away from the influence of modern dance and get into more  of an ethnic look. There's a lot more theater in it -- with masks. But the  basic difference is the music."  </P> <P> Carter gives the credit for the company's return to its true roots to Danongan  Sibay Kalanduyan, ethnomusicologist and master of the Kulintang, a rare musical  tradition indigenous to the southernmost Philippine Islands.  </P> <P> Kalanduyan, a Rockefeller Fellowship recipient in 1976, has committed to memory  thousands of traditional musical motifs, phrasings and songs, and his influence  on the company's repertory is substantial.  </P> <P> Vocalist and composer Musiban Limbang Guiabar, a colleague of Kalanduyan, is  another reason the Samahan is rethinking its Philippine identity these days.  Guiabar will contribute his thick, throaty chants while Kalanduyan creates  percussive patterns on the eight bronze gongs that make up the Kulintang.  </P> <P> "When they were in San Francisco for five years, they weren't allowed to work  with any other group," Carter said. "But we were the first company they called  when they left because they had heard good things about us. Naturally, I  invited them to come right down."  </P> <P> With help from a COMBO grant and frantic fund-raising efforts, the Samahan  dancers found the necessary support for the musical masters who inspired the  troupe's new thrust. They're hoping to keep both around -- at least long enough  for the musicians to pass on their art to the new crop waiting in the wings.  </P> <P> The troupe will perform at 8 p.m. Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday, and the program  will be a major turning point for the troupe, as Carter pointed out.  </P> <P> "We're starting an entirely new repertory, and we'll be working with a smaller  group. We'll really be going deeper into authentic ethnic dance and trying to  get away from the big ensembles.  </P> <P> "For our October concert, we'll be doing more duets and trios," she said. "No  more flashy ensembles. This concert will still have a lot of our old repertory.  But I have an idea of going on tour someday, and you can't tour with a big  group."  </P> <P> This weekend's program will abound with visual spectacle. The ornately costumed  "Singkil" is back on the bill, with veteran dancer Ruby Chiong stepping in and  out of the crashing bamboo poles yet another time. This dangerous-looking  dance, performed barefoot and at breakneck speed, requires split-second timing  and the kind of fleet-footed precision that has been the hallmark of this  delicate dancer for years.  </P> <P> "I haven't been able to develop a professional group because you get kids that  stay for a while, and then go off somewhere," Carter said. "It's hard to get  support. But we have Ruby Chiong, who is 35 now but still looks 18, and we have  Tony Salamat from the Philippines. And this group is one of the best I've had."  </P> <P> Philippine dance is a melting pot of styles, but this weekend's program will  concentrate on the dances of the southern Philippine Islands.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of influence from Indonesia," Carter said. "The hand movements  are very much like Oriental, and there's a lot of head movements and  off-centered positions.  </P> <P> "We just got some small drums and gongs from the Philippines. When (Kalanduyan  and Guiabar) saw the instruments we were using, they said, 'Throw them out,' so  we replaced them with real authentic ones. They make the dances better -- more  exciting -- now that we're dancing to really good music."  </P></p>

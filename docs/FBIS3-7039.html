			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting  Network in Korean at 2100 GMT on 23 March carries three  consecutive reports citing Japanese newspaper items on U.S. and  Japanese military moves aimed at the DPRK.    The first of three reports states that "The United States is  maneuvering to conduct a war exercise on the East Sea of Korea  [Sea of Japan]. According to a report, the Japanese newspaper  TOKYO SHIMBUN dated 23 March reported that the U.S. Government  is considering an independent war exercise on the East Sea of  Korea. The paper reported that the United States is employing a  hardline policy against our country, such as the deployment of  Patriot missiles in South Korea and setting up specific plans to  resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise. The paper added  that the U.S. Government is pushing ahead step by step with  plans to implement a specific hardline policy."    The second item begins: "According to a report, the Japanese  newspaper YOMIURI SHIMBUN dated 23 March reported that Hajime  Izumi, assistant professor of Sizuoka University, a Korean  affairs expert, urged Japan to take measures to support the U.S.  forces in Japan in case of emergency on the Korean peninsula."  The report notes Izumi's call for an enactment of necessary  laws for Japan "to effectively cope with a military conflict on  the Korean peninsula." The report concludes, "This shows that if  the United States provokes a new war on the Korean peninsula,  Japan is scheming to actively cooperate and participate in it."    The third item reports: "According to a report, the Japanese  newspaper TOKYO SHIMBUN dated 23 March disclosed that the  Japanese Self-Defense Air Force openly conducted a field  maneuver of Patriot missiles on (Shariki) base in Aomori  Prefecture on 22 March. The paper said that the missile launch  pads are aimed at the northern sky. The missile field maneuver  by the Self-Defense Air Force, which is conducted at a time when  the United States is intensifying the military threat against  our Republic, saying that it will deploy Patriot missiles to  South Korea, shows that Japan is dancing to the tune of U.S.  military pressure."</p>

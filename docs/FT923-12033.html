			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Getting back to basics to resume growth - Henry Barrett looks to its core businesses to achieve a recovery WHAT A difference recession makes. Two years ago Henry Barrett Group, the steel and industrial fasteners company, was still riding high, having grown rapidly since flotation in 1987. The Bradford-based group benefited from the last construction boom and bought 13 companies in the late 1980s. Now it is incurring losses and is heavily burdened by debt, in spite of having sold several of those acquisitions. Henry Barrett shares have fallen from their 1989 peak of 280p to 20p, and the market value has dropped from a high of Pounds 110m to less than Pounds 9m. The problems were precipitated by the collapse in demand for steel-framed warehouses and out-of-town stores from retailers such as B&amp;Q, MFI and Texas Homecare. Henry Barrett's biggest mistakes, however, came from its attempts to diversify away from the inevitably cyclical core business of steel stockholding, and building steel-framed buildings. In 1988 it bought Park Pallet, a company making carrying systems for automated warehouses and factories, and the following year purchased OSS and ASS, which make shelving storage and handling systems for big retailers. Mr James Barrett, a director from the group's founding family, said: 'The materials handling business suffered from a slowdown in the retail sector, so proved to be in the same cycle as construction.' These companies have now been sold, as have two more profitable acquisitions  -BNL, which makes thermoplastic bearings, and Lurmark, which manufactures spray nozzle tips, mainly for use in agriculture. Mr Barrett said the underperformance of the materials handling businesses was initially masked by the strength of the group's core activities. However, even successful acquisitions, such as BNL and Lurmark, took up a disproportionate amount of management time. He concludes: 'We can make our business more resilient by staying within our area of expertise, rather than running around to find something to be good at.' Not all is gloom at Bradford, however. One surprise has been the continuing resilience of steel stockholding, which grew directly from the iron merchant's business founded by the original Henry Barrett in 1866. Despite the recession, the stockholding side has continued to trade profitably and expand market share. It is one of the leading independent steel stockholders in the UK. The group is big enough to negotiate keen prices for steel, but its 10 existing depots serve local markets right down to small workshops, and can make good margins. Mr Barrett said: 'When we are in a position to grow, that is what we will grow.' The group still has no depots in Wales, Scotland or south of the Thames. Henry Barrett's best short-term hopes for recovery lie in its construction divi-sion, as the continuing attrition of competitors raises the prospects of higher prices and a recovery in profit margins. Westbury Tubular Structures, purchased in 1989, continues to trade profitably and has just completed a Pounds 4m contract for the roof of the new Waterloo Channel tunnel terminal in London. In May the workforce was reduced by 36 to 80, but order intake since then has been good. On the design and build side, the group is now trading at about break-even, having closed its Leicester factory in November with the loss of 50 jobs. The business now employs 205 people - 175 in Bradford and 30 on the sales side. Mr Barrett said: 'There's a market of about 250,000 tonnes a year of the single-storey structures we make for industrial and retail use. We need about 20,000 tonnes of that to keep going. Prices are currently at Pounds 650 a tonne, compared with up to Pounds 1,100 at the peak. We just need a small recovery in prices to make profits.' The widespread demise of competitors is finally allowing prices to move up, but the group has also succeeded in raising productivity by 15 per cent a year. Just-in-time manufacturing techniques have cut stocks from seven to two weeks, with increased flexibility. The group completed erection of a 15,000 sq ft baggage handling facility at Heathrow within 23 days of receiving the order. The construction division's main headache lies with Don Reynolds Holdings, which makes flat-panel cladding for use in steel-framed buildings and was bought for Pounds 10.8m in 1989. Demand for its product in the UK has collapsed, partly because fewer offices and business parks are being built, and also because the fashion has switched back towards more traditional materials, as championed by the Prince of Wales. DRL's best hope of profits lies overseas, through joint ventures in Japan, the US and continental Europe. The loss-making UK operation is now sharing its factory with Lindapter, a profitable business which sells a system for joining steel without bolts or welding, and exports half its output. Mr Donald Parvin, who became Henry Barrett's chairman in December, assumed an executive role earlier this month. Mr James Barrett will no longer act as group chief executive, but will concentrate on the stockholding division. Mr Barrett's younger brother, Richard, is managing director of the construction division. A former chief executive of Matthew Clark, the mechanical and electrical engineers, Mr Parvin said he believed a cut in working capital and greater efficiency could yield better financial results - even in present trading conditions. Henry Barrett is expected to make a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 3m on turnover of Pounds 100m in the current year, and is likely to break even next year. Overshadowing the whole group's future are its borrowings of between Pounds 17m and Pounds 18m, which puts gearing at about 75 per cent. Mr James Barrett conceded: 'Until we reduce that debt, our share price will languish.' Mr Parvin said Barclays, the group's bankers, had been very supportive. Its financial advisers, NM Rothschild, were looking at possible steps to strengthen the balance sheet, but had so far made no definite proposals. The sale of surplus property could raise a few millions, but the chairman said one way forward could be to form strategic alliances with one or more overseas steelmakers - from the US, Europe or Japan. Mr Parvin said Henry Barrett had always bought steel from overseas. In exchange for a cash injection, such producers could gain from Henry Barrett's knowledge of and access to the UK market. James and Richard Barrett borrowed heavily to help buy out the 48 per cent of the shares held by family members and bring the company to market. What lessons have they learnt from its subsequent roller-coaster ride? James said: 'We can't eliminate the cyclicality of design and build, because that is how people expand. But in such a violently cyclical business, you really need an ungeared balance sheet at the start of any downturn.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The government wants to expand joint  research with Russia under the slogan "Help for Self-Help."  Bernd Neumann (Christian Democratic Union), parliamentary  secretary of state in the Research Ministry, told the press in  Bonn on Friday [27 May] that agreements on joint research in  three specialized fields -- biological science, water and  environmental research, and information technology -- should be  reached during his government talks due to begin in Moscow on  Monday. This should be followed by a further agreement on  increased cooperation on maritime and polar research.    During his four-day stay, which includes a visit to St.  Petersburg, Neumann intends to acquaint himself with the current  situation in Russian research, which is suffering from, among  other things, a shortage of money and personnel. Nevertheless,  Russian scientists continue to be desirable partners, especially  in the fields of space travel, maritime and polar research, and  laser technology, he said. A major project in space cooperation  is the development of the "Express" space capsule, being  undertaken jointly with Japan.    In the sphere of nuclear reactor safety, Neumann mentioned  the expediency of using German technology and experience in  examining deficiencies in reactors. Russian experts should be  given an opportunity to improve the safety of their nuclear  power stations, which does not meet Western standards.    Bonn is spending some 37.5 million German marks [DM] until  the end of 1994 on a scientific support program that started in  1992. In addition, Russian scientists are involved in over 100  specialized projects on which the Research Ministry is spending  DM240 million. The Western-sponsored projects include the  International Science and Technology Center in Moscow, which can  largely be attributed to an idea of former Foreign Minister  Hans-Dietrich Genscher.</p>

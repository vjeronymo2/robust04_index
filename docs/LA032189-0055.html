			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 SOUTH AFRICAN DETAINEES FLEE HOSPITAL;  </P> <P> EX-HUNGER STRIKERS GRANTED REFUGE IN WEST GERMAN EMBASSY  </P> <P> Four political detainees escaped Monday from a hospital where they were  recuperating after a hunger strike and found refuge in the West German Embassy  40 miles away. They demanded freedom for all activists being held without  charge by the South African government.  </P> <P> "We have commited no crime," the four men said in a statement issued by the  Detainees Aid Center.  </P> <P> "We have been kept in detention for so long that we felt we had to embark on a  life-and-death hunger strike to secure our release. We (escaped) after it  became clear there is no intention to release us."  </P> <P> The four blacks, 21 to 28 years old, were leaders in youth organizations  affiliated with the United Democratic Front, the country's largest  anti-apartheid coalition. They had been held for periods ranging from eight  months to nearly two years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Asylum Reported  </P> <P> Their attorney, Priscilla Jana, said they were granted asylum by the West  German Embassy. Embassy officials declined to comment except to say that the  four had been allowed into the walled embassy mission a few blocks from South  Africa's administrative headquarters in Pretoria, the capital, and that the  embassy was in contact with the South African government.  </P> <P> Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, the South African foreign minister, issued a statement  saying that "the matter is receiving attention." He said it is regrettable that  the men escaped when "only a relatively small number are still in detention and  each case is being reviewed daily."  </P> <P> Human rights activists estimate that 500 political activists remain in custody  under the 33-month-old state of emergency. As many as 100 have been in jail for  more than two years without trial, and about 30,000 have been detained for  varying periods since June, 1986.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hunger Strike  </P> <P> About 300 detainees have taken part in a hunger strike since Jan. 23, demanding  that they be charged or released. The strike was suspended last month when the  minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok, agreed to review each detainee's case  and release "a substantial number."  </P> <P> The government says about 500 have been released in recent months, many under  restrictions that inhibit their movement and prevent them from participating in  political activity.  </P> <P> Anti-apartheid leaders complain that too few have been freed and that dozens  more people have been arrested since Vlok's pledge.  </P> <P> Monday's incident marked the second time in six months that activists held  without charge have slipped out of a hospital and sought refuge in a diplomatic  mission.  </P> <P> On Sept. 13, three prominent anti-apartheid leaders left a hospital where they  were undergoing physical therapy and fled to the U.S. Consulate in  Johannesburg. They left five weeks later after being assured by the government  that no action would be taken against them.  </P> <P> The four men involved Monday escaped from their guarded rooms in Johannesburg's  Hillbrow Hospital. Their attorney said they took a taxi to the West German  Embassy. The men waved to reporters from the embassy foyer. One was wearing a  T-shirt bearing the message: "Release All Detainees. Support the Hunger  Strikers."  </P> <P> The four were identified as Ephraim Nkoe, 28, of the South African Youth  Congress, who had been held eight months; Mpho Lekgoro, 24, of the  Saulsville-Atteridgeville Youth Congress, held a year; Clive Radebe, 28, of the  Soweto Youth Congress, held 16 months, and Job Sithole, 21, of the Alexandra  Youth Congress, held 23 months.  </P></p>

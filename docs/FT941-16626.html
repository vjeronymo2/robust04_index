			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions In spectacular market conditions, it is hardly surprising to see the volume of selling rise sharply - not just the number of trades but also the cash value of those sales. Dr Desmond Graves, director of construction company George Wimpey, appears again with two separate sales, each of 300,000 shares. Graves sold two tranches of stock totalling Pounds 750,000 at the beginning of the month, so the latest reduction takes his sales to 1.35m shares. Since he now holds just 270,000, clearly that is a very significant divestment. Wimpey has been one of the weaker performers in the construction sector but is back in the black after last year's loss. Another stock in the same sector, Persimmon, was also affected by some selling. Michael Allen, the deputy chairman, disposed of 71,621 shares at 305p, reducing his holding to just over 200,000. In contrast to Wimpey, Persimmon shares performed well last year and have risen by almost 40 per cent against the market over the past 12 months. A good deal of the selling has been option-related. A number of deals stand out, not least Standard Chartered where recovery has been particularly strong. David Moir, director of banking for the Asia Pacific region, exercised an option over 93,000 shares, selling them all at Pounds 12.18. Since mid-November, four directors have exercised options over large tranches of stock and sold the resulting holdings. Two directors in Grand Metropolitan, including Sir Allen Sheppard, the chairman and chief executive, also exercised large options in Grand Metropolitan and sold the lot.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           No of Company                Sector       Shares     Value    directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bilton                  Prop        2,140        14         1 Blenheim Group           Med       15,000        47         1* BPB Industries          BdMa       30,000       105         1 Bradstock                Ins       65,000        95         1 British Data Mngmt      Supp      200,000       424         1 British Gas             GasD       27,820        99         1 Capital Radio            Med        7,500        21         1 Crossroads Oil Grp       Oil      950,000       157         1 Delta                   Elcs        3,000        14         1 EMAP                     Med        4,256        17         2 Enterprise Oil           Oil       12,306        56         1 Glaxo                   Phar      136,497       964         1* Grand Metropolitan      Spir      256,880     1,228         2* Grand Metropolitan      Spir       11,576        54         1 Hambros                 Merc       70,000       279         1* H'land Distilleries     Spir       40,000       142         1* Lincoln House           Hous      121,106        36         1 Lloyd Thompson           Ins       50,000       131         1 Lynx Holdings           Supp      100,000        42         1 MAI                     OthF       50,000       131         1 Norcros                 BdMa       15,000        29         1 Persimmon               BdCo       71,621       218         1 Premier Land            ExtI      500,000        33         1 Reed Intl                Med       15,000       133         1 Reuters Holdings         Med       12,095       218         2* Seton Healthcare        Hlth      100,000       310         1 Severn Trent            Watr       15,367        92         1 Sheldon Jones           FdMa      491,278       214         1 Southern Water          Watr        3,000        20         1 Standard Chartered      Bank       93,058     1,133         1* Telegraph, The           Med       13,333        62         1 Tinsley Robor           PP&amp;P      125,000        29         1 VTR                      Med       10,000        12         1 Warburg (SG)            Merc      101,546       962         1* Wates City of Londn     Prop      200,000       176         1 Wessex Water            Watr       12,000        88         1 Wimpey (George)         BdCo      600,000     1,086         1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bernard Mathews         FdMa      125,000        98         1 Booker                  FdMa        6,000        25         2 British Thornton        PP&amp;P       50,000        90         1 Carlton Comm             Med        2,500        22         1 CityCntr Restaurant     L&amp;Ho       23,000        19         1 City of Oxford Inv      InTr       50,000        51         1 European Mtr Hldgs      Dist       15,000        21         1 Fairway Group           PP&amp;P       25,000        18         1 Greggs                  ReFo        1,940        13         1 Hampden Group           ReGn      100,000        17         2 Holliday Chemical       Chem       25,000        40         1 MEPC                    Prop        3,616        20         3 National Home Loans     OthF      100,000        31         1 Reliance Securities     Supp       10,000        11         1 Scottish Eastern        InTr       50,000        43         1 Triplex Lloyd            Eng       10,000        13         1 Ulster Television        Med       10,000        51         1 WSP                     Supp       52,000        18         1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Polls cause jitters TWO OPINION polls showing the opposition Labour party with a five-point lead over the Conservatives made the UK money market nervous once more, with rates firming across the spectrum. The market did draw a little consolation from a 0.4 per cent rise in UK February retail sales, fuelling hopes that consumer spending may be starting to recover. But this did not stop rates firming again to levels more appropriate to a 10 3/4 per cent base rate than 10 1/2 per cent. All interbank rates climbed, with the three-month up  1/16 to 10 13/16 -10 per cent, the six-month up  1/8 to 10 15/16 -10 13/16 , and the one-year up  3/16 to 11-10 7/8 . The June sterling contract opened 16 basis points down at 89.13 and slid away to 89.08. The Bank of England did its best to sustain confidence and keep trading rates within a realistic distance of 10 1/2 per cent by relieving the market of a large slice of longer-dated bills in early assistance. It forecast a shortage of around Pounds 950m, but a large part of this was covered in early operations as the market seized the opportunity to unload Pounds 572m of bank and treasury bills in bands 3 and 4. The latest opinion polls had underlined the risk of carrying longer paper, and the Bank's price of 10 3/16 per cent for band 3 and 10 5/32 per cent for band 4 was better than anything that could be obtained in the market. Overnight rates fell from 10-10 9/16 per cent to 10 1/2 -10 1/4 , and eased again after midday, when the Bank purchased Pounds 350m band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, taking out most of the remaining shortage. This was later revised upwards to Pounds 1bn, while the Bank purchased a further Pounds 100m band 1 bank bills to take the day's assistance to Pounds 1.022bn. Overnight rates fell to 7-5 per cent, reflecting the apparent excess on operations. In Germany, the Bundesbank's injection of DM1.2bn via its weekly securities repurchase was seen as a technical move offsetting quarterly tax payments, and gave no signal about the likely outcome of today's Bundesbank council meeting. In spite of some speculation in the currency markets that the council might tighten monetary policy, dealers said they could see no reason for such a move. German call money was steady at 9.60 per cent, with demand and supply in balance.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVABLE FEASTS: A FOOD COACH'S EXERCISE IN HEALTHY EATING  </P> <P> I have just bitten into a stuffed red bell pepper that is so healthy it is  positively leaking Vitamin C. Inside the pepper are 250 calories full of brown  rice, ground turkey and a tomato sauce so clean it seems scrubbed behind the  ears. I figure all this virtue is costing about $1 dollar a bite.  </P> <P> "Look at it this way," says a friend visiting from New York. "Think of what  you're saving. The Golden Door would cost you $3,500 plus gas."  </P> <P> We're saving on the gas here. Definitely. Yolanda Bergman -- the "food coach"  to Carrie Fisher, Kate Jackson, Ozzy Osbourne and other assorted celebrities --  comes to you.  </P> <P> Sometimes she'll arrive with oat bran waffles, low-fat pizza, grilled orange  teriyaki chicken, barbecued scallops, berry tarts . . . or, at the very least,  a large empty bag.  </P> <P> Bergman, the former ballerina and Jane Fonda instructor who likes to be called  just "Yolanda," will make a clean sweep of a kitchen and fill it with lean,  healthy food (no fats, sugar, additives, caffeine, cholesterol, red meat, salt,  MSG . . .). Many of her clients place weekly orders for precisely the sort of  food you'd find at a spa. A week's worth of Yolanda's "The Perfect Food" meals  runs between $200 and $250.  </P> <P> I dig into the marinated grilled vegetables, a gorgeous mound (65 calories,  $7.95) of smoky tri-colored peppers, whole mushrooms, slabs of zucchini and  yellow squash, fat eggplant discs. It is bursting with flavor, crisp, juicy and  amazingly fresh. I could get used to this.  </P> <P> My New York friend is on the telephone. "How much does a live-in cook run these  days?" He writes down the facts. "Really? From three-fifty to seven-fifty a  week."  </P> <P> He hangs up and announces, "We're saving money." Indeed. Two little bell  peppers are $17.50, tomorrow's turkey meat loaf is $15.95 for two, the roast  turkey breast is $17.95, and that small package of mixed wild and brown rice is  $6.50.  </P> <P> "What about that $10 delivery charge?" I ask. "If you have to ask prices . . .  ," he says.  </P> <P> If you have to ask prices then you probably won't have your fridge bursting at  the seams with Yolanda's microwaveable packages. But since she happily delivers  individual meals -- $35 minimum -- with eight hours' notice, you might order a  week of light lunches -- or have a supper now and then.  </P> <P> Yolanda's food is comparable to the meals served at the best American spas --  with one plus: The portions are normal, not Lilliputian. (Ozzy Osbourne  wouldn't stand for doll-sized meals.) While the muffins are gummy, the barbecue  sauce (no sugar or honey) is a pale trace of the real thing. But the low-cal  lasagna (plenty of fresh tomatoes, tofu and spinach) is nothing that a little  cheese and salt wouldn't rev up, and the entrees tend to be so delightfully  fresh (and, gosh, cheerful) you'd think they were farmed and cooked five  minutes before.  </P> <P> "I could imagine coming home to this after a hard day at the studio," said my  pal tasting the grilled lime chicken. It is 138 calories per portion, tender  and served with a flirty little red salsa -- I could enjoy it again too.  Likewise the sweet, juicy roast turkey fashioned with a thin green mustard  sauce. Even the low-calorie garlic herb salad dressing, usually, by its very  nature, execrable, is sparkling. (It's 6 calories per tablespoon and $7 for a  small jar.)  </P> <P> The next night we're eating the fluffy turkey meat loaf woven with onions,  carrots and zucchini. The no-oil tomato topping is even fluffier. It's exactly  the kind of food that tastes great when you've been at a spa for five days.  Even now, it's pretty good -- but why am I up hunting down the tamari sauce?  </P> <P> "I don't know why," says my friend who stopped smoking two years ago, "but this  meal makes me want to have a cigarette."  </P> <P>  Yolanda's, (213) 657-3821. Call for delivery information. $35 minimum order,  $10 delivery charge. Eight hours' notice required. American Express,  MasterCard, Visa and checks accepted. Entrees: $6.95-$25.50.  </P> <P> </P></p>

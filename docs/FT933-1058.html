			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Healthcare switch Consideration of President Clinton's health reforms continued yesterday to affect those UK health stocks with significant exposure to the US. The main feature in the London stock market was a switch of holdings from Zeneca, the recently demerged pharmaceuticals arm of ICI, to Glaxo. President Clinton has said pharmaceutical companies will have to offer a 15 per cent discount on drugs sold to Medicare, the health system which offers subsidised treatments to the elderly and which represents 30 per cent of the US health budget. Analysts said Glaxo, which rose 132 to 654p had less exposure to Medicare than Zeneca, which fell 11 to 710p. Healthcare group Fisons was the subject of renewed takeover speculation, this time from both Zeneca and ICI. Although one of the oldest outstanding bid stories in London, Fisons shares lifted 7 1/2 to 174p. Oil stocks were firmer, reflecting a pick-up in crude oil prices and expectations of an advantageous outcome to the weekend's OPEC conference. Among the majors, Shell Transport improved 6 1/2 to 651p while BP was marginally firmer at 302p. The exploration and production companies were also a good market. Enterprise rose 4 to 432p and Lasmo gained 2 1/2 to 146 1/2 p. Insurance broker Willis Corroon lifted 4 to 229p after announcing plans to sell its 56 per cent stake in subsidiary Gryphon Holdings. Gryphon holds the group's two US insurance companies - Associated International Insurance and Calvert Insurance - which write commercial property and casualty policies for small- to medium-sized insurers. However, Hoare Govett downgraded its recommendation from hold to overvalued arguing that the yield was too low in the light of the weak balance sheet and poor recovery in US casualty insurance. Shares in Hepworth, the building materials group, rose 7 to 377p in spite of a fall in interim profits to Pounds 27.5m from Pounds 32.8m. The figure was better than most analysts forecast and the operating profit by division was better than expected. UBS raised its forecasts for the full year to Pounds 60m but remains a holder of the stock preferring to invest in MB - Caradon, off 4 at 319p. Bargain hunters caused a turnround in several of the food retailing stocks after gloomy sessions that followed the release of disappointing figures. Tesco firmed 4 1/2 to 202p, while its rival J Sainsbury gained 8 to 428p. Asda edged a penny forward to 60 1/2 p. Shares in Thorn EMI remained under a cloud as worries about the company's US Rent-A-Center operation continued. Nervous selling saw the shares give up 22 to 922p. The US subsidiary contributes between 15 and 16 per cent to group profits. The recent selling in Ladbroke appears to have dried up and the shares finished 6 ahead at 195p. However talk that the final dividend could be cut continued to circulate. In the rest of the drinks sector, the poor figures from Guinness released earlier this week continued to exact a toll and the shares lost another 5 to 422p in trade of 4.1m. The other stock to be downgraded by NatWest Securities in the sector was Allied Lyons. The shares gave up 8 to 563p, after the securities house reduced the current year profits estimate by Pounds 15m to Pounds 669m. Several analysts were surprised to see shares in Mirror Group Newspapers gain 2 to 180p ahead of a big stake sale. The book-building process for the sale of the 54.8 per cent holding currently with the administrator begins on Monday and was expected to depress the share price. Shares in BICC advanced 7 to 420p, after it won two new contracts. The company won a contract for work on the M8 motorway in Scotland said to be worth about Pounds 39m. BICC is also believed to have secured a Pounds 50m contract for a waste water scheme in Egypt. The two new contracts rounded off a favourable week for the group in which its Balfour Beatty subsidiary signed a memorandum of understanding with Malaysia on project management contracts for building the country's new international airport. Williams de Broe was particularly active in the stock yesterday and Mr Mustapha Omar at the broker believes, 'the 6 per cent yield premium is likely to fuel advances in the share price.' Among stores, SG Warburg was said to have been positive on Kingfisher where the shares advanced 4 to 666p. US buying was seen in British Steel and volume rose to 14m as the shares firmed 4 to 119 1/2 p. Further consideration of results from Quality Software, the developer and retailer of financial computer packages, sent the shares down another 49 to 479p.</p>

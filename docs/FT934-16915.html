			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Arts: Tamerlano In a few weeks Opera North will be 15 years old. The company has performed almost 100 operas since its inception, and the new season demonstrates the high quota of unusual works in its repertoire, including this staging of Handel's Tamerlano at the Grand Theatre, Leeds. Dating from 1982, it was originally a co-production with Welsh National Opera, produced and designed by Philip Prowse. There is a 'designer opera' feel about it. The single set, subtly lit, is very arty - an imposing vision of a civilisation in decay, dominated by two stone horses, looking down on carefully arranged piles of debris, bricks and corpses thrown together, all sprinkled with a layer of dusty grey. The plot would have us believe this to be a grand and ruined city of the Ottoman empire after its sack by the Mongols, but there is another way to read it, too. Opera producers of the late 20th century seem intent on telling us that Handel's operas are museum pieces, written in a style that is defunct. It is a small step from there to set this opera in the remains of a great civilisation, its splendour gone, its social order in ruins. The question is: could Opera North blow off the dust for this revival? Tamerlano is highly regarded for the quality of its music, but it is not one of those bold and daring operas in which Handel sweeps aside the conventions of his day in the white heat of inspiration - at least not until the closing quarter-of-an-hour. The singers must work to bring it alive. In the title-role, Christopher Robson came close to turning tragedy into farce. This was the murderous despot Tamburlaine turned into a spiteful, preening peacock. A ring in his ear, a ridiculously long, brocaded cloak trailing behind him, he was made to strut around the stage like a walking parody of a Baroque castrato. The voice lacks authority and the way in which he spat out the words belittled the character's stature. For naturalness of expression Rosa Mannion was the most convincing, making all of the soprano Asteria's slow music hold the attention. Graham Pushee, the second counter-tenor in the cast, brought a bright and forward vocal manner to Andronicus (his duet with Asteria was the evening's most stylish piece of singing). Patricia Bardon ennobled Irene with an old-fashioned Handelian contralto; Geoffrey Dolton made the words count as Leone. With Roy Goodman persuading Opera North's musicians to adopt pseudo-authentic musical practice, there was a fair amount of forward impetus. I regret only his decision to restore the numbers near the end cut by Handel before the first performance. For at this point Philip Langridge had just seized centre-stage for Bajazet's death scene. He may not be the most stylish Handelian tenor, but he shattered the tedium, blew away the camp, left words and music burning with intensity, as though he believed Handelian opera to be a living thing. Then the dust settled again.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Compound growth The smooth management transition at SmithKline Beecham stands in marked contrast to the sudden departure of Mr Ernest Mario from Glaxo last month. The relaxed reaction of the shares yesterday shows which approach the market prefers. The marriage of SmithKline Beckman and Beecham in 1989 must also be judged a success for ending years of underperformance for shareholders in both companies. There have been disappointments along the way. The cosmetics business might have been sold for more. Yet the balance sheet has been restored to good order, as promised. More importantly, the combined business looks diverse enough to ride out nasty shocks. The merger might still provide a model in this respect. One might wonder whether Boots' drugs business is broad-based enough to bounce back should Manoplax, its heart drug, flop following yesterday's poor clinical trials data. Fisons' future as an independent pharmaceuticals company is open to question for similar reasons. SmithKline Beecham must still deal with the US patent expiry of Tagamet, it biggest selling drug, but US sales of Tagamet now account for only a small percentage of turnover. Cheap generic versions of Tagamet may be more of a threat to Glaxo, which depends on its rival anti-ulcer treatment Zantac for almost half of sales. Whether Glaxo can overcome its dependence on Zantac alone, or needs an outside partner to bring diversity, remains the burning question. Those with long memories will remember blood-letting among the top management at SmithKline Beckman before it settled on the merger solution.</p>

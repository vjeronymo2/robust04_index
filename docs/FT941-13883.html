			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Cultural tug-of-war divides Scots - The row over Scotland's new National Gallery The room was designed to seat 250; in the event, 1,000 turned up. University lecturers in tweed jackets stood alongside old ladies in mackintoshes, young women tending babies and at least one judge of the court of session at the meeting earlier this week to protest against the decision by the National Galleries of Scotland to locate a new gallery not in the Scottish capital, but in Glasgow. It was the climax of a controversy which has been the chief talking point of Scotland's chattering classes since early December. Each day there have been broadsides in the letters and features pages of The Scotsman. Last week its Glasgow rival The Herald devoted four pages to the issue. Next week it will be debated in the House of Lords. The controversy involves not just art but Scottish nationalism and the perpetual rivalry of Scotland's two biggest cities. It concerns a plan to create a National Gallery of Scottish Art, intended to tell the history of Scotland and its art. It will take paintings by Scottish artists from two Edinburgh galleries, the National Gallery of Scotland on The Mound, and the Gallery of Modern Art. It will also absorb the entire Scottish National Portrait Gallery, also in Edinburgh, which will close. The new institution will be built at Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow. The idea of creating a National Gallery of Scottish Art was launched in 1991 by Timothy Clifford, the ebullient Englishman who is director of the National Galleries of Scotland, and by Angus Grossart, the terse merchant banker who is chairman of the galleries' trustees. It sprang from a desire to relieve the serious shortage of space in the Edinburgh galleries, which means that paintings by Scottish artists have to be taken down to provide space for exhibitions, while hundreds of Scottish paintings lie in store. The Portrait Gallery's collection of paintings of leading Scotsmen and women over the centuries would form the nucleus of the new gallery, blended with other paintings by Scottish artists such as Raeburn, Wilkie and Cadell from the National Gallery and the Gallery of Modern Art. It would tell the history of Scotland visually. Landscape paintings would illustrate Scotland's geology and topography. At the time Clifford said Edinburgh was the most logical place for the new gallery, but added: 'It is up to Glasgow to come up with wonderful proposals. We are ready to be seduced.' That is exactly what happened. Whereas Edinburgh reacted sluggishly, Glasgow with typical assertiveness offered the trustees several locations, promised to lend the new gallery some of its best paintings and commissioned architects such as Sir Norman Foster and Terry Farrell to produce designs. Glasgow consistently made the running: a consultants' study showed that on economic grounds Glasgow was the best location: the sites were cheaper, the population was bigger and the existing Kelvingrove art gallery and museum had higher attendances than the Edinburgh galleries. The ten trustees repeatedly postponed a decision. But in the end the economic arguments for Glasgow, reinforced by the knowledge that the trustees represent Scotland rather than Edinburgh (several of them come from Glasgow) made Kelvingrove inevitable. It was announced on November 30. People in Edinburgh reacted with horror to what had happened. The decision meant that some of the best-loved paintings would leave Edinburgh for Glasgow. Raeburn's famous picture of the Reverend Robert Walker skating on Duddingston Loch - which the gallery uses as its logo - would go for some years to Kelvingrove. The rights and wrongs of a National Gallery of Scottish Art had been debated intermittently since 1991. Now the arguments against it came pouring out. They boil down to two. First, the new institution would mean herding Scottish art into a ghetto. As Julian Spalding, director of Glasgow's Art Galleries, said in 1991 (he has since changed his mind) the most successful galleries in other countries try to cross-fertilise the art of different nations rather than separating them into compartments. By the same token it would severely weaken the National Gallery. Though the gallery has listed those Scottish paintings that will stay, art historian Duncan Macmillan says the Scottish collections should be the heart of the National Gallery. 'Without them it becomes the National Gallery of Nowhere in Particular, or perhaps the International Gallery of Anywhere Else but Scotland.' Secondly, the new institution means destroying the Portrait Gallery, created in 1889 and one of only three in the world. Paul Scott, a leading campaigner, calls it one of the most treasured possessions of the Scottish people: it should be kept intact and remain in the Scottish capital. It is this which arouses the strongest feelings. At this week's public meeting Clifford defended his plan and Spalding pricked a few consciences when he asked: 'If the Portrait Gallery was closing and if Edinburgh had been successful in the bid it made (to have the new gallery) would you all be here tonight?' Edinburgh campaigners say they do not object to a new gallery being built somewhere else, even Glasgow, but with a different configuration. But they voted overwhelmingly for the trustees to reconsider or resign. None of the trustees was present. Yet even if the trustees stick to their decision it is far from certain that the new gallery will go ahead. The Scottish Office has said that it will not contribute to the Pounds 20m cost. Glasgow may stand a better chance than Edinburgh of qualifying for EU funding but this is far from certain. Grossart talks of tapping private donors and getting money from the National Lottery or the Millennium Fund. But it is difficult to believe that the government, which will control those funds, would direct them to a project which so many people oppose. Increasingly eyes are turning to Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary. He has the final say and could veto the scheme or order a review. To many people, possibly including some of the trustees, that might come as a relief.</p>

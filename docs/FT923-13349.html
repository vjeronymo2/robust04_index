			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Bush still ahead on foreign policy PRESIDENT George Bush's aura as the victor of Desert Storm and the man who presided over the western world as the Soviet Union collapsed may have faded in recent months, yet the Democratic party has not yet succeeded in denting voters' confidence in his foreign affairs expertise. A recent Gallup poll carried out for CNN and USA Today showed that 62 per cent of voters believe that Governor Bill Clinton, the Democrats' presumptive presidential candidate, would be capable of defending US interests abroad. An overwhelming majority, however, still said that Mr Bush would be better than either Mr Clinton or Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who seems likely to run as an independent candidate, on foreign affairs  - the only category in which the president still leads both his challengers. Mr Clinton has set out to position himself as a serious student of foreign policy with a series of speeches that have attracted favourable reviews from Washington pundits. The Democratic party platform, to be voted on at this week's convention in New York, continues on the same lines with a generally middle-of-the-road foreign policy plank, but with several differences from the Bush stance. Attacking 'the corrosive effect of foreign policies that are rooted in the past, divorced from our values, fearful of change and unable to meet its challenges', the platform criticises the Bush administration for its placatory approach to dictatorships and to regimes which abuse human rights. Some criticisms may strike home. The recent call by Democrats in the House of Representatives for the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into the administration's role in the BNL Iraqi loan fraud seems likely to maintain the spotlight on Mr Bush's policy errors over President Saddam Hussein. Apart from calls for a faster reduction in US forces and a more pro-Israeli policy in the Middle East, the Democrats differ little from the Republican administration in their desire for collective security arrangements, multilateral peacekeeping and free trade. In accusing Mr Bush of remaining rooted in the Cold war, however, the Democrats underline their claim that Mr Clinton and his vice-presidential running mate, Senator Al Gore, are the candidates of generational change.</p>

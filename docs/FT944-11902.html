			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (5): Good-bye to easy money - Banking: the credit-rating crisis has exposed the system's weakness Bankers are not happy. Most expect profits to fall in real terms, for the first time in recent memory. Mr Erol Sabanci, vice-chairman of Akbank, part of the Sabanci business empire and one of Turkey's biggest banks, reckons 1994 pretax income will slide 43 per cent to Dollars 184.2m. But after years making easy money, bankers are in no position to complain. They have piled up profits by playing a rudimentary arbitrage game stacked in their favour. Banks used Turkey's once-high credit rating to borrow cheaply overseas, and used the money to speculate in fast-moving financial markets or to lend to the government. Not only did the government pay high interest rates, it also allowed the Turkish lira to appreciate, handing banks a 40 per cent margin. So it is hardly surprising that net profits at Turkey's 10 biggest banks rose 41 per cent in dollar terms last year, to the equivalent of Dollars 806.2m. Assets rose to Dollars 47.44bn from Dollars 44.33bn. But the game was up in the spring, when Turkey's credit rating dropped below investment grade, and currency and financial markets collapsed. Luckily, only three small banks crashed. But the crisis laid bare the system's weaknesses: over-reliance on trading, narrow local deposit bases, unadventurous lending and investment banking arms. Although bank profits have taken a heavy hit, the government's insatiable appetite for money is keeping interest rates sky high. In May, interbank rates reached Latin American heights of 1,000 per cent a year. Even when rates settled down to 85 per cent in the autumn, they were still equivalent to a real 40 per cent as inflation fell. Clearly, banking can still be good business as long as executives are careful about their risks. Banks with a strong local deposit base have lower cost of funds and are less exposed to currency risk. Mr Sabanci says: 'Akbank's main source of funding is local currency. Our (foreign currency) positions are 10 per cent of liabilities. Compared with some banks with 90 per cent, this is a tremendous difference.' He says Akbank's strengths are a sound balance sheet, a healthy loan book and conservative management. Indeed, even its 33 per cent leap in profit last year looks hesitant compared with some competitors' gains of 80 per cent. The big Turkish banks are impressively manoeuvrable. They have invested in technology while cutting jobs and branches. They have good, professional management teams, even though ownership is retained by powerful families. The big banks exceed international capital standards. Many blue-chip banks also own big industrial holdings. Depending on one's point of view, these are either a source of weakness or a source of strength. Isbank, the largest non-state bank, has stakes in 84 companies, including control of Sise Cam, Turkey's leading glass manufacturer. Garanti Bankasi, part of the Dogus industrial conglomerate, also holds stakes in group companies. Iktisat Bankasi, a highly-regarded medium-sized bank, has holdings in television, newspapers and manufacturing companies. Akbank is a minority partner in Sabanci group joint ventures with multinationals such as Toyota, Philip Morris and Ladbroke's. It has a leasing company with BNP and Dresdner Bank. These holdings are usually booked at cost, not market, values. Mr Sabanci argues that these under-valued equity stakes represent strong hidden reserves. He says that although Akbank's equity holdings are booked at Dollars 80m, their market value is now about Dollars 800m. But analysts complain that banks receive insufficient dividends on these holdings. Akbank's 1993 gains from participations and investments was just Dollars 19.5m. But Mr Sabanci says the capital value of these equity stakes is growing. Furthermore, ownership of banks such as Akbank or Garanti lies with holding companies that also own big industrial companies. Problems on the industrial side could weaken the banking arm and vice versa. Analysts complain that, while small banks play too fast and loose, big ones play it too safe. Akbank, they say, should boost profits by being less risk-averse. Garanti has been slow to develop retail products like consumer finance, credit cards and unit trusts. Garanti aims to grow by targeting smaller, more profitable, upscale segments. Its share of Visa and American Express credit-card operations, for instance, is bigger than its share of credit cards in circulation. Some cassandras say banks are less profitable than they seem. Mr Selcuk Abac, chairman of Istanbul's IBAR bank rating agency, says inflation overstates profits and is corroding the system's capital base. He says banks 'absolutely need to raise profits and productivity', both to adjust for the risky operating environment and to rebuild capital. Whatever the private banking system's shortcomings, they are nothing compared with the problems of the state-owned banks. Ms Arzu Turksoy, an analyst at Global Securities, an Istanbul brokerage, says: 'State banks make inefficient use of their huge assets and have very poor management. Profit is never considered the first variable. They do not operate as banks. They make symbolic returns from state sector.' Their accounts are not audited to international standards. They do not provision for loans to state enterprises and co-operatives, many of which should be classified as non-performing. Even so, nearly all the state banks still perform dreadfully. The four largest last year raised assets by 4.5 per cent, but net income fell 6 per cent in dollar terms. In comparison, the six biggest private banks raised assets 10 per cent and net income 41 per cent. The state banks' size and inefficiency distorts the banking system, raising costs for private borrowers. Not everyone complains, though. Mr Erol Aksoy, Iktisat's owner, says bluntly: 'Spreads are so nice because of the state banks. With a bit of luck and good management you can make a killing.' The private banks' fortunes should revive in 1995 if, as expected, the economy bounces back. However, small banks are perceived as risky and will probably continue losing depositors to bigger, safer competitors. The large banks with their lower costs will be the best-positioned to benefit from recovery. That said, the day will come when the state will stop lining the pockets of Turkey's bankers. In other high-inflation countries, stabilisation brings a big drop in income and a painful transition period as bankers hit the slow lane of corporate finance and consumer lending.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- TURKEY'S TOP BANKS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                  Assets (Dollars bn)           Net income (Dollars m)               1993      1992   Change %      1993      1992   Change %  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Ziraat*      12.29     11.68          5     741.2     747.4         -1 Emlabank*     6.40      6.11          5      64.2      44.3         45 Is Bank       5.46      5.29          3     219.0     121.6         80 Yapi          4.86      4.01         21      85.4      73.5         16 Akbank        3.92      3.67          7     238.4     179.6         33 Halk*         3.74      3.28         14      22.4      45.0        -50 Vakif*        3.13      3.36         -7       9.0      55.7        -84 Pamuk         2.96      2.89          3      35.9      38.1         -6 Garanti       2.65      2.40         11     207.6     146.1         42 Turkbank      2.04      1.63         25      19.8      13.5         46 Total:       47.44     44.33          7   1,643.0   1,464.8         12  --------------------------------------------------------------------- * State banks                     Source: bank annual reports and IBAR  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 19 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese  Government has set a target of keeping its total acreage of  cultivated land at over 1.83 billion mu (120 million ha) at the  end of this century.    To meet this target China has to bring down its average  annual loss of farmland below 2.5 million mu in the remaining  seven years of the century, according to a senior official with  the State Land Administration.    In an interview with XINHUA today the official said that  China has seen a sharp reduction of cultivated land in recent  years, due to the overheated boom in real estate development and  economic zones.    According to an estimate, China's cultivated land accounts  for 13.2 percent of the country's total land area. The per  capita land area under cultivation stands at 1.8 mu, or 41  percent of the world's average per capita figure.    The official noted that China has had a net loss of four  million mu of cultivated land annually since 1991.    However, thanks to vigorous measures taken by the  government,  particularly after the nationwide delimitation of the protection  areas for farmland in 1993 in line with the state's agriculture  law, China has made headway in checking the loss of cultivated  land.    According to incomplete statistics, 27 of the mainland's 30  administrative divisions have started delimitation of protected  areas under cultivation.    In the pace-setting provinces of Zhejiang, Hubei and Hebei  the farmland acreage under protection accounts for 96 percent,  60 percent and 62 percent, respectively, of their total  cultivated land areas.    Within the protection areas no encroachment of any kind is  allowed except with special permission, said the official.    As a result, random occupation and exploitation of  cultivated  land has been effectively curbed, he added.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan: </F> On Revisions and Addenda to the Program of Targeted Social  Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tatarstan"]    [Text] For the improvement and development of the Program  of Targeted Social Protection of the Population of the Republic  of Tatarstan the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan  resolves:    1. To make the following revisions and addenda to the  Program  of Targeted Social Protection of the Population of the Republic  of Tatarstan approved by the decree of the Supreme Soviet of the  Republic of Tatarstan of 23 March 1993:    to make the preamble to the Program read as follows:    "The Program of Targeted Social Protection of the Population  of the Republic of Tatarstan was drawn up in accordance with  Decree 1552-XII of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of  Tatarstan of 9 July 1992 'On Progress of Fulfillment of the  Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan of 19  April 1991 "On Measures for Social Protection of the Population  of the Republic of Tatarstan."' It is an integral part of the  socioeconomic policy being pursued by the Government and the  Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan.    "Social protection of the population of the Republic of  Tatarstan provides for a sum total of legislatively enshrined  legal, economic, and social safeguards ensuring observance of  the most important social rights and the creation of the  conditions for the achievement of a socially acceptable living  standard of the populace. It incorporates the realization of  state social safeguards (minimum wage and minimum pensions,  grants, and other social payments), the preservation of current  and the creation of new jobs, support for enterprise, targeted  social support of the urban and rural population and other  sociodemographic groups, the pursuit of an effective  financial-credit and tax policy, the structural reorganization  of the economic system, and the creation of market mechanisms.    "The socioeconomic situation in the republic in the first  half of 1994 has been characterized by a continuing decline in  output in industry, a nonpayments crisis, an ineffective  financial-credit and tax policy, and the lagging of the rate of  growth of personal income behind the requisite level.    "A trend toward a relative decline in the rate of growth of  personal income has been observed since the start of the current  year.    "Average wages in the Republic of Tatarstan in December 1993  constituted R128,100, in April 1994, R142,700 (in the Russian  Federation R141,200 and R171,500 respectively).    "Per capita income in December 1993 constituted R81,700, in  April 1994, R90,200 (R84,000 and R124,000 respectively in the  Russian Federation). The living standard assessed as the ratio  of per capita income to the value of the subsistence minimum  showed a tendency to increase in 1993, but it declined in the  first quarter of 1994. The main reason for the decline in  society's living standard is the insufficient growth of personal  income.    "The proportion of the population with income no lower than  the subsistence level constitutes 11.2 percent, and above the  subsistence level, but below the minimum consumer budget, 56  percent, and 4.3 percent of the population is in the category of  people with a high and very high income.    "As of the start of realization of the Program of Targeted  Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tatarstan  the numbers of the populace in receipt of compensation payments  constituted 57.6 percent, in March 1994, some 5.8 percent.    "In connection with the fact that the subsistence level  determines the minimum permissible level of man's material  security and characterizes the poverty line, it cannot be a  reference point in the socioeconomic policy of the republic, it  may be merely a stopping device. The need for the establishment  of such a reference point is now urgent. The indicator of the  minimum consumer budget should be such";    that the section "Stage I of the Program of Targeted Social  Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tatarstan"  should read as follows:    "Stage I of the Program of Targeted Social Protection of the  Population of the Republic of Tatarstan.    "The Program of Targeted Social Protection of the Population  of the Republic of Tatarstan is based on the following  principles of active social policy:    "the principle of a rise in the living standard of the  population of the Republic of Tatarstan;    "the principle of equality in the social support of the  urban  and rural population;    "the principle of the employer's compulsory fulfillment of  the guarantees of an employee wage level not less than the  minimum consumer budget;    "the principle of the targeted nature and anticipation of  assistance for inhabitants entitled to it;    "the principle of the comprehensiveness of assistance  providing for the possibility of the allocation simultaneously  of several types of assistance (monetary, in-kind, in the form  of services or privileges);    "the principle of the independence of the local authorities,  enterprises, and organizations in the rendering of social  assistance to the public;    "the principle of a social response on the part of the  government to a change in the living standard of the population  of the republic.    "The following are envisaged for realization of the Program  of Targeted Social Protection of the Population:    "the establishment as social norms determining the living  standard of the rural and urban population and various  sociodemographic groups of an average aggregate income per  family member, including income from subsistence farming, and  values of the subsistence level and the minimum consumer budget;    "a state guarantee assuring the employee a wage not less  than  the minimum consumer budget;    "a state guarantee assuring a level of income of families  with children up to the age of 16 (for trainees of general  educational institutions, up to the completion of their tuition  and employment, but for no longer than two months following  graduation from educational institutions) and of pregnant women  as of 20 weeks of pregnancy in accordance with the minimum  consumer budget, but not less than the subsistence level of  these categories;    "a state guarantee assuring a level of income not less than  the subsistence level for:    "nonworking recipients of all types of pensions, depending  on  the amount of the pension, with regard to the extra payments,  increases, and sums of compensation established by current  legislation;    "students and trainees studying with time off from work in  general institutions of higher, secondary, and elementary  vocational training;    "graduate students undergoing tuition with time off from  work  in a graduate studentship at general institutions of higher  vocational training and research institutions.    "mothers on postnatal leave caring for a child until it has  reached the age of three and nonworking women raising a child up  to the age of three (or other relatives actually caring for the  child);    "nonworking able-bodied persons caring for a handicapped  child up to the age of 16 and raising three and more children up  to the age of 16 (for trainees not in receipt of a grant, up to  the age of 18);    "nonworking able-bodied persons caring for a Group I invalid  and elderly persons who are in need of outside care (according  to the findings of a medical institution) or who have reached  the age of 80; and    "citizens deemed in the established procedure to be  unemployed and also citizens undergoing, as assigned by the  employment office, vocational training and retraining and skills  improvement and in receipt of unemployment benefit (a grant);    "provision of children up to the age of two with special  dairy foods and blends per doctors' prescriptions free,  regardless of the family's per capita aggregate income;    "a health-improvement schedule for handicapped children,  orphaned children and children under guardianship (in care), and  children from families in which one parent or both are Group I  and II invalids on free passes to sanatoriums, health and  fitness centers, recreation centers, and children's  health-improvement camps in accordance with medical evidence  with 100 percent compensation of the cost of their travel by  urban mass transit and river and rail transport and 50 percent  of the cost of travel of the persons accompanying them to the  locations of the health-improvement establishments from the  resources of the republic budget of the Republic of Tatarstan;    "a gradual transition from the subsidizing of agricultural  products and the services of passenger transport and housing and  public utilities and enterprises supplying the public with fuel  to targeted social support with regard to the social norms  established in the subsistence level, for which the phased  alignment in the course of 1994-1995 of the cost of foodstuffs  and the amounts of the payment for municipal services and  housing, fuel, and passenger transport (other than air, river,  and railroad) with their actual cost is contemplated;    "an improvement in the mechanism of the allocation of  targeted public assistance and the structure of administration  of questions of social protection. For the comprehensive  realization of the social protection of the populace the  creation of city and district social protection centers  coordinating the social security, social protection, and labor  and employment authorities, territorial information centers, and  other off-budget funds (branches of the Retirement Fund of the  Russian Federation for the Republic of Tatarstan, the Employment  Fund of the Republic of Tatarstan, the Tatar Regional  Intersectoral Branch of the Social Insurance Fund of the Russian  Federation, hospital funds, and public social support funds) and  their provision with personnel;    "the introduction of supervision of observance of the  interests of tenants (regardless of the forms of ownership of  the accommodations they use) in the rendering of housing and  municipal services;    "the formation of republic, city, and district data banks  pertaining to the social protection of the population and the  creation of territorial information centers in cities and  districts in interaction with the tax authorities of the  republic;    "the systematization of privileges for veterans and the  handicapped and their enshrinement in legislation of the  Republic of Tatarstan;    "an improvement in the system of the taxation of public  organizations of veterans and the handicapped and their  enterprises and also the republic and local funds for the  targeted social support of the population and their enshrinement  in legislation of the Republic of Tatarstan.    "Targeted social support provides for the allocation to  needy  inhabitants of the republic of sums of compensation (in monetary  form or by check) and/or in-kind support in the form of basic  necessities and services.    "Sums of compensation are paid to needy groups of society at  enterprises and in organizations and at social protection  (social security) authorities of cities and districts. The  procedure of the payment of compensation is established by the  Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Tatarstan.    "The Program of Targeted Social Protection of the Population  of the Republic of Tatarstan is financed from resources of the  funds for social support of the populace [line missing] Social  Support of the Population of the Republic of Tatarstan and  subsidies from the republic and local budgets and also  off-budget funds (branches of the Retirement Fund of the Russian  Federation for the Republic of Tatarstan, the Employment Fund of  the Republic of Tatarstan and the Tatar Regional Intersectoral  branch of the Social Insurance Fund of the Russian Federation,  and so forth), and other sources as they so decide.    "The executive authorities of cities and districts may in  individual cases decide questions of an increase in the amount  of compensation for the inhabitants, for meals for trainees and  students included, from the resources of local budgets and  social support funds and also render the needy supplementary  social assistance.    "Enterprises, organizations, and institutions, regardless of  forms of ownership, may render their employees and their  families social support (early pensionable retirement, pension,  benefit, and meal supplements, and supplementary privileges and  benefits) from their own funds.    "In the event of the infringement of the rights of the  citizens in the allocation of sums of compensation and other  types of social protection that have occasioned the nonreceipt  or the receipt in less than the due amount of monetary or  in-kind support and the nonallocation or allocation to less than  the full extent of due services and privileges, the citizens may  lodge an appeal against the actions of officials and social  protection (social security) authorities with the local  administration or the state authorities or in legal form.

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Play Ball] means several things in Seattle: The final innings of a game affecting US-Japanese relations ON THE southern edge of central Seattle, the pre-eminent city of the US Northwest, stands an ugly, concrete-domed sports stadium, with all the visual charm of a deflating souffle. The Kingdome, as unlikely as it may seem, has become the microcosm of America's tussle between Japan-bashing xenophobia and a cosmopolitan view of the world. The stadium is home to the Seattle Mariners baseball team, and the ruling authorities of the US national sport must decide whether to approve a controversial plan by a Japanese-backed group of local businessmen to buy the team. The saga not only illustrates the remarkably strong ties that bind Seattle with Japan, it also highlights the chauvinistic tendencies of the men who own America's top baseball teams, and, since the game is a defining element of US popular culture, says something about the isolationist tendencies of the nation as a whole. The Mariners, one of the least successful teams in the major leagues, were put up for sale in December by their owner, Mr Jeff Smulyan, a businessman in the broadcasting industry who needed to repay a large bank loan. He gave the city until today to come up with a new local owner or see the franchise move elsewhere. A group calling itself the Baseball Club of Seattle duly bid Dollars 100m (Pounds 57.8m) and said it would plough a further Dollars 25m into improving the team. The group included a clutch of local worthies, such as Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman of aircraft manufacturer Boeing, but 60 per cent of it was owned by Japan's Yamauchi family, founders of the Nintendo video-game company. Nintendo - whose US headquarters in Seattle oversees 80 per cent of the American video-games market - became involved after being approached by Mr Slade Gorton, a US senator representing Washington state. The family's stake in the team would be managed by Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa, son-in-law of the company's founder. But the Yamauchis, to counter US fears of Japanese domination, agreed to stringent policy controls by the minority owners. However, none of this cut much ice with Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent, nor with other team-owners, who have to approve the sale. Mr Vincent noted baseball's tradition of not approving investors from outside the US and Canada; owners cited local ownership. The bid also provided a fresh target for US resentment of Japan, since it followed numerous Japanese acquisitions of such well-known US institutions as New York's Rockefeller Center and California's Pebble Beach golf course. Seattleites argued that their bid would put the Mariners under local interests for the first time. Mr Arakawa might be Japanese but he had lived in the city for 15 years. This was more than could be said of Mr Smulyan, who hailed from Indiana, or the previous Californian owners. US newspapers weighed in on Seattle's side. One accused the authorities of acting like a 'snobbish country club' and argued that involvement by the Japanese, who have their own popular baseball leagues, could enrich the game and make it more appealing internationally. Club owners may well have felt that deep-pocketed foreigners would simply push up the already steep cost of hiring the best talent. Negotiations dragged on and on, but there now are some indications that a compromise can be struck. This could involve the authorities' accepting a deal in return for cosmetic changes to reduce the Nintento stake to around 50 per cent. Such an outcome would represent a triumph for Seattle and its long tradition of links with Asia, especially Japan. Sen Gorton said of the bid: 'The Pacific Northwest looks outward. This is a partnership made in heaven for the Pacific Northwest.' The region's ties with Japan began to flourish a hundred years ago, with the export of northwestern timber, agricultural products and minerals, and Japan today remains Washington state's largest single trading partner, accounting for some Dollars 5.5bn, or 22 per cent, of the state's exports in 1990. The adjacent ports of Seattle and Tacoma, comprising one of the largest shipping complexes on the west coast, are big importers of Japanese goods, while the region's Sea-Tac airport is becoming an increasingly important hub for Asian flights for flights to and from the Far East. With trade came people. More than 11 per cent of Seattle's population is of Asian origin, mostly from Japan, China and the Philippines. There are 34,000 people of Japanese origin in Washington state, mostly Japanese-Americans whose parents or grandparents had been interned by the US during the Second World War. The state's Japanese population ranks jointly with New York as the third largest in the US, after California and Hawaii. Cultural ties are strong: Seattle's new art gallery boasts one of the best Japanese collections in the US, while Washington state has the highest number of high schools offering Japanese language studies. You can buy a plate of Japanese noodles from a stand at Sea-Tac airport or take part in a cherry blossom festival in suburban Bellevue. Morevoer, the Mariners row could prove yet another opportunity, whatever the baseball authorities decide: recent developments could eventually translate into greater Japanese interest in the area. Mr Bill Stafford, executive director of the Trade Development Alliance of Greater Seattle, says businessmen returning from Japan report many compliments on 'Seattle's sensitive appreciation of the complexity of US-Japanese relations'.</p>

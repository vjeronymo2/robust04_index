			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARGAIN CORNER: COUPONS DISCOUNT SOUTH PACIFIC HOTELS  </P> <P> If you happen to be traveling to the South Pacific, look into the possibility  of using coupons offered at 45 hotels through the Southern Pacific Hotel Corp.  The coupons can be used at properties in Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti and  Fiji.  </P> <P> You have to buy a minimum of 12 coupons at a cost of $40 per coupon. Two to  four coupons are required for a one-night stay, except in Tahiti, where five to  seven coupons may be needed, depending on whether you have a regular or  above-the-water room.  </P> <P> And the number of coupons needed may be higher during the high season, which  lasts until the end of April.  </P> <P> An SPHC spokeswoman estimated that by using the coupons, travelers can expect  to receive discounts ranging from 15% to 30% during the high season, and 15% to  20% in the off-season, May through September.  </P> <P> Hotels take part in the program on a space-available basis, so it's possible  that the coupons may not always be usable in heavily booked periods. Check in  advance.  </P> <P> The coupons have to be purchased in the United States. They're valid for all of  1990 and don't have to be used on consecutive nights. Room reservations can be  made either before departure or overseas. It's always a good idea to book your  first night abroad before leaving the United States.  </P> <P> When traveling, reservations may be made for you at no extra charge for either  the same country or in another country. For example, one property can process  your reservation at the next property within Australia, as well as in New  Zealand, Fiji or Tahiti.  </P> <P> Cities with participating hotels include Sydney, Melbourne, Cairns, Canberra,  Brisbane, Darwin and Alice Springs in Australia; Auckland, Rotorua, Wellington,  Christchurch and Queenstown in New Zealand; Suva and Nadi in Fiji, and Papeete,  Tahiti.  </P> <P> Children 18 or younger can stay free when sharing a room with an adult.  </P> <P> No refunds are offered if you don't use all of the minimum of 12 coupons. But  if you buy more than 12, you can get a refund for any extra unused ones, less a  handling fee of $10 per order.  </P> <P> Contact travel agents or Southern Pacific Hotel Corp. either toll-free at (800)  252-2155 or at (213) 557-2424.

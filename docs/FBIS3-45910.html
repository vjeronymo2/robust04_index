			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] China has complained to the Hong Kong Government  about the screening in the territory of the controversial BBC  documentary on Mao Zedong. Although Chinese officials at first  kept silent about the showing of the film by pro-democracy  activist Lau Shan- ching at a public meeting, it is understood  the local branch of XINHUA (the New China News Agency) recently  lodged a formal complaint with the Government.    Mr Lau was last week given permission by the Television and  Entertainment Licensing Authority (TELA) to show the film as  often as he wished. The authority said it had no reason to  refuse Mr Lau's request because other distributors had had  similar requests granted under normal circumstances. TELA is  allowed to ban any film which is likely to damage friendly  relations with other countries.    News of China's objection came as the Foreign  Correspondents'  Club (FCC) screened the Mao documentary yesterday. Xinhua  officials last week asked the FCC not to show the film, Chairman  Mao: The Last Emperor. They said it had "hurt the feelings of  the Chinese people". But as the showing got under way, club  president Philip Bowring said: "There's not a great deal they  can do."    The crowded screening at the club's headquarters in Central  also drew interest from the Urban Council and TELA, though  neither had shown any interest in other films shown at the FCC  in recent years, club vice-president Carl Goldstein said. TELA  had asked the FCC to submit the film script for censorship, Mr  Goldstein said. The club had replied to TELA by post.    Private clubs must obtain TELA approval for screenings, but  FCC board members said they could not remember TELA concerning  itself with previous screenings at the club. A government  spokesman said TELA approached the FCC after newspaper reporters  asked whether it had obtained approval. Urban Council  inspectors visited the club yesterday to ensure it would not  admit the general public to the screening, Mr Goldstein said.    TVB last year bought the rights to show the Mao film but has  so far declined to screen it. Mr Lau, jailed in China for 10  years for "counterrevolutionary" crimes, has shown the film  twice. He has said he will keep screening it until TVB agrees  to do so. The activist is to meet TVB representatives this week  to seek an explanation as to why it had exercised "censorship".</p>

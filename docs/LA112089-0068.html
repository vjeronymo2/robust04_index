			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SECONDARY ANSWERS THE CRITICS;  </P> <P> RAMS: DEFENSIVE BACKS ARE IMPRESSIVE AGAINST THE CARDINALS' TRIO OF  QUARTERBACKS, PICKING OFF FOUR PASSES.  </P> <P> OK, so the Phoenix quarterbacks were a less-than-illustrious trio: the  journeyman, the punter and the rookie.  </P> <P> So Gary Hogeboom has thrown just 45 touchdown passes and 55 interceptions in  his 10 1/2 pro seasons. Sure, Tom Tupa was better known as the nation's best  punter than for his quarterbacking skills as a senior at Ohio State in 1987.  And, yeah, rookie Timm Rosenbach had never thrown a pass in the National  Football League before Sunday.  </P> <P> But don't ask the Ram secondary to throw back any of the four passes they  intercepted Sunday during their 37-14 victory over the Cardinals.  </P> <P> Not even Hogeboom's high lob that cornerback Jerry Gray collected when Hogeboom  and receiver Ernie Jones got their signals crossed early in the second quarter.  Jones went one way and the ball came down to Gray, who was the only one within  15 yards of the ball. You almost thought he was going to call a fair catch.  </P> <P> "I asked him if he was going to donate that one to charity," LeRoy Irvin said,  smiling. "He said, 'No.' "  </P> <P> You can excuse the Rams' defensive backfield if it isn't feeling all that  charitable these days. It has taken so much heat for the Rams' defensive woes  of late, Sunday's game was like a cool breeze. Forget the Santa Ana winds and  the 90-degree temperatures.  </P> <P> The Rams rank 27th in the league in pass defense, bouncing out of dead last to  pass the New York Jets last week. And even when the defense shined in a 31-10  victory over the Giants last week, Ram Coach John Robinson said he was  "disturbed" by the play of his secondary.  </P> <P> But this Sunday, Robinson found himself praising his much-maligned defensive  backfield . . . for a few seconds, anyway.  </P> <P> "We're playing more aggressive ball in the secondary," Robinson allowed. "We're  finishing plays better. But it's a week-to-week thing.  </P> <P> "We've been bloodied and we're not pretending that we don't have some big  wounds and black eyes. And a lot of interceptions are erratically thrown  balls."  </P> <P> The Rams' Big Four Sunday pretty much fell into that category:  </P> <P>  -- Hogeboom overthrew Jones on the third play of the game and hit safety  Michael Stewart right in the numbers. Stewart sprinted down the sidelines into  the end zone and the Rams grabbed a quick 7-0 lead.  </P> <P>  -- Early in the second quarter, the Rams blitzed, Jones didn't react as  Hogeboom predicted and the Phoenix quarterback sent up the flare that Gray  settled under before returning it 10 yards. Two plays later, Bobby Delpino went  32 yards to put the Rams up, 21-0.  </P> <P>  -- Gray intercepted his second pass late in the third quarter when Tupa hit  Roy Green in the hands but the ball popped up and into Gray's arms. The Rams  drove to the Cardinal 23-yard line and Mike Lansford kicked a 40-yard field  goal that gave the Rams a 30-7 advantage.  </P> <P>  -- And even Clifford Hicks, who was replacing the injured Irvin at right  cornerback, got into the act when he stepped in front of Don Holmes to pick off  a Rosenbach pass in the end zone with less than two minutes left to play.  </P> <P> "Tom Tupa, Hogeboom, Rosenbach, yeah, but, you know what? They were the  quarterbacks," linebacker Mel Owens said. "I don't care who they put out there,  that's who you've got to play. You can't get Johnny Unitas every day."  </P> <P> The Rams are grateful for that. In the past month or so, they have helped  elevate a few quarterbacks to Hall-of-Fame performances . . . for one game,  anyway.  </P> <P> And nobody felt more responsible for the secondary's problems than Gray.  </P> <P> He dropped two possible interceptions during the heartbreaking loss in Buffalo.  One he felt he should have returned for a touchdown. The other miss came late  in the fourth quarter and would have saved the Rams from the embarrassment of  wilting in overtime.  </P> <P> Then, in Minnesota two weeks ago, he dropped another easy interception that  appeared to be a sure touchdown and the Rams lost, 23-21.  </P> <P> "Today, they came my way and I made the plays," Gray said. "In Buffalo, I had  two chances and didn't make the plays. In Minnesota, I should've had that one  and I didn't. During that slump, it just seemed like we were one step away from  making the big plays.  </P> <P> "I think this is one of the best games I've ever played as a Ram. We were  dominating today. And all these interceptions are kind of contagious, too."  </P> <P> Gray also was quick to point out that the Rams' pass rush played a big role.  Phoenix quarterbacks were sacked four times and chased out of the pocket all  afternoon.  </P> <P> "Pass coverage and pass rush go hand in hand," he said. "If you make the  quarterback run, he's gonna throw the ball out of desperation."  </P> <P> The Ram defensive backs can relate to that feeling. The secondary was supposed  to be a strength in the preseason and soon they had become designated whipping  boys. Coming into Sunday's game, Phoenix safety Tim McDonald had as many  interceptions as all the Ram defensive backs combined.  </P> <P> So they picked off some dying quails Sunday. It's better than going hunting and  coming home with an empty bag again.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> PUTTING A NEW SPIN ON VENTILATING THE ATTIC;  </P> <P> TURBINES: THEY LOOK LIKE CHEF'S HATS, BUT THEY ARE EFFECTIVE IN COOLING THE  HOUSE WITHOUT RUNNING UP ENERGY BILLS.  </P> <P> We have all seen them, those strange looking "chef's hats" spinning on the  roofs of all kinds of buildings. What are they you may have wondered?  </P> <P> They are called wind-driven turbine ventilators and are, perhaps, one of the  best investments for home comfort and energy savings you can make if you have  an attic.  </P> <P> "Wind-driven turbine ventilators can substantially reduce home cooling costs by  decreasing a home's attic temperature without using household energy,"  according to Builders Emporium's answer man Pop Larson.  </P> <P> Here is how they work:  </P> <P> On a hot day, a normally vented attic (one that has eave and gable vents  installed as per building code requirements) can be anywhere from 15 to 40  degrees hotter than the outside temperature.  </P> <P> This heat is transmitted to the living space through the ceiling, resulting in  an inside temperature of the home often greater than the temperature outside.  Also, the excess attic heat can keep the house hot even after the sun goes  down.  </P> <P> Naturally, this makes your air conditioner work harder than necessary, costing  you money.  </P> <P> Since heat rises, the turbine ventilators are installed near the high point of  the attic to allow the hottest air to escape and create a flow of cool air  through the existing vents up through the turbine.  </P> <P> The turbines are made of lightweight aluminum and fit over a hole cut in the  roof. They are built with lifetime lubricated bearings that allow them to  silently spin in the slightest breeze, and as they do, they "draw" the air out  of the attic without hookup to any household energy source. It's essentially  free cooling.  </P> <P> They are designed to deflect even the heaviest rainfall from entering the attic  even if they are not turning, and their smooth metal surfaces and closely  spaced openings keep rodents from entering.  </P> <P> The only caveat to satisfactory use of the turbines is proper eave and/or gable  venting.  </P> <P> Since the turbines allow a flow of air through existing vents, you must make  sure that your house has a substantial number of screened vents (roughly 4-x-16  inches) under the eaves or large vents at the gable ends before considering  installing turbines.  </P> <P> Although it is difficult to quantify the level of energy savings or attic  temperature reduction from one house to another, it is safe to say that most  any attic will be cooler.  </P> <P> For example, I have a turbine ventilator on my own home and I did an experiment  recently in which I measured the attic temperature on a hot day and found it to  be 95 degrees.  </P> <P> I covered the turbine with a trash bag and checked the temperature 30 minutes  later and found it to be 110 degrees.  </P> <P> Determining the number of turbines needed in your home is a function of the  attic square footage. Most manufacturers recommend one 14-inch vent for each  1,000 square feet of attic.  </P> <P> One common question asked about the turbines is "Will my house be colder in the  winter with the turbines in place?"  </P> <P> Many hardware stores sell turbine covers designed to keep heat in during the  winter. However, the turbine manufacturers recommend against covering them  because of the risk of damage to the bearing or frame.  </P> <P> They point out that in a properly insulated home the heat lost through the  turbine(s) will be negligible. Also, the added ventilation in winter helps  reduce wood damaging condensation in the attic, the benefit of which greatly  overshadows any small heating cost increase.  </P> <P> The one downside to the turbines is that they do not add to the appearance of  the roof. Therefore, it is important to place them where they will not be seen  from the street, if possible.  </P> <P> My own turbine is set on the back-yard side of the roof ridgeline, about a foot  from the roof's high point so the top of the turbine is not seen from the front  of the house. It is painted (as any turbine can be) to match the color of the  roof to help camouflage it.  </P> <P> The turbines are available in two sizes, 12 and 14 inches, although I usually  recommend only the 14-inch size.  </P> <P> Most brands sell for under $50 at major hardware stores and home centers.  </P> <P> Although it is easiest to install the turbines on a flat, asphalt-shingle or  wood-shake roof, they can go on any type of roof provided there is an attic  below. Most retailers can recommend individuals or service companies that can  handle the job.  </P></p>

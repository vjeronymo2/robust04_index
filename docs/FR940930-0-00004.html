			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After examining all available information related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the incidents above, the FAA published a proposal in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57760)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain Beech 35 series airplanes . The document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed to supersede AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a new AD that would maintain the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each of the current AD's, and would require rebalancing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ruddervators (off the airplane) anytime the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ruddervator is repaired or repainted (even if stripes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are added). The document does not propose any new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> speed restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons were afforded an opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in the making of this amendment. Several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments were received on the proposed rule. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments reference inadvertent mistakes made by the FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in drafting the proposed rule and request additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time to comment on the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to allow the public additional time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on the proposed rule, the FAA reissued this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document as a supplemental NPRM that corrected the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadvertent mistakes, and published it in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 6, 1994 (59 FR 16151).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due consideration has been given to the two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments received on the supplemental NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Beech Aircraft Corporation states that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to Beech Kit No. 35&hyph;4016&hyph;9 is referenced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorrectly as Beech Kit No. 39&hyph;4016&hyph;9 in paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)(3) of the proposed AD. The FAA concurs and has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changed the AD accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other commenter recommends deleting Figure 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Method No. 2) because of the expense and effort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to accomplish the tasks presented. The FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concurs that Method No. 2 is expensive to accomplish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that the complete weighing procedure is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished more accurately using the other two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods. Method No. 2 of the AD has been deleted, thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changing the proposed Method No. 3 to Method No. 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review, including the comments noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public interest require the adoption of the rule as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in the supplemental NPRM except for changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referenced above and minor editorial corrections. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA has determined that these minor changes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> add any additional burden upon the public than was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 10,200 airplanes in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take approximately 40 workhours per airplane to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish the required action, and that the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators is estimated to be $27,540,000. This figure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is based on the assumption that no affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner/operator has accomplished the required action,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and does not reflect repetitive inspections. The FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has no way of determining how many repetitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections a particular owner/operator may incur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both are superseded by this action, require the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions as specified by this AD. With the idea that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all affected owners/operators are in compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the superseded AD's referenced above, this AD does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impose any initial cost impact over what is already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial direct effects on the States, on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship between the national government and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, or on the distribution of power and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities among the various levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not have a significant economic impact, positive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or negative, on a substantial number of small entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Incorporation by reference, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

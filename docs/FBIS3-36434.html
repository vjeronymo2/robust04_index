The delegation, led by Peter Voeller, is  providing the republic with technical assistance for the  implementation of socioeconomic reforms.    The delegation was received by Askar Akayev, the president  of  the Kyrgyz Republic.    IMF representatives expressed serious concern over the way  reforms were being implemented. It was noted that due to a  sharp reduction in tax revenues, a most complex situation had  taken shape regarding the formation of the income part of the  budget, which cast doubt on the government's ability in the near  future to continue paying salaries to teachers, doctors, and  other employees paid from the budget.    Akayev thanked members of the delegation for the work they  had carried out, pointing out that he shared their concern and  expressed his opinion about the issues discussed.    As a result of a dialogue that took place, a certain  compromise was reached. It envisages a lower inflation rate,  which Kyrgyzstan should achieve by reducing the budget deficit,  a stricter credit and monetary policy, and a harsher financial  discipline. If these conditions are met, the IMF will be ready  to consider a program of further financial assistance on  preferential terms.</p>

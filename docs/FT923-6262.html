			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Darby dives to Pounds 285,000 With no improvement in trading conditions through the second six months, Darby Group, a USM-quoted maker of specialist glass products, suffered a fall in profits from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 285,000 pre-tax for the year to February 28. Earnings declined to 2.51p (9.31p) and a reduced final dividend of 0.8p (2.1p) cuts the total by 1.3p to 2p. Certain expenses deferred at the half way stage associated with Darby (France) were not considered appropriate, given continued difficulties in the French market, and were charged against profits for the full year. Directors said the charge was the main reason that full year profits were lower than the Pounds 406,000 announced at mid-year. Helped by acquisitions, sales for 1991-92 rose from Pounds 15.12m to Pounds 17.87m. Interest charges accounted for Pounds 797,000 (Pounds 249,000).</p>

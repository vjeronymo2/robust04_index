			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, this afternoon talked to Yasushi  Akashi, the UN secretary general's special envoy for the area of  the former Yugoslavia. The talks were also attended by member  of the Presidency Ejup Ganic and Army General Rasim Delic.  Coming up is Nedzad Leko's report.    [Leko] Following today's talks, it was Yasushi Akashi who  spoke to reporters first. He expressed satisfaction with the  fact that the situation in Sarajevo had improved considerably  since his last visit on 20 February. I can see that people are  happier, more relaxed, Mr. Akashi added. As for the talks he  said:    [Begin Akashi recording in English fading to Serbo-Croatian  translation] We discussed how best to restore important public  services in Sarajevo. General Rose, in cooperation with Bosnian  Army Commander Gen. Rasim Delic, has already done a lot in that  respect. He has drawn up a list of priorities for restoring  electricity, water and gas supplies, and opening roads. We will  continue working in that direction. As you know, the UN  secretary general has been asked to send a report on this to the  Security Council in seven days. We are preparing that report,  and as far as the restoration of services in Sarajevo is  concerned, we will work closely with the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Government.    We also reviewed the military situation, which is  particularly tense in Maglaj, while the situation in other towns  such as Mostar and Vitez has improved somewhat. As you know, I  visited those towns last week and the cease-fire is holding,  although it is occasionally violated.    We also discussed the opening of Tuzla airport, where some  issues are still open. I promised UNPROFOR's [UN Protection  Forces] full cooperation in improving the situation further and  in strengthening peace, but, as you know, we need additional  forces, reinforcements.    President Izetbegovic expressed his confidence in UNPROFOR  as  a neutral and unbiased force, which acts on behalf of the whole  of the international community, and I am grateful to him for  that. [end recording]    Akashi answered several journalists' questions. Speaking  about when roads will be opened, he said that a special  committee -- which will be headed by Bosnian Presidency member  Ejup Ganic on the Bosnian side, and by Gen. Rose on the UNPROFOR  side -- will review it. They will establish specific details of  when and how, and whether all roads can be opened simultaneously.    Answering a question about the convoy for Maglaj, Akashi  could not say when the convoy would leave because UNPROFOR has  no troops deployed in the area. He stressed that UNPROFOR was  very concerned about the situation there because air-drops are  the only way to send food, but only 40 percent of food reaches  those for whom it is intended. Akashi could neither confirm nor  deny the reports on this morning's bombing of Maglaj by Serb  aircraft. He said that, since he had been travelling all day,  he had received no information about it from NATO.    Journalists wanted to know when Tuzla airport would be  opened. Akashi said:    [Begin Akashi recording in English fading to Serbo-Croatian  translation] Of course, I hope that Tuzla airport will be opened  as soon as possible. The airport is good, but it needs to be  improved, and some parts need to be repaired. We also have to  provide additional equipment. However, problems at the moment  are more of a political nature rather than technical. I would  like the airport to be opened as a result of a general  consensus, and this is why I am holding very intensive talks  with the interested parties. However, there are still certain  problems that need to be overcome. [end recording]    [Leko] The press were then addressed by Alija Izetbegovic.    [Begin Izetbegovic recording] As you can see, we discussed a  large number of issues today. It is my impression that we made  some progress on each of these issues, on some to a greater  extent, on others to a lesser extent. I believe that very soon  we are going to have a far better situation regarding power,  gas, and water supplies in Sarajevo. We also expect that these  roads in Sarajevo will open very soon. We also expect Tuzla  airport to be opened in the near future. There are some minor  difficulties that ought to be resolved. They are of a  political, not of a technical nature. Our talks today focussed  on Maglaj. We will send a letter to the Security Council this  evening again, on the basis of our talks. We also asked Mr.  Akashi and Gen. Rose to enable us to visit Srebrenica and  Gorazde. I believe that the problem of Gorazde will be solved  very soon, perhaps in a few days. We will have to wait a bit  longer for Srebrenica, but I believe that this will also be  solved successfully. [end recording]</p>

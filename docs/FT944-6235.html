			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Comment): Building the new jobs consensus - The proposed incentives for employment Mr Kenneth Clarke made much in his Budget speech of the gulf between the Conservative approach to reducing unemployment and that he ascribed to the Labour opposition. The chancellor contrasted his approach of reducing the cost for employers of taking on long-term unemployed with what he described as Labour's desire to load costs on to employers through policies such as the minimum wage and the employee rights embodied in the European Social Charter. Yet apart from those few well-rehearsed differences between the Conservatives and Labour, much of the package of measures announced to get the long-term unemployed back into work is common currency among the main political parties. 'There is a growing consensus that there is a problem in the interface between work and benefits,' said Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. 'What the government is proposing is a set of interesting measures that together will have a reasonable impact on the problem.' Mr Clarke has shown himself willing to borrow good ideas from sources that include his political opponents as well as the CBI and right-of-centre think-tanks. He has also quarried the final report of the Social Justice Commission of Sir Gordon Borrie on modernising the welfare state for a future Labour government. Not surprisingly, Labour is unhappy at what it regards as the theft of Labour's ideas published last week without the provision of the funds needed to make them effective. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said last night: 'The chancellor is deluding the public if he is claiming these measures will be enough to tackle long-term unemployment.' Still, there is clearly a growing consensus on two assumptions: that helping the long-term unemployed back into work is best done by giving employers incentives to offer jobs; and that persuading the unemployed to take work - especially in low-paid jobs - requires changes in the social security system to provide incentives to come off benefits. The first assumption is behind the rebate of national insurance contributions for employers who take on someone who has been unemployed for more than two years. For low-paid workers, this is less generous than it appears, according to Mr Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, because employers' NI contributions are not very high at the bottom of the income ladder. 'Employers' NI is less than Pounds 10 a week for employees earning up to Pounds 200 a week,' he says. 'It would probably need a further grant to make a real difference to employers' hiring decisions.' One attempt to provide such grants is the Workstart scheme, already being pioneered in four areas and now to be extended in new pilots. This pays employers Pounds 60 a week for 26 weeks if they take on someone unemployed for more than two years, with Pounds 30 a week for a further 26 weeks. Such a costly scheme is being restricted to 5,000 new jobs. The second half of the consensus job creation package is improving incentives for the unemployed to accept what job opportunities there are - even when they are low-paid or part-time. One way to achieve this is by cutting social security benefits for those out of work. Tougher rules have already been introduced for claiming invalidity benefit, which many long-term unemployed were claiming because of the higher rates of benefit. Yesterday's budget announced the end of the payment of mortgage interest for the first nine months of unemployment. 'Around 80 per cent of 30-year-olds are owner-occupiers,' says Mr Alan Marsh of the Policy Studies Institute, the independent thinktank. 'Maybe they will be prepared to take out insurance to cover the payments, but it will be a powerful incentive for the newly unemployed to find a job.' For those who are prepared to accept the work on offer, however, there are better benefits. These include help for those returning to work after a long spell of unemployment who may need to buy work clothes, tools, transport or childcare. 'The chancellor is prepared to tackle the hidden in-work costs that act as a serious disincentive to accepting jobs,' said Mr Marsh. The biggest incentive to accept low-paid work is family credit, a benefit that tops up the income of more than 500,000 low-paid employees with children. The chancellor yesterday announced a pilot to extend family credit to couples without children and single people, at a potential cost of Pounds 1.5bn a year. If the pilot is a success and the benefit is offered to everyone in low-paid work, the UK welfare state will move closer to a negative income tax system in which the state routinely tops up the income of those on low pay, and taxes those further up the income ladder. 'Oddly, the result could be to end up with more people on benefits,' said Mr Marsh, 'a surprising outcome for a Conservative government.'</p>

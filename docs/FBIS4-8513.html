The chetniks are (?advancing) from all  directions toward the defenseless people on the free territory.  Their activities are particularly fierce from the direction of  Kozara, Nekop, Ustipraca, and the Praca River valley. The  situation in the town is extremely dramatic. Women and children  are exposed to terrible suffering. There is no longer any space  for the injured in the field hospital. The chetnik hordes are  advancing mercilessly toward the town center.

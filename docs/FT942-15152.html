			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich up in delayed reaction to rate cut Better news from the US helped bourses mount a gentle recovery, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH picked up the pace as industrials took advantage of the strength of the dollar, and in a delayed reaction to Thursday's discount rate cut. The SMI index rose 29.2 to 2,872.9, little changed on the week. Analysts noted, however, that while the financial sector was firmer on the day, its lacklustre performance in the wake of the SNB's move on rates indicated that further market weakness could be in store next week. Currency considerations helped Nestle SFr15 higher to SFr1,249: the group reiterated its strategic interest in L'Oreal following the French cosmetics group's announcement on Thursday of a restructuring of its holdings. Ciba registered rose SFr15 to SFr945 ahead of Monday's first quarter sales figures, and Roche certificates by SFr40 to SFr7,080 as analysts looked for a rise of at least 20-30 per cent in 1993 earnings on Tuesday. Strong cyclicals featured Brown Boveri, up SFr30 to SFr1,287 on London buying. Oerlikon-Buhrle rose SFr7 to SFr168 and Alusuisse added SFr11 to SFr656. Against the trend, Sulzer lost SFr35 to SFr1,010 in further response to this week's profits forecast. FRANKFURT kicked effectively in the post-bourse for the first time in days, the Ibis-indicated Dax climbing to 2,211.92 after a rise of just 1.71 to 2,200.42 on the official session which left it slightly down on the week. Turnover rose from DM9.5bn to DM10.3bn. Even in the morning, Dax constituents showed more of a pattern than in recent days, with the weakness of banks on the Jurgen Schneider property situation more than balanced by strength in automotive stocks. The positive aspects of that trend were extended in the post bourse. Daimler, just DM2 higher at DM874.50 on the session, put on another DM5.50 in the afternoon and Volkswagen moved from a DM9.50 rise to DM519.50 to one of DM18, at DM528. VW had been strong against the market over the last month, quarter and 12-month period, but Goldman Sachs said it had further to go, projecting a prospective p/e of just over 7 on 1997 earnings. PARIS closed at the day's high as the market was lifted by late futures activity. The CAC-40 index put on 20.54 or 1 per cent to 2,159.59, for a week's rise of 2 per cent. Schneider was heavily sought, rising FFr23.409 or 5.4 per cent to FFr452.90, following the release of better than expected 1993 results. The electrial equipment group also raised the dividend, by 50 centimes to FFr7, and saw growth continuing throughout 1994. Saint-Louis added FFr28 to FFr1,775 on news that it was to merge its prepared food business with BSN, up FFr8 to FFr850. AMSTERDAM was particularly active as options expired during the afternoon, with the AEX index reaching a session high of 428.42 before slipping back to close up 1.43 at 425.12. The index recorded a 2.3 per cent gain on the week. Royal Dutch, up Fl4.30 on the day, and 3.3 per cent on the week at Fl207.50, was the most active issue as oil prices and stocks firmed in London on bullish expectations. Nedlloyd, due to release figures next week, added Fl1.10 to Fl74.90. Goldman Sachs noted yesterday that the shipping and distribution group had been one of the market's best performing stocks recently. Most of this outperformance, Goldman added, occured in the second half of 1993 following better-than-expected results and forecasts of a profit in 1994, which the investment bank estimated at Fl127m. MILAN gave up some of an early advance in a round of brief but heavy selling by domestic funds as the conservative alliance failed to have its nominees elected as parliamentary presidents, and Mr Silvio Berlusconi raised the spectre of fresh elections. The Comit index finished 13.20 or 1.7 per cent ahead at 800.32 for a 5.9 per cent rise on the week. Trading was again heavy as more than 180 new shares and warrants joined the screen-based trading system, bringing an end to open outcry in Milan. Blue chip industrial issues, which had led the market, saw their gains restrained. Fiat rose L42 to L6,569, after a high of L6,790, and Montedison edged L3 ahead to L1,507 after a peak of L1,558 in heavy volume of 53.9m shares. The telecommunications issues were a bright spot: Sip rose L48 to L4,961, Italcable L67 to L11,539 and Cogefar L61 to L2,616. But profits were taken in the insurers after their recent surge: Alleanza fell L296 to L18,974, Fondiaria lost L230 to L13,935 and SAI gave up L491 to L21,693. MADRID remained nervous about the appearance of Mr Mariano Rubio before congress, after hours yesterday, to answer questions about his personal financial dealings while he governed the Bank of Spain. The general index fell another 2.78 to 318.86, 2.1 per cent lower on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Apr 15                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open     10.30     11.00     12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1473.53   1473.79   1473.31   1472.37 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1487.92   1490.40   1490.45   1489.46  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00     14.00     15.00     Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1469.74   1468.86   1472.52   1471.48 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1487.85   1486.70   1491.25   1489.43  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Apr 14    Apr 13    Apr 12    Apr 11     Apr 8 FT-SE Eurotrack 100  1467.07   1476.04   1486.27   1479.07   1461.08 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1482.61   1492.35   1500.59   1489.72   1477.01  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base 1000 (26/10/90); High/day: 100 -  1474.15 ; 200 -  1492.53 Low/day: 100 -  1468.53  200 -  1485.78  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by William Cochrane, John Pitt and Michael Morgan</p>

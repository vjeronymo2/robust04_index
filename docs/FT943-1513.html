			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: US demand lifts Ricardo Strong demand from US car producers helped to lift turnover and pre-tax profits at Ricardo, the consulting engineer, for the year to June 30. The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.46m, up from Pounds 2.68m last year, which included losses on discontinued operations and property provisions. Before exceptional items, pre-tax profits last year stood at Pounds 4.11m. Turnover was Pounds 62.9m against Pounds 65.6m including Pounds 5.59m from discontinued operations. Sales were 82 per cent ahead in North America and 48 per cent in the Pacific Basin. However, a good performance by the group's consulting engineers was offset by a 26 per cent drop in turnover from its aerospace division, which now aims to refocus on the industrial gas turbine market. Sir Philip Foreman, chairman, said: 'We are pleased with these results which have been achieved despite difficult trading conditions, but reflect the strong organic growth potential of the business.' In June the company announced a rights issue of 10.5m shares to help fund the Pounds 13.6m acquisition of FF Developments, the transmission and chassis engineer. Receipts from the issue helped to reduce gearing from 15 per cent to nil. FF Developments is now charged with marketing the Ricardo Differential, which was hailed last year as a 'revolutionary' limited slip differential gear for family cars. In March, Ricardo spent Dollars 2.26m (Pounds 1.43m) acquiring Airflow Sciences Corporation. The Detroit-based company, which looks at fluid flow and heat transfer problems, is expecting strong demand from power stations which need to reduce emissions. Earnings per share amounted to 8.4p (4p). The proposed final dividend is 4p (3.8p) giving a total of 6p (5.7p).</p>

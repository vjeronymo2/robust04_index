			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WE HAVE OUR OWN TENSIONS  </P> <P> The national news is full of racial strife in New York City: One white teen was  acquitted and another found guilty in the murder of a black youth attacked by a  mob of whites. Some blacks in Brooklyn are targeting Korean-owned stores for  boycott.  </P> <P> How easy it would be for Southern Californians to feel smug that we don't live  in the middle of such a mess. And how foolish.  </P> <P> In South-Central Los Angeles, there are tensions between Korean merchants and  black community residents. Several commendable organizations have formed to  promote better cultural understanding and smash racial myths that are at the  root of ethnic tensions. The myths are many, but unfortunately the local  statistics on hate crimes are real. Reports of race-related crimes rose  dramatically last year.  </P> <P> Statistics don't reveal the unreported incidents, the everyday resentments that  keep people apart. In Los Angeles and Orange counties, the changing makeup of  the community is threatening a sort of fragile truce between blacks and  Latinos, between whites and Asians.  </P> <P> Southern Californians must not delude themselves into thinking a  Bensonhurst-type incident could not possibly happen here. Churches, synagogues,  mosques and temples must exert their moral authority to persuade the faithful  that when people are seen and known as individuals, facile group stereotyping  diminishes. And the media, so crucial in shaping public perception, must  remember its role: A local television station properly dropped its routine  description of "militant black Muslims" after an alert viewer complained. An  engaged and involved citizenry, full of determination rather than denial, can  make good the lessons of Bensonhurst.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hate Crimes  </P> <P> Hate crimes-those motivated by race, religion or sexual orientation-reached  record highs in L.A. County in 1989.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:2.22IN:2.77IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Totals for 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 267 crimes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Totals for 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 378 crimes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: L.A.

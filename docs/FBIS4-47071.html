			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under "Gorstat Reports" rubric: </F> "Results of Three Months: Crisis and Losses"]    [Text] In the first quarter of the current year,  there was no improvement in the situation with respect to  industry in the city. The decline in production remains  significant. Overall it amounted to 21.7 percent of the level of  the first quarter of last year. Eighty enterprises, 60 percent  of the total number, had a reduced volume of production.    Of the 95 kinds of output considered in the regular  reporting, the production volume increased for 21 items  (agricultural machinery, knitted and sewn goods, bed linen,  canned fruits and vegetables, groats, mixed feeds, and others)  in comparison with the analogous period in 1993, it declined for  62 items, and there was no output at all for 9 items (machine  tools, medical equipment, road signs, canned meat and  meat-vegetable products, and wine).    There was a decline in production in all basic branches with  the exception of the electrical power industry. The total volume  of production in the fuel and energy complex exceeded the level  of the first quarter of last year by 1.2 percent and amounted to  81.5 million tenge in current prices. The output of electrical  power for the city declined by 4.6 percent and the production of  thermal power fell by 3.2 percent.    In the machine building complex, the volume of production  declined by 22.4 percent relative to the corresponding period of  last year.    The largest decline in production is seen in the woodworking  branch--44 percent.    In the building materials industry, output declined by 29.8  percent in comparison with the first quarter of last year,  including by 35.7 percent for the production of prefabricated  reinforced concrete structures and products.    In the first quarter of the current year, fixed capital  amounting to 585 million tenge was put into operation, of which  41.3 percent was for production facilities. In the current year,  16 start-up facilities and capacities are under construction. In  the first quarter, 59.5 million tenge were assimilated, or 16.7  percent of the annual funding allocated from the fund for the  transformation of the economy. There was a significant decline  in the volume of conveyances with all kinds of transport.  Communications enterprises provided services to the population  amounting to 15.5 million tenge. The number of basic subscribers  increased by about 2,200 over the year and the increase in the  number of telephones installed in apartments was almost 1,800.    The economic crisis that has affected all branches of the  national economy could not fail to be reflected in the financial  results of the enterprises and organizations. In the first two  months of the current year, the city registered total losses of  217.7 million tenge. Of 629 enterprises and organizations, 94  (15 percent) suffered losses amounting to 387.7 million tenge.    Wholesale prices of industrial enterprises exceeded the  level  of the corresponding period of last year by a factor of 18.5; in  the first three months, prices increased by a factor of 2.7; in  March, they increased by a factor of 1.4 in comparison with the  preceding month.    In the first three months of the current year, the prices  for  foodstuffs increased by a factor of 2.4. For nonfood items, the  cost of paid services to the population increased by a factor of  2.2.    In the first quarter in comparison with the corresponding  period of 1993, the production of consumer goods declined by  14.7 percent, including by 15.2 percent for foodstuffs (despite  the fact that in March the total production of consumer  foodstuffs increased by 66.6 percent over February).    There was a decline in the production of almost all food  products except canned fruit and vegetables, macaroni products,  packaged natural tea, margarine, bread, and baked goods.    The volume of meat production was only 72.5 percent of the  level of the first quarter of last year, that of sausage  products was 63.1 percent, mayonnaise 46.2, whole-milk  production 86.5, confectionery 60.8, animal oil 41.7, and  semifinished meat products 64.3 percent.    The population of the city was provided with adequate  quantities only of bread, baked goods, and macaroni products.    In March, the per-capita cost of a selection of vitally  necessary food products was 323 tenge compared with 290 tenge in  Febuary.    The production of nonfood commodities declined by 19.2  percent in the first quarter in comparison with the same period  last year.    In comparison with the corresponding period of last year,  the  volume of production of knitted goods increased by 9 percent,  leather footwear by 3.9 percent, sewn goods by 24.9, bed linen  by 1.4, and leather goods by 2.1 percent. The production of  textile goods amounted to only 8.6 percent [of the level of last  year], televisions 10.9, and washing machines, 34.9 percent.    The average monthly wage in January-February increased by a  factor of 11 in comparison with the corresponding period of last  year and amounted to 446 tenge, whereas in Febuary it was 475  tenge (an increase of 26.2 percent over January).    Above average for the city was the average monthly wage for  workers in transport, communications, construction  organizations, material-technical supply, housing and municipal  services, and nonproduction kinds of domestic services for the  population. For workers in commercial activities, it amounted to  a little over 800 tenge, whereas for workers in the credit  industry and in state insurance it was more than 1,200 tenge.    Below the average for the national economy was the level of  wages for workers in public health, physical culture. social  security, and science, where it was lower by a factor of 2.3,  and scientific services, where it was one-half the level for the  national economy.    Since the beginning of the year, 2,376 persons appealed to  the employment service and jobs were found for 1,142 of them  (48.1 percent). As of 1 April of the current year, there were  144 persons officially registered as unemployed in Almaty, of  whom 115 (79.9 percent) are receiving unemployment assistance.    As we see, overall the situation in the branches of the  economy remains unsatisfactory. In the coming months, one may  more likely predict a worsening rather than a stabilization of  the situation in industry, because with the insolvency of  enterprises the increase in prices for power sources will lead  to a shutdown of many production capacities.</p>

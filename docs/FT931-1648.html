			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Life profits move News that United Friendly, the life assurance group, is examining ways of determining ownership of its life fund and methods of distributing profits from future life insurance profits triggered an upsurge in United shares and similar gains in other life stocks. Life assurance specialists said the move by United was not entirely unexpected and follows similar ones by other life companies. 'It is a positive step forward and should put pressure on other life companies,' commented the insurance team at Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker. Mr Youssef Ziai at Morgan Stanley adopted a much more cautious view: 'This could be the last piece of positive news in the sector for some time and is now fully reflected in share prices.' United shares jumped 65 to 715p, having touched a peak 725p. Britannic and Refuge, seen as likely candidates to adopt a similar approach to their life funds, rose 13 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. The latter closed 112 higher at a record 1130p and the former a massive 172 up at an all-time high of 1475p.</p>

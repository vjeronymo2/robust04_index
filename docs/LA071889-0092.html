			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. IS LOSING BILLIONS ON FORECLOSED MORTGAGES  </P> <P> The taxpayers' bill for foreclosures on federally backed mortgages for  middle-class housing has passed the $2-billion mark and is showing few signs of  leveling off as once-profitable government housing insurance funds are hit with  the full impact of the losses, according to government and housing industry  officials.  </P> <P> Housing insurance programs run by the departments of Housing and Urban  Development and Veterans Affairs have helped millions of Americans buy homes  and build or rehabilitate multi-family housing during the last half century.  </P> <P> In many cases these programs paid their own way from the fees they collected  and had enough left over to contribute to the federal Treasury.  </P> <P> Those days are over for the biggest of the programs, which are now a drain on  the Treasury. The economic slump in the South, Southwest and parts of the West  is a major contributor, but mismanagement and fraud also have played a part.  </P> <P> Housing program staffs, cut back sharply by the Reagan-era effort to contract  programs out to private companies, were unable to monitor many programs  adequately while the cost of favors for high-ranking Republicans compounded the  problems.  </P> <P> The Government National Mortgage Assn., a mortgage-financing agency known as  Ginnie Mae, is the latest to suffer. The agency's losses could eventually hit  $1 billion, and Ginnie Mae is blaming much of its problem on the Department of  Veterans Affairs' loan guaranty policies. Unless action is taken to curb the  expected VA losses, Ginnie Mae could be recording losses of $50 million to $100  million annually starting as early as next year, according to a high-ranking  Ginnie Mae official who requested anonymity.  </P> <P> The Federal Housing Administration, which provides government insurance on home  buyers' loans, is also reporting losses after 55 years of profitability. The  FHA lost $452 million in 1987 and continued to lose $40 million a month on its  single-family home insurance program during the six months ended March 31,  according to the Heritage Foundation.  </P> <P> The VA is being hit even harder. Congress has appropriated $1.7 billion since  1984 to keep the department's loan fund afloat and will have to continue  covering losses, officials said.  </P> <P> Ginnie Mae plays a pivotal role in the U.S. real estate market by raising money  for loans to home buyers and developers of rental apartments.  </P> <P> With the help of Ginnie Mae, lenders bundle together FHA- and VA-insured  mortgages and issue bonds backed, or "secured," by the mortgages and the  monthly payments they are supposed to produce. Paying the investors each month  is the responsibility of the lenders. When a homeowner defaults, the VA and FHA  are responsible for insuring the mortgage principal. But Ginnie Mae must keep  up with the monthly interest payments, at least until the property is sold.  </P></p>

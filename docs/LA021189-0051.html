			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JORDAN HAS STATISTICS TO RANK WITH THE BEST  </P> <P> In reference to a Feb. 4 letter about Michael Jordan's selection to Scott  Ostler's all-time NBA team: Who in their right mind would not name him to their  all-time team?  </P> <P> Last season alone, Jordan was league MVP, defensive player of the year, MVP of  the All-Star game, slam dunk champion and steals leader, and he also earned his  second consecutive scoring title. He is also the only player to score 50-plus  points in three consecutive playoff games.  </P> <P> But you're right, he's just a flash in the pan.  </P> <P> JEFF GREEN  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

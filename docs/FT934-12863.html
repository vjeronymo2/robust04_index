			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Big drop in wage freezes reported THE NUMBER of pay freezes has dropped sharply since the start of the year and more than two thirds of pay awards remain in the 2 per cent to 4 per cent band, says the latest pay survey from independent analysts Incomes Data Services. The Confederation of British Industry's pay databank continues to report that nearly a quarter of all manufacturing settlements are freezes. But according to IDS, of 119 private-sector deals concluded from July onwards, only five were freezes, 'a much lower number than at the start of the year'. The apparent decline in freezes and the bottoming out of pay settlements in the private sector will increase pressure on public-sector managers to offer employees some sort of pay rise next year in spite of the government's freeze on public pay bills. Average pay settlements could also start to shift upwards next month with the second stage of two-year agreements of 4 per cent at Jaguar, 3.6 per cent at Rover Group, and 3 per cent at Iveco Ford Trucks following a six-month deferral. Some of the higher rises concluded from July include 7.5 per cent (including bonus payments) for 2,500 employees at Severn Trent Water, and 5.5 per cent at Calor Gas, which was partly to compensate its 1,800 employees for moving from a non-contributory pension scheme to a contributory one.

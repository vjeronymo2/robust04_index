			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Food for Thought: Bootleggers' Beluga THE CAVIAR business has been in a black mood recently. With prices about to be quoted on the imported spring catch in the Caspian, the usual price war is going on to dump old stock before the new 'crop' arrives in the warehouses. While caviar importers undercut one another, Taste magazine has contributed to the turmoil by publishing the results of a Beluga tasting held at Christmas. It concluded that Sainsbury's pasteurised Beluga was better than all but one of the tested caviars. With no wish to pour scorn on Sainsbury's, pasteurisation for caviar is possibly even more lethal than it is for wine or cheese; it hardens the eggs, destroys the flavour and renders the caviar inert. It was not the high praise given to Sainsbury's however, which caused most grief in the Taste tasting, but the accusation that one of the caviar companies had not been selling Beluga at all, but rather cheaper Oscietre eggs. On April 22 the company in question, La Princesse d'Isenbourg, invited customers and members of the press to try their caviars and prove that there was no truth in the allegations. In the presence of Princesse d'Isenbourg (actually a German-Russian Furstin von Ysenburg from Hessen) we all gleefully tucked into some very good Beluga and Oscietre and thanked God for the internal squabbles of the caviar trade. Accusations of this sort are not new. Several importing houses have been locked in a feud over markets for some time and tempers have frayed as the markets narrow with recession. Nor is it unheard of for importers to cheat customers by packing Beluga pots with Oscietre, but those with established reputations, such as W. G. White, Grivan, Caviar Kaspia, R. E. Campbell, Caviar House and the calumnied Princesse d'Isenbourg have no interest in trying to pass off lower-priced Oscietre as Beluga and perhaps wipe out their customer base overnight. Not all the caviar on the market, however, comes from them. About 20 per cent of the eggs in restaurants come from bootleggers selling second-rate eggs packaged for the domestic Russian or Iranian markets. Restaurateurs would be wise to give bootlegged caviar a wide berth as they risk the health of their customers by serving a food which has been stored in unhygenic conditions. Nicky Kerman of Scotts in Mayfair and Overtons, the fish restaurants, says Polish sailors have become an occupational hazard for him. He says that by the law of averages an occasional tin may contain decent caviar but he buys all his supply from reputable importers. Gavin Rankin of importers Caviar Kaspia stressed the simplicity of caviar. There are three fish: Beluga, Oscietre and Sevruga of which the Beluga accounts for less than 2 per cent of the catch. They are the same fish whether caught by the Russians or the Iranians. Russian Beluga tends to be a little better than Iranian and Iranian Oscietre better than Russian. Opinions vary on the small slate grey Sevruga. Beluga occasionally comes marked 000, meaning a super-sized egg, and traditionally companies have labelled this 'royal' or 'imperial' Beluga. Oscietre is either toast/gold or dark grey/black. 'If you want a failsafe method to ensure that it really is Beluga caviar that you've bought and not Oscietre,' Rankin told me, 'all you have to do is this.' He took three grains of Oscietre caviar in a teaspoon and crushed them into his plate; the juice was golden yellow. Then taking the same number of Beluga eggs he crushed those too leaving a smear of dark grey oil on the plate: 'It works every time.'</p>

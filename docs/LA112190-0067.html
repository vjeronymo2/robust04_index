			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL IS CRITICAL OF POLICE ACTS;  </P> <P> DEMONSTRATION: COMMISSION SAYS OFFICERS' OVERZEALOUSNESS LED TO VIOLENCE IN  JANITORS' PROTEST MARCH.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Commission on Tuesday concluded that a protest by  striking janitors last summer turned violent because police were overzealous in  chasing protesters who refused to disperse and because union organizers were  too secretive about their plans.  </P> <P> Sixteen people were injured and more than 40 were arrested during the June 15  confrontation, which took place as the Justice for Janitors march moved on  Century City.  </P> <P> The commission, which was ordered by Mayor Tom Bradley to investigate the  incident, also called for changes in the way Los Angeles police officers handle  protest marches, and recommended development of a departmentwide training  program to teach officers how to deal with demonstrations.  </P> <P> The march turned ugly when 100 police officers formed a line and attempted to  disperse the crowd as it headed toward Century City. The marchers linked arms  and walked defiantly toward the officers.  </P> <P> Justice for Janitors, the group that sponsored the demonstration, later said  that most of those injured suffered broken bones and concussions, and one woman  had a miscarriage. They also said that during the scuffle, police knocked many  of the demonstrators to the ground, and chased others to an underground parking  area where more arrests were made.  </P> <P> Although the Police Commission's investigation laid responsibility for the  confrontation on both police supervisors and union organizers, the commission  was particularly critical of the officers who pursued the fleeing  demonstrators.  </P> <P> Chief Daryl F. Gates agreed.  </P> <P> "Clearly the department is not and was not happy with what occurred on that  particular day," Gates said. "We've been dealing with labor disputes for years  and are pretty proud of how we've done. But this is one of those unfortunate  incidents where it did not work."  </P> <P> He added that the officers should have maintained their composure and not  hunted down those marchers who ran to the garage. "We should have stopped at  the curb," he said. "We broke down our line and that was a break in our  discipline."  </P> <P> Bill Ragen, an organizer for Local 399 of the Hospital and Service Employees  Union, said the garage was where much of the police brutality occurred. "That's  where a lot of people got beaten and hurt trying to get the hell out of there,"  he said.  </P> <P> The commission also determined that police did not adequately announce their  dispersal order, a fact that James Wood, the No. 2 official with the Los  Angeles County Federation of Labor, said could have prevented many injuries. "A  30-second order to disperse is unreasonable," he said. "You can't comply."  </P> <P> The commission also called for greater communication between police and  demonstration organizers in the future.  </P> <P> Commissioner Reva B. Tooley pointed out that union members "were less than  forthcoming" in their march plans, "thereby depriving the (Police) Department  of valuable information and insight in what was bound to be a volatile  situation."  </P> <P> "For its part," she said, "the department failed to stay in touch with union  leaders along the route and thereby missed the opportunity to enlist their aid  in controlling a situation they believed was escalating."  </P></p>

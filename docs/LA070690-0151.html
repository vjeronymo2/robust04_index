			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PARENTS AVOID PRISON TERM IN SON'S DEATH  </P> <P> A couple were sentenced to 10 years' probation today for allowing their son to  die while treating him with Christian Science healing methods rather than  taking him to a doctor.  </P> <P> David and Ginger Twitchell were ordered to take their surviving children for  regular medical checkups as a part of their probationary sentence for  manslaughter.  </P> <P> "We've always tried to obey the law . . . and will try to obey the judge's  instructions," Twitchell said after leaving the courtroom. "We'll try to  balance the law and the judge's instructions with our trust in God."  </P> <P> Suffolk Superior Court Judge Sandra Hamlin rejected a prosecution request that  the couple be automatically jailed if they violate any term of the probationary  sentence. Instead, if there is a violation, a hearing would be held and  punishment would be decided.  </P> <P> The Twitchells, both 34 and lifelong Christian Scientists, had faced up to 20  years in prison. Hamlin had indicated Thursday, however, that she did not  believe the couple should be put behind bars for the 1986 death of their 2  1/2-year-old son, Robyn.  </P> <P> The couple were found guilty of manslaughter Wednesday; their lawyer has said  they will appeal.  </P> <P> Under terms of the probation, Hamlin said that American Medical Assn. standards  should be followed for checkups of the Twitchells' three surviving sons and any  children they might have in the future. If there is any sign of serious  illness, they are to take their children to a doctor.  </P> <P> After a two-month trial, a jury found the Twitchells, former Boston residents  now living in New York, guilty of involuntary manslaughter.  </P> <P> The key issue in their trial is one continually debated by legal scholars:  Where should the government draw the line on freedom of religion?  </P></p>

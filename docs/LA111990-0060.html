			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE THRILL ISN'T GONE;  </P> <P> 1990 TOURNAMENT'S ECSTASY, AGONY LINGER AT CONNECTICUT  </P> <P> A cold New England wind rides through north central Connecticut, scattering  yellow leaves and sending the unmistakable message that winter is close behind.  </P> <P> Students on the University of Connecticut campus bundle up against the cold as  they walk stiffly into the wind. Heads covered, hands shoved deep into pockets  of bulky jackets, they make their way to class.  </P> <P> Many pass the domed structure at one end of the campus, the Gampel Pavilion,  known by students as the Conn Dome, where inside the Big East champion Husky  basketball team is practicing and the temperature is rising fast.  </P> <P> "Enjoy our win last night, Shawn?" Coach Jim Calhoun asked freshman forward  Shawn Ellison.  </P> <P> "Yeah," said Ellison, who did not play in the Huskies' one-point exhibition  victory over the touring Soviet national team.  </P> <P> "Did you enjoy your view?" Calhoun asked. "Keep playing like you are and it'll  be permanent."  </P> <P> Lyman DePriest, a 6-foot-5 senior forward, put up a shot and missed.  </P> <P> "Heck," DePriest said.  </P> <P> "OK, from now on, let's all yell 'Heck, heck, heck,' every time we miss instead  of getting back on defense," Calhoun said.  </P> <P> Three hours later, Calhoun blew his whistle and sat down heavily in a chair at  one end of the court. Practice was over for the Huskies, but expectations are  running rampant and Calhoun is trying his best to defuse as much as he can.  </P> <P> It's not an easy job. The Big East coaches have made the Huskies, who were 21-6  last year, the conference favorite, and news-service polls has UConn ranked No.  13 and No. 17.  </P> <P> "We're not the No. 13 team in the country and we aren't No. 17, either," said  Calhoun, 48, in his 19th year of Division I college coaching. The 6-5 Calhoun  is a golfer, fan of Woody Allen films and a marathon runner.  </P> <P> Calhoun went on to list something else the Huskies aren't.  </P> <P> "We aren't the Rockefellers or the Cabot Lodges yet, the aristocrats of college  basketball," he said.  </P> <P> But what about last year?  </P> <P> "We say this to our players all the time: We want to build on last year. We  can't live on last year."  </P> <P> Around basketball crazy Connecticut, that may be in dispute. Picked near the  bottom of the Big East, the Huskies not only finished first, but also won the  conference tournament on their way to the No. 1 seeding in the East Regional of  the NCAA tournament.  </P> <P> Who will ever forget the play that beat Clemson in the East semifinal at the  Meadowlands?  </P> <P> UConn trailed by a point with one second to play when Scott Burrell threw a  90-foot inbounds pass to Tate George, who sank a turnaround jump shot as the  game ended for a 71-70 victory.  </P> <P> The play is known simply as "The Shot" among Husky faithful, who were equally  stunned by the outcome of the East final when Duke scored on a last-second shot  and beat Connecticut in overtime, 79-78, to end the dream season.  </P> <P> Calhoun remains convinced that the Huskies could have won the NCAA title last  year.  </P> <P> "I still believe to this day, although we didn't get a chance to prove it,  there wasn't anyone in the country we couldn't beat," he said. "I just knew we  were good enough to win the national championship."  </P> <P> This year, they probably aren't, for two reasons: Nadev Henefeld and George.  Henefeld, the team's best passer and defender, returned to his native Israel to  sign a pro contract with Maccabi of Tel Aviv, and George was a first-round  draft choice of the New Jersey Nets.  </P> <P> Henefeld's loss will be felt the most. A 6-7 forward who could play inside or  outside, Henefeld made the Huskies' full-court pressure work. Calhoun said  Henefeld's defection was a major blow.  </P> <P> "I've tried to downplay it to the kids," Calhoun said. "I've told them it  presents opportunities for some of them. People do a lot of things with  opportunities. Sometimes they blow them, and other times they make the most of  them."  </P> <P> Like last year?  </P> <P> "We were special," Calhoun said. "We were locked onto the track. We were in a  groove all the way.  </P> <P> "This year's team is fun to coach, too," he said. "They're not as good, but  it's fun."  </P> <P> A sellout crowd at the Hartford Civic Center watched the Huskies take a  19-point lead against the Soviet team, then saw them fall behind, 81-80, with  three seconds to play. Calhoun called a timeout and drew an inbounds play, much  like the one that beat Clemson.  </P> <P> Burrell, who pitched for the Toronto Blue Jays' farm club last summer in the  Class-A New York-Penn League, would throw the ball in.  </P> <P> Burrell's pass was caught past midcourt by Murray Williams, who took three  dribbles past two Soviet defenders expecting a jump shot and dropped in a layup  as the game ended in an 82-81 Connecticut victory.  </P> <P> Afterward, Soviet Coach Vladas Garastas was asked if he knew that Connecticut  had done nearly the same thing in the last-second victory over Clemson. Vladas  nodded and smiled.  </P> <P> "Sure, everybody know," Garastas said.  </P> <P> The Clemson game is something Husky fans will never forget, even if Calhoun  prefers that they try.  </P> <P> Clemson's David Yates made a three-pointer for a 70-69 Tiger lead with 12  seconds left. It was Yates' only basket of the game.  </P> <P> The Huskies moved the ball upcourt quickly. George penetrated the middle,  wanting to pass to Chris Smith or John Gwynn, but both were covered. So George  took the shot himself, but missed an open 16-foot jumper with five seconds  left.  </P> <P> "I almost started crying," George said. "I think I realized my college career  was coming to an end. After that miss, I wanted the ball back in my hands.  </P> <P> "I thought, 'Well, it's been a dream season,' but I was upset that it was going  to end like that."  </P> <P> Clemson's Sean Tyson rebounded George's shot and was fouled by Burrell with 1.6  seconds left. Tyson missed the free throw, Burrell rebounded and called time,  almost in the same motion. The clock showed :01.0.  </P> <P> "(Calhoun) kept yelling, 'It's not over! It's not over!' " Burrell said. "He  picked our heads up and said, 'We're going to get a shot off.' I don't know if  I believed him. I thought it was over, to tell you the truth."  </P> <P> Calhoun drew the play. Burrell would throw the ball to one of the Huskies' big  men past midcourt and he would turn and heave the ball in desperation. But in  the huddle, George told Burrell that should pass all the way downcourt.  </P> <P> That's what happened. Burrell fired a fastball over the outstretched hands of  6-11 Clemsoncenter Elden Campbell. George caught the pass with his back to the  basket, whirled as Tyson backed off and lofted the ball at the basket. It fell  through.  </P> <P> The play was called "home run," which is pretty close to what George hit. In  the pandemonium afterward, George's mother cried in the stands, Clemson Coach  Cliff Ellis stared in disbelief and George caught Big East Commissioner David  Gavitt in a bear hug.  </P> <P> Outgoing Connecticut Gov. William O'Neill was moved to announce that George or  possibly Calhoun ought to succeed him in the statehouse.  </P> <P> "The Shot" was seen by rabid Husky fans as the natural progression of the  season: a miracle shot by a miracle team.  </P> <P> Calhoun does not ordinarily like the word miracle used in connection with last  year's Husky team.  </P> <P> "To me, miracle means something happened that wasn't based on fact or  substance," he said. "But that shot, yeah, that was a miracle."  </P> <P> However, miracles seem to get spread around a little bit. The 17-foot jump shot  by Duke's Christian Laettner that beat Connecticut at the end of overtime might  not qualify as a miracle, but it was close enough. Somehow, the Huskies had  lost their chance to make the Final Four.  </P> <P> Maybe it just wasn't meant to be. Moments before Laettner's winning shot, there  was George picking off a pass by Bobby Hurley intended for Phil Henderson in  front of the Duke bench, but fumbling it out of bounds and then sticking his  hands in his mouth in horror.  </P> <P> "When Laettner made it, it was like a curtain had closed," Calhoun said. "It  was a sudden stop. I could still see Tate with the ball, coming to me. He was  going to dribble right to me and we were going to dribble to Denver.  </P> <P> "We had the play," he said. "I could feel the bench behind me, everybody was  up. We had the ball stolen. And the game."  </P> <P> But Huskymania remains.  </P> <P> Reporters from 15 of the state's 20 daily newspapers covered the exhibition  game with the Soviets, which was carried on the 15-station Husky radio network.  </P> <P> The athletic department had to return $250,000 in season ticket requests for  the 8,500-seat Gampel Pavilion after cutting off season ticket sales at 6,500.  In the Hartford Civic Center, where the Huskies play eight games, season ticket  sales have reached 13,100. Three years ago, season tickets in the Civic Center  were not even half that.  </P> <P> Connecticut has mailed 100,000 full-color catalogues of Husky merchandise such  as T-shirts, hats and sweat shirts, targeting its alumni base, season  ticket-holders and boosters. Last year, sales of such merchandise netted more  than $125,000.  </P> <P> The Huskies will play their first full season in the new Gampel Pavilion, which  opened last January at a cost of $28 million -- $22 million from state bonds.  And the team that plays there? Well, it considers itself new, too.  </P> <P> "We're nothing like last year," Burrell said. "Last year is last year. It's  over. Gone. It's not the same team. We want to find out what we're all about  this year. We may not be as good as last year, but we don't ever want to dwell  on what happened then because we can never get it back."  </P> <P> Said Smith: "It's a feeling that probably won't ever happen again."  </P> <P> A streak-shooting 6-2 junior guard from Bridgeport, Smith leads the team.  Chosen the most valuable player in last season's Big East tournament, Smith  spent the summer touring with the U.S. national team, played in the Goodwill  Games and was a starting guard during the World Championships in Argentina.  </P> <P> He started all eight games in the World Championships and averaged 9.4 points  and 1.9 assists as the U.S. won the bronze medal. Smith's backcourt partner  this year is point guard Gilad Katz, a 22-year-old from Tel-Aviv, a member of  the Israeli national team who has completed his military service.  </P> <P> The other Huskies who will log most of the playing time are veterans: 6-9 1/2  junior center Rod Sellers, Burrell, Williams, DePriest and John Gwynn coming  off the bench. Toraino Walker, a 6-7, 226-pound sophomore, will be back as soon  as he makes up incomplete class work.  </P> <P> Even without George, it would have been a complete team if Henefeld were still  around. Calhoun fully expected Henefeld to come back for a second and probably  final season, but the Huskies' success combined with Henefeld's status as  Israel's top player prevented that.  </P> <P> "Nadev had become bigger than life in Israel and here," Calhoun said. "He had a  feel for the game that you could only hope to coach. If we had him back, then  the polls would have been right."  </P> <P> Last year, the Huskies' average margin of victory was 15 points, best in the  nation. This year, Calhoun figures his team is going to have to grind it out,  hope for the best and forget about the past.  </P> <P> Calhoun remains a big man in these parts. Last week, he was a guest conductor  of the Hartford Symphony Orchestra. He began the "William Tell Overture" by  blowing his coach's whistle. A drummer donned a Husky cap.  </P> <P> "I was going to put a Lone Ranger mask on, but, naw, what the heck," Calhoun  said.  </P> <P> University of Connecticut basketball fans share the feeling. Love those  Huskies? Still replaying "The Shot?" Well, don't feel like the Lone Ranger.  </P></p>

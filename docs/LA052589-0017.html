			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> A MIGHTY BLOW FOR FRIENDLY PERSUASION  </P> <P> Tian An Men Square is converted into the world's largest peace park. Images  from China are telling the world that nonviolence is effective, both as a  conviction of the heart and a tactic of the street. The eruption of nonviolent  disobedience has brought the Chinese dictators to a state of powerless  confusion that could never have happened as quickly or been as widespread had  the students chosen guns or bombs.  </P> <P> Without exception, every show of force -- nonviolent or violent force -- has as  its goal the changing of minds. George Bush sends 2,000 troops to Panama to  persuade Manuel Noriega to change his mind about ruling his country. Bank  robbers aim guns at tellers to change their minds about who should own the  money in the drawer. Mahatma Gandhi fasted to change England's mind about who  should rule India.  </P> <P> Every conflict or problem, whether among individuals or governments, has been,  and will be, solved through the exertion of violent or nonviolent force. No  third way exists. Choosing nonviolent noncooperation, the Chinese students are  proving the truth of Gandhi's statement: "Government of the people is possible  only so long as they consent either consciously or unconsciously to be  governed."  </P> <P> Eleven Latin American dictators were overthrown in this century through  nonviolent strikes. Armed Philippine guerrillas tried for years to drive out  the Marcos regime. He was defeated by nonviolent resistance.  </P> <P> What has violence done? Compare El Salvador and Poland. At about the same time  in the late 1970s, rebels in both countries wanted to change the mind of the  government. In El Salvador, they attacked with guns. More than 70,000 have been  killed on all sides. Governance has worsened. In Poland, they attacked with  moral force. Few have died. Governance has improved.  </P> <P> A massacre of innocents -- the "crackdown" that pessimists say is inevitable --  is still possible in China. What isn't possible is that the bravery and wisdom  of the past two weeks of massive nonviolence can be canceled. The story still  to be written is how this group of Chinese students came to understand so well  and so boldly that the strength of truth and justice is superior to the  weakness of guns and tanks.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S ETHICS PROPOSALS FACE UNCERTAIN FUTURE;  </P> <P> CONGRESS' OPPOSITION TO SOME PARTS LIKELY; PAY ISSUE SIDESTEPPED  </P> <P> President Bush, saying that the American people are troubled by "brazen  contempt for the letter or spirit" of ethics laws, Wednesday proposed a package  of reforms including more stringent financial disclosure rules for federal  officials, restrictions on lobbying by former members of Congress and a ban on  some campaign contributions.  </P> <P> Bush also called for a 25% pay increase for federal judges but stopped short of  proposing a raise as well for members of Congress and employees of the  executive branch.  </P> <P> "Congress should have a pay increase," he said in a speech to the American  Society of Newspaper Editors, where he announced the ethics package. But, he  added, "there is no point, absolutely no point, in putting Congress through  another traumatic bashing" now like the furor that led to the defeat of a 50%  pay raise earlier this year.  </P> <P> Announcement of the reform package redeemed Bush's campaign promise to tighten  ethics laws, but its prospects are unclear. Some congressional aides have  suggested that it could be boosted if the pending ethics report on House  Speaker Jim Wright's financial affairs triggers heightened public concern over  the issue. Otherwise, it could be hamstrung by likely congressional opposition  to a number of provisions.  </P> <P> Although Bush sidestepped the question of congressional pay, Congress is the  target of most of the new proposals in his package. The plan would impose  several new rules and establish a new Congressional Ethics Office, with power  to conduct public inquiries of allegations against members or their aides.  Currently, such allegations are investigated in secret by the congressional  ethics committees and often become public only if the committees vote to impose  some penalty.  </P> <P> Under the new plan, members of Congress and their aides would have to wait a  year after leaving government before they could lobby former colleagues. A  similar "cooling off period" already applies to executive branch workers.  Congressmen also would be forbidden from voting on legislation that affects any  company with which they are negotiating for jobs.  </P> <P> Congressional staff members, although not the lawmakers themselves, would be  covered by the federal conflict-of-interest law that forbids taking action that  affects a company in which the individual has a personal stake.  </P> <P> By contrast, Bush has proposed relatively few changes in the rules governing  his own appointees in the executive branch. And some parts of his plan, such as  providing a new tax break to assist government officials who must sell assets  to avoid conflicts of interest, would loosen current restrictions.  </P> <P> Bush aides say that the emphasis on Congress is justified because ethical rules  for the legislative branch have been less stringent than those covering the  rest of the government. The new plan is designed to put all three branches of  the government -- the executive, the legislative and the judiciary -- on the  same level, they said.  </P> <P> "The American people do not understand why certain behavior is considered  criminal when committed by an executive branch official (but is) perfectly  legal when committed by someone in another branch," Bush said in his speech.  </P> <P> The package disappointed some outside groups that have campaigned for more  dramatic overhauls of the federal ethics code. In particular, critics argue  that Bush should have endorsed a ban on speech and appearances fees for members  of Congress. Such honorariums can add nearly $36,000 to the income of some  lawmakers.  </P> <P> Bush "caved in to pressure by members of Congress who want to keep this corrupt  system going," complained Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, the  citizens lobby. Bush aides countered that proposing to eliminate honorariums  without recommending a pay raise would only alienate Congress.  </P> <P> While many of the ethics proposals are highly technical, a few of the changes  would have a clearly noticeable effect. For example, government officials  would, under Bush's plan, have to report exactly how much money they have,  rather than reporting their income and wealth only in broad ranges that  effectively conceal much of their net worth. Officials also would be required  to report the amount of money they borrow from relatives, something they  currently do not have to disclose.  </P> <P> Bush's proposed campaign finance reform would eliminate contributions directly  to candidates by special interest political action committees. Rather, PACs  would be allowed to contribute to political parties, which, in turn, would  divide the money they received among their candidates.  </P> <P> In the past, critics have charged that direct contributions tended to protect  incumbents, making challenges by other candidates difficult and locking in the  parties' competitive positions in Congress.  </P> <P> Bush also has proposed that members of Congress be banned from converting  campaign funds to personal use. Congress already has forbidden most members  from converting campaign funds to other uses but included a "grandfather  clause" for those who were in Congress before 1980. Effectively, that clause  has allowed some of Congress' most senior members to amass nest eggs worth  hundreds of thousands of dollars, a practice that Bush would end.  </P> <P> Campaign contributions, he said, "should not become a sort of individual  retirement account for members of the United States Congress."  </P> <P> During a question-and-answer session with the editors, Bush defended the pace  of the federal government's involvement in fighting the oil spill in Alaska's  Prince William Sound, pointing to the contributions of the Coast Guard and  stating that the government moved "more quickly and more boldly than it gets  credit for."  </P> <P> The President signaled that he would veto a revision in the broadcasting  Fairness Doctrine, now making its way through Congress. A similar bill was  vetoed by former President Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> And, asked by the father of a 12-year-old black child whether the young girl  might some day be President, Bush said: "I hope that the progress this country  has made and will make in the future will guarantee that a black teen-ager  today, female, might well be President of the United States."  </P> <P> </P> <P> HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BUSH ETHICS PACKAGE  </P> <P> Public disclosure of the exact value of assets owned by government  </P> <P> officials.  </P> <P> Members of Congress and staff required to wait one year before taking  </P> <P> jobs as lobbyists.  </P> <P> Members of Congress and staff to be covered by new conflict of interest  </P> <P> rules.  </P> <P> New Congressional Ethics Office to investigate allegations and make  </P> <P> public reports.  </P> <P> Special prosecutors to be given authority to investigate Congress as  </P> <P> well as executive branch officials.  </P> <P> Prohibition on political action committee (PAC) contributions directly to  </P> <P> congressional candidates.  </P> <P> New tax break for officials who must sell assets to avoid conflicts of  </P> <P> interest.  </P> <P> A 25% pay increase for federal judges.  </P></p>

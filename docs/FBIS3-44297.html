			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News and Press Review" program] </F>   [Text] The first issue of ZHONGHUA YINGCAI [CHINA'S  TALENTS] magazine for 1994 -- which was published today --  carries Premier Li Peng's lengthy remarks during an interview  with the magazine's reporter. Li Peng expressed his important  views on such issues as the domestic and international  situation, as well as economic work in 1994.    He said: Sustained, rapid, and healthy development is our  motto [ti fa] for development, and an efficiency-based growth  rate is our demand. We should implement the principle of  stressing both development and frugality, optimize our  structure, expand our transport capacity, and expedite  infrastructure construction. On the other hand, we should carry  out some long-term construction projects. In real estate  development, we should principally build medium- and low-end  housing to solve urban residents' housing problems.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Plamen Enchev: "Military Games"] </F>   [Text] "A la guerre comme a la guerre," (in war as in war)  Prime Minister Berov said one year ago, and until today he  remains loyal to his slogan.    God and history could testify that the Professor was not the  one who started the war. Unlike his predecessor, Lyuben Berov  was also the target of the other institutions. However, a real  war has been conducted in the last week only on one front -- the  presidential front.    Bulgarian, and probably many non-Bulgarian, factors claim a  part in the big game.    The reconnaissance view of the battlefield produces the  following picture: On one side there is the cabinet, which  relies on insecure and even conditional parliamentary support.  On the other there is the figure of the supreme commander in  chief -- a rather lonely figure, unless one also notes his  advisers and controversial military office. Only conventional  means are used -- the one gives interviews, the other responds  through statements. Behind-the- scenes maneuvers are not  revealed to the public at large.    The presidential salvo began with the conclusion that  Berov's  cabinet must go because it threatens civic peace. Despite his  four by-passes the prime minister countered in a direct manner  -- he accused Dr. Zhelev of violating his constitutional  prerogatives and interfering in places he has no business. The  Presidency did not react to this blow. It lowered its profile  and apparently awaits support from outside.    The outcome of the games that are taking place, is  unpredictable, especially when one realizes that one side is  motivated by interest, the other -- by honor.</p>

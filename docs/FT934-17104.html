			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / International Company News: Swissair seeks to calm merger fears SWISSAIR said yesterday that the proposed collaboration with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Austrian Airlines could add SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.1bn) to the combined profits of the four companies after a three-year start-up period. The extra profits would come from higher revenues and lower costs, it said. The Swiss national airline said talks on the collaboration, called the Alcazar project, had reached an 'intensive stage', with the partners close to agreement on several fundamental points. It hoped that a memorandum of understanding would be signed 'in the next few weeks', and that operations could begin early next year. It pointed out, however, that before operations began, an integration agreement would need to be concluded and approved by the companies' shareholders. The airline appears to have issued the statement mainly to reassure shareholders, who have been unnerved by a number of recent speculative reports. In particular, concern has been expressed in Swiss financial circles that Swissair might be undervalued relative to the other companies in the proposed structure. The plan is that Swissair, KLM and SAS would each have 30 per cent of a centralised management company. Austrian Airlines would have 10 per cent. However, Swissair noted that 'independent valuations of the four partners have suggested different proportions of relative worth. Some forms of offset will therefore be required. These are currently being developed.' It added that it was 'committed to the interests of its shareholders in all such activities'. Swissair said the offsets could include removing some of its subsidiary businesses - such as catering, hotels and aircraft maintenance - from the combined group. The airline also sought to allay fears of large numbers of compulsory redundancies, saying that a 10 per cent overall reduction in jobs was expected and would be borne 'in equal proportions by all four partners'. Mr Jan Carlzon, the top SAS negotiator on the Alcazar project, said this week the proposed four-way airline alliance could hit its target of being ready for operation in April next year. However, he pointedly refused to give any guarantees of a successful outcome. 'If we do not resolve the outstanding critical questions there will be no deal,' he told a Swedish newspaper yesterday. Meanwhile, SAS completed a reshuffle of its senior management following Mr Carlzon's recent resignation as president and chief executive. He quit last Monday to concentrate on the Alcazar project. Mr Jan Reinas, Mr Carlzon's temporary successor, is also to take over as chief operating officer from Mr Kjell Fredheim, a key Carlzon lieutenant who will now head corporate development. Mr Steffen Harpoeth has already quit as deputy president, effectively completing the removal of Mr Carlzon's team from the top echelon of SAS, which has seen mounting losses this year. Mr Carlzon himself has moved out of SAS headquarters in the Stockholm suburbs, and into an office in the city.</p>

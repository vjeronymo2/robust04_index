			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Virginia Perez Araoz and Mariano Botas] </F>   [Text] In initial remarks to LA PRENSA, Energy Secretary  Carlos Bastos says: "I cannot understand some government  officials who have adopted the habit of calling journalists,  making strong remarks, challenging other government officials,  and having journalists play the role of a judge." Nevertheless,  since he clearly and explicitly is not in the mood to challenge  the National Commission for Atomic Energy [CNEA], the energy  secretary directly addresses the issue that actually worries him.    Bastos says: "Here on my table I have a preliminary report  by a consulting company, a survey that is not directly linked to  CNEA because it just describes the state's function with regard  to the nuclear power industry in those countries where the  production of nuclear power is in private hands. There is also  a report on the situation in the United Kingdom, a country that  was unable to achieve nuclear privatization and whose experience  we also are interested in learning."    [LA PRENSA] But this is not all the "Group of Entrepreneurs"  was asked to do ...    [Bastos] This is a preliminary report. Afterward, there will  be a summary on all the practical cases reviewed. With this  material, the presidency of the nation (including presidential  secretary Eduardo Bauza; President Menem; CNEA Chairman Manuel  Mondino; and, probably, [Economy] Minister Domingo Cavallo, who  will convey the Energy Secretariat's opinion) will decide if it  would or would not be viable to open up the nuclear area for the  participation of private capital.    If it is indeed viable, a second step will be taken in which  the consulting company would actually present some concrete  privatization alternatives.    [LA PRENSA] Why was CNEA not consulted on the decision to  call this consulting company?    [Bastos] Because we are not making decisions on CNEA. We are  just trying to establish a basis, based on international  experience, to determine which way to advance, if a decision is  made on advancing.    The nuclear issue is a field almost exclusively staked out  by  CNEA people. Not even all the nuclear scientists participate in  it.    Based on the survey requested, we just want to become  acquainted with, to define what will happen with industrial  security if the production of nuclear power is transferred to  private hands; what will be done with the plants and nuclear  waste when the nuclear power plants stop operating; and if the  rates that will be approved for these companies will be  regulated or will be established by market conditions. These  are politico-economic issues that are independent from the way  in which CNEA would be restructured.    [LA PRENSA] The energy secretary said: "No one has a  definite opinion on how CNEA will be restructured because no one  knows how the entire industry will be restructured. For  example, if the nuclear power plants are privatized, who will  supply the fuel? Will foreign companies be allowed to supply it  or will the participation be restricted to national companies?  Will they be exclusive suppliers or will they have other deals?  These are open questions."    But if CNEA's future is raised again, it is because there is  a definite opinion that things are not working the way they  stand now.    [Bastos] I am not saying that CNEA is operating well or  poorly now. I am actually saying that there are general  guidelines on streamlining the state. We, Minister Domingo  Cavallo and I, have adhered to these guidelines with plenty of  evidence. The state must be removed from entrepreneurial  activities. The control of general interests in entrepreneurial  activities alone must be left in the state's hands.    [LA PRENSA] Is it a mistake, then, to claim that all nuclear  activities must be in the state's hands?    [Bastos] I don't know. I am not a specialized expert in this  area. I actually know that our secretariat is responsible for  the energy policy, in general. And we cannot stop voicing an  opinion on the organization of the nuclear field that is  involved in energy production.    I do not want to get involved in an argument with Mondino or  bring the CNEA under the Energy Secretariat's jurisdiction. I  must insist, however, that we are entitled to voice an opinion  on this issue.    This industry obviously will be restructured. And it is  important for the political power to hold the reins and decide  on the nuclear area's role and the way it will be restructured.    Maybe Mondino is unaware of the fact that the studies may  recommend that it is not advantageous to privatize CNEA ...    [LA PRENSA] Does the Energy Secretariat, then, believe that  it is best to privatize CNEA?    [Bastos] This is not the way in which the report requested  from the consulting company should be understood. Maybe it has  been misinterpreted because, for the time being, we do not  intend to define the privatization of the power plants. We  actually are trying to determine the role in this area that the  state plays in other countries, the state's responsibility.    At the moment, everything is in the hands of CNEA, a state  organization that has superimposed activities and a single  balance. The CNEA is a development and research center. And at  the same time, it controls its own accounts and projects. It  must be restructured.    [LA PRENSA] Nevertheless, Mondino's proposal to transform  CNEA into a corporation is precisely aimed at that ... What is  your opinion?    [Bastos] What I told Mondino is about a meeting that was  also  attended by Bauza. It is about a superficial change that does  not propose basic issues such as how to integrate CNEA into the  electric industry or security and the risks of a nuclear  accident.    The idea of separating the accounting was good but to do  that  there is no need for a decree; it can be done through an  internal procedure.    The project is up in the air. If he is asked what the  state's  role is, Mondino would say that CNEA is responsible for defining  a policy for the industry. And this is not so. CNEA is not the  state but an organization of the state.    [LA PRENSA] Is there international capital interested in the  nuclear industry?    [Bastos] Practically all the international companies are  interested in finishing the Atucha-2 nuclear plant. This is the  business in which they are now interested. But some Spanish and  Canadian companies have been asking about the eventual  construction of a fourth nuclear plant.    [LA PRENSA] What is the timetable for drawing up a plan for  restructuring CNEA?    [Bastos] The second report by the consulting firm will be  ready before the end of this year; it is a synthesis of the  experience abroad. With this information, we will begin to  discuss the need to open up to private capital and in which  areas to do it.    I believe that by the middle of next year a decision already  will have been made on the meaning and ways of restructuring  proposed for CNEA.    But this process, I insist, is not linked to an Energy  Secretariat goal. It has to do with the state's reform.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Algerian poll cancelled after Chadli quits office: Armoured vehicles in capital - Islamic party denied victory ALGERIA'S transition to democracy received a severe setback last night when the country's leaders cancelled general elections which looked certain to hand power to Moslem fundamentalists. As tanks guarded government buildings in the capital, Algiers, the High Security Council said the elections could not be continued 'until necessary conditions were achieved for the normal functioning of institutions'. Effective power following the resignation on Saturday of President Chadli Bendjedid now rests with the High Security Council. This includes prime minister Sid Ahmed Ghozali, senior military commanders and the interim president, Mr Abdelmalek Benhabyles, who is also chairman of the Constitutional Council, the top legal body. The High Security Council said it had taken charge provisionally of public order and security. Its intervention prompted a strong reaction from Hocine Ait-Ahmed, leader of the Front des Forces Socialistes, the main lay opposition, who said on French radio that the country was witnessing a coup 'if not in form, then certainly in fact'. A second round of the elections, Algeria's first multi-party contest, was due to take place on Thursday. In the first round on December 26, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which aims to turn Algeria into North Africa's first Islamic state, took a landslide lead with 188 seats in the 430-seat National Assembly. Mr Chadli's resignation after some 13 years in power came after pressure from military officers and many other groups representing professional bodies, trade unions and women. The FIS called the resignation a 'piece of theatre aimed at suppressing the people and cancelling the results'. FIS militants gathered outside the party's headquarters in Algiers, awaiting directions from their leaders. The capital and other main cities were subdued, however. Tanks were stationed in front of the prime minister's office, the Ministry of the Interior and the state television building. But the presence of the army remained very discreet, with troops confined essentially to the barracks on the city's outskirts. Before the High Security Council's intervention last night, the National Liberation Front, which held a monopoly on power in Algeria until 1988 and was thrashed in December's polls, reiterated its commitment to the elections. The Defence Ministry said that the army 'reaffirms its loyalty to the constitution and its confidence in the existing constitutional institutions'. Under the constitution, Mr Benhabyles has 45 days as interim head of state to organise a presidential election. France, the former colonial power, has plans to accommodate refugees who would flee an Islamic state in Algeria if one came into being, according to Mr Philippe Marchand, the Paris interior minister. Meanwhile, Britain was among countries which advised their nationals to avoid travelling to Algeria because of the crisis. The Foreign Office advised the 200 Britons living in the country to stay in touch with the embassy and 'to take sensible precautions . . . and avoid potential troublespots'.

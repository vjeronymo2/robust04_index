			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Arts: Looking back - 'A Penny for a Song' One of the main English notions about England is that it is brimful of darling, impractical eccentrics; that the most shattering events of history have occurred abroad; that England is a safe and charming refuge from the real world; and that things have been so for centuries - and should continue so. So it is in John Whiting's 1951 comedy A Penny for a Song, set in 1804, during the Napoleonic Wars, and currently revived (in its 1962 revised text) at the Orange Tree, Richmond. Sir Timothy plans to repulse the invading French army by impersonating Napoleon and - using French from a textbook - ordering it to go back home. His sister-in-law Hester prepares to join the East Anglian Amazon corps. Meanwhile their cricketing neighbour 'Stumper' Selincourt trains a very amateur home guard. And so on. Everything is very, very charming. There are still those who love this kind of pretty treacle; but I am too conscious of its deliberate unreality to relax to its comedy. A Penny for a Song wants to evoke the Shallow and Silence scenes in Henry IV Part Two, and the Dogberry episodes of Much Ado; and it reminds us now of the dafter flights of Dad's Army. I love an English comic idyll too. Whiting's play, however, more anodyne and escapist than all these, tries to hug England for its sillier Englishnesses and to be wistful about it as well. The giveaway comes in the quaintly stylised language. ('I'll not believe that this day, this so-called Armageddon, can pass without our being needed.') Nothing like 1804 parlance, nor much like 1951, this talk apes Oscar Wilde. Especially the play's do-nothing spectator, Hallam Matthews: 'I have published three polemical pamphlets on quite uncontroversial subjects.' But Wilde's delicious sting is here replaced by mere charm. Whiting had not the force to tease England. He merely wanted to love it, with a laugh and also a little sigh. And he came to sense his play's inclination to excessive idyllic escapism. His 1962 re-write beefs up the role of Edward, the one character in the play who talks of the value of revolution, the horrors of war and the importance of social change. I am grateful for every window on the real world that this character opens. But even Edward has buckets of charm. By the end of the play, it matters more to us that he and Hester's daughter Dorcas may end up in true love than that he may pursue his politics. Every other character in the play is conceived not to be convincingly lifelike but to be theatrically adorable. Sam Walters's direction emphasises this. As Hallam Matthews, Michael Elwyn speaks in carefully fluted tones that chiefly evoke Alan Bennett as a C. of E. vicar. Like David Timson's Sir Timothy and Auriol Smith's Hester, he projects his own consciousness that he is playing an English eccentric. And thereby underlines the unreality, pointlessness and harmlessness of the whole play. At the Orange Tree, Richmond, until December 19, and from December 29 till January 30</p>

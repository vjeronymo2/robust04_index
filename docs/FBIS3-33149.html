The  military prosecutor requested jail sentences of 20 and 15 years  for the soldiers who committed the crime -- two majors and four  subofficers -- while only five officers were included in the  proceedings and charged with negligence.    Jurists, congressmen, and other prominent people linked to  human rights organizations have described the sentences  requested by the military prosecutor for the 11 soldiers being  tried in the La Cantuta case as mild.    [Begin unidentified priest recording] In my opinion, the  sentences are too mild, because it was a very serious crime.  [end recording]    The most drastic sentences were requested for Majors  Santiago  Martin Rivas and Carlos Pichilingue, for whom the military  prosecutor requested 20 years each. In descending order, 15  years were requested for subofficers Jesus Antonio Sossa, Nelson  Carvajal Garcia, and Pedro Guillermo Supo; five years for  General Juan Rivero Lasso; four years for Colonel Federico  Navarro Perez; two years for Captain Jose Velarado Astete; and  30 days for Colonel Manuel Guzman Calderon.    In view of the situation, relatives of the slain civilians  announced via their lawyer that they will not participate in the  trial to be held in a military court.    [Begin Attorney Saul Cuadros recording] The civilian side --  the relatives and three others -- today agreed not to  participate in the military trial. Previously, in May and  October, we acted on behalf of the civilian side in written  documents, but we never received approval to do so. By  participating on behalf of the civilian side, we would be  endorsing many irregularities committed by the military court --  irregularities with which we totally disagree. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Congressman Cesar Larrabure criticized U.S.  meddling in Peruvian affairs by commenting on the so-called La  Cantuta law. He said the autonomy and sovereignty of countries  must be respected, adding that the United States cannot treat  Peru as a colony. In this regard, he said the U.S. State  Department's statement with regard to the so-called La Cantuta  law is unacceptable. He also expressed his confidence that  soldiers implicated in this case will receive a fair trial.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> PROFITABLE FUN ZONE RIDES ARE STILL ON THE BLOCK FOR $2.5 MILLION AFTER A YEAR  </P> <P> About a year ago, Joe Tunstall was oiling the bumper cars at the Fun Zone --  Newport Beach's vest-pocket amusement park -- and explaining why he was tired  of owning the merry-go-round, the small Ferris wheel and the "Scary Dark Ride."  </P> <P> Running the Fun Zone rides is a profitable business, and was even fun for a  while, said Tunstall, who collects amusement-park rides on the side.  </P> <P> But it's also a lot of work for a guy who's in his 50s and has already made a  bundle from a bike shop and wants to spend it traveling.  </P> <P> So, Tunstall said a year ago, he and a partner were putting the rides on the  Balboa Peninsula up for sale. (The Fun Zone building itself belongs to a  Japanese businessman; the rides are on a 20-year lease.)  </P> <P> But no serious takers have come forward as yet, Tunstall said a few days ago.  He's asking $2.5 million.  </P> <P> He said that the rides brought in about $1.1 million last year -- up 10% from  the year before -- and that the owners cleared around $400,000 before taxes.  </P> <P> "No product costs," Tunstall said, explaining the high profit margin.  </P> <P> "We've had offers, but they've been on the ridiculous side," he said. "I don't  need to get out of here that bad. I just want to get out." It looks, however,  like he's in the amusement-park business for a while yet.  </P></p>

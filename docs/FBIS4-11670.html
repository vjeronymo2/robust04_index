			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Riyad Mansur] </F>   [Text] The Hebron emergency committee has addressed a  strongly worded statement to Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat, warning him against the consequences of signing any  agreement that deals with their city.    In a statement sent to President 'Arafat, a copy of which  was  obtained by SAWT AL-SHA'B, the Hebron emergency committee, which  represents all the city's sectors and factions, said its  approval should be obtained before the signing of any agreement  that deals with their city. It called for the removal of all  settlements through the total elimination of the occupation of  all the territories, including Jerusalem, and securing  international protection for the Palestinian people to replace  the occupation forces according to international laws.    Hebron's warning came after prominent figures in the city  rejected a decision by the Palestinian president to appoint a  council for the Hebron Governorate.    A number of those appointed by 'Arafat as members of the  council rejected the decision, including Dr. Nabil al-Ja'bari,  former member of the Palestinian negotiating delegation.  Al-Ja'bari sent a cable to the Palestinian president telling  him that he reviewed the name list of the so-called Hebron  Governorate council and that he rejects being appointed as  member of this council.    In his cable, al-Ja'bari said the difficult circumstances  facing the Governorate of Hebron and the pure blood watering its  soil prompts them to close ranks and unite their words to  confront the common enemy. He said the men of the Governorate  of Hebron are capable of finding a legislative body with a  popular base to protect their interests and rights.    Al-Ja'bari affirmed to the Palestinian people that he does  not accept an appointment to this council. He said he was not  consulted before his name was thrown in, noting this name list  will not be representative of the Hebron Governorate, no matter  how many names are included, because there are well-known bases  for appointment.</p>

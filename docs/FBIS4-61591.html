			<p>BFN     [Text] Armenian military units used tanks painted red and  infantry units dressed in white uniforms in their attacks on  towns in Terterskiy Rayon. Colonel Rezvan Maliyev, chief of  police in Terterskiy Rayon, informed a correspondent of the  [name indistinct] NEWS AGENCY that the objective was to create  fear in Azerbaijan's military units. Despite their efforts to  direct psychological pressure on our units, the Armenians  suffered many casualties. They have lost 32 tanks and large  quantities of grenade launchers, mortars, and other types of  arms since the beginning of their onslaught against Terterskiy  Rayon on 16 April. They have also lost 100 men a day.    Asked how many Armenians have been taken prisoner during the  past few days, Maliyev said: The Armenians kill their  colleagues to prevent them from being taken prisoner. A special  military detachment has been created in Armenia for that  purpose. The commander of a group of 24 troops recently  contacted Azerbaijan's military positions by field radio to  inform them that they were ready to surrender as long as they  were guaranteed safe travel to Russia. The Armenian command  center monitored what they said. The 24 troops were shot and  killed. Another 64 Armenian troops who wanted to surrender were  shot and killed in the south of the front line.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- Thirty-one suspects --  some of them members of the AWB's [Afrikaner Resistance  Movement] elite Ystergarde [Iron Guard] unit -- have been  arrested and are being held in connection with several bomb  blasts which have hit the Witwatersrand and Pretoria areas since  the weekend.    Two of the men are policemen, one a serving member and the  other a reservist. All those arrested are being held at  different places and investigations into further connections,  perhaps at leadership level, are in progress. This was  announced by the commissioner of police, General Johan van der  Merwe, at a special media conference called at a Braamfontein,  Johannesburg night club on Wednesday afternoon.    A confiscated pipe bomb and its explosives were exhibited to  the media and a special video tape was released to SABC [South  African Broadcasting Corporation] TV and other television  journalists.    The blasts caused the death of 21 people and the injury of  173. "Investigation teams have been working around the clock  over the past few days to hunt down those responsible for recent  terror blasts and in an attempt to prevent further blasts," Gen  Van der Merwe said. This team effort, co-ordinated and executed  nationally, had resulted in a remarkable breakthrough, he said.    "The achievement again illustrates the will, commitment and  ability of the SAP [South African Police] to maintain law and  order and should also be seen as a strong warning to those who  wish to achieve their aims through violent means. Using  violence to achieve their aims is not only futile and pointless,  but will ultimately lead to their own destruction," he said.    The media conference was shown 4kg of fertiliser explosive  which police experts said was "amateur" but the effect of which,  packed in a 12cm diameter by 60cm steel pipe, was "utterly  professional".    The pipe bomb had been confiscated in a roadblock at which  suspect was expected. "The breakthrough must be attributed to  the sheer hard work and determination of the investigation teams  involved, as well as exceptional intelligence work," the police  commissioner said.    The breakthrough apparently started with the first arrest. A  suspect was detained under Section 29 of the Internal Security  Act on Sunday. Regular arrests then followed in Rustenberg,  Ventersdorp and Pretoria, involving some members of the  Afrikaner Weerstandbeweging's elite Ystergarde. Some suspects  had given themselves up.    Police were confident that those arrested were the brains of  the group but it could not be excluded that others were  involved, including leaders. This was currently under further  investigation, Gen van der Merwe said. He said the suspects  were being held at various locations which were being kept  secret.</p>

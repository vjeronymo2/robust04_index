			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SWITCH WOULD LIMIT PLAY OF CITY, SOUTHERN SECTION  </P> <P> A proposal by the Los Angeles Unified School District to move its winter high  school athletic programs to fall would limit participation between the City and  Southern Section teams in nonleague competition, Southern Section Associate  Commissioner Dean Crowley said Thursday.  </P> <P> The district begins a year-round school schedule on July 1, 1991, but fewer  than 10 of the district's 49 high schools will be open all year.  </P> <P> The remaining schools will follow a new calendar, with the majority closed from  late December until mid-February.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, the 1991 winter sports season would begin in late September  or early October and finish by the end of December. The move would affect  wrestling and boys' and girls' basketball and soccer.  </P> <P> Several City teams now participate in nonleague basketball tournaments with  Southern Section teams in December. A switch to fall would mean City teams  would instead be playing in their league and section championships at that  time.  </P> <P> And at the beginning of the City season, winter teams in the Southern Section  would not even have begun practicing yet.  </P> <P> "The only ones they (City teams) would have left to play against are  themselves," Crowley said.  </P> <P> Hal Harkness, the City Section commissioner, said the City will ask the  California Interscholastic Federation to allow teams to continue participating  in the state basketball and wrestling tournaments. Harkness said the seven-week  break "certainly wouldn't help" in tournament play.  </P> <P> Tom Byrnes, CIF commissioner, said City participation in the tournaments likely  will be discussed at the state federation's council meeting February in  Sacramento.

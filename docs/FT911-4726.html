			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Michelin Yesterday's announcement from Clermont-Ferrand confirms that Michelin workers are being asked to pay a heavy price for the ill-timed acquisition of Uniroyal Goodrich. Investors, though, have already had to count the cost. At last night's close of almost FFr90, the shares are trading at a quarter of their all-time high before the 1987 crash, while their value has roughly halved since autumn 1989 when the Dollars 1.5bn purchase of north America's second largest tyremaker catapulted Michelin to the top of the worldwide league. There are, of course, explanations besides Uniroyal for last year's dreadful figures and the company's own acknowledgement that it will not be back in the black until 1992. The global tyre business continues to be dogged by gross overcapacity, and Michelin has had little choice but to drive prices lower in a grim battle for market share. The sharp decline in the US dollar, moreover, certainly did not help. Having said that, though, the cost of financing the Uniroyal deal is, to a very large extent, responsible for the dire state of the balance sheet. Gearing is already 280 per cent if the FFr5.5bn of subordinated loans is treated as debt, and is likely to go well beyond 300 per cent before the year is out. Interest charges of around FFr3.1bn compare with operating profits of just FFr1.9bn. The burden is enormous even with a promised 12 per cent cut in employee numbers, a substantial reduction in capital expenditure and a fairer wind from the market place. However urgent the need for new capital, it is hard to see how balance sheet pressures can be quickly relieved. Existing shareholders would be badly diluted by a rights issue and any would-be industrial partner is certain to be put off by the company's cumbersome, consciously bid-proof ownership structure. So much can yet go wrong that only real risk-takers should ride this one for the recovery.</p>

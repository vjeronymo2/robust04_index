			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW RISES 16.44 AS INVESTORS CHEER JOB NEWS  </P> <P> The stock market posted a moderate gain Friday after a government report on  January employment boosted investor confidence about the economy and eased  recession fears.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 16.44 points to close at 2,602.70.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered decliners in nationwide trading of New York Stock  Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,004 issues up, 495 down and 473 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume came to 164.40 million shares, up from 154.58 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate held steady  at 5.3% last month while 275,000 new non-farm payroll jobs were created. The  number of new jobs was substantially higher than market expectations of about  160,000 jobs, analysts said.  </P> <P> "Stock investors took the attitude that employment is better than expected,  which means business is better than expected and the economy is not in a  recession," said Jack Solomon, equities analyst for Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Traders said renewed merger activity also helped to revive takeover stocks. In  particular, drug and biotechnology stocks got a boost from news that Roche  Holdings would acquire a majority stake in Genentech Corp.  </P> <P> Despite the rally, the market retraced some of its gains late in the day as  investors remained cautious ahead of next week's $30-billion Treasury  refunding, which could provide a better clue about the prospects for interest  rates.  </P> <P> Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed broadly higher in thin trading,  boosted by program buying. The Nikkei 225-share index, which gained a modest  17.47 points Thursday, soared 443.73 points to 37,650.15.  </P> <P> British shares edged higher, helped by early strength on Wall Street. By the  close the Financial Times 100-share index was 9.3 points up at 2,355.1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Economy's Strength Weakens Bonds  </P> <P> Bond prices tumbled after the government released the January employment report  suggesting that the economy is stronger than expected, diminishing chances for  lower interest rates.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost 3/4 point, or $7.50 for every $1,000  in face value. Its yield, which rises when the price declines, jumped to 8.50%  from 8.43% late Thursday.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8.25%, unchanged from late Thursday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Dollar, Gold Rise in Quiet Trading  </P> <P> The dollar finished mostly higher in light, uneventful trading on world  currency markets.  </P> <P> Gold prices rose, with gains more pronounced in overseas dealings. On New  York's Commodity Exchange, an ounce of gold gained 20 cents to close at  $418.20. Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $418.50 an ounce, up 85  cents from late Thursday.  </P> <P> The dollar rose following the better-than-expected employment report.  </P> <P> Most of the day's activity centered on the dollar and the West German mark,  both of which moved in a wide range.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Summer Demand Fuels Oil Prices  </P> <P> Expectations of strong gasoline demand early this summer fueled a strong rally  in oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, copper and precious metals rose; livestock and meat  were mixed; and grains and soybeans were mixed.  </P> <P> Gasoline futures posted the sharpest gains, settling 0.83 cent to 1.9 cents  higher, with the contract for delivery in March at 64.22 cents a gallon; West  Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 0.32 to 0.44 cent higher, with March at  23.02 cents gallon; heating oil was 0.77 cent to 1.52 cents higher, with March  at 58.26 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> Tables begin on D5  </P></p>

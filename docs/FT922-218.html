			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Italy fields economic team with attacking flair: The Amato government is facing an uphill task imposing unpopular measures THE RED chair reserved for the finance minister was noticeably empty when the new Italian cabinet of Prof Giuliano Amato met to be sworn in. Mr Giovanni Goria, the new minister, kept everyone waiting for 40 minutes because his aircraft had been delayed. The new government can ill afford delays as it sets out to tackle an alarming array of problems, the most pressing being the economy. Mr Goria, the 49-year-old Christian Democrat agriculture minister in the outgoing government, is the one politician in the new economic team. This underscores Prof Amato's intention to allow as much space as possible to the technocrats, even if politically unpopular polices have to be introduced. Mr Goria was finance minister from 1982 to 1987 under Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader; and in that period he had to tackle the end of a recession similar to the present. This experience should stand him in good stead and ensure proper co-ordination at the political level with the prime minister and the parties in parliament. One of the most negative features of the previous Andreotti government was that the budget and finance ministries, along with the prime minister's office, constantly outmanoeuvred the Treasury, staffed by Mr Guido Carli, the former governor of the Bank of Italy. Indeed, Mr Carli was used as a front to impress the international community of the seriousness of the government's economic intentions, while the government behind the scenes treated all commitments with the respect of calculations on the back of an envelope. This fate is unlikely to await Mr Piero Barucci, who has been drafted into the treasury from running Credito Italiano. Mr Carli has also left behind a beefed up treasury team. Mr Barucci, an academic economist, has been a banker since the eighties. He admits his appointment was a complete surprise and it is not clear how the Treasury will co-ordinate with the finance and budget ministries. Originally it seemed Prof Amato would merge them - their previous justification as separate ministries has merely been as a means of providing jobs controlling sensitive matters of money to members of the different parties in coalition. He has gone some way towards this by putting in two technician ministers and eliminating the Ministry for the South. This great uncontrolled dustbin of state aid and favours has been merged into the Ministry of the Budget run by Prof Franco Reviglio, an economics professor at Turin and a former finance minister. Prof Reviglio was also in charge of ENI, the state oil concern during the eighties, which had considerable investments in the South. The immediate task will be to draw up a special budget to cover 1992 budget deficit which has slipped from L128,000bn (Pounds 58bn) to L175,000bn (Pounds 79bn). Prof Amato has indicated that curbing the deficit will involve new fiscal measures plus spending cuts, most likely in the pensions, welfare benefits and local authority transfers. With trades unions already locked in inconclusive talks about the future of wages and labour costs, the economic team faces an uphill task imposing unpopular measures. Despite a slim 16-seat government majority in the chamber of deputies, the Amato government has several factors in its favour which can be exploited. The main political parties are weak and divided while firm leadership from the prime minister could create unexpected room for manoeuvre. Secondly, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro appears determined to give the premier his full backing. Finally, there is the plight of the lira and unsustainably high interest rates. The lira is under heavy pressure close to its floor of L765 against the D-Mark and will remain so until the markets detect signs of concrete government measures to tackle the deficit. Equally, interest rates are creating tensions at close to 15 per cent or nearly 10 per cent above inflation. Such high rates are part of the Bank of Italy's defences against the lira speculation; but they push up the cost of debt service and delay any recovery.</p>

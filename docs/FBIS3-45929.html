The scholars at the forum called for giving more priority to  basic education while economic development is set as the central  task.    They noted that leaders at various levels should attach more  importance to education.    Liu Bin, vice-minister in charge of the State Education  Commission, said that development of basic education has seen a  decline in China with problems such as shortage of educational  funds and postponing payment of teachers' salaries.    He said that the problems should be noted in society,  especially by leaders at various levels.    Gong Yuzhi, deputy director of the party Literature Research  Center of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party,  said that the question of education has an important position in  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and urged leaders in central departments and  localities to check the tendency to give education short shrift  in their economic development.    Tao Xiping, director of the Beijing Education Bureau and  deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), said that  China's compulsory education law has been promulgated for more  than seven years and now a teachers' law has also come into  force. He expressed hope that the implementation of the laws of  education should be enhanced so as to ensure the strategic  position of the development of education.    Lei Jieqiong, vice-chairwoman of the NPC Standing Committee,  and some leaders of democratic parties also attended the forum.</p>

Located in the Chang Jiang river delta, the province took  the  lead in the country in introducing the market mechanism.    Economists here agree that the rise of 18 percent in the  gross product last year was the result of the adoption of such a  mechanism.    According to statistics, between 90 percent and 95 percent  of  local economic operations are under market regulation, and more  and more enterprises are becoming independent corporations.    With a flourishing processing industry, Jiangsu had set up  4,600 markets for farm and sideline products, and industrial  goods by the end of last year.    These markets now offer 95 percent of the production  materials and equipment for the various economic entities in the  province.    A survey shows that Jiangsu has 589 share-holding companies  and 495 companies with responsibility for their own profits or  losses.    More than 5,000 small enterprises have been leased out and  545 merged into other, more efficient, organizations.    One tenth of the 100,000 rural industrial enterprises in the  province employ the share-holding system, and 110 rural  industrial enterprise groups have been formed.    Last year saw the industrial output value of rural  industrial  enterprises account for two-thirds of the province's total.    In addition, Jiangsu's improved investment conditions have  drawn a surge of interest from overseas business people.    At present, the province has more than 10,000 foreign-funded  enterprises with contractual investment totalling 18 billion  U.S. dollars.    More than 400 enterprise groups in the province are being  encouraged to employ share-holding systems this year in a bid to  compete better in the market.</p>

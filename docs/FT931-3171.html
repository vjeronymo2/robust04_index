			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Details satisfy majority of entrepreneurs - Small Business A CLEVER budget showing an understanding of the issues of concern to small businesses, was the near unanimous reaction of organisations representing small companies to the most wide ranging of small business budget packages in recent memory. For a sector of the business community which has been particularly hard hit by recession, the chancellor's combination of tax changes, reductions in red tape, and adjustments to business support schemes came as a welcome relief. Mr Norman Lamont's measures showed a fine feel for the detail of the problems which confront the small business owner within a framework which acknowledged the importance of their contribution to the economy. The measures covered the full spread of the small business community from tax simplification for the self employed through to an easing of the capital gains tax burden on successful entrepreneurs selling their businesses. The Loan Guarantee Scheme changes took in the struggling young business unable to match the bank manager's normal loan criteria. Cuts in export credit insurance premiums will help the medium-sized company trying to establish itself in overseas markets. But set against the wide range of measures tailored for the small business, or intended to have the greatest impact in that sector, were a number of general measures which will have an adverse affect on small firms and the self employed. Increases in petrol duties and the promise of steadily rising fuel prices in the years ahead were most unwelcome while the 1 percentage point rise in Class 4 National Insurance contributions by the self employed from 1994 were also met with dismay. Turning to the chancellor's specific proposals, the steps announced to reduce red tape were widely welcomed. The proposed simplification of the tax system for the self employed and the shift towards self-assessment hold out the promise of fewer night shifts spent making the tax books balance. The small business community has developed a wariness about the impact of attempts to deregulate so will wait to see how the changes work out in practice. The announcement of a consultation paper on the subject of the small firms audit was also welcomed but the small firms audit has been debated for more than a decade and the banks, the Inland Revenue and at least one accountancy organisation still have considerable reservations. more rapidly than the administration of the tax system it is the penalties which are imposed when the business owner gets it wrong. The announcement from the chancellor that the scope of the serious misdeclaration penalty is to be reduced and only the larger, persistent offenders will be pursued was particularly welcome. The decision to give customs officers discretion to mitigate VAT penalties depending on individual circumstances was a significant easing of what has been widely seen as a draconian penalty system. The decision to 'free' entrepreneurs locked into businesses which they could not sell without incurring sizeable capital gains tax liabilities will be welcomed by many ambitious business owners as well as by the venture capital industry. Providing rollover relief to entrepreneurs who reinvest the proceeds of a sale in another unquoted business, should encourage the 'serial entrepreneur,' the businessman who goes on to found a second and even a third business. Perhaps the most controversial move by the chancellor was to ease the conditions of the government's Loan Guarantee Scheme. He has moved to reduce the cost of scheme but his proposed changes will do nothing to reduce the dependence of the scheme on the willingness of the banks to take part. An improved loan guarantee scheme is still only a half-way house towards a subsidised small business loan fund which the small firms lobbyists have been calling for for several years. There is still no real replacement in sight for the Business Expansion Scheme which expires at the end of the year. Pleased though they are with budget measures announced yesterday, the small business groups are hoping for further action in this area in the November budget.</p>

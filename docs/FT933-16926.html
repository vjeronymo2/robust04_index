			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Stop the EC waste war LONG ACCUSTOMED to complaints from its EC partners about high interest rates, Germany now faces criticism for flooding its neighbours with another form of unhelpful export. The cause of the concern is the excessive quantity of waste packaging material generated by Germany's ambitious but ill-thought out recycling scheme. Having bowed to pressure from environmental lobbyists for hasty introduction of a country-wide collection system, Germany now finds the results are hurting its neighbours and itself. After several skirmishes on the subject among Community environment ministers in recent months, France on Tuesday threatened to ban German imports of packaging material. Other countries may be ready to follow. The episode highlights the need for sensible EC rules governing waste disposal in member countries. Unfortunately, an EC directive setting down common policies and objectives on packaging waste, under discussion for 2 1/2 years, is still a long way from agreement. The issue, which has important repercussions for the functioning of the single market, has been lamentably neglected during the past year. One of the more useful contributions of the six-month Belgian EC presidency which starts today would be to clear up what is rapidly becoming an EC-wide packaging mess. The nub of the problem is Germany's DSD recycling network, established after a 1991 law obliged manufacturers and retailers to re-absorb wrapping materials. Refuse gathered under the scheme, subsidised by both consumers and producers under a product labelling system, far outstrips the country's capacity to recycle it. As a result, large amounts of waste are roaming Europe, driving down prices for raw materials such as plastic, paper and board, and damaging recycling industries elsewhere. The system has other important drawbacks. Rules requiring companies to take part in recycling schemes on a country-by-country basis can discriminate against importers. The main beneficiaries have been German waste contractors: risk-free intermediaries which arrange collection and recycling, and pass on the bills to the central DSD company. Reflecting rising recycling costs, the organisation itself has announced it is in danger of financial collapse. Outside Germany, Spanish, French and UK producers have been hit by large quantities of subsidised German waste paper, while Belgium and the Netherlands have complained about too much German glass. The DSD's most counter-productive success has been in collecting plastic, which is technologically difficult - and thus uneconomic - to recycle. This year, 400,000 tonnes will be collected, of which an estimated 160,000 tonnes will be sold abroad. Indicating greater realism, Bonn now plans legislation to ease constraints on plastic incineration, which may lower excess supply. The EC's proposed directive, in its present draft form, offers only half a solution to the free-for-all. The plan calls for countries to recover or recycle a uniform 90 per cent of all packing waste over 10 years, compared with about 20 per cent at present. What is required is a graduated set of rules for different products, linking targets to ease of recycling in different markets. In the meantime, Germany should accept self-restraint on subsidised exports of surplus material. The last thing the EC needs is a war over waste.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / 'Slow bills' cited by bankrupt Euro Disney sub-contractor A CONTINUING row over sub-contractors' claims that Euro Disney has been too slow in paying their bills came to a head yesterday, with one of the claimants filing for bankruptcy. Roiret, a Lyons-based business specialising in electronics and audiovisuals, alleged the bankruptcy was precipitated by unpaid bills, notably from Euro Disney which plans to open the Euro Disneyland theme park on April 12. Roiret's collapse comes only a week after Le Tendre et Sautiere, a Saint-Nazaire-based construction company, sued Euro Disney for the FFr10m (Pounds 1.02m) it claimed it was owed for its work at the park. It also follows the formation of a lobby of 16 disgruntled Euro Disney sub-contractors, claiming to represent 300 different companies, to try to extract better terms of payment from the company. For its part, Euro Disney claims the complaints are unfounded. It issued a statement yesterday denying responsibility for Roiret's problems, adding that it hoped to find an 'amicable solution' with its sub-contractors. The sub-contractors' troubles are linked to the depressed state of the French construction industry, where small and medium-sized companies are finding life particularly tough. Moreover, the French press has seized upon any rumblings of discontent at the theme park with even more than its usual ferocity. The lobby group has threatened to step up its campaign, possibly by staging demonstrations, unless it reaches an agreement with Euro Disney by the middle of next month.</p>

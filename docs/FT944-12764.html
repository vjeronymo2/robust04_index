			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Company News This Week: J Sainsbury - Other companies J Sainsbury: The UK's largest food retailer reports interim results on Wednesday, and Kwik Save, the biggest discount chain, reports its finals on Thursday. Pre-tax profits forecasts for Sainsbury range from Pounds 430m to about Pounds 460m, with the consensus at around Pounds 445m - a 7 per cent increase from a restated Pounds 417m last year. Forecasts for Kwik Save are concentrated around Pounds 130m, an increase of only 3 per cent. Kwik Save is suffering from the increased competition in the market, which is eroding its price advantage over the superstore groups.</p>

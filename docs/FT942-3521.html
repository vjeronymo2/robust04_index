			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Dutch Alcoa chief sees squeeze on aluminium groups Smaller west European aluminium companies will be increasingly squeezed by east European rivals and global operators in their own market, said Mr Berry Bemelmans, president of Alcoa Nederland, Reuter reports from Drunen, the Netherlands. Mr Bemelmans said that companies needed to establish a significant presence in the key packaging, aerospace or transportation aluminium sectors to ensure their survival. A further challenge would come as Russian producers moved from exports of ingots and extrusions to products with greater added value. Mr Bemelmans said Alcoa Nederland, through its ownership by Aluminum Company of America, was the first western company to establish a significant presence in the east European aluminium market.</p>

The assessments for each site and licensee, as stated above, will not distinguish between site-specific and generic services provided by FEMA personnel and FEMA contractors. Licensees with multiple sites will receive consolidated bills. FEMA will forward one bill to each licensee during the first quarter of the fiscal year, with payment due within 30 days. There will be a one-time adjustment to the billing cycle in the first quarter of FY 1995 to accommodate a transition to the new methodology. During this quarter, an adjusted final bill for FY 1994 REP Program services will be issued along with the bill for all of FY 1995, with a possible second bill if minor adjustments are necessary. In order to avoid having the licensees pay two bills during the same fiscal year (FY 1994) for activities performed in two different fiscal years, FEMA, with the concurrence of the Department of the Treasury, will structure the due date of these two bills so that the adjusted bill for FY 1994 will be due and payable by the end of December 1994 and the full bill for FY 1995 will be due and payable in January of 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;354.7  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Failure to pay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In any case where FEMA believes that a licensee has failed to pay a prescribed fee required under this part, procedures will be implemented in accordance with 44 CFR part 11, subpart C, to effectuate collections under the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3711  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James L.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, we propose to establish procedures for closing Deposit Accounts in cases of failure to respond to requests for replenishment or repeated attempts to charge fees against an account with insufficient funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Proposed Fee for Opening and Maintaining a Deposit Account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When we began our study and cost analysis of the Deposit Account system we sought to identify each of the work load items associated with the system and to determine what it costs the Office to perform the particular service. The costs for opening an account run, on the average, to $50.00, to cover necessary correspondence, accounting procedures, and clerical work. We have also established that the same amount, $50.00, would cover the total annual cost involved in servicing the account. Thus, rather than establishing separate fees for each Deposit Account service performed, we believe that it would be more economical for both account holders and the Office to establish a flat fee of $50.00 for opening an account and another $50.00 annual fee to be deducted from accounts each January for maintaining the account. We also propose to remove the requirement that a Deposit Account holder must make 12 transactions a year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Proposed Fee in Case of Insufficient Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The storage and servicing of ``insufficient funds'' claims is not only costly, but it is also a service of direct benefit to Deposit Account holders. When an ordinary, non-Deposit Account claim comes in without funds its handling depends on whether the work is unpublished or published. If the work is unpublished, the entire case (application, deposit, and accompanying correspondence) is usually returned to the sender. If the work is published, the case is held and the sender is given an opportunity to remit the missing funds; then, lacking a prompt reply, we forward the deposits to the Library of Congress in accordance with our regulations based on Sections 407 and 408 of the Copyright Code. Copies forwarded to the Library are not retrievable for registration purposes and, if another copyright registration is attempted, the remitter must refile the application and replace the deposit materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast, when a Deposit Account holder submits a claim to be charged against an account with a balance insufficient to cover it, all of the material submitted is held to await replenishment of the account. Because their material is held rather than being returned or forwarded to the Library, account holders are spared the expenses of postage, handling, and replacing applications and deposits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the substantial extra workload required, we have calculated the costs connected with handling each case of insufficient Deposit Account funds at no less than $50.00. We therefore propose to deduct a handling fee of $50.00 from any Deposit Account whose remitter attempts to charge a copyright claim (or other fee service) when there are insufficient funds in the Deposit Account. However, we do not propose to make this change cumulative. Regardless of how many or how long claims are pending during the period when the account is depleted, we propose to make only one $50.00 charge, to be deducted from the account at the time a replenishment check is credited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Proposed Fee in Case of Uncollectible Check  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have calculated the extra cost of handling each case involving a check received for replenishing a Deposit Account that is returned as uncollected at no less than $35.00 per check. We therefore propose to establish a fee of $35.00 to be charged against the account in each such case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Proposed Changes in Minimum Account Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We do not propose to change the current monetary requirements with respect to the minimum amount required to open a Deposit Account ($250.00) and the minimum amount required for a remittance to replenish an account (also $250.00). However, we now propose to establish new procedures and requirements for handling cases in which a balance drops below $100.00, as well as those in which the balance is insufficient to cover pending claims. In both cases (Deposit Accounts with a balance of less than the $100.00 minimum and those with a balance of any amount that is not sufficient to cover the charges made against it) the Copyright Office will notify the account holder of the deficiency and state a reasonable deadline (we recommend 60 days) after the date of the Notice by which replenishment must be received. If replenishment is not made before the deadline, we propose to dispose of pending claims, in the same way we dispose of ordinary, non-Deposit Account claims received with payment of insufficient fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also propose to set forth and implement a procedure for closing a Deposit Account when the holder has attempted to charge fees against an account with insufficient funds more than two times within a calendar year. In such cases, an initial service charge ($250 deposit plus $50 opening fee) would be required to re-open the account).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Official Point of Contact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Traditionally we have had one contact person for each Deposit Account. We send monthly statements of account, notification of insufficient funds, and announcements relating to Deposit Accounts to this person. We have become aware that in some cases this contact person is in a corporate business office or accounting department and may have little communication with the persons in the organization who file copyright applications and make other fee service requests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because we now intend to impose fees in cases where Deposit Accounts have insufficient funds to cover pending charges, or where a replenishment check is returned uncollectible, we believe that Deposit Account holders need to establish mechanisms for communicating information regarding account balances and copyright service requests when these are handled by different units in their organizations. Specifically, we believe that each Deposit Account holder should provide us with the name, organizational title, and organizational address and number of an ``official point of contact'' for the account. All statements and other communications with respect to the account will be diverted to that individual, who will then be held responsible for monitoring the account and maintaining sufficient funds in it. The Deposit Account holder would also need to inform us when the person who is the official point of ``contact'' has charged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 11. Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It may be possible to implement some of these proposed changes without amending our existing regulations. We invite comments on the proposal in general and any other alternatives for improving Deposit Account operations and recovering costs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: July 19, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barbara Ringer,  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Register of Copyrights. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Approved:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James H.

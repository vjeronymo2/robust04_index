			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Isetan suffers 72% drop in first six months ISETAN, the leading Japanese department store company which invested heavily in modernising its stores over the past two years, suffered a 72 per cent drop in taxable profits to Y1.36bn (Dollars 11.3m) for the first half to the end of September from Y4.7bn a year earlier. Sales fell 2.7 per cent to Y213bn. The Tokyo based company said the fall was mainly due to a sharp rise in depreciation charges to cover the modernisation programme. The company is to cut the salaries of 26 top executives and the year-end bonuses of 300 department heads by 5 per cent to save about Y41m. Isetan is maintaining its interim dividend of Y5 a share in spite of a fall in earnings per share to Y2.37 from Y10.2 a year earlier.</p>

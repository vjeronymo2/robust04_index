			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: A determined stamp of authority - The changes to Lonrho's structure RESTRUCTURING Lonrho's complicated mix of businesses was always going to be the easy part. Mr Dieter Bock has now chosen to change the international trading company's board, an altogether more delicate task. The German financier, who at the beginning of the year acquired an 18.8 per cent stake in the conglomerate and was then appointed joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland, is determined to stamp his authority on the company with the appointment of non-executive directors. Lonrho's board, meeting on Thursday, is expected to approve the appointment of its first two non-executives for two decades: Mr Peter Harper, director of Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate and Mr Stephen Walls, chairman of Albert Fisher, a food processor and distributor. Mr Rowland, who has been Lonrho's guiding force for 30 years and has been opposed to non-executives since the 'straight eight' directors unsuccessfully tried to remove him in 1973, is not expected to block the moves. Their arrival should mark the beginning of a number of changes to the way Lonrho is run which could prove uncomfortable to some of the board's longer-serving members. The new directors will be set a number of delicate tasks. They will join its remuneration committee and re-evaluate directors' pay, They will also determine what to pay Mr Bock, who has not drawn a salary since becoming joint chief executive. They will also set up the company's first ever audit committee, to review its auditing procedures and financial performance on a regular basis. Mr Bock wants to concentrate on three core businesses; mining, hotels and agriculture. But despite the sale of many of the group's businesses, including the lossmaking Observer, Lonrho still has a slightly negative cashflow - though it could turn neutral next year. There are likely to be further disposals outside the three core areas. Profits from these could be significant if the recent sale of a property in Brussels is any guide. It fetched Pounds 30m, to yield a Pounds 13m profit. That is a substantial contribution to earnings, yet few of Lonrho's share-holders probably knew the company owned that asset. Profits are likely to receive a further boost from a reduction in the costs of running the London headquarters at Cheapside, which are estimated to be more than Pounds 20m a year. There are likely to be significant cuts in the number of head office staff from the current 160 and the number of executive board members, currently 12, will also come down. Some of the full-time executives, who have grown used to the somewhat idiosyncratic manner in which Mr Rowland has effectively run Lonrho for the past 30 years, may be wary of some of the planned changes. One of Lonrho's few institutional shareholders, while welcoming the appointment of new non-executives, yesterday voiced concern as to whether they will be in a strong enough position to push through the changes needed to rebuild bridges with the investment community. Mr Harper, who has been responsible for Hanson's investor relations, has been criticised in the past by some fund managers for not keeping them sufficiently briefed on the company's affairs. Last year Mr Walls was forced out as chief executive of Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper company, after losing a board room battle over strategy. Both men will however have the full backing of Mr Bock, who took full responsibility for finding them. He plans to add to their ranks with a further one or two non-executive appointments in the coming months. In order to establish better relations with institutions, which own a relatively small proportion of Lonrho's shares compared with other big companies, Mr Bock believes the company has to become a more open company. Lonrho has only four big shareholders: Fidelity, with 8.9 per cent; UBS Phillips and Drew Fund Managers, with 2 per cent; Postel with 1.5 per cent; and Genting, a Malaysian plantations and gaming group, with 3.9 per cent. For all the speed with which Mr Bock is trying to transform Lonrho, he cannot expect an overnight increase in the proportion of shares held by institutions. They are likely to want to see the effects of his changes before buying.</p>

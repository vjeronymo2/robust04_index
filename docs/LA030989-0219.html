			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BENGALS' WILSON IN DRUG CLINIC AGAIN  </P> <P> The Cincinnati Bengals say they are paying for another drug rehabilitation  program for suspended fullback Stanley Wilson, who still awaits word from the  National Football League on whether he will ever be allowed to play in the NFL  again.  </P> <P> Wilson, 27, a former University of Oklahoma star from Carson, checked into a  drug rehabilitation clinic in Inglewood on March 1, said Mike Brown, the  Bengals' assistant general manager.  </P> <P> Brown said Wilson was due to stay at the clinic for a week to 10 days and was  being treated as an in-patient. The Bengals are paying the cost of Wilson's  stay at the clinic through an insurance policy, Brown said.  </P> <P> Bengals general manager Paul Brown has said his team has no further plans for  Wilson as a player. Wilson, a 1983 Bengals draftee, scored two touchdowns in  the NFL playoffs but was suspended hours before the Bengals' Jan. 22 Super Bowl  appearance in Miami because of evidence that he had relapsed into drug use.  </P> <P> Wilson has asked the NFL to reinstate him. Commissioner Pete Rozelle has not  announced his response.  </P> <P> The NFL suspended Wilson for the 1985 and 1987 seasons because of cocaine use.  The Bengals said the NFL told Wilson, when he was reinstated the last time in  April, 1988, that it would be his last chance to stay drug-free if he wanted to  continue playing in the league.  </P></p>

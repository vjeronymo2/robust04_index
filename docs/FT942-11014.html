			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: B&amp;J board agrees to Pounds 56m cash injection from Pepkor Pepkor, South Africa's biggest retail group, last night clinched a deal to inject up to Pounds 56m into Brown &amp; Jackson, which owns the lossmaking Poundstretcher chain of discount retailers. The recommended agreement gives the South Africans an option to take a 63 per cent stake in B&amp;J, if they put in the full amount. The chain of 230 Poundstretcher outlets would eventually be combined with the 45 clothing outlets, Your More Stores, which Pepkor already owns in Scotland, creating the UK's biggest discount retail chain. The Pepkor offer is being recommended by B&amp;J's board, even although it last month recommended a rescue offer from the Weisfelds, the millionaire couple who created the What Everyone Wants discount clothing chain. B&amp;J shareholders were due to vote at an EGM on Monday to approve the Weisfeld plan. That meeting will go ahead, but the first item will be a motion to adjourn until shareholders can consider the latest offer. Mr Gerald and Mrs Vera Weisfeld had offered to injected an initial Pounds 6m to meet B&amp;J's immediate working capital needs in return for a 19 per cent stake and two seats on the board. Pepkor will make no offer to existing shareholders. In exchange for their cash, the South Africans will receive a mixture of new shares and loan notes. They will inject an initial Pounds 20m to pay off trade creditors and remove B&amp;J from the control of its banks. The agreement was only reached after the market closed, following a day of frantic negotiations in Guernsey, where the South Africans set up an offshore holding company. B&amp;J's shares closed yesterday  1/4 p higher at 6 3/4 p, valuing the group at Pounds 43m. Mr Christo Wiese, Pepkor's executive chairman, said the group owned 1,700 stores in southern Africa and employed 40,000 people. It wanted to diversify internationally and had been keeping track of B&amp;J for several years. He said: 'B&amp;J in its present state requires decisive and immediate action, including the full initial injection of Pounds 20m contained in the Pepkor proposal. 'Considerable work is required after that to return the business to profitability.' Of the Weisfelds' offer, Mr John Jackson, B&amp;J chairman, said that he believed that Pepkor represented 'a better option to secure the long-term future of the Brown &amp; Jackson group while providing value to existing shareholders.' Pepkor denied rumours that the deal involved Mr Philip Green, the controversial former chairman of Amber Day, which bought WEW from the Weisfelds in 1990. Mr Green is now running the privately-owned Xception chain of discount stores. Mr Wiese said: 'We have known Philip for years, working as we do in the same business, but this is our deal - he's not involved.'</p>

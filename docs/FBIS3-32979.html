The Finance Ministry is having difficulty accepting  the 1993 and 1994 accounts of the state governments.  Additionally, state enterprises are not submitting the results  of their 1993 activities nor are they submitting their programs  for 1994. The government does not know the volume of the  surplus of 1993 accounts that will be disbursed by the Treasury  in 1994. Jose Cechin, the Finance Ministry deputy secretary for  economic policy, told the IMF that in 1994 Brazil's public  accounts will have an operational deficit (excluding monetary  correction) equivalent to zero. In other words, neither a  surplus nor a deficit.    Jose Fajgenbaun, head of the IMF delegation, who on 10  February held a brief meeting with Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso, termed the congressional approval of the  Social Emergency Fund during the first round of voting as "an  important stage toward attacking the imbalance in the public  accounts." He emphasized that the government needs to implement  more measures to maintain the economic plan.</p>

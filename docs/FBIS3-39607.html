			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Air Force Leaves Bierset"] </F>   [Excerpt] This year the Air Force is to disband three large  units. They are the third wing of the Bierset base (near Liege)  and two logistical units. The operation is part of the Army  restructuring plan which was approved in January 1992 by the  government.    The Air Force will disband the third wing on 31 March and  leave the base at the end of June. The Mirages have already  been withdrawn from active service. Some weeks ago the Air  Force flew the last aircraft of that type to the reserve base in  Weelde (Antwerp) for storage. There they are waiting for a  buyer. Sabca [Belgian Aeronautic Construction Company] was  instructed to look for interested parties. Yesterday it emerged  that the Philippines were a possible purchaser.    The facilities at Bierset will be transferred to the Army's  light aircraft unit. It will become the base for the Agusta  A109 helicopters and the Alouettes which have been brought back  from bases in Germany.    This year, two of the Air Force's five logistical units will  also disappear. Only the "maintenance," "communication," and  "support" wings will remain on the Evere base.    The Air Force chief of staff announced yesterday that in the  coming months 31 F-16s will also be transferred to Weelde.  These planes are to be withdrawn from active service due to the  cutbacks announced in July 1993. The Air Force also wants to  sell these aircraft. One plane will be stationed in  Saffraanberg (St. Truiden) and serve as teaching material.    The military training center in Koksijde will close in June  due to the abolition of compulsory military service. The last  conscripts will then receive their training in Florennes or  Kleine Brogel, depending on their linguistic roles. The Defense  Ministry will soon centralize the basic training of all Air  Force personnel in Saffraanberg. [passage omitted]</p>

We believe that good-neighborliness with the  PRC is strategically important, the minister declared. Defining  the principal criteria of Russia's foreign policy in the  Asia-Pacific area, Andrey Kozyrev said:    [Begin Kozyrev recording] First, the importance of this  region to Russia's future is increasing, above all because the  economic role of the Asian part of our own country is growing.    Second, the system of international relations in the  Asia-Pacific region -- and, indeed, throughout the world -- is  neither monopolar nor bipolar but is becoming increasingly  multipolar. I think that echoes of great power pretensions,  including the idea that there should be one sole superpower, and  the ideology of regional or global alliances of some countries  in the Asia-Pacific region against others are receding into the  past. The future of the region, and the world as a whole, lies  not in power rivalry but in cooperation and interaction, above  all among the great powers. The danger that a region of major  military conflicts could emerge is now at its lowest level. The  significance of the military factor has been markedly reduced.    At the same time, there is considerable potential here for  tension. Not only is there the legacy of the cold war but there  is tension created by new problems -- the question of access to  the resources of the seas and the Pacific Ocean, including the  seabed, and a number of border disputes. Religious and ethnic  extremism is dramatically acute in Afghanistan. It also poses a  threat to Tajikistan. Unless we tackle these problems jointly,  the outcome could be explosive for a region which includes both  Russia and China, a region which is, of course, of vital  interest to us.    In these circumstances the key issue is the threat of the  spread of nuclear weapons and missile technology. I am sure  that it is not in the security interests of any part of the  region, including Russia, China, and India, for such a  development of events to happen.    Fourth, the 21st century will clearly be a century of rapid  economic development in the Pacific. Developing economic might  will not threaten neighbors but on the contrary will create  favorable conditions for economic growth throughout the region.  In other words competition in this sphere is mutually  advantageous competition. We welcome China's participation in  the recent Seattle meeting of Asia-Pacific states as an  important event. For our part we count on friendly China's  support in getting Russia included in the region's economic  unification.    Fifth, in Asia, as in other regions, economic progress helps  to safeguard the principal human rights and freedoms. We favor  the formation of a security community in the Asia-Pacific  region, which anyone who wants will be able to join. In this  respect we should, of course, bear in mind Europe's experience,  but at the same time go our own, Asian way. [end recording]    [Announcer] The proposal to base bilateral relations on  constructive partnership was made for the first time during the  visit to the PRC by Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey  Kozyrev. Revealing this idea, Andrey Kozyrev said:    [Begin Kozyrev recording] What could this new concept mean?  Above all, the further strengthening of mutual trust and  security. Guided by the policy of good-neighborliness with the  PRC, Russia still fully adheres to the principles of the  declaration on the principles of relations signed last year at  summit level. This includes the whole range of the two parties'  obligations to comply with the principle of not using force  against each other or in international relations in any form,  including not being the first to use nuclear weapons.    We are also in favor of further progress at the first  Russian- Chinese talks in Asia on military detente and  confidence-building measures in the border region. As permanent  members of the Security Council, Russia and China advocate  resolving the problems of nuclear weapons on the Korean  peninsula on the basis of International Atomic Energy Agency  guarantees. On the whole, with regard to our cooperation on the  Security Council, I would like to emphasize that we are  satisfied with the existing level of interaction.    The enhancement of trade and economic cooperation is an  important aspect of our partnership. We are ready to  participate in major economic development projects being  implemented by China, such as the construction of the Three  Gorges hydroelectric power station complex. Russia is very  interested in the modernization -- or participation in the  modernization -- of Chinese industrial enterprises formerly set  up with the help of the Soviet Union. Cooperation in border  regions is one of the quickest and most effective ways to  develop economic ties with - it goes without saying - a  coordinating role for the governments of both sides.

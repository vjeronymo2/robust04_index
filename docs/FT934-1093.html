			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Laporte powder coatings sale Laporte, the UK's second largest independent chemicals group, is to dispose of the powder coatings businesses which it bought as part of its Pounds 129m takeover of Evode in January. The company has sold its powder coatings operations in the UK and New Zealand to HB Fuller of St Paul, Minnesota, US, and its 25 per cent holding in a powder coatings associate to its partner, Dexter Corporation in the US, which now owns all the company. The total consideration for the sale of these businesses, which made an operating profit of Pounds 1.04m, amounts to approximately Pounds 15.7m. The disposals are regarded as non-core businesses and 'represent a substantial advance in selling those interests acquired with Evode which are not central to Laporte,' said Mr Ken Minton, Laporte chief executive. Laporte has also completed the sale of a small South African footwear business, Chamberlain Phipps, for Pounds 1.1m. It has also bought the Aztec Catalyst Company, based in Cleveland, Ohio, from Phillips Petroleum for an undisclosed sum. In 1992, Aztec made an operating profit of Dollars 5.2m (Pounds 3.48m) on sales of Dollars 33m. Aztec is the third largest supplier of organic peroxides - used in making PVC, polystyrene and acrylics - in the US. Their manufacture is one of the main activities of the organic chemicals division, one of five core areas on which Laporte is focusing. Laporte intends to invest up to Dollars 8m in Aztec over the next two years to rebuild manufacturing plant and enhance safety standards.</p>

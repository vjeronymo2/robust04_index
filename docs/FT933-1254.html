			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Grain forecast raised again THE INTERNATIONAL Wheat Council has increased its estimate for this year's world grain harvest by 7m tonnes to 1.39bn tonnes from its August forecast of 1.383bn, which was itself up 10m tonnes from a month earlier. Most of the latest increase was attributed to coarse grains such as maize and barley. In its latest monthly report the IWC forecasts wheat production at 575m tonnes, up from 562m tonnes the previous year and an increase of 2m tonnes from its forecast last month. The expected decline in the wheat harvest in the European Community, central Europe and the US is expected to be more than offset by bigger crops in Argentina, Canada, China and Russia. World production of coarse grains is estimated to be 5m tonnes higher than last month's prediction at 815m tonnes - but this marks a drop from 861m tonnes in 1991-1992. The decline in the coarse grains harvest is largely the result of disastrous floods in the US corn belt. But India, Russia and Ukraine are now forecast to produce more maize than had been expected. The IWC pointed to some quality problems with this year's wheat because of wet harvest conditions in France, Germany and the UK as well as early frost in Canada. Rain also delayed US planting.</p>

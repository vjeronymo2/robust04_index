			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> If he weren't the owner of two restaurants, Gerard Ferry never would have  noticed the strange coincidence.  </P> <P> Ferry received a letter at L'Orangerie from a man who claimed that on a recent  visit "one of your servers accidentally spilled a drink down the front of my  suit. The incident did not anger me because I was a waiter while in school and  accidents do happen. The server apologized and told me to just send in my  cleaning bill."  </P> <P> Funny thing, though. When Ferry opened his mail at Pastel, he received a letter  that was identical except that "Pastel" had been substituted for "L'Orangerie"  and "Beverly Hills" for "Los Angeles." And a copy of the same bill was  enclosed.  </P> <P> Next, Ferry related, "I call (owner) Eddie (Kerkhofs) at the Le Dome, and  Eddie, he gets the same letter." So did Locanda Veneta's Jean Louis de Mori,  and Tuttobene's owner, Sylvio de Mori (Jean Louis' brother).  </P> <P> Considering the small scale of the fraud attempt, no one has contacted police  about the letter writer, whose address turned out to be a post office box in  Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> "No, no, no," Ferry quipped. "I have enough problems with (Times restaurant  reviewer) Ruth Reichl."  </P> <P> "Why join a fitness club when you can buy muscles for $1.85?" writes  mid-Wilshire resident Jim Bishop. Despite the spelling on the label of the  package that he bought in Little Tokyo (see photo), it actually contained  mussels.  </P> <P> We've read all about sign-waving malathion opponents. But there was a  pro-malathion sign out the other day at a gas station on La Brea Avenue.  </P> <P> "Spraying Tonight!" it said. "Car Covers $5.99."  </P> <P> It's always a thrill to see works of art in progress. There's the blue stripe  that has languished on the south side of the L.A. Convention Center for weeks  while officials try to decide if that's the color they want to paint the  building.  </P> <P> A while back, the letters GO suddenly appeared on the Wells Fargo building  downtown -- a "visibility test" for its forthcoming Wells Fargo logo. The  company's stagecoach symbol was junked. Too subtle, perhaps.  </P> <P> Now comes Sa Ba, a test logo for Sanwa Bank's new building, an  otherwise-impressive combination of rose granite and turquoise trim on Figueroa  Street. Already, letter writers in the L.A. Downtown News are accusing the bank  of "uglifying" the skyline, in the manner of the 73-story First Interstate  tower with its tacked-on "I" logos.  </P> <P> "When a company puts that much money into a location and all the competition  around you has managed to put their names on their buildings, it's a little  tough to say we'll forgo the logo," said a spokeswoman for Sa Ba -- excuse us,  Sanwa.  </P> <P> The recorded message on the telephone answering machine for the sheriff's  patrol in Paramount says: "Hello. You've reached Deputies Pierre Nadeau and  Augie Pando. They can't come to the phone right now because they're tied up."  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> The first combination automobile-airplane, the Waterman Studebaker, was  produced in Santa Monica in 1937. It never really got off the ground.  </P></p>

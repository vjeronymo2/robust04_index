			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Wellcome drug ready for approval Clinical trials on a drug being developed by Centocor, a US biotechnology company, and the UK drugs company Wellcome have been successful, according to research published today in the medical journal The Lancet. The trials were phase III, the latest stage, and Wellcome will submit the drug for approval in June in Germany, where research was carried out. Further trials are likely to be conducted in the US before submission for approval there, said Wellcome yesterday. Stockbroker Lehman Brothers estimates the potential market for the drug, Panorex, at up to Dollars 100m a year. Panorex was used in 189 patients with advanced colorectal cancer, alongside conventional surgery. The researchers found that the drug extended life and postponed the return of the disease. Colorectal cancer has a high survival rate if caught early, but the death rate increases rapidly if the diagnosis is late. Wellcome owns almost 5 per cent of Centocor as the result of a deal last November in which Wellcome paid Dollars 100m for the stake, some technologies and in staged payments as research proceeded. They can be made in a laboratory to attach themselves to specific parts of the body such as cancer tumours and then activate the body's defence mechanisms. They have many uses, but as an anti-tumour agent they have had a patchy success record.</p>

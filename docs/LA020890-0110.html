			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROWTH/ A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS FIGHT TO KEEP FARMLAND;  </P> <P> SANTA PAULA: A LAND-CONVERSION STUDY APPROVED BY THE CITY COUNCIL AND PAID FOR  BY A DEVELOPER ANGERS CITIZENS.  </P> <P> Eager to preserve their predominantly rural community, nearly 200 Santa Paula  residents packed a City Council meeting this week to oppose possible  development of 500 acres of prime agricultural land.  </P> <P> A study being performed by STA of Newport Beach will help decide the future of  the privately owned land that lies to the west of city boundaries.  </P> <P> "Every citizen of Santa Paula knows and recognizes that the essence and core of  Santa Paula's quality as a community is its environmental character and every  citizen who has any pride in the community points proudly to the beauty and  bounty of our agriculture," said lifetime resident Tom Beach, who owns citrus  and avocado groves on the city's east side.  </P> <P> "A proposal to condemn 500 prime acres to a housing development is a gut punch  to the environmental character of the town," he said.  </P> <P> Orange County developer Harry Tancredi, president of Circle T Corp. in Santa  Ana, provided the City Council with a $187,000 interest-free loan for the land  study in October.  </P> <P> The deal worried some residents because Tancredi is interested in building  between 120 and 150 upscale houses in the section.  </P> <P> But Mayor Les Maland, who at one point threatened to clear the room, reminded  Monday night's crowd that the city is under no obligation to annex the land or  to permit development.  </P> <P> His words did little to mollify the crowd.  </P> <P> Jim Proctor, a spokesman for the recently created Citizens for Responsible  Development, called on the council to cancel its contract with STA.  </P> <P> He also claimed that the City Council had not adequately informed residents  about Santa Paula's plans for growth.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Kay Wilson responded that citizen concern was being expressed too  late and said residents could have learned of the plans by reading the paper.  </P> <P> The crowd greeted her comments with a resounding chorus of boos.  </P> <P> Another public hearing on the plan is scheduled for Feb. 27.  </P></p>

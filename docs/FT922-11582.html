			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (29): Bondlike qualities with tax postponed - In spite of 11 per cent yields, analysts warn investors also to look at 'cover' INVESTMENT TRUSTS have sprouted numerous bells and whistles in recent years, in an effort to broaden the consumer base for the product. For the risk-averse, the most attractive fillip has been the zero-coupon preference share, a key ingredient in a formula designed to offer the highest possible returns to those who are willing to take some equity risk. Zero-coupon securities are precisely that: they will pay zero interest, or dividends, during their life. However, upon maturity, the investor is entitled to receive a sum far greater than the initial investment. The maturity sum is paid for out of the capital appreciation of the share portfolio. If one were to calculate the rate by which the capital had appreciated each year during the life of the trust, the yield would approximate to a rate of interest. Part of the attraction of zero-coupon preference shares is their tax status. Investors incur no tax on the implied gain in value of their securities, and only pay capital gains tax upon maturity. Thus, their tax status makes them particularly unattractive for inclusion in a personal equity plan, warns Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. 'The value of a Pep is to avoid paying tax on the dividend stream,' he notes. So when there is no dividend or interest stream, it is nonsensical to try to protect it against taxation. Effectively, 'zeros' supplant the role of bank debt within an investment trust, Mr Aaron says. They allow borrowing to occur and, because there is no interest paid, the investment trust can use funds which otherwise would have serviced bank loans to pay higher dividends to holders of income shares. Zero-coupon preference shares carry the chief characteristic of bonds - a fixed rate of return to maturity. Often, they are the highest ranking security, with investors having first claim on the investment trust's assets in the event of failure. However, purchasers are warned to read the small print, to learn where they would stand in the queue of creditors. Among the few investment trusts which do not rank preference shareholders on top is Scottish National Investment Trust. There, stepped-preference shareholders and debenture holders have first charge on the trust's assets in liquidation. And while the majority of preference shares currently are offering yields of around 11 per cent per year, net of tax, analysts warn that it is not enough for investors to look at yield to maturity: they must also look at 'cover', and gauge the ability of the fund manager to produce returns that grow sufficiently quickly. If cover is insufficient upon maturity, investors will get back less than was promised on issue. Among zero-coupon preference shares with the worst cover are those of Olim Convertible Trust, which in early February yielded 12.73 per cent to maturity, while the trust's assets were only sufficient to cover 71 per cent of the preference shares' face value at maturity. The fund manager must earn returns of 4 per cent a year to cover preference shareholders, Mr Aaron notes. At the other end of the scale, River Plate &amp; General was offering a yield to maturity in 1996 of 9.4 per cent, but the redemption value was covered 2.15 times by the assets of the trust. 'That means the market could fall by 50 per cent and you would still get your money if you held the preference shares,' said Mr Aaron. However, if the final maturity year of an investment trust's zero-coupon preference shares coincides with, say, an October 1987-type stock market crash, 'you're up the creek without a paddle,' he added. Meanwhile, some investment trust analysts have pointed out that there may be conflicts of interest between holders of zero-coupon preference shares and those who hold the income-producing ordinary shares. John Korwin-Szymanowksi, analyst at SG Warburg, points out that, in some investment trusts, fund managers have purchased high-income producing shares  -which by definition are often those of weaker companies - to the detriment of preference-share holders who benefit from capital appreciation. Mr Aaron notes: 'If you're looking for high-yielders, you can be picking some pretty dreadful stocks.' Recently, Tor Investment Trust took the unusual step of appointing a new fund manager, Sun Life. Sun Life is a holder of Tor's income shares but has a still larger stake in the capital shares. According to Mr Korwin-Szymanowski, Tor's capital shares had risen only 27 per cent in the past five years, producing an inflation-adjusted loss for shareholders. Meanwhile, its income shares had well outperformed the market. 'You require a strong board of directors to keep the fund in line,' he said. Indeed, the second largest stock holding in Tor's investment portfolio in July 1990 was the now-defunct Polly Peck.</p>

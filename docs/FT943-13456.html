			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Monaco (7): Newcomer finds its niche - The principality has become an international landmark for art sales Christie's, the celebrated London auction house, always knew that last winter's sale in Monte Carlo of the contents of a Parisian apartment owned by Hubert de Givenchy, the French fashion designer, would be a rather special event: but it did not realise quite how special until after the auction was over. Givenchy had shown the same fastidious taste in furnishing his apartment as in creating his haute couture. His rue de Grenelle apartment had contained some exquisite examples of French painting and furnishings, including the famous Hanover chandelier, a stunning piece in sterling silver. Christie's had calculated that the sale of his collection should raise between FFr100m and FFr110m. Yet the auction itself achieved a total of FFr155m - which included a successful bid of FFr18m for the Hanover chandelier alone. For Humphrey Butler, head of Christie's in France, the Givenchy auction was a prime example of the very best type of Monegasque sale. 'There's a glamour associated with Monte Carlo which is absolutely ideal for the auction of a very special private collection such as Hubert de Givenchy's,' he says. 'It's the sort of collection that probably sells better in Monaco than anywhere else.' Monte Carlo is still something of a newcomer to the art market, at least compared to the old-established centres such as London, Geneva and New York. The first big sale in the principality was staged in 1975 by Sotheby's, chief competitor of Christie's, when it auctioned off the Dede de Rothschild collection. That auction and subsequent sales were so successful that Monte Carlo has since become a landmark on the international art dealing scene. The merits of Monaco as an auction centre are easy to see. The location, only a 15 minute helicopter ride away from Nice's busy international airport, makes it easy for international dealers to fly into the principality for special events. Sotheby's and Christie's even ensure that they hold their six monthly sales fairly close together in June and December to maximise attendance by foreign dealers. Monte Carlo also offers the added frisson of a sprinkling of self-indulgent local residents, and people driving over the borders from France and Italy. Yet the main reason for Monaco's metamorphosis into an auction centre is the idiosyncratic nature of the French art market, which is so tightly restricted by anachronistic legislation that it is almost impossible for leading international auctioneers such as Sotheby's and Christie's to hold important sales in France. France is the home of some of the world's finest art collections. French painting and antique furniture is highly sought after by wealthy collectors in other countries, notably in the US and Japan. Yet for decades the market has been hidebound by stiff export restrictions which make it very difficult for Sotheby's, Christie's or their international rivals to transport works out of France to auction them in London, New York, Tokyo or Geneva. The French government is empowered to stop any piece from leaving the country for foreign auction by buying it at the minimum reserve price - usually much lower than the 'hammer' price at which the auctioneer will actually sell it. (If the piece is sold in France, the government must buy it at the hammer price.) However, the controls over the French market are so tight - the only people allowed to practise as auctioneers are the small band of commissaires priseurs, who are licensed by the justice ministry and can only apply for a licence when an existing commissaire relinquishes one - that Sotheby's and Christie's cannot operate in France. At the same time, the archaic nature of the commissaire system means that the auction market is highly fragmented and that individual auctioneers do not have the resources to stage and market international sales on the same scale as Sotheby's or Christie's. This state of affairs continued until 1975, when Peter Wilson, then chairman of Sotheby's in France, decided to exploit a loophole whereby works could be auctioned in Monaco free from the usual restrictions on foreign sales. In other words, the French government is obliged to pay the full hammer price, rather than the minimum reserve, if it seeks to stop French works leaving the principality. Monte Carlo has since become renowned for its sales of old master paintings, antique French furniture and for other Gallic decorative specialities such as Art Deco and Art Nouveau. It has also hosted a series of high profile sales, including Sotheby's auction of the the Florence Gould and Claud Cartier collections, the Christie's sales of Sir Charles Clore's furniture and its auction last month of the contents of the Cap d'Antibes house owned by Margaret Biddle, the wealthy American who was a leader of the Riviera social scene in the 1940s. The nature of the Monaco market means that it has been relatively robust during the recession of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The only area of the market to have suffered is classic cars, which became a Monegasque speciality in the 1980s (thanks to the principality's motor racing tradition) but fizzled out in the economically depressed early 1990s. Christie's and Sotheby's achieved well over their original estimates in last month's Monte Carlo art auctions. The prize of the Sotheby's sale - a pair of 18th century black lacquer corner cabinets by Bernard Van Risamburgh - was sold for FFr5.45m, against an estimate of FFr5m. The biggest threat to the Monegasque auction scene is not the economic environment, but the forthcoming reforms of the French art market. In theory, the French should have liberalised their arcane auctioneering system with the onset of the single European market at the end of 1992. But in practice, although proposals for change have been tabled, the system has remained intact. Yet even the most conservative commissaires accept that change is inevitable. Jacques Toubon, the centre-right arts minister, has already put forward a concrete plan for reform. 'The inflexibility of the art market will soon be no more than a bad memory,' began a recent article in La Tribune Desfosses, the French financial daily. Liberalisation of the French market is almost certain to prompt the international houses to switch some of their Monaco auctions to Paris. Sotheby's and Christie's are already planning to do so. At the same time the French commissaires have developed plans to band together in order to compete more effectively against the London and New York houses. Yet Christie's Humphrey Butler is still convinced that there will be a role for Monaco on the auctioneering scene. 'I doubt very much that as soon as the Paris market opens, we'll move everything there and close down in Monaco,' he says. 'Monte Carlo serves a very particular purpose in the art market. We may well have decided to hold a special sale like the Givenchy there even if Paris was open to us. After all, we're all susceptible to glamour.'</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD;  </P> <P> SEAHAWK OIL REDUCES DEBT  </P> <P> Seahawk Oil International Inc. of Irvine was incorrectly characterized in a  June 21 story as "debt-ridden" and "unable to pay its debts." In fact, the  company has reduced its long-term debt to about $1.5 million by the end of 1988  from $7.3 million three years earlier, and has missed no required debt  payments.  </P> <P> In addition, Seahawk has not bought four oil companies in the last five years  and sold off its reserves, as the story reported. The firm has acquired only  one other company and continues to produce its reserves.  </P> <P> Seahawk recently arranged to sell all of its domestic oil and gas properties  for $4.5 million. After retiring most of its remaining debt, the company will  have $3 million in cash it can use to finance new oil ventures or to enter  another line of business. The firm also has about $8 million in accumulated tax  losses it can use to shelter future income from taxes.  </P></p>

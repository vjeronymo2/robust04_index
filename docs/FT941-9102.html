			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Pharma Vision sells stake in Ciba-Geigy Pharma Vision 2000, the Swiss pharmaceutical shares investment company, has arranged to sell its SFr410m (Dollars 283m) stake in Ciba-Geigy because it disagrees with the Basle-based group's policy to remain diversified in chemicals and pharmaceuticals. This decision could have some impact on Ciba shares in the next few days. Moves by Pharma Vision and other investment vehicles controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank group are closely watched in Swiss equity markets. Two weeks ago, BK Vision, another investment company controlled by Mr Ebner and his associates, revealed it was running down its stake in CS Holding, the financial group built around Credit Suisse. Since then, CS shares have been weaker than the Swiss banking sector as a whole. Mr Christoph Blocher, chairman of Pharma Vision, said in his annual statement that the company reduced its Ciba holding last year because Ciba was 'sticking to its strategy of diversification rather than focusing on the pharmaceutical sector'.</p>

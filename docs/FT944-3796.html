			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Yeltsin's troops march in where angels might fear to tread . . . Three moments in history define the Chechen relationship to Russia: its decades of struggle against Russian expansion in the Caucasus, culminating in forced submission in the 1860s; the Soviet repressions of the 1920s, reaching an apogee in 1943-1944 when the Chechens, with the Karachai, Ingush and the Balkar peoples, were deported (and many killed) for alleged collaboration with the Nazi invasion of the Caucasus; and the contemporary period, when under the leadership of General Dzhokar Dudayev in November 1991, the republic declared independence from Russia. The first gives a foundation of national pride; the second a pervasive national grievance; the third, a basis for national independence which, though compromised by the arbitrary and allegedly corrupt rule of General Dudayev, appears nonetheless strongly supported by Chechnya's 1m people. More than any other of the 'small peoples' of Russia, the Chechens have retained warrior traditions and have invested heavily in their own institutions - including the Sunni Moslem faith. Reviled by Russians, especially Muscovites, as criminals, they are also given a wide berth for their reputed ruthlessness. President Boris Yeltsin is choosing to swat a formidable fly. General Dudayev's declaration of independence at the head of a coalition of nationalist forces was followed by armed Russian intervention. The Russian troops got little further than the airport and exchanged only sporadic fire before being withdrawn when the Russian supreme soviet refused to ratify their involvement. Since then, the Dudayev regime has become a centre of anti-Russian sentiment in the North Caucasian region. He gave sanctuary to the deposed president of Georgia, the late Zviad Gamsakhurdia, and assisted his abortive effort to re-establish his presidency last year. He strongly backed the Confederation of Mountain Peoples, which supported the successful efforts of Abkhazia to break away from Georgia. Within his borders, the 300,000 Russian speakers dwindled to an estimated 100,000. Internal opposition became evident in spring of 1993, when an impeachment motion was put to the parliament - after which Gen Dudayev dissolved it, quelling a minor armed uprising. Several opposition groups were formed, the strongest of which gathered round Mr Umar Avturkhanov, who operates from his home base in the town of Znamenskoye, 40km from Grozny. Mr Dodu Zavgayev, leader of the Chechen supreme soviet abolished by Gen Dudayev in 1991, is now a member of Mr Yeltsin's administration and also a focus of opposition, as is Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the most famous Chechen, former leader of the Russian supreme soviet and once the Russian president's bitterest enemy. The opposition forces, with Russian backing, attacked Grozny two weeks ago: their tanks and troops reached the centre of the capital, but were halted and thrown back, leaving 21 Russians as prisoners. The prisoners' story - that they had been recruited from the Kantemirov division by the Federal Intelligence Service (the successor to the KGB) to act as 'advisers' to the opposition - inflamed Russian liberal opinion against the Russian administration's attempts to achieve the downfall of Gen Dudayev by stealth. The failure of the opposition attack was followed by a harsh decree from Mr Yeltsin, demanding what amounted to a surrender by Gen Dudayev. Russian troops poured into bases around the Chechen border. The past week has been one of wildly differing signals: a strengthening of the troops and official declarations that constitutional order must be restored in Chechnya, mixed with a bizarre negotiation between Gen Dudayev and the Russian defence minister General Pavel Grachev last week, at which the two were seen to be on friendly terms and the latter quoted as saying only peaceful means would be used to settle the conflict. That last seems to have been a feint, either unconscious or deliberate. The troops are committed. A fourth critical moment in Chechnya's history opens.</p>

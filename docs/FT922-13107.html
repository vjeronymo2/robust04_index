			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Bonds: Borrowers take advantage of demand for sterling issues TWO more borrowers took advantage of strong demand for sterling bonds, in the wake of last week's UK election victory by the ruling Conservative party, to add tranches to existing bond issues. The Woolwich Building Society and Hypobank, the German bank, each raised Pounds 50m of 10-year and five-year bonds respectively. On Friday, two UK companies, BAA and Cable &amp; Wireless, launched a total of Pounds 200m of bonds. The Woolwich issue consists of subordinated bonds, which qualify as Tier 2 capital under Basle capital adequacy guidelines. The bonds, priced to yield 145 basis points more than the 10-year gilt, met demand mainly from UK institutions which liked the relatively high yield and are allowed to hold subordinated paper. A number of UK companies are eyeing the market. However, many corporate treasurers are hesitating because they expect UK interest rates to be cut soon. For many of them, funding levels of under 10 per cent are a likely trigger point. Most companies are not in urgent need of funds, since investment is running at a low level, but there is a continuing trend of refinancing bank debt. Activity is likely to be concentrated among UK companies which need to raise sterling. Overseas borrowers are likely to be able to fund more cheaply elsewhere, since sterling swap rates are not looking attractive. Yield spreads of Eurosterling bonds relative to the gilts market have remained stable, in spite of a five-point rally in the gilts market last week. Eurobond prices normally lag movements in the government bond market, causing spreads to widen when the government bond market rallies. Dealers said there was virtually no Eurosterling paper around, since the primary market had been very quiet in the run-up to the election. The heavy fresh supply of gilts has not yet dinted demand for sterling paper, dealers said. Elsewhere, Ferrovie, the Italian railway, raised L700bn of 10-year floating-rate notes.</p>

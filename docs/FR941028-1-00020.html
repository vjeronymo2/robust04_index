			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> First, transactions generally must satisfy Commission recordkeeping and audit trail requirements. Proposed paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 36.3 requires the contract market to provide for record maintenance and retention consistent with Regulation 1.31, 17 CFR 1.31 (1994). Under proposed &sect;36.3(b)(2), the audit trail for such transactions must meet the trade register, trade timing, and contract market oversight requirements in Regulations 1.35(e), (g), and (i), 17 CFR 1.35(e), (g), and (i) (1994), respectively. In addition, the recordkeeping requirements set forth in Regulation 1.38(b), 17 CFR 1.38(b) (1994), for noncompetitive trades and the audit trail documentation required under the other provisions of Regulation 1.35, 17 CFR 1.35 (1994), must be satisfied to the extent they are applicable to the subject trading procedures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 38 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A contract market must demonstrate in a clear and convincing manner that these and any other regulations referenced in paragraph (b) that it believes are inapplicable to its proposed trading procedures are, in fact, inapplicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 38 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, Regulation 1.35, 17 CFR 1.35 (1994), provides for two orders, an office order (1.35(a&hyph;1)(1)) and a floor order (1.35(a&hyph;1)(2)(i)). A contract market's proposed procedures may render the requirement for a floor order inapplicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, the Commission is proposing to maintain customer protection standards. Commission Regulations 155.2, 155.3, and 155.4, 17 CFR 155.2, 155.3 and 155.4 (1994), set forth customer protection trading standards for floor brokers, FCMs, and introducing brokers (``IBs'') respectively. Under proposed &sect;36.3(b)(3), the contract market's proposed procedures must comply with these provisions to the extent they are applicable. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, Regulation 155.2, 17 CFR 155.2 (1994), sets forth standards for floor brokers. If, however, under proposed section 4(c) contract market trading rules, a function analogous to that of a floor broker does not exist, that rule would not apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Third, the transactions must be transparent. The Commission is proposing in paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of Rule 36.3 certain requirements for the reporting and identifying of section 4(c) market transactions after they are executed. Specifically, in addition to the trade recordation requirements listed above, the transactions are to be reported immediately to the floor of the exchange and are to be disseminated immediately on the relevant market floor, trading screen, and/or vendor services through the exchange's market quotation system. Records must be maintained of the time of execution to this end. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The information to be so reported must include, at a minimum, price, quantity, and contract. To the extent that a proposal for section 4(c) contract market transactions might provide for trading when the exchange floor is closed, the Commission would still require the immediate report and dissemination of that transaction information. Brokers engaging in such transactions will need to have supervisory procedures in place reasonably designed to achieve such post-trade transparency. The Commission believes that these proposed requirements to report and specifically identify section 4(c) contract market transactions will provide the public with notice of the way in which the prices in this market have been reached. As such, persons relying on these prices for price basing purposes will have the opportunity to take that information into account. The Commission requests comment on these requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> To the extent applicable, all Regulation 1.35 audit trail requirements will apply to the production of upstairs trading records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fourth, the Commission is proposing requirements intended to ensure the financial integrity of the transactions. Proposed paragraph (b)(5) of Rule 36.3 requires section 4(c) contract market trading rules to provide that section 4(c) contract market transactions be reported to clearing and be cleared by the contract market on the same schedule as required for trades subject to Regulations 1.38 and 1.39. Should there be no such schedule, then the report to clearing must be immediate. The Commission requests comment as to whether clearing procedures should be further articulated in that case. In this connection, the Commission notes that the clearing arrangements would be subject to Commission oversight and that proposed clearing rules would require prior Commission review under Section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 7a(12), and Regulation 1.41, 17 CFR 1.41 (1994). The section 4(c) contract market clearing organization would have an affirmative duty under the Act and Commission regulations to enforce its rules, and would be subject to recordkeeping, document retention, and other applicable requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to NYSE market surveillance staff, block trades are not separately identified as such on the exchange's audit trail/time and sales register. However, NYSE would be able to ascertain whether a trade is a block trade by contacting the transacting members, each of whom must keep a record reflecting which of its trades are blocks. Interestingly, while not separately identifying block trades in its audit trail, NYSE and its vendors do have a separate ``block trade'' ticker which runs throughout the day reflecting size and price of block trades alone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission requests comment on whether to require the dissemination of separate pricing information for block trades.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to proposed paragraph (c), any submission made hereunder for proposed section 4(c) contract market transactions must describe fully the contract market procedures and systems that will assure compliance with Sections 4b and 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6b and 6c(a), with respect to prohibitions on abuse of customer orders, including frontrunning of such orders, misuse of information, and wash sales and fictitious trades. This provision reflects, among other things, the Commission's continuing concern that customer orders receive appropriate priority and that trading between markets or locations does not cause distortions in prices or provide advantages to one class or user of the markets over others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this connection, proposed paragraph (g) of Rule 36.3 states that trades entered into in compliance with section 4(c) contract market trading rules shall not be in violation of Sections 4b(a)(iv), 4b(b) or 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6b(D), 6b or 6c(a), ``based solely on having been executed noncompetitively.'' Failure to comply explicitly with such contract market rules will render the conduct involved subject to Commission action under Sections 4b and 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6b and 6c(a), and Regulations 1.38 and 1.39, 17 CFR 1.38 and 1.39 (1994), in addition to any other applicable provisions of the Act and Regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

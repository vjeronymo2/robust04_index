			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA MAYOR SAYS AIDS LED TO COMPANION'S DEATH  </P> <P> Gary Burdick, the 15-year companion of Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry,  died early Tuesday in a Newport Beach hospital of complications from AIDS,  Gentry said.  </P> <P> Burdick, 49, died at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian. While the coroner  will investigate the cause of death, Gentry said he is certain that it was  related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> "I'm angry that he passed away from a disease that should not have killed him,"  Gentry said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Before his death, Burdick had tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus,  so Gentry said he believes Burdick had AIDS.  </P> <P> Gentry expects to receive results of Burdick's blood test in about a week. "I'm  convinced it will come up positive" for AIDS, he said.  </P> <P> Gentry, the only openly gay elected official in Orange County, said that while  he advocates AIDS testing, he has not himself been tested.  </P> <P> "I did not have the strength to do it," he said. "But now I will."  </P> <P> Gentry said he wanted to avoid sharing any bad news with Burdick: "I tried to  spare both of us that burden."  </P> <P> A private funeral service will be held at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in Cypress.  A public memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. Sunday in the Laguna Room at  the Hotel Laguna. Gentry requested that donations be made to the Costa  Mesa-based AIDS Service Foundation of Orange County, the Laguna Shanti Project  or the AIDS Response Program, in lieu of flowers.  </P> <P> Described as "a great animal lover," Burdick bred dogs and horses for shows,  and later rabbits as a hobby, Gentry said.  </P> <P> Co-workers at the Images For Hair salon in Corona del Mar, where Burdick worked  as a stylist, said he will be missed.  </P> <P> "He was probably the most happy and upbeat person I've ever worked with," Paula  Marralle said. "He didn't seem like a sick person to me.  </P> <P> "He must have been a very strong person to make everything all right every  day," she said. "We'll really miss him."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow May 24 -- "To reinforce the ceasefire  agreement in the area of conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, it is  necessary for all the conflicting parties to take clear and  definite measures to demonstrate their aspiration to turn this  pause into a stable truce and move ahead to solving disputable  issues by peaceful, negotiatory means," said Grigory Karasin,  spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry.    According to him, the ceasefire agreement reached on May 12  by military chiefs of the belligerents through Russia's  mediation and encouragement on the part of Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe "is being observed in the  main". "Only separate incidents" of small-scale fighting occured  since then, he added.    "Expressing our satisfaction with the fact that bloodshed  has  been stopped for the time being, we would like to see that the  parties concerned thus showed, first and foremost, their  political resolve to cease military operations and confirm their  ability to fulfil their commitments," Karasin emphasized.    In view of the fact that previous ceasefire agreements were  repeatedly violated by this or that party, these features are of  special significance.    Karasin regretted the fact that "certain political forces  and  leaders try to create crisis situations for the sake of their  self- serving interests at this decisive moment (in the fate) of  the peoples involved in the conflict."    "It is time we determined, who comes out for peaceful  settlement of the conflict and who - for resumption of  hostilities, for return into the bloody impasse," Karasin  pointed out.</p>

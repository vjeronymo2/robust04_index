			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 12, RIA -- "I will continue to fight  for the observance of laws in Russia and I do not want this to  be called a struggle against Yuriy Luzhkov," Anatoliy Chubays,  vice-premier of the Russian Government and chairman of the State  Property Management Committee, told a RIA correspondent during  an intermission in the founding congress of Russia's Democratic  Choice Party today.    It is to be remembered that President Yeltsin asked First  Vice- Premier Oleg Soskovets to tell Chubays that he "should not  have anything to do with Moscow."    Chubays promised to do all within "authority to punish those  who violate laws regardless of their position. Time will show  who wins. however, my attitude to privatisation Moscow style did  not change after President Yeltsin's famous order," he said.</p>

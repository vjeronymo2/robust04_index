			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS' PARRISH HAS 4-FOR-4 NIGHT IN ROUT OF ORIOLES  </P> <P> Only by becoming quiet at the plate did Lance Parrish make some noise.  </P> <P> Bedeviled by a slump that almost cost him his starting status, Parrish worked  on his hitting approach with Angel Manager Doug Rader and batting instructor  Deron Johnson. They advised the 33-year-old catcher to be calm without being  passive, "a very, very quiet approach to the ball (that) generates more bat  speed," Rader said.  </P> <P> The change generated a single, a double, two thunderous home runs and four runs  batted in for Parrish Tuesday night.  </P> <P> It also gave Angel left-hander Jim Abbott the leeway he needed to challenge  hitters and gain his first victory of the season, a 7-1 rout of the Baltimore  Orioles that Abbott called "nothing to start talking championship about, but  something that maybe will get us started."  </P> <P> At the very least, it stopped a stretch of four losses in five games for the  Angels, who are 4-7 on this trip with a game here tonight and another Thursday  at Seattle remaining. At the most, it represented for Abbott (1-1) the end of  the harmful effects of the spring-training lockout and for Parrish, the  beginning of a resurgence.  </P> <P> "All I was trying to do is be patient," Parrish said. "I'd been chasing balls  out of the strike zone. When you have a tendency to jump at the ball, that's  the opposite of being quiet. I definitely fell into that category. Hitters in  slumps are overaggressive, which is opposite of the way they should be. I got  tired of fighting it the other way and tried this (Monday). Hopefully, I can  maintain it."  </P> <P> Parrish was two for 24 before Monday, when he was two for five in the series  opener. He has hits in five consecutive at-bats, raising his average from a low  of .163 Sunday to .250.  </P> <P> "I realize in this game that you're either hot, cold or somewhere in between,"  Parrish said. "When you're struggling, the manager has an obligation to find  somebody who can do the job. John (Orton) is an exceptional catcher and I had  to start contributing, or I'd find my butt on the bench."  </P> <P> Max Venable came off the bench to open the game with a home run off Oriole  starter Jay Tibbs (0-3). Luis Polonia, acquired Sunday from the New York  Yankees, was scheduled to lead off and play left field but has not yet joined  the team from New York. Rader told Venable to be ready in case Polonia didn't  make it. Then, the Angel manager delayed handing in the lineup card as long as  possible.  </P> <P> "I was on hold and then I wasn't, I was in the game," said Venable, who hit his  last home run Sept. 26, 1986, while a member of the Cincinnati Reds. "I don't  care if he ever gets here."  </P> <P> After getting jump-started by Venable's home run, the Angels took a 2-0 lead on  Parrish's home run to right on a 2-2 count.  </P> <P> "It's a lot easier to pitch when you have some runs and every little mistake  isn't so important," Abbott said.  </P> <P> Not that he made many. Baltimore scored its only run in the second, after Mike  Devereaux's popup fell between right fielder Dante Bichette and second baseman  Mark McLemore for a leadoff double. Devereaux promptly stole third and scored  on Bob Melvin's grounder to short. The Orioles put runners on second and third  in the third inning on a single by Cal Ripken Jr. and a double by Randy  Milligan, but Abbott got out of that jam by striking out Craig Worthington.  </P> <P> "The first inning was a little shaky," Parrish said of Abbott, "but he worked  himself into a position where we could open wide with any pitch. He threw a few  curveballs, some changeups, and he threw strikes with his fastball."  </P> <P> The Angels got him some breathing room in the fourth, on Parrish's three-run,  405-foot blast into the left-field bleachers.  </P> <P> McLemore contributed a run-scoring single in the sixth, and Bichette drove in  the final run with a home run to left in the eighth, his first home run in 12  games and only his second RBI in 12 games. It helped the Angels score more than  five runs for the first time since they had seven in a 12-inning game April 14  against Minnesota.  </P> <P> "When you have runs to work with, you're supposed to throw the ball over the  plate, and that's what I tried to do," Abbott said. "I felt that my arm  strength was there. I think the lockout effects are gone for me, and this  outing was true to form."  </P> <P> Parrish hopes the same is true for him. "Amazing, isn't it?" he said after his  first two-home run game since July 9, 1986 when he was with Detroit. "I hope I  can maintain the same thought processes. You can put that down -- amazing."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> According to the Basic Agreement, Luis Polonia has 72 hours after the trade to  report to his new club. That period expires tonight.  </P> <P> Catcher John Orton (sore left shoulder) has improved and was available last  night, although he did not start. Johnny Ray (right shoulder bursitis) took  early batting practice and also was available. Bob McClure (sore left elbow)  threw softly for 15 minutes for the second consecutive day and reported no  discomfort.  </P> <P> Lance Parrish's eighth-inning double extended the Angels' streak to 19  consecutive games with at least one double, two short of the club record set in  1971. . . . The Angels' pitchers don't have a complete game this season. . . .  The Orioles had won the previous four games from the Angels. . . . Parrish's  two home runs came one night after Oriole center fielder Steve Finley reached  above and behind the fence to rob him of a homer. "I told him when he came up  the first time that I was going to try and hit 'em where he couldn't get 'em,"  Parrish said.  </P> <P> Oriole shortstop Cal Ripken played in his 1,271st consecutive game Tuesday, 36  behind Everett Scott's second-place total of 1,307. The all-time record of  2,130 was set by Lou Gehrig.  </P> <P> Donnie Hill entertained his teammates before the game by going through his  repertoire of impersonations. Throwing left-handed, Hill did a fine Tommy John  impression, which goes with his Don Sutton and Frank Tanana. He also does a  good imitation of side-armer Gene Garber, but Sutton and John hold a special  place in his affections. "I like the old Dodgers," said Hill, who lived in  Huntington Beach and graduated from Edison High School. "I grew up with the  1970 Dodgers, John, Sutton and those guys."  </P></p>

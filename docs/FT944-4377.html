			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Whirlpool buys majority of Chinese microwave unit Whirlpool, the world's largest producer of white goods, is expanding its presence in the fast-growing Chinese home appliance market by acquiring a majority stake in SMC Microwave Products, China's largest microwave producer. The deal will make Whirlpool one of the top five microwave oven producers worldwide. It comes two days after Whirlpool signed an agreement with China's Snowflake Electrical Appliance Group to make refrigerators at a Beijing plant. Whirlpool is already a partner in SMC, a joint venture company with annual revenues of Dollars 100m. Terms were not disclosed, but Whirlpool said the current partners, Shell Electric Manufacturing (Holdings) and Shunde County Beijiao Economic Development Company, would hold minority stakes in the venture. SMC has about half of the Chinese microwave market, which totals about 500,000 units a year, and exports more than 500,000 units to other Asian, European and Latin American markets from its factory in Shunde, Guangdong province. Whirlpool said it expects SMC to produce about 1.5m units a year by 1997. The rapid growth forecast for the Chinese white goods market is attracting growing interest from western producers. Last month, Munich-based Bosch-Siemens said it would link up with China's Wuxi Little Swan to build a washing machine factory in China. Whirlpool said talks with Chinese manufacturers for washing machines and compressors were 'progressing smoothly' and could result in joint venture agreements in early 1995.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses catch up with losses in bond markets Continental Europe, Milan and Madrid apart, came back from holiday and caught up with some painful events; bond markets fell after Monday's losses in London and bourses followed suit, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT reflected Monday's sharp fall in June bund futures in London, from 95.30 to 94.68 on LIFFE, but dealers were surprised as the Dax index dropped by 50.93, or 2.3 per cent to 2,198.72 during the official session. Turnover eased from DM7.2bn to DM7bn. Ms Barbara Altmann, of B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that she had expected a fall of around 20 Dax points to cover the weakness in bonds following comments from the Bundesbank president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, which were taken to mean that there would be no more official German interest rate cuts in the near future. However, German equities were probably suffering from their outperformance in recent months. The Bundesbank added yesterday that April's M3 German money supply grew by an annualised 15.8 per cent, up from 15.4 per cent a month earlier. After this, the Dax was unable to hold up against a further drop in bund futures, indicated at 94.41 in late afternoon, and the Ibis index tested its support level of 2,180 with a low of 2,177.72 before recovering to close the day at 2,188.01. PARIS lost a percentage point, a little worse than the European average, and dealers blamed liquidation of positions on the last day of the May account. Some of the interest rate-sensitive financials took more than their fair share of the losses as the CAC-40 index closed 22.11 lower at 2,133.32, Axa losing FFr39 at FFr1,346 and Suez FFr8 at FFr309.50; but here, too, local professionals found a domestic reason: profit-taking. Companies in, or potentially in the news were not popular. Eurotunnel dropped another FFr1.65 to FFr31.25; Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Securities said that the market was expecting terms for the company's mammoth rights issue to be set today. Some cyclicals, meanwhile, seemed to see a continuation of last week's switching into more defensive stocks: Alcatel dropped FFr19 at FFr643 and Michelin FFr7.30 at FFr232.60; the tyre company was exposed to higher US interest rates, noted Mr Woodcock, who added that the Balladur measures to stimulate consumption were now expected merely to advance demand from the second half of this year into the first, leaving the automotive industry with little benefit over the year as a whole. ZURICH fell 1.5 per cent in response to worries about the outlook for interest rates. The SMI index lost 40.7 to 2,692.0 although some late buying helped the market up from a low of 2,681. Sandoz registered finished SFr24 lower at SFr692 after an early SFr680 in response to the agreed Dollars 3.7bn bid for Gerber Products, the largest maker of baby foods in the US. Mrs Birgit Kulhoff at UBS in Zurich, who viewed the bid as a positive development, believed that the link would open the US market for Sandoz healthcare products, although it would not help Gerber to enter the European baby food market, which was already crowded. Gerber would, however, benefit from Sandoz's presence in Asian markets. Mrs Kulhoff thought that the shares had come under pressure because investors were unjustifiably worried that the bid price was too high and that the deal might indicate that Sandoz would no longer be concentrating on the pharmaceutical side of its business. Roche certificates, under pressure this month after the group's Dollars 5.3bn bid for Syntex, the US drugs company, lost another SFr105 to SFr6,050. BK Vision, the investment fund controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group, fell SFr30 or 1.9 per cent to SFr1,510 following the announcement that it recorded a SFr30.1m loss in the first four months of this year after a SFr9.9m profit during the same 1993 period. MILAN was under renewed pressure early in the day as foreign and domestic investors continued to take profits. But local buying emerged late in the session and the Comit index eased just 2.73 to 755.24. Fiat was one of the front runners in both directions. The shares were marked down to L6,510 before rebounding to finish L149 higher on the day at L6,836. Mediobanca, L501 or 3 per cent lower at L16,211, was hard hit by newspaper reports that the merchant bank knew of hidden losses at Ferruzzi long before the information was made public. Fondiaria, the Ferruzzi group's insurance arm, fell L131 to L15,779 in response to news that magistrates had questioned a senior executive over various property deals. Construction stocks advanced on suggestions that the new Berlusconi government was considering measures to free public works projects frozen due to the corruption scandals and the recession. Italcementi rose L460 to L15,341, Cogefar gained L95 to L2,337, and Calcestruzzi was up L218 at L12,669. AMSTERDAM saw early losses reduced as US markets opened firmer and the AEX index finished 4.48 lower at 408.29. Chemicals came under pressure on the view that they had been overbought recently, DSM falling Fl 4 to Fl 132.60 and Akzo Fl 3.40 to Fl 209.30. Elsevier was Fl 3.20 lower at Fl 175.80 on profit-taking. News of Sandoz's bid for Gerber sparked buying in Nutricia, the baby and health foods group that has been viewed as a likely takeover candidate for some years. The shares, marked Fl 5 higher at one stage, finished Fl 2.50 ahead at Fl 83.00. MADRID saw some late buying following an upturn on Wall Street, and the general index closed just 1.39 lower at 336.52. However, turnover remained subdued at Pta27.3bn and there was still more life in secondary stocks than in the big blue chips. ATHENS fell another 3.7 per cent as investors shunned shares and instead turned their attention to bank repos, currently yielding around 40 per cent on an annual basis. The general index fell 32.83 to 854.25 in active volume of 1.8m shares - a decline of 10 per cent since May 13, when the drachma came under pressure and the Greek central bank drove interest rates up to defend the currency. TEL AVIV dropped again following Monday's official interest rate increase, the Mishtanim index losing 6.53, or 3.3 per cent at 189.67 for an aggregate fall of around 8 per cent since Sunday morning.

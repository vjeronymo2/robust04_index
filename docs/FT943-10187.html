			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / UK Company News: A wider base is more stable - Why Asprey has been making acquisitions Asprey, the exclusive jewellery retailer which also owns Garrard, the crown jewellers, has learnt it is dangerous to depend on a small group of super-rich customers, particularly during a recession. That is the view of Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive, who has been behind the group's aggressive acquisition strategy designed to take Asprey into more areas of the luxury goods business. 'Our customer base had to be widened so that the effect of future recessions would not be so severe,' says Mr Attallah. 'We have to live with the fact that margins are under pressure and that circumstances have changed. Money does not disappear, it just changes hands and we have to follow it.' Through acquisitions the group has sought to reduce its dependence on the sort of customers traditionally attracted to its Bond Street shop where a set of jewellery made from diamonds and Burma rubies retails for Pounds 2m and a pair of life-sized panthers made from oxidised silver cost Pounds 450,000. 'There are only so many people who can spend that kind of money. We had to build a bigger base so that we were not so vulnerable,' says Mr Attallah. Helped by the recession, Asprey has picked off a number of prestigious outlets starting with Mappin &amp; Webb and Garrard in 1990, Watches of Switzerland in 1992 and Les Ambassadeurs, the watch and jewellery retail chain, in 1993. In July last year Sears, the retail group, sold its 25 per cent stake in Asprey and it moved from the USM to the Official List. The additions have already made their presence felt. Acquisitions made during the past two years contributed Pounds 18.6m to turnover in the year to March 31, helping to push the total up by almost 30 per cent, from Pounds 144.7m to Pounds 187.6m. Despite this, the group's reliance on the Asprey business remains large. Asprey continued to contribute more than 75 per cent of profits and 55 per cent of sales. Mr Attallah's goal is to cut Asprey's contribution to profits to 35 per cent. 'At that point I will feel we have reached an optimum position. We will be less vulnerable and have a wider customer base,' he says. Asprey's management still has a long way to go to improve the performance of the acquisitions. Many of the businesses were in bad shape and it has had to develop a corporate structure more compatible with a diversified group. Some notable improvements have already been achieved. Garrard has emulated Asprey, organising large exhibitions and pursuing overseas markets. During the year exhibitions were held in Hong Kong, Vienna, Maastricht and New York. The strategy helped boost turnover by 35 per cent to Pounds 30m at the year end. At Mappin &amp; Webb an expansion of outlets lifted sales by 17 per cent and profits have been enhanced by maintaining gross margins. Watches of Switzerland, in its first full year of trading under Asprey ownership, saw its outlets grow from 26 to 33. The subsidiary is also set to benefit from the launch last year of Zeus, aimed at younger shoppers where watches cost hundreds rather than thousands of pounds. The Les Ambassadeurs chain, with outlets in Zurich, Geneva, St Moritz, Lugano and Lucerne, has performed well ahead of expectations. The Asprey group is also seeking to expand its overseas operations and has set about building a bigger export team. A Mappin &amp; Webb outlet will be opened in Prague in October while an Asprey office has been established in Hong Kong. Although Asprey has shelved plans to open in Shanghai, Mr Attallah believes China will offer the 'biggest boom ever' in 10 years time. 'Our biggest spending customers used to be from the Middle East but there has been a shift to the Far East as a new entrepreneurial class has developed.' Mr Attallah concedes the group will not achieve maximum growth through expansion alone. Of equal importance will be its ability to drive down costs. Although the group's jewellery and gift manufacturing capacity has been enhanced through the acquisitions, Mr Attallah believes little headway has been made in rationalising and integrating production facilities. Asprey produces only 12 per cent of what it it sells, far too little in Mr Attallah's view. He has set the group a target of 35 per cent by the end of the decade. This shift could also boost commissioned sales which accounted for only 10 per cent of turnover last year. He would like to see this rise to 15 per cent. In its dash for growth Asprey is not yet reaching for the mass market. It remains to be seen whether the group can manage to hold on to its exclusivity and simultaneously achieve significant increases in sales volumes with better margins.</p>

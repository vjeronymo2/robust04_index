			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMMIGRATION BILL POLITICS  </P> <P> The column by Stephen Moore (Commentary, Sept. 28) and the editorial point up  the economic possibilities, both positive and negative, of the the family unity  bill. But we also need to address a number of provisions that can facilitate  the reunification of immigrant families in an orderly and controlled manner.  </P> <P> As an organization that has seen firsthand the frustration of U.S. families who  for years have been separated, we strongly encouraged support of the family  provisions of the bill.  </P> <P> We note particularly that this act creates a special category 115,000 visas  aimed at the reunion of permanent residents with their spouses and minor  children. At present, newly legalized persons might have to wait up to 20 or 30  years to live with their spouses and children.  </P> <P> A further provision would provide 50,000 visas to ease some of the most  unreasonable backlogs. Moreover, the bill would protect the spouses and  children of legalized residents from deportation and would grant them work  authorization.  </P> <P> Family immigration has been and must remain the cornerstone of the American  immigration system.  </P> <P> BRUCE M. RAMER, Chairman  </P> <P> Pacific Rim Institute  </P> <P> American Jewish Committee  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

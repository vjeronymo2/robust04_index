			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kerstin Hellbom: "New Virus Among Drug </F> Addicts"--introductory paragraph in boldface as published]    [Text] Another virus infection affecting mostly  intravenous drug users has now been discovered in Sweden. It is  the HTLV virus, closely related to HIV, and it has been found in  blood samples. The National Board of Health and Welfare has  therefore decided that all blood testing will now have to  include a test for the HTLV virus.    "The virus is now present in our country, but the risk of  infection is very small," says Assoc. Prof. Aud Krook, chief  physician at the infectious disease clinic at Huddinge Hospital.  At the doctors' convention early in December, she will present  the results of her study of the incidence of HTLV in blood  samples from intravenous drug users.    She found HTLV in 10 out of 134 blood samples. All 10  subjects had had hepatitis A, B, and C and jaundice, and seven  of the 10 were also HIV- positive.    "The incidence of HTLV was surprisingly high. In every case,  the virus was present in addicts who had been exposed to a great  deal of infection."    In another study, this one involving blood samples from Lund  and Malmo, that will also be presented at the doctors'  convention, eight HIV-positive cases were found, while a third  study, conducted by the Infectious Disease Control Institute,  turned up 14 cases.    Exactly like HIV, HTLV belongs to the family of  retroviruses,  meaning that one of its peculiar features is that it does not  disappear from the body's cells once it gains entry. It can  remain there for years without giving any sign of its presence,  but then suddenly it strikes and causes serious symptoms of  illness. It is spread in the same way as HIV--that is, through  blood and blood products, by sexual contact, and from mother to  child during pregnancy or breast-feeding.    In the early 1980's, the virus that causes AIDS was named  HTLV-3, but it turned out that the AIDS virus belonged to a  different branch of the retrovirus family, so it was renamed  HIV-1. HIV belongs to the lentivirus branch, which attacks the  immune system, while HTLV belongs to the oncovirus branch, which  among other things can cause leukemia.    HTLV has its own offshoots: type 1 and type 2. In most  cases,  the virus discovered in blood samples in Sweden is HTLV-2. Types  1 and 2 can both cause leukemia and a disease known as TSP  [?Tropical Spastic Paraparesis], which paralyzes the body from  the waist down.    "Those diseases are very rare even among people infected  with  the virus. HTLV is not as `efficient' as HIV: It can remain in  the cells for decades without presenting any symptoms," says  Krook.    She also feels that the risk of infection is extremely  small.  Contaminated blood from blood donors would probably have been  discarded since in most cases, the infected donors also have  jaundice or HIV. Blood products supplied to hemophiliacs have  been processed to kill HIV, thereby killing HTLV as well.    Retroviruses remain in the cells and can cause disease after  many years. Oncoviruses (HTLV-1, HTLV-2, STLV-1, and others) can  cause cancer. Lentiviruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, SIV, and others)  weaken the immune system.</p>

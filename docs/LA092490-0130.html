			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> U.S. AIMS TO BRING TV TO TROOPS  </P> <P> American troops in Saudi Arabia soon may have at least one comfort of home --  television.  </P> <P> Plans are being laid to bring news, sports and entertainment shows to troops  taking part in Operation Desert Shield, and the U.S. military is ironing out  final details with Saudi authorities, said Lt. Col. David MacNamee of the Armed  Forces Radio and Television Service.  </P> <P> The programming will be an extension of the non-commercial TV already broadcast  to U.S. troops stationed in Germany, South Korea and the Philippines, he said.  </P> <P> "We're trying to get it on as soon as we can," MacNamee said. "As soon as we  get the programs and the equipment in and get approval, we'll be up and on the  air."  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATKINS PLEDGES NUCLEAR SAFETY IN ENERGY DEPT.  </P> <P> Preparing to take over a troubled helm, retired Adm. James D. Watkins, the  energy secretary-designate, Wednesday denounced what he said had been decades  of misguided priorities within the Energy Department and vowed to instill  concern for health and safety in those responsible for the nation's nuclear  weapons complex.  </P> <P> "We are now paying the price for this long-term cultural misdirection," Watkins  told a Senate committee considering his nomination.  </P> <P> Watkins, a former chief of naval operations, said that officials managing the  department's nuclear weapons-building operations too often have been  preoccupied with the need to maintain secrecy and to meet production goals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vital Lessons Unlearned  </P> <P> As a result, he said, such vital safety lessons as the partial meltdown at the  Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in 1979 -- a watershed experience for  operators of the nation's civilian reactors -- went virtually unheeded by  officials in the Energy Department's weapons operations.  </P> <P> At the nation's nuclear weapons facilities today, Watkins said, "there is  little risk in being careless, little incentive to excel."  </P> <P> The energy nominee, selected to head a department racked by disclosures of past  shoddiness and burdened by the estimated $81-billion cleanup cost at the  weapons facilities, devoted much of a lengthy opening statement to assurances  that he would elevate concern for the environment to a top priority.  </P> <P> "Fulfillment of the mission of our national defense and protection of the  environment are mutually compatible objectives," Watkins declared, "and to  think one must be sacrificed to fulfill the other is wrong."  </P> <P> Outgoing Energy Secretary John S. Herrington similarly had sought to make  concern for health and safety a higher priority within the agency's nuclear  operations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conflicts in Energy Dept.  </P> <P> But, with the nation's three main weapons production facilities shut down for  safety reasons, sharp conflicts have emerged in the department between cautious  safety officials and production managers impatient to get the system back on  line.  </P> <P> Such divisions are far from resolved, Watkins indicated. Since his selection as  energy secretary, he said, "I have learned enough about the defense program  side . . . to know that there is an urgent need to effect a significant change  in the deeply embedded 35-year culture."  </P> <P> Watkins sided emphatically with those urging caution. When questioned about the  shut-down reactors, he said that he believes it is important to restart the  Savannah River Project in South Carolina, the nation's only source of tritium,  a vital but perishable ingredient in nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> But he sounded stronger concerns about delays in the construction of the Waste  Isolation Project, a nuclear waste disposal facility in New Mexico, and opposed  the reopening of any facility until the department is sure that it can "bury  more (waste) than we're producing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confirmation Held Likely  </P> <P> Senators complimented Watkins on his candor, and there seemed no doubt that the  committee would recommend unanimously next week that the Senate confirm  Watkins.  </P> <P> But some, betraying a distrust of the Energy Department that is widely felt on  Capitol Hill, worried aloud that he might abandon his outspokenness after  taking office.  </P> <P> "I hope that you will keep the attitude that you have," Sen. Wendell H. Ford  (D-Ky.) told him.  </P> <P> Although Watkins' remarks focused chiefly on the nuclear weapons complex, the  hearing called attention to the breadth of the challenges facing him.  </P> <P> Watkins, who has been charged by President Bush with developing a comprehensive  national energy policy addressing a wide range of interests, must take sides in  a number of contentious disputes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Acid Rain Controversy  </P> <P> Environmentalists are pitted against the domestic coal industry on the question  of how best to respond to problems of acid rain and global warming. Others are  debating the question of automobile fuel economy standards, with more stringent  requirements supported by conservationists but opposed by U.S. auto makers.  </P> <P> At the same time, with U.S. consumption of foreign oil increasing, oil and gas  interests are demanding anew that the Administration take further action to  protect domestic producers.  </P> <P> Watkins gave little indication of the tacks he might take in attempting to  resolve such issues. But senators nevertheless offered sympathy for the  enormity of the job.  </P> <P> Given present circumstances, said Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), the  committee chairman, stewardship of the Energy Department "is the most daunting  management task that I think we've ever given to anyone in government."  </P></p>

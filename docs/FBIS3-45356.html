			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>   [TExt] China is considering whether to invite dozens of  community leaders to join another platform of advisers on Hong  Kong affairs, according to sources.    Beijing would then have three groups working on the  transition in 1997: the high-level Preliminary Working  Committee (PWC) chaired by the deputy Prime Minister Qian  Qichen, the 91 Hong Kong advisers appointed by the Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office and the local branch of XINHUA (the NEW  CHINA NEWS AGENCY) and the district-level group.    The creation of the lesser tier would help satisfy the  enthusiasm of a number of community figures who want to become  Hong Kong Affairs Advisers.    A source said the appointment of advisers on district  matters  was a new idea which fitted Beijing's strategy of boosting ties  at all levels following the breakdown of political co-operation  with London.    The source said that after declaring that it would step up  its own preparations for the 1997 handover, Beijing had shifted  the emphasis from seeking co-operation with Whitehall to  expanding its so-called united front in the territory.    Senior Chinese officials have indicated that they would  increase the membership of the PWC and name a third batch of  Hong Kong Affairs Advisers.    It is understood that Beijing is still finalising the two  lists of appointees and calculating the best timing for such an  announcement.    The Hong Kong and British governments already fear that the  establishment of these groups ahead of the Preparatory Committee  for the Special Administrative Region in 1996 is tantamount to  creating an alternate power base to its own administration.    It is understood that 10 more people would be named to sit  on  the 57-member PWC, which comes under the auspices of the  National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee.    Of the 57, 30 are local dignitaries and six of the 10  newcomers are expected to come from the territory.    It is also expected that at least two more local delegates  of  the NPC will be enlisted.    The front-runners are tipped to include unionist Cheng  Yiu-tong, surveyor Kan Fook-yee and geography lecturer Victor  Sit Fungshuen.    It is understood that Beijing may approach a few senior  government officials who have either been retired or left the  bureaucracy.    These include former treasury secretary Yeung Kai-yin and  former secretary for education and manpower John Chan Cho-chak.  But both have said privately they would not accept such an  invitation.    The source said it was now likely that the NPC Standing  Committee would finalise the list of new PWC members at a  meeting next month.    It will also be around the time that invitations will be  extended to the third batch of Hong Kong Affairs Advisers, whose  number is yet to be decided but is said to be in the range of 50  to 100.    In spite of the significant jump in the number of advisers,  sources said local Xinhua officials began a few months ago to  consider the possibility of naming a separate group of district  affairs advisers.    But a district leader who has been asked about the idea  said:  "I don't think it" appropriate now. It will create different  classes -- on territory-wide and district affairs.    "Those who are invited to become district affairs advisers  might not be happy to accept the offer," he said.</p>

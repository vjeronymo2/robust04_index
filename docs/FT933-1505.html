			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Armco sells Brazilian operations ARMCO, the US steelmaker, has sold its Brazilian sheet and strip operations and will record a charge of Dollars 15m against third-quarter earnings from the sale and remittances of inter-company debt, Reuter reports. Armco said it received net cash proceeds of Dollars 55m from the sale to the Brazilian unit's current management team. The Brazilian company will purchase ongoing technical assistance from Armco's corporate research department for five years and will provide assistance to Armco in the sale of technical services to other companies in Brazil, Armco said. It said the sale was a continuation of its strategy to focus on stainless and electrical steel and divest businesses that do not represent a strategic fit.</p>

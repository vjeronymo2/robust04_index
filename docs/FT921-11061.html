			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / US Money and Credit: Investor unease over Fed optimism PRESIDENT Bush delivered his much-vaunted State of the Union message last week, but investors in the bond market shrugged off the election year package of tax gimmicks and took their cue instead from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. His comments in Congress appeared to pour cold water on the prospect of more interest rate cuts in the near term. Mr Greenspan's declaration that an economic recovery looks likely this spring sent the Treasury bond market into a tail-spin on Wednesday, with a sell-off of a full point on the benchmark 30-year long bond. Bond investors seem to have over-reacted to the Fed chairman's optimistic prognosis - and they nudged prices upward again later in the week. The reason the market's reaction to the Fed chairman looked overblown is that Mr Greenspan and most of America's leading economists have been saying for the past 18 months - regularly and quite erroneously - that a US recovery is just around the corner. What really worried Treasury bond investors was Mr Greenspan's proclamation that the Fed had lowered interest rates 'enough' to get the economy moving again. This was taken as a sign that further rate cuts were not imminent, and would probably not be decided at this Tuesday's and Wednesday's meeting of the Fed's Open Markets Committee. While Mr Greenspan may be returning to his cautious form - convinced that a 100 basis point reduction in the discount rate last December was sufficient to stimulate the economy - the raft of macro-economic statistics available last week suggests a gloomier scenario. Durable orders were down by 4.9 per cent in December, the biggest such drop since 1982. Had it not been for military orders, the decline would have been 9 per cent. The Chicago purchasing managers' index fell in January, while the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell from 52.5 to 50.4 during the month. The continuing lack of confidence among US consumers was highlighted in New York last week, when Macy's, a pillar of the retail market, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law. TWA followed Macy's with its own Chapter 11 filing later in the week. Leading economic indicators for December meanwhile declined by 0.3 per cent, worse than expected. New home sales in December were down by 6.6 per cent, closing out a year that experienced a 5.6 per cent decline, the third year in a row of declining sales. All of this made last week quite volatile in terms of Treasury bond price movements. However, the bad news eventually outweighed Mr Greenspan's curious optimism, and the benchmark 30-year bond ended the week less than half a point down at 102 3/4 , yielding 7.75 per cent. The yield was thus little changed on the week, although some 30 basis points higher than at the end of December. These statistics - and this week's expected offering - do not paint a picture of a speedily recovering economy. Today, for example, the national purchasing managers' composite index is expected to be little changed from its December level of 47.4. On Thursday, factory orders for December are likely to be lower, while non-farm payrolls should show a further decline in manufacturing employment and a higher overall unemployment rate. One economist who does not believe Mr Greenspan when he demurs on further interest rate cuts is Mr Phillip Braverman, of DKB Securities. Mr Braverman, who noted on Friday that the 1990-1992 US recession was by far the longest and, by some measures, the worst since the depression of the 1930s, reckons real GDP will sink in the first quarter of 1992. He is also one of the few US forecasters to suggest 'there could be no recovery at all this year'. In such an environment, says Mr Braverman, the Fed would have no choice but to ease further and substantially. He is looking for a Fed funds rate (now 4 per cent) of 3.5 per cent by the end of March, and as low as 3 per cent later this year. If one accepts the present round of statistics and takes a bearish view of supposed US recovery prospects, there should be an improvement in the Treasury market's fortunes, on the grounds that bad economic news drives bond prices higher. However, the effect of Mr Greenspan's caution on the interest rate front could be strong, and may well lead to a period of stasis in the market, at least in coming weeks.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Last   1 week   4 wks   12-month   12-month                           Friday      ago     ago       High        Low  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fed Funds (weekly average)  4.50     3.87    3.75      11.00       2.00 Three-month Treasury bills  3.91     3.90    3.93       8.29       3.76 Six-month Treasury bills    4.04     4.06    4.00       7.70       3.95 Three-month prime CDs       4.15     4.15    4.12       7.17       4.01 30-day Commercial Paper     4.05     4.00    4.20       7.12       3.98 90-day Commercial Paper     4.00     4.00    4.10       7.02       3.94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Last   Change           1 week   4 wk.

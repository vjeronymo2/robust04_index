			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the heading "Panorama": "Will an </F> Agreement on the Export Oil Pipeline Be Signed?"]    [Text] The issue of the route for laying an export pipeline  will be discussed in Turkey at a meeting between representatives  of foreign companies and the State Oil Company (GNK) of  Azerbaijan which belong to a consortium for the joint  development of the deposits of "black gold" in the republic. A  KHABAR-SERVICE correspondent learned this from well-informed  sources in the GNK. A contract on the pipeline might be signed  after a week of negotiations and mutual accord is achieved. The  entire management of the GNK will travel to the negotiations,  which will begin on 2 May. GNK President Natik Aliyev was to  travel to Turkey yesterday.    Let us recall that the contract for laying the export  pipeline is a separate document whose preliminary signing is  mandatory for the signing of a contract for the development of  oil fields between the GNK and foreign companies.</p>

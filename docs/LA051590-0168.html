Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> GIOVANNETTI OF ITALY STAGES UPSET IN CYCLING'S TOUR OF SPAIN WIN  </P> <P> Marco Giovannetti of Italy beat the odds and a field of top international  cyclists to win the Tour of Spain today after 22 grueling days of racing.  </P> <P> Giovannetti, 28, who has been racing professionally for six years, became the  fourth Italian to win the 2,292-mile event.  </P> <P> Regarded as a long shot in a field that included such outstanding cyclists as  Pedro Delgado and Miguel Idurain of Spain, Giovannetti led for 11 legs.  </P> <P> He clinched the victory Monday in the next-to-last leg by repelling repeated  attacks by Delgado, a two-time winner and Tour of France champion.  </P> <P> "He made me suffer a lot," Giovannetti said.

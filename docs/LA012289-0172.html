			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETURNED BURMESE DEMONSTRATOR FINDS GENERATION GAP AT HOME  </P> <P> Aung Naing, a 19-year-old apprentice mechanic with what passes for the punk  look in Burma, is in good standing with the law, but he's got a bit of trouble  with his parents.  </P> <P> The youth, who goes by the alias Ya Coot, took to the streets in nearby  Mandalay last summer when anti-government demonstrations swept the country.  When the military took power in September, he fled to the jungles, fearing  arrest.  </P> <P> "I went with my friend," Aung Naing told a reporter who was here interviewing  students who had returned to their homes under a government amnesty program.  </P> <P> "A bad choice of friends," snapped his mother, who for three months did not  know what had happened to her son.  </P> <P> He had gone to the Thai border, had a generally miserable time and caught  malaria. But Thursday, malaria seemed minor compared to what he might catch  from his father.  </P> <P> In a generation gap further widened by the tumultuous events in Burma in August  and September, the young apprentice, who wears an earring and a side-sheared  haircut, had rejected parental pleas and joined the protests. He expressed no  regrets.  </P> <P> Hla Maung, wearing a traditional Burmese jacket and cap, said he was glad that  his son had returned but that he should not have gotten involved in  anti-government politics in the first place. On his chest, the father wore a  government decoration, awarded for alerting the military when Communist  insurgents attacked an air base in 1977.  </P> <P> The parents said their son is a good, honest youth. Was it wrong for young  people to work for a different kind of political system in Burma? "I have no  idea," the father said. "As a civil servant, I'm not interested in politics."  </P> <P> Somehow that attitude was not passed along to his son. "Everybody was taking  part (in the demonstrations), so I took part," Aung Naing explained. "We had  our demands."  </P> <P> The father sees developments another way: "There was anarchy before the  military took over. Now peace has been restored."  </P></p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Postman Pat and his E-mail cat: Post offices do have a commercial future - if they adapt to new technology In 1873 the US postmaster-general predicted that Alexander Graham Bell's telephone would supplant written mail. In fact, the western world's postal services are busier than ever. But can they continue to withstand the march of competition and technology? The question is of special interest to investors across Europe, who are likely to be offered shares in a succession of postal privatisations over the next decade. The Dutch mail operator was privatised last month. The UK's Post Office is clamouring to follow - a government consultation paper on its future may be published later this week. Eager to convince a sceptical public, Britain's Post Office argues that its future is safe only if it is privatised. It cites competition to deliver business mail from, among others, the Dutch operator, and new forms of communications such as fax machines. 'No letter is safe from the technological postman,' claims Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive. 'At the moment the technology is ahead of the market. But when the market catches up, we will be highly vulnerable unless we can invest.' The case for privatisation is alluring. The Post Office says it has only about 14 per cent of the UK 'communications' market, including mail, telecommunications, and electronic media. Across the world, the telecoms operators are rapidly being exposed to competition: until recently yoked together with postal operators across Europe, they are now forging multi-billion international alliances geared to the corporate market and talking about still larger investments in fibre-optic 'superhighways'. With nine-tenths of all UK mail paid for by the corporate or public sectors, the Post Office's argument goes, the future could be grim unless it is allowed to behave in a similarly aggressive and entrepreneurial fashion. In reality the Post Office is almost certainly overstating its case. It assumes, first, that commercial freedom requires privatisation and, second, that a failure to develop new lines of business will inevitably undermine its existing service. Neither is necessarily the case. In practice, argues Mr Adrian King, a postal expert at Omega Partners, a London-based consultancy, three broad challenges face post offices across Europe - liberalisation, competition and new technology. But in each area the threat is less straightforward than it might initially seem. Liberalisation of services in the European Union is proceeding far more slowly in postal services than in telecoms. The EU has yet to produce firm plans but draft proposals circulating in Brussels suggest that the post offices will be able to protect their letter monopolies on the grounds that they are needed to ensure a universal service. Competition, particularly in liberalised markets such as parcels, will certainly intensify. But the total cake will grow; the arrival of the technological postman will probably create more, not less, footslogging for his human counterpart. Transactions made by E-mail and fax beget orders and statements; home shopping begets home parcel deliveries. The Post Office's main asset, a home-to-home delivery service, is not about to become obsolete. While every other utility has shed jobs in the past 20 years, the Post Office's workforce has risen from 170,000 to 190,000 in response to demand for its services. As further competition is allowed, some advertising mail may be delivered to homes by rivals to the Post Office - including companies already active in the parcels and express delivery sectors. But apart from premium business-to-home services, rivals will be interested mostly in low-priority, low-value advertising business which does not require elaborate sorting facilities or daily deliveries. Meanwhile, direct mail is greatly expanding the market for business-to-home communication. For example, Heinz, the food company, has switched a large part of its marketing budget to direct mail. New technology offers several ways of bypassing the post box - notably fax, E-mail, electronic data exchange and 'hybrid mail' (letters that are collected, sorted and printed electronically and then delivered by hand). However it is simplistic to suppose post offices are under immediate threat or ill-equiped to respond. Only parts of the mail market appear susceptible to early competition. According to Mr King, the standard European pattern is for 10 per cent of a postal service's traffic to be household-to-household, 60 per cent business-to-household, and 30 per cent business-to-business. The use of physical mail is unlikely to diminish markedly in the first category. In the third, the technological postman is more threatening as E-mail, fax and other electronic links are hard to match with physical delivery services. But in the second category - business to home - technology offers post offices an opportunity to expand business by pioneering the use of hybrid mail. The challenge is to expand total traffic and for post offices to gain a far larger slice of its value by becoming one-stop providers of electronic printing and home delivery services. That could extend to providing data bases, billing software and payments systems using post offices' own giro cash transfer facilities and counters. 'The task of post offices is to move up the value chain,' says Mr King. 'It is not so much competition from other deliverers, but gaining a larger slice of the value of postal and electronic communications which challenges them.' The case of Sweden Post, arguably Europe's most advanced operator in new technologies, is instructive. Although wholly state-owned, it has a free rein to take commercial decisions on alliances and investment strategy, and no longer has a monopoly over letter deliveries. It is one of Europe's few profitable post offices (the UK's is another), and has a subsidiary, called PostNet, dedicated to developing electronic communications. 'The prospect of competition on the mail side forced us to take electronic media seriously,' says Mr Bengt Norin, an executive director of Sweden Post hired from a US software company to build up Sweden Post's electronic side. The competition in the letters business has come mainly from City Mail, an independent company, which offers a delivery service, about twice-weekly, in Stockholm and other cities including Goteborg and Malmo. In spite of Sweden's large rural hinterland, Sweden Post believes it can continue to offer a universal service by retaining a large share of the high-value delivery business in cities. The government will review the position in three years; if Sweden Post argues at that stage that it cannot continue nationwide letter deliveries, levies on rival operators could be imposed to subsidise the service. By then Sweden Post expects electronic communications to be a substantial part of its business: last year, of the 2.5bn first and second class letters handled by Sweden Post, 200m were hybrid mail. It also transmitted several million electronic messages via E-mail or data exchange systems. Sweden Post's principal hybrid service is 'ePost', which enables companies to despatch, electronically, statements and other printed mail to six centres across the country, where the material is printed and put into the ordinary mail. A 'PC ePost' service, just launched, allows smaller customers to send hybrid mail from desktop computers. In the E-mail business the main competitor is Telia, the state telecoms operator. Mr Norin denies Telia is the 'natural' player in the electronic market. 'We don't own the roads because we drive on them: anyway, they are going to have their hands full with new cable and voice services over the next decade.' Telia, of course, does not see it that way. The electronic highways of Europe are set to become battlefields between telecoms operators - and the more entrepreneurial post offices.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Post Office: high-tech competition  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Market by                             Total market size mail contents                          volume (billion)                                            1992-93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Social Christmas, greetings and                     11.3 other social mail  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Financial Bills and invoices, cheques,                 18.3 other money matters including insurance/legal  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Commercial Orders, newspapers,                          32.5 magazines, books, other commercial  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Advertising Christmas, greetings and                      2.2 other social mail  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Royal Mail                                     % market share Competitors                            1992-93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Social Hand delivery, Interflora                 30 and telephone calls  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Financial Fax and EDI, credit and debit             36 cards (telephone), direct debit, visit branch/outlet, home banking, hand delivery, bike courier etc  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Commercial Purchase from retail outlets,             13 home delivery, EDI business post data run, telephone  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Advertising Ceefax/Teletext, TV, press,               31 radio, posters  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Post Office  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

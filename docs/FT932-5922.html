			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Smartest policy for Republicans The Clinton administration is going through a rough patch. But Republicans are naive if they expect an easy presidential victory in 1996. The business cycle favours the Democrats. So does the fall of communism, which has removed an external threat that once served to unite right-wingers. Worse, after the drift of the Bush years, the conservative movement lacks definition. Instead of presenting a clear alternative to Clintonism, a jumble of factions - ranging from born-again Christians to patrician traditionalists and crypto-protectionists - are vying for influence. If conservatives are to win political power, in the legislative as well as executive branch, they need a new unifying vision. Yet after the political gyrations of recent decades, it might seem that every possible 'ism' has been tried, usually with disappointing results. In fact, there is one philosophy that has never been consistently advocated - classical 19th-century liberalism. For some reason, politicians who advocate laissez-faire economic policies usually favour conservative social policies. Social liberals, on the other hand, nearly always advocate interventionist economic policies. The pattern is perfectly illustrated by Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. President Reagan cut taxes and deregulated the economy but tightened anti-abortion laws. President Clinton fights for gay rights yet wants to raise tax rates and increase government intervention in the economy. There is no mileage in Republicans attempting to outflank Democrats as economic regulators. But suppose they favoured freedom in all spheres, social as well as economic? Might this not be a winning combination? A book* edited by Mr David Boaz and Mr Edward Crane of the Cato Institute, a Washington think-tank, makes a strong case for precisely this combination of policies. Cato scholars are usually regarded as card-carrying conservatives. But Boaz and Crane chaff at the label, on the grounds that they are keener on radical reform than almost anybody else, certainly than Democrats. They would call themselves 'liberals', had American left-wingers not expropriated that title. Since 'classical liberal' sounds rather backward-looking, they have settled on 'market liberal' as shorthand for their political philosophy. 'Market liberals have a cosmopolitan, inclusive vision for society. We reject the bashing of gays, Japan, rich people and immigrants that contemporary liberals and conservatives seem to think addresses society's problems,' they write. The doctrine ought to be acceptable to a broad swathe of Americans, they claim, because it represents a return to the principles that guided the nation's founding fathers: personal freedom, limited government, free markets and the rule of law. What could be more American or more traditional than that? The book, however, is not without shortcomings. One danger is that mainstream readers will be put off by the sheer radicalism of its specific policy proposals. Mr Boaz, for example, would tackle inner city problems by abolishing most welfare payments, legalising hard drugs and breaking up public-sector educational monopolies. These are logically defensible positions but pretty hard for any politician to defend. There is little discussion of the broader obstacles preventing governments from pursuing policies that are consistently liberal in the 19th century sense. Boaz and Crane assume that the typical human being is a free spirit looking for fresh challenges. But what if most people are risk averse and keen on a relatively easy life? The essence of market liberalism is that government should stand back and allow individuals to make a success or failure of their lives. Crucial to this philosophy is the belief that people should be allowed to fail. But the modern state largely exists to prevent or limit people's ability to fail by providing pensions, healthcare, housing and numerous other services. The evidence suggests these welfare cushions are extremely popular. Another obstacle is the modern world's deep commitment to social justice. The most powerful objection to the prescriptions of true market liberals - be they cutting marginal tax rates, scrapping minimum-wage laws or making schools compete for pupils - is that they are 'unfair'. In the short run, some individuals would gain at the expense of others; in the longer run the gap between different income groups might widen. To make electoral progress, market liberals have got to bring about a fundamental shift in popular conceptions of fairness, for example by persuading people to stop worrying about gaps in relative incomes. This seems more possible in the US than in most of Europe. Indeed, at least one possible presidential contender in 1996, Mr William Weld, the highly regarded Republican governor of Massachusetts, is publicly associated with the socially progressive/economically tough approach championed by Boaz and Crane. A tax-cutting defender of gay rights, he even cites Friedrich Hayek, the late Austrian economist, as one of his intellectual heroes. If Mr Weld sticks to his principles and remains popular, he may come to represent the future for the Republican party. * Market Liberalism: A Paradigm for the 21st Century.

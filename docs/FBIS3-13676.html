			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Now to the inquiry commission into the massacre of  Muslims at prayer at a mosque in Hebron's Cave of the  Patriarchs. David Eppel, who has been listening to the evidence,  reports here on two new versions of what happened on the morning  of the crime; versions that surprised the bench and produced  some intensive cross questioning.    [Begin Eppel recording] What exactly were the orders given  soldiers when Jewish settlers opened fire on Palestinians? Did  Barukh Goldstein, the killer, carry the standard M-16 assault  rifle or was it a shortened version of the Galil, the Galon.  These were the critical questions as the inquiry commission  probed deeper into the circumstances surrounding the massacre in  Hebron. If, as four soldiers at the cave claimed in their  testimony today, Goldstein carried an M-16, it not only  contradicts the account given by their deputy company commander  Rotem Ravivi, but the version accepted by everyone until now,  including the defense establishment. Two of the four soldiers  said they saw another settler, whom they were unable to  identify, entering the Cave of the Patriarchs around the same  time as Goldstein. He, they said, was carrying a Galon, the  rifle Goldstein was assumed to have used. Other facts emerging  today concerned shots fired by men on guard duty at the door of  the Muslim place of worship. Some bullets fired into the air  also hit the ceiling. Time and again at this afternoon's  session, the bench wanted to hear from the soldiers giving  evidence or members of the Tank Corps how they interpreted the  open-fire orders. And to a man, they said they had been ordered  not to shoot at Jewish settlers if they were using their guns on  Palestinians. If they were being shot at, the directive was to  take cover and try to remove the magazine from the gun. Several  agreed they considered the order illogical, as they put it, and  in two instances they expressed their reservations. But beyond  that, under questioning, they agreed they would obey it even if  they themselves had come under fire. [end recording]    The commission goes into recess this evening and the  proceedings resume again next week.</p>

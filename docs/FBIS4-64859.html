			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Peter Norman report: "Lords Warn Brussels of EU Jobless </F> Expansion"]    [Text] The European Union [EU] is facing the prospect of a  "jobless expansion" with the European Commission underestimating  the gravity of its structural unemployment, a House of Lords  committee warns today.    Warning that "unemployment is the most important social  problem facing us at the present time," the Committee on the  European Communities calls on the EU "to develop a strategy both  for competitiveness and for employment."    Restoring Europe's competitiveness is a necessary condition  for sustained growth, the Committee says in a report on last  year's Commission white paper on growth, competitiveness and  employment. But competitiveness will not solve the problem of  structural unemployment -- the type that will not be dislodged  by economic growth and accounts for at least half of the EU's 17  million or more jobless.    The report says structural unemployment is, "if anything,  even more serious than the white paper suggests."    The Committee says the EU has much to learn from the United  States and Japan, which have better records of job creation. It  cites inadequate growth and investment, high short-term interest  rates over a long period, reduced competitiveness in terms of  quality and cost, loss of "technological edge," high unit labour  costs and excessive non-wage labour costs as reasons for the  EU's high structural unemployment.    Job creation can be achieved partly through improving  productivity and partly through encouraging innovation. But the  Lords point out that microeconomic measures to create jobs need  to be carried out at a national, rather than at an EU level.  These include simplifying regulations, reforming benefits and  the use of lifelong education and vocational training to match  skills to changing technological needs.    The EU's role should be to act as a catalyst for the  exchange  of ideas; an advocate of best practice; a monitor, for example,  of the effect of regulations on employment; and an umpire to  prevent mutually destructive de-regulation between member states.    The Lords report, which was agreed unanimously, says that  recovery should be "the immediate priority" of macroeconomic  policy in the EU. It urges member states to aim to achieve the  tough fiscal and monetary convergence criteria of the Maastricht  Treaty in the medium term. "They should not be strictly applied  until the Community has recovered from recession," the report  says.    Although the report steers clear of a full assessment of the  planned economic and monetary union, it is sceptical as to  whether it will help solve the problem of cyclical unemployment.  The report calls on the EU to complete the single market quickly  and enforce it equally.</p>

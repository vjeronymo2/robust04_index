			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Observer: Cadmium wash From Luneburg Heath to Medicine Hat. The British Army, which will have to give up its main training area in Germany from mid 1994, has secured an 'absolutely crucial' guarantee from Canada allowing it to fire guns and drive tanks around the Alberta prairie for the next 15 years. But the defence ministry was on sticky terrain in trying to persuade the Albertans of its considerate nature. 'The preservation of this area for army training has, as is so often the case with military land, led to it becoming well known as a safe environment for natural plant and animal life to flourish,' it said. That message clearly did not impress residents of the Luneburg area, who cam- paigned successfully to save the heath from soil erosion, noise and pollution by cad- mium, lead, mercury and oil.</p>

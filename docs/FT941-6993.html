			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: A man for all reasons - Barbara Ellis on the insurance ombudsman's annual report Compensation claims from home income plan investors have been pitched into further doubt in what has become a three-year tussle between the insurance and building societies ombudsmen and the institutions under their jurisdiction. Home income plans are packaged investments consisting of a mortgage taken out to buy an insurance company investment bond. Thousands were sold during the late 1980s on the basis that income from the bond would pay the mortgage interest and provide an income. But many salesmen failed to warn about the risks of spiralling debt and repossession if house prices and investment returns fell, and interest rates rose. Julian Farrand, the insurance ombudsman, says home income plans are the most significant part of his work load, totalling about 1,000 cases now with one or two new complaints arriving daily. So far, he has closed about 80 cases, with payouts to investors averaging Pounds 55,000, and distress payments averaging Pounds 1,500. But Farrand now faces a challenge from Sun Life. Last year, a QC acting as arbitrator in a case involving Legal and General ruled that the insurance ombudsman could not deal with a complaint about the mortgage element of an endowment mortgage package. Farrand felt this put home income plans outside his jurisdiction but John Craddock, a retired L&amp;G executive who chairs the ombudsman scheme board, said he should continue handling them. Farrand now is considering a handful of cases involving Sun Life although the company says it does not think they fall into the category of home income plans. Geoffrey Holt, compliance executive at the company, says two of the investors took out roll-up mortgages from building societies, then approached a Sun Life salesman to invest part of the money raised in a bond. 'We will look at the advice on the bond, but it is up to the societies to deal with the mortgage,' says Holt. Ombudsmen covering the building societies have no jurisdiction over 'pre-completion' matters such as advice given before a person takes up a mortgage as part of a home income plan. They are handling some home income plan complaints, but only with the voluntary consent of the societies concerned. Some have refused flatly to co-operate. Although a Building Societies' Association report has recommended the ombudsman's jurisdiction be extended to pre-completion complaints, it was careful to exempt complaints about the selling of investments, saying these would be 'more appropriate' to the new PIA ombudsman (see page VI) due to start work in July. But this could entail disastrous delay for investors, as most were elderly when they bought the plans. Moreover, if the PIA also takes over Farrand's long-term insurance case load, home income cases presumably will be included, resulting in a probable halving of the maximum Pounds 100,000 compensation available from the insurance ombudsman now.</p>

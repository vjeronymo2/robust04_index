			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Arts: Sex and drugs . . . and - marketing of ancient songs To the sophisticated connoisseur of classical music, Carl Orff's Carmina Burana is a stirring, if slightly excessive, paean to the rantings of a group of 13th century Bavarian monks who probably spent too much time with only their fevered imaginations to keep them company. To the less refined listener it means only one thing - after-shave. The memorable advertising campaign by Old Spice in the 1970s used Orff's opening to the work, 'O Fortuna', to evoke in a few expensive seconds of air-time the atmosphere of passion, danger and excitement which no self-respecting, iron-pumping macho man could resist. The ad became a classic. It was satirised by the hapless duo of the Carling Black Label series, while Orff's exultant piece, composed in the 1930s, continued to be plundered by the scavengers of popular culture: it was used in the score of John Boorman's Excalibur, formed the basis of Damien's theme in The Omen trilogy and, more recently, warmed up the pubescent audiences waiting to see Michael Jackson perform during his Dangerous tour. Now a record company has taken the classics-to-pop journey to its logical conclusion: Decca is packaging and promoting the Carmina Burana in exactly the same way it would treat a high-profile pop album. Although certain classical musicians - Luciano Pavarotti, Nigel Kennedy - have achieved pop status and sales figures, and themed compilations have made a certain impact on the market, this is claimed to be the first time a single piece of classical music is being made to take the strain all on its own. From this week, British television viewers will be treated to the new advertising campaign devised to promote the product. And it is little more than an act of promotion: there is no new recording to push (the version chosen by Decca is 10 years old), no big-name artist to splash across the cover, no mention, even, of the composer. Instead, we have loud music, writhing bodies and a semi-naked girl gyrating in ecstasy before a hysterical audience. For keen followers of post-modern semiotic theory in practice, there is even, in the opening seconds, the wave from the Old Spice advertisement. 'We felt it was vital to establish that link,' says Paul Moseley, head of marketing of Decca UK. He says market research showed that, when played the piece of music, nearly everyone recognised it but only 20-25 per cent of the sample knew what it was. 'Because of the familiarity from the Old Spice ad, the Carmina Burana has always been a best-seller, but there are more than 100 versions around and sales have been dispersed.' Now the company is hoping to tap that familiarity and persuade its target audience - mostly male (that Old Spice connection again) 20-40 year-olds whose resistance to asking for funny foreign names in a record shop is breaking down all the time. Moseley bridles when asked if his campaign is not vulgarising classical music by its use of sex as a selling point. 'It is all there already, we are not adding anything. The Carmina Burana are all about sex, drinking, gambling and death.' He quotes cheerfully from one of the songs: 'This is the Joyful Time': 'My virginity makes me frisky, my simplicity holds me back Oh] Oh] Oh]'. It was not all purity and piety in the medieval monasteries, after all. Of the album's sleeve, which shows the girl from the advertisement posing in front of a baying rock crowd, he says: 'Many of the sleeves from the past have had similar themes, of nakedness and pagan celebrations, but they just happen to have been paintings.' Just in case the point is missed, the album promotion even has a slogan: 'Music for your basic instincts'. The Decca campaign is costing the company around Pounds 500,000, for which it expects an entry into the pop charts. The revamped Carmina Burana will have to sell six-figure numbers to achieve that, which in these days would be no mean feat for an old recording of a classical piece. 'After the boom years of 1990 and 1991, when we had the Three Tenors, Nigel Kennedy and Pavarotti, things have fallen off somewhat. It is more difficult to sell more than 100,000 copies of a classical album now,' says Moseley. The release of Orff's most famous work is not entirely an exercise in cynical marketing; 'O Fortuna' is already used regularly in dance clubs to get things going, much as New Age and ambient music is used at chill-out time. There are few pieces of music better-suited to the Ecstasy-induced adrenalin rush of a rave moving into top gear than the Carmina Burana's triumphant opening. Proving, perhaps, that it is young music listeners who care the least about traditional categories in the first place and that the record companies are finally following in their wake.</p>

The  minister answered: "We found no military weapons." He stated  that leftist activists are operating in Tava'i Borda. He added:  "I am warning my fellow countrymen, the peasants, not to  participate in adventures at the invitation of some enthusiastic  people, because most probably, at the time of truth, those  enthusiastic people will be nowhere near the front line... I  want to reiterate that according to information on hand, to the  investigation we conducted, and to what we actually found, the  peasants will not last five minutes in a battle." The minister  stressed that he "does not want any innocent victims."    Podesta stated: "The leftists are there," adding that "there  is nothing wrong with that.... It is no longer a sin to be a  leftist." He went on to say that "it is still a sin, however,  for leftists, rightists, centrists, people from above or below,  to advocate breaking the law. It cannot be tolerated."    The minister indicated that sometimes the leftists, as well  as other groups, advocate breaking the law. He did not specify  which other groups. Podesta said: "Sometimes we tend to forget  the rules of the game and if we find these rules inappropriate  we have a democratic congress which we can ask to amend the law.  Until the laws are amended they must be complied with. The law  must be obeyed."    Podesta admitted that the state does not have a  representative in Tava'i Borda, adding that state supervision is  not good, nor should it last forever. He explained that the  settling of the area began in 1989 "amid general approval, but  nobody could have imagined that peasants would be expelling  other peasants. Furthermore the administration was unable to  provide the followup support to guarantee the success of the  settlement."    The minister added that a state emergency program is under  way to help the peasants. He announced that a permanent and  broader plan will be implemented later. [passage omitted]</p>

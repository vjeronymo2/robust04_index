			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAKES AND SIN  </P> <P> In response to "We Need a Meter to Gauge the Richter Scale of Sin," by Brent R.  Pitman, California Commentary, Nov. 13:  </P> <P> For Billy Graham to implicate the earthquake with sin is unbelievable. What an  insult to the people of Santa Cruz and Watsonville. "If there were no sin in  the world, he said, there would be no earthquake and no suffering." I agree  that if there were no sin, there would be no suffering for the simple reason  there would be no people. There would still be earthquakes but the results  would be academic.  </P> <P> For the good reverend's information, there is no sin on the moon because there  are no people. However, the moon still records about 8 moonquakes every day,  some 3,000 per year.  </P> <P> Makes one wonder about these so-called men of the cloth who claim to engage in  a daily dialogue with God.  </P> <P> JOHN C. MARTIN  </P> <P> Palmdale  </P></p>

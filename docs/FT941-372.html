			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Bio seeks Pounds 93.6m to fund drugs development In the second cash call in two days from the bustling biotechnology sector, British Bio-technology yesterday announced a rights issue of ordinary shares and warrants intended to raise Pounds 93.6m over the next two years. The rights issue is equivalent to a 1-for-3 issue at 400p a share and 3/4 of a warrant on the basis of one unit, comprising four ordinary shares and three warrants, for every 12 shares held. It should raise an initial Pounds 46m net of expenses. The warrants are exercisable at 525p at any time between December 11 1995 and January 31 1996. If exercised in full, they will raise Pounds 47.6m. The shares rose 5p to 470p. The cash-raising exercise comes 12 days after the first clinical trials of Batimastat, an anti-cancer drug, indicating that it worked well. Mr James Noble, finance director, acknowledged that the cash call was opportunistic but added that this was a characteristic of the sector. Biotech companies spend many years in research and development before a drug comes to market and must generate cash from markets rather than sales. Further clinical trial results from other drugs are due later this year. The summer should see data on Aids and pancreas disease treatments. He said that the company needed the Pounds 93.6m to take it through the development phases to drug launches. Four of the directors intend to take up their rights and the others will sell some of the rights and buy the rest with the proceeds. The units will be dealt nil paid from April 15 to May 9 when they will be split into shares and warrants for fully paid trading. COMMENT The rights issue from British Bio-technology is not like that on Monday from Proteus International. British Bio-tech moved more quickly after the publication of important clinical trial data, it has already signed deals with blue chip research-driven pharmaceuticals companies such as Glaxo, and it has a solid following among City analysts. Once Batimastat enters the next stage of clinical development later this year, a risk-adjusted net present valuation of the company comes out at about Pounds 700m. That is the equivalent of more than Pounds 10 a share, and makes the rights issue look a bargain for the risk-minded investor.</p>

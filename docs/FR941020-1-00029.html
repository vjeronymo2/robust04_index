			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background on the Indiana Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 29, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Indiana program. Background information on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval can be found in the July 26, 1982,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (47 FR 32071). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 914.10, 914.15, and 914.16.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since July 29, 1982, (the date of conditional approval of the Indiana program), a number of changes have been made to the Federal regulations concerning surface coal mining and reclamation operations. Pursuant to the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17, OSM informed Indiana on May 22, 1985, (Regulatory Reform I), and on September 20, 1989, (Regulatory Reform III), that a number of Indiana regulations are less effective than or inconsistent with the revised Federal requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated October 15, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IND&hyph;1300), the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) submitted to OSM a State program amendment package  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 93&hyph;6 consisting of revisions to 52 sections of the Indiana rules. These revisions address changes to the Indiana program that were identified in the two letters referred to above, and certain required program amendments. The State has also proposed additional changes which Indiana believes will further improve the approved State program. The primary focus of the submittal is on hydrology, impoundments, roads, support facilities, and termination of jurisdiction. OSM subsequently reviewed the proposed amendments in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 93&hyph;6 and provided Indiana with a detailed list of comments concerning the amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated September 26, 1994 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1401), Indiana submitted proposed program amendment  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 94&hyph;5. In that letter, Indiana stated that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 94&hyph;5 revises language which was previously submitted in program amendment  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 93&hyph;6, and formally withdrew amendment  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 93&hyph;6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following rulemaking actions are being proposed by Indiana:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

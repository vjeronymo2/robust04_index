			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Ownership of an applicant or 8(a) concern by one or more disadvantaged individuals must be direct ownership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) An applicant concern owned by another business entity that is owned and controlled by one or more disadvantaged individuals does not meet the requirement that it be owned by disadvantaged individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An applicant concern that is owned by a trust which is in turn owned and controlled by a disadvantaged individual does not meet the requirement that it be owned by disadvantaged individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (g) The individuals determined to be disadvantaged in one 8(a) concern, their immediate family members residing in the same household, and the 8(a) concern itself may not hold, in the aggregate, more than a 10 percent equity ownership interest in any other single 8(a) concern. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A non-8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business is prohibited from having an equity ownership interest in an 8(a) concern which exceeds 10 percent, except that a former Program Participant may have an equity ownership interest of up to 20 percent in a current 8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business. *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) *&blank;*&blank;* While SBA approval must be obtained, the substitution of one disadvantaged individual for another disadvantaged individual within an 8(a) concern that was awarded one or more 8(a) contracts does not require termination of those contracts under &sect;124.317 of these regulations or a request for waiver of that termination requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) The ownership interests of business concern and its principal(s) are considered to be aggregated in determining whether a non-disadvantaged individual or business concern exceeds the 10 percent equity ownership limitations (or, in the case of a former Program Participant, the 20 percent equity ownership limitations) established by this section and &sect;124.104. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m) In determining the respective ownership interests in an applicant concern, or in a Program Participant once admitted to the program, SBA considers applicable state community property laws. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) In a community property state, even when only one spouse's name appears on a document of title or stock certificate, both spouses are considered to have one-half interest in that property as long as the property is acquired, earned, or accumulated during the course of the marriage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If SBA determines that the stock or assets of an 8(a) applicant concern are held as community property, and if only one spouse demonstrates disadvantaged status, SBA shall require as a condition of demonstrating or maintaining eligibility, the transfer by the non-disadvantaged spouse or his/her ownership interest to the disadvantaged spouse. Such a transfer must be in an amount sufficient for the disadvantaged spouse to meet the minimum 51% unconditional ownership requirement for 8(a) program eligibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Title to 8(a) applicant concern A is 100% in the name of Mrs. X (an individual determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged). Mr. X is a non-disadvantaged individual. Mr. and Mrs. X reside in a community property state and concern A is determined to be community property. By operation of law, Mr. X is deemed to own 50% of concern A. In order to meet 8(a) eligibility requirements, Mr. X would have to transfer 1% of his interest in concern A to Mrs. X as non-community property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Title to 8(a) applicant B is 51% in the name of Mr. Y (an individual determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged) and 49% in Mr. Z (an unmarried non-disadvantaged individual). Mrs. Y is a non-disadvantaged individual. Mr. and Mrs. Y reside in a community property state and concern B is determined to be community property. By operation of law, Mrs. Y is deemed to own 25.5% of concern B. In order to meet 8(a) eligibility requirements, Mrs. Y would have to transfer all 25.5% of her interest in concern B to Mr. Y as non-community property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Section 124.104 would be amended by revising the introductory text, paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4), paragraph (b), the introductory text of paragraph (c), paragraph (c)(2), and paragraph (d)(3) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;124.104  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Control and management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except for concerns owned by Indian tribes, Alaska Native Corporations, Native Hawaiian Organizations, or Community Development Corporations, as defined in &sect;124.100, an applicant concern's management and daily business operations must be conducted by an owner(s) of the applicant concern who has (have) been determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  &sect;124.112 for the requirements for tribally-owned entities and those owned by ANCs). In the case of an applicant concern owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization, the concern's management and daily business operations must be conducted by one or more Native Hawaiian individuals. In the case of a concern owned by a Community Development Corporation, the concern's management and daily business operations must be conducted by one or more individuals determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged. In order for a disadvantaged individual to be found to control the concern, that individual must have managerial or technical experience and competency directly related to the primary industry in which the applicant concern is seeking certification. The application must demonstrate that the applicant concern is actually controlled and managed by one or more individuals determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged. A disadvantaged individual's unexercised right to cause a change in the control or management of the applicant concern does not satisfy this requirement, regardless of how quickly or easily the right could be exercised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

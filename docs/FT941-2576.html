			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Travel: Life with the lions - Practical Traveller You know what they say: if you come face to face with a north American mountain lion, don't run away. Attack. They are as powerful as jaguars and have teeth as long as your little finger, but mountain lions are basically deferential. They are also highly persecuted - or have been. For years, they have been shot at by ranchers and hunters. Lion numbers are reckoned to have levelled off recently. But US state game agencies still know too little about them to ensure their survival in the face of expanding human numbers. The most direct way to find out about the lions is to join one of the many expeditions organised by Earthwatch. Since 1972 Earthwatch has supported 1,850 field projects in 104 countries by providing scientists with 40,000 volunteers, plus funds and equipment. It says its aim is to 'improve understanding of the planet, the diversity of its inhabitants, and the processes that affect the quality of life on earth'. This is the sharp end of eco-tourism - a logical step forward for anyone tired of the familiar itineraries and (sometimes) shop-worn package deals strung together by commercial tour companies. The mountain lion trips organised by Earthwatch take you to the Albion mountains of Idaho. Five expeditions are scheduled this year: July 6-17, July 27-August 7, August 17-28, September 7-18 and September 28-October 9. The cost is Pounds 880 (Dollars 1,300) each, which covers food and accommodation, plus a contribution to the project's overheads (staff, field camp, vehicles, etc). Before leaving you get an expedition briefing (25-75 pages) outlining the history, aims and logistics of the project. Not covered: transportation to and from the meeting point. In the case of the mountain lions, this is Pocatello, Idaho. Says Earthwatch: 'These are real scientific expeditions, not tours. Earthwatch makes every effort to describe accurately field conditions in its publications, but field work in remote locations is a delicate business and prone to last-minute change. Certain details of your expedition may be different from published descriptions.' The Idaho lion project is trying to answer various questions. Example: what costs does inbreeding impose on small, isolated lion populations? Depending on season, Earthwatch teams help capture, radio-collar and monitor mountain lions, and locate kill sites. All teams share cooking duties. There is a huge range of Earthwatch expeditions on offer. You can look for dinosaur remains in Argentina; study human origins in Uganda; visit the mammoth graveyard at Hot Springs, South Dakota; ponder the rise and fall of the Himalaya; track jaguars and other species in Peru; join a Bahamian reef survey; photograph humpback whales off Hawaii; and observe the behaviour of golden eagles on the Isle of Mull, Scotland. Almost all expeditions last 12, 13 or 14 days, with the cost generally falling between Pounds 800 and Pounds 1,200 each (plus travel to the pick-up point, visas, insurance and side-trips). Under some circumstances, part of the cost may be tax-deductible, even for UK tax-payers. You have to be a member of Earthwatch to join these expeditions: Pounds 25 annually (family membership: Pounds 30). Details: Earthwatch Europe, Belsyre Court, 57 Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6HU.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- China's first banking  law, the Draft Law on the People's Bank of China, is to be  submitted to the National People's Congress, the country's top  legislature, for deliberation starting on June 28, after 15  years of formulation and repeated revisions, a NPC spokesman  said here today.    The draft law is to specify the position and  responsibilities  of the People's Bank as the central bank, and uphold the  authority of monetary policies, Zhou Chenggui told a press  conference on the upcoming Eighth Session of the Eighth NPC  Standing Committee.    The new law will also be "necessary for supervision and  control over China's financial industry, and the establishment  of the macro adjustment system with the central bank as the  core," he said.    In the eight-day meeting ending July 5, the draft  arbitration  law and the draft auditing law will also be submitted to the  legislators for review.    The formulation of the arbitration law aims at improving  China's arbitration system, better solving economic disputes and  maintaining social economic order, Zhou claimed.    "It will help to develop China's socialist market economy,  and promote international economic and trade exchanges and  cooperation," he said.    The legislature will continue its review of the draft  securities law, which has already been deliberated in two  sessions.    Zhou disclosed that there are some "major changes" to the  previous version of the draft law this time, based on the  reviews by the lawmakers and opinions of people from all walks  of life.    He said the NPC Standing Committee session will also  deliberate the Draft Labor Law, the Draft Urban Real Estate Law  and the Draft Regulation on Punishing Copyright Violators.  These were submitted to the legislature in the previous two  sessions.    Also included on the agenda are the examination of the 1993  final state accounts, a review of the State Council reports on  China's forestry industry and NPC special committees' reports on  the implementation of the statistics law and the teachers law.</p>

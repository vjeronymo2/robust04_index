			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Newly named Construction  Minister Koji Morimoto said Thursday [28 April] he plans no  change in the policy of the former government of Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa to boost Japan's public works projects program  for the current decade.    "I think the program should be expanded. I want to study it  more," he told reporters at a news conference, his first as  construction chief.    The former Hosokawa government decided to add more projects  to the 430 trillion yen program, which was set up in line with  Japan's agreement on the structural impediments initiative (SII)  talks with the United States concluded in June 1990.</p>

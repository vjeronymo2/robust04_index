			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPARENT KIDNAP ATTEMPTS PUT PARENTS ON GUARD -- AND ON EDGE;  </P> <P> SAFETY: ADULTS IN HERMOSA BEACH AND MANHATTAN BEACH TRY TO WARN THEIR CHILDREN  WITHOUT WHIPPING UP HYSTERIA.  </P> <P> In her mind, Debbie Shaffer can hear the final bell ringing at Hermosa Valley  School and see her 11-year-old daughter, Michelle, starting the long walk home.  </P> <P> At the office where she works as an executive secretary, the young mother  fidgets and watches the clock for the next half-hour, the time it takes for the  little blonde girl to phone and say she has reached home -- safely.  </P> <P> Only then will Shaffer relax.  </P> <P> It's been that way for many parents in Hermosa Beach and neighboring Manhattan  Beach since the first in a string of four apparent kidnaping attempts against  schoolchildren was reported March 8.  </P> <P> While unnerved by reports that a man in a pickup truck has approached  youngsters in the communities, adults said they are relieved that years of  training paid off and that all four children ran from the stranger.  </P> <P> Fears of child abuse are nothing new in the two beach cities, where residents  have lived for years with the legacy of the McMartin Pre-School molestation  case. Several of the "McMartin kids," as they are known, attend Hermosa Valley  School.  </P> <P> "The McMartin situation has pretty well sobered everyone to what can happen,  even in a small community," said Richard Halliburton as he dropped his daughter  off at Hermosa Valley School, where gates were locked Thursday to prevent  strangers from coming onto campus.  </P> <P> A long line of cars dropped children off at the school Thursday morning. More  parents have been escorting their children to campus in the past week, school  officials said.  </P> <P> A boy in a fluorescent surfing-style T-shirt and a girl lugging a book bag half  her size nodded in silent agreement as their parents explained that they had  warned their children to be increasingly wary of strangers.  </P> <P> "It's important to alert them without unduly alarming them about the danger,"  said one father.  </P> <P> Shaffer said she had moved to Hermosa Beach three years ago to escape the gangs  and drugs she feared her children might have encountered in Lawndale schools.  "I wanted to get the kids in a good community and a good school, and then this  happens," she said. "It makes me real nervous."  </P> <P> She said she has come to realize that Hermosa Beach is not immune to the  world's problems -- despite the illusion of insulation held out by high home  prices, sea breezes and the easy beach life style.  </P> <P> "Things do happen in nice neighborhoods," said another mother. "We are not  exempt."  </P> <P> Children at Hermosa Valley School discuss "stranger danger" and other social  concerns at least once a week , said Shalee Cunningham, superintendent of the  one-campus Hermosa Beach City School District.  </P> <P> The four children approached since March 8 apparently learned their lessons  well.  </P> <P> The incidents began that day when an 8-year-old walking home from Pacific  Elementary School in Manhattan Beach was approached by a man in a white pickup  truck. Over the next six days three more children -- two from Hermosa Valley  School and one from Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach -- were  approached by strangers in either a red or white pickup. All four children ran  before the stranger could get close to them.  </P> <P> Since each offered a slightly different description, police said they do not  know whether they are looking for more than one man.  </P> <P> Dozens of phone calls with possible leads have poured in to the police.  Plainclothes officers in both seaside cities are making special patrols around  the schools.  </P> <P> "Anyone in a red or white pickup gets a lot of attention," said Anthony Cotton,  a crossing guard.  </P> <P> Hermosa Valley School has taken an added precaution by locking two gates at the  back of the campus that used to be open so residents could walk to and from the  beach. Cunningham said the open-campus policy made it too difficult to  distinguish legitimate visitors from those who might threaten children.  </P> <P> Several parents said they are wary of the television news crews and reporters  who have visited the community in the past week. They said the media, in the  wake of McMartin, has unfairly painted the South Bay as an area possessed by  hysteria over child molestation.  </P> <P> "The press portrayed us as being hysterical," said one mother, who asked not to  be named. "We don't want that to happen again. These are serious incidents."  </P></p>

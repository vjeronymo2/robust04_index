			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Political paralysis looms over G7 summit JAPAN'S political crisis could not have come at a more sensitive time for its international economic relations. With a general election due in late July, the country will be in the midst of the election campaign when Tokyo hosts the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised starting on July 7. That week Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, is due to sign an agreement with US President Bill Clinton on a framework for Japan and the US to negotiate trade disputes. The prospects for the Gatt world trade talks have also been hurt. The Japanese government, fearful of being punished in the polls, will be in no position to deliver concessions for the sake of a Gatt agreement at the summit. The immediate consequence of the no-confidence vote will be paralysis of the government. Mr Miyazawa has become a lame duck and all major decisions will be put off during the campaign. The election itself could yield a weak, LDP-led coalition government. In the short run the main beneficiaries of the crisis may be Japan's powerful bureaucrats, who will have more scope to act on their own initiative. But in the medium run the bureaucrats can only work effectively if strong politicians are on hand to take big decisions, for instance over whether the ailing Japanese economy needs more stimulus or what concessions to make on agriculture for the sake of the Gatt talks. The summit may not be too damaged because plans for its agenda are already fairly well advanced. Indeed a successful summit would strengthen the LDP's claim to be the only party capable of representing Japan on the world stage. However, the ageing Mr Miyazawa is likely to look weak next to the relatively youthful Mr Clinton and the new Canadian prime minister Ms Kim Campbell. Japan's bilateral meetings with Russian President Boris Yeltsin may be particularly troubling, as Mr Yeltsin is likely to make clear Japan should not expect concessions in the dispute with Russia over the Kurile islands north of Japan. Rough treatment from Mr Yeltsin would be a further humiliation for Mr Miyazawa. As for the talks with the US, foreign ministry officials are confident the outline framework for trade negotiations can be agreed by officials. But substantive talks on specific issues such as opening up the market for supercomputers or car parts will have to be shelved. In addition US calls for further stimulus for the Japanese economy will only be met by a strong government capable of overcoming the finance ministry's opposition to more government pump priming. The same is true of the Gatt talks. Tokyo will next week host a meeting of trade ministers from the EC, the US and Canada. It was widely hoped this would deliver an agreement on market access measures. That may be more difficult now. But what can certainly be ruled out in the near future is any Japanese concessions on its rice import ban, which is the main Japanese obstacle to a Gatt deal. The LDP needs all the support it can get. Its unwillingness to support political reform may well have antagonised young urban voters. The last thing it will want to do is to alienate its traditional rural supporters as well.</p>

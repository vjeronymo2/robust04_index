			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Slough Estates plans rights issue after 59% rise to Pounds 50m SLOUGH Estates, the UK's largest industrial property company, yesterday took advantage of the City's improved sentiment towards the property sector by launching a Pounds 147.3m rights issue to reduce its gearing. The rights issue was accompanied by a 59 per cent rise in 1992 pre-tax profits from Pounds 31.6m to Pounds 50.3m, a 17 per cent decline in diluted net assets per share from 331p to 274p and a 30 per cent cut in the dividend. Slough Estates' share price, which has nearly doubled since interest rates began to fall last September, dipped 2p to 193p. Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman, was cautiously optimistic about the property market. 'We believe that the market is at or near its bottom,' he said. However, he doubted that there would be a significant improvement until the rise in unemployment was arrested. Sir Nigel said the rights issue was necessary to reduce the 'higher than appropriate' balance sheet gearing, which increased from 67 per cent to 83 per cent during 1992. The rights issue will reduce gearing to 58 per cent and dilute the net asset value from 276p to 245p. The proposed 3-for-10 rights issues involves the issue of 100.8m new shares at 150p each. The company also said it was redeeming its 6 per cent convertible bonds due in 2003. The operating profit before interest and exceptional items increased from Pounds 95.7m to Pounds 114.0m. Net interest charges increased from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds 44.9m, with a Pounds 20.2m decline in capitalised interest. Exceptional provisions against trading property assets amounted to Pounds 18.8m, compared with Pounds 36.7m in 1991. Property sales totalled Pounds 123m. The value of its investment portfolio fell by 10.1 per cent. Values fell by 7.3 per cent in its core UK industrial portfolio, by 8.2 per cent in its UK retail portfolio and by 21.1 per cent in its UK office portfolio. Bredero Properties, which is 49.5 per cent owned by Slough, has began talks with its banks about renegotiating its loans. Slough has valued its investment at Pounds 13.3m. Earnings per share rose from 8p to 9.6p. The final dividend of 5p (up from 7.15p) makes a total dividend for the year of 8.1p (up from 11.55p). Lex, Page 20</p>

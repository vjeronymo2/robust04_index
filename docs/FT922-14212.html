			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Libyan demonstrators mob UN envoy A CHANTING mob yesterday blocked a motorcade in Tripoli carrying a United Nations envoy sent to explain a UN resolution imposing sanctions against Libya over its refusal to yield two men suspected of the 1988 bombing of a US airliner. Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, the UN undersecretary general for political affairs, was later assailed in his hotel by the demonstrators, who were dispersed by riot police firing tear gas. The Tripoli demonstrations hardly augured well for renewed attempts by Arab League foreign ministers in Cairo last night to find a compromise to Libya's increasingly bitter dispute with the world community. The special committee of seven ministers from Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Syria, Libya, Mauritania and Morocco was formed several weeks ago to defuse the Libyan crisis, but it has been ineffectual. Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, told reporters after a morning's informal talks on the Libyan affair there were 'many proposals' on the table, but he would not go into details. Privately League officials are pessimistic about their latest mediation efforts. 'The aim of the committee is to contain the situation, confirm the Arab position opposing terrorism, solve the problem in the framework of international sovereignty and provide a solution which all parties will agree to,' Mr Moussa added. One proposal is for Libya to hand over the two men to the Arab League which would act as a conduit for their eventual surrender to the British or US authorities for trial. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, would also be involved in facilitating such a transfer. But in Tripoli at the weekend, Libya's Colonel Muammer Gadaffi was adamant that unless the men voluntarily gave themselves up, he would not hand them over. Libya would never surrender its 'sons', he declared. Security Council Resolution 748, agreed last week, imposes an air and arms embargo against Libya from April 15 if it continues to block attempts to extradite its nationals suspected of downing Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in Scotland. The Council is also demanding that Libya make available for questioning to the French authorities four Libyans, including Col Gadaffi's brother-in-law, in connection with the bombing of a French UTA aircraft over Niger with loss of all 171 passengers and crew.</p>

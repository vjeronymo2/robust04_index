			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 2: Market leader in meat machinery - Profile / Wolfking Whenever you eat fast food, the chances are high that the ground meat in the burger, the chicken nuggets in the salad or the salami slices on the pizza were churned out by machinery from a small Danish company, Wolfking. With few exceptions, the Danish companies which manufacture machinery for the food processing industry are small, but they often have a substantial share of the world market in their special area. Wolfking is typical. At its headquarters in the town of Slagelse, on Sjlland, it employs about 200 people and has a turnover of about DKr160m (Pounds 16.5m), but it is nevertheless a market leader in its field. About 85 per cent of its production is exported. Its biggest market, where it employs a sales and service staff of 25, is the US, followed by the UK, Germany and France. The global range of its exports, which go to China, Japan, Korea, and South America as well as the US and Europe, has helped Wolfking maintain its growth despite downturns in individual national or regional markets. Started as a family business in 1949, Wolfking has been a member of the Danish BJH Group since 1979. BJH is an unlisted private company with a turnover of about DKr1bn, mainly from production of raw materials for the European petfood industry. Since 1949, Wolfking's employment has more than doubled to more than 200 in Slagelse itself. In addition, it has sales and service companies in the US, the UK and Germany. It works through agents in another 30 countries or so. Two years ago it bought a Dutch company, Belam, which concentrates on ham production systems, with 50 employees. Altogether, the Wolfking companies have a turnover of about DKr200m. Wolfking produces all the machinery which is required by butchers, supermarkets and mass-producers of minced-meat products or hams from the point at which raw materials are delivered to the final handling and portioning of the finished product (but not packaging machinery) - ranging through simple machines to semi- and fully-automated systems, including 'grinders, mixers, emulsifiers, injectors, tenderisers, massagers, pumps and transport equipment', according to its catalogue. The acquisition of Belam is an indication of things to come. Other companies which have high-quality products and product programmes are being sought to complement Wolfking's existing business. Most of Wolfking's machinery is for the meat industry, but not all. The company also manufactures food pelleting systems for the fish-farming industry, machines for making processed cheese, and plant to produce fish-fodder for mink (which is no accident: Denmark is the world's largest producer of mink skins). Some of its equipment also goes to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, bakeries, and producers of chocolate and sweets. Where Wolfking has the edge over its international competitors, says Mr Jacob Dilling-Hansen, marketing manager, is in its supply of complete, fully-automated processing lines. 'No one else makes such complete machinery systems as we do.' As a supplier of automated production systems, says Mr Dilling-Hansen, 'we are cleaning up the market. Our share of the world market for systems of this kind is about 75 per cent.' Wolfking gained its first reference for this kind of system by delivering the equipment for a big plant operated by Tulip International, the Danish company, for minced-meat products at Vejle, Jutland. The plant was installed at the end of the 1980s. Since then, it has delivered complete systems to Germany, Spain, Norway and the UK, where one of its production lines turns out 75 tonnes an hour, 24 hours a day, six days a week for Spillers, the petfood group, near Glasgow. The development of these large-scale systems has taken Wolfking into the era of computer-aided design and manufacturing and computer-integrated manufacturing systems. All project development, engineering and design is done on three-dimensional CAD network. Plant control software is developed in-house. When machinery or complete systems are delivered, the same engineers who worked on production are sent to the customer to undertake installation and start-up, says Mr Dilling-Hansen. One of the company's main pre-occupations is to ensure that its machinery meets the requirements of the European Union's machinery directive, which comes into force in 1995. The directive concerns hygiene and safety. 'We expect that all our machinery will receive the 'CE' stamp by then,' says Mr Dilling-Hansen, 'and we think that many of our competitors will have trouble meeting the deadline.'</p>

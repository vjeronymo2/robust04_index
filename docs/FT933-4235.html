			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses unable to make much headway SENIOR bourses drifted yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw a weak start as the options and futures market dragged equities to a DAX index intraday low of 1,865, before recovering just before the close to 1,885.29. Traders reported that selling accelerated when the DAX broke a support level at 1,880, although they added that the market had been looking overbought and was due for a correction. Turnover improved slightly to DM7bn from Tuesday's low DM6.3bn. In an absence of corporate news, VW again attracted attention, particularly given conflicting statements from the group's senior management. The shares added DM1.40 to DM362.90 after Mr Ferdinand Piech said that a dividend would probably be resumed in 1994. PARIS fell back modestly, the CAC-40 index shedding 7.85 to 2,129.44 in turnover of FFr3.2bn. A further batch of interim results affected share performances: CarnaudMetalbox lost FFr10.50 to FFr198.50 after reporting that it saw no improvement in profits for the rest of the year, and Valeo gained FFr20 to FFr986 reflecting satisfaction with first half figures. Mr Bob Barber of James Capel, reiterating his sell recommendation, noted that it was difficult to believe Valeo shares could outperform the market 'at a time when the prospects for companies in the sector are generally being regarded with growing caution and ahead of what we believe will be a downward reaction in the price of automotive shares'. AMSTERDAM experienced a further correction, with the CBS Tendency index falling 2.5 or 2 per cent at 123.9 in good turnover. The market had a second look at Ahold's results and marked the shares down Fl 3.50 at Fl 87.70, while a fall in Grolsch of Fl 1.70 to Fl 39.30 on disappointment with its interims, dragged Heineken off Fl 4.10 to Fl 182.30. Bols Wessanen was down Fl 1.50 to Fl 42.20 ahead of today's results. MILAN remained on a downward track, not helped by program selling ahead of tomorrow's options expiry, and the Comit index shed 15.57 or 2.6 per cent to 594.18. Bank privatisation candidates came under pressure following the news that IRI, the state holding company, planned to sell them off by public offering and not through a competitive tender. BCI shed L234 or 4.4 per cent to L5,126 while Credito Italiano was L25 easier at L2,700. Ferruzzi, however, shrugged off local press reports that details of its rescue plan would be delayed until the end of this month. The shares continued their recent advance, rising L41 or 10 per cent to L452.75. ZURICH spent an uncertain session, with investors mixed on the prospects for lower interest rates and the SMI index dipped 5.5 to 2,397.9. Nestle registered shares were steady at SFr1,072 in active trading with analysts expecting a moderate growth in half year profits to be announced today. STOCKHOLM retreated further as Volvo Bs lost another SKr11 to SKr447. The Affarsvarlden general index declined 12.3 to 1,272.1 in turnover of SKr1.3bn. COPENHAGEN took little notice of a 0.5 point cut in the central bank's key 14 day rate to 10 per cent with analysts suggesting that further cuts would be needed before the present, positive undertone turned into a rally. The KFX index shed 0.9 to 98.95 in moderate turnover of DKr601m. VIENNA fell 4 per cent amid further profit-taking after the market's strong run and on renewed concern ahead of results due shortly from OMV. The ATX index tumbled 41.36 to 970.81. OMV shed Sch42 to Sch755, after a day's low of Sch735, as local press comment suggested that the group faced heavy losses and could be forced to restructure its chemicals operations. ATHENS bounced back after Tuesday's slide as the prospects of an early election receded. The general index which was 2 per cent higher for much of the day received a late fillip which took it 40.25 or 4.9 per cent higher to 861.15 at the close. ISTANBUL continued in record-setting mood, in spite of some late profit-taking after an early rally which saw the composite index over the 13,000 level. The index finished 198.4 or 1.6 per cent higher at 12,725, for a 9.2 per cent rise since the start of the week.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- September 8                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open      10.30      11.00     12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1270.50    1269.09    1268.83   1271.84 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1361.79    1361.28    1361.07   1365.31  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00      14.00     15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1272.51    1270.89   1266.71    1266.53 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1368.39    1366.54   1361.97    1363.68  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Sep 7     Sep 6     Sep 3     Sep 2     Sep 1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1277.38   1284.01   1293.60   1302.75   1305.63 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1365.81   1371.90   1384.27   1385.48   1385.51  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1272.98; 200 - 1368.90 Low/day: 100 - 1265.87  200 - 1359.22  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

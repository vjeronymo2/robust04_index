			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T forced to issue results for one month AT&amp;T has been forced for the first time to publish financial results for a single month. This is a consequence of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations relating to the 35.86m AT&amp;T shares held by British Telecommunications as a result of AT&amp;T's merger with McCaw Cellular Communications announced last year and which BT wishes to sell. AT&amp;T said in October it had net income of Dollars 429m, or 27 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 6.28bn but warned against drawing conclusions about the full quarter on one month's results. It said the figures reflected the trend for the first nine months. Full-year results are expected in late January. BT last year held a 17 per cent stake in McCaw which it intended to sell; on the merger in September this year it received an equivalent number of AT&amp;T shares. It has always said it did not intend to hold its rival's shares on a long-term basis. AT&amp;T yesterday filed a registration statement with the SEC as a prerequisite to BT's disposal of its shares through an underwritten public offering. The holding was valued this week at about Dollars 1.7bn. At the time of the merger announcement the shares were valued at Dollars 2.2bn. The timing of the sale remains at BT's disposal. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been appointed lead managers for the offering.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Fleming Feldgeling assets advance 33% Net asset value of The Fleming Fledgeling Investment Trust was 253.7p per share at December 31 - a rise of one third on the previous year's 190.2p. Net revenue for the 12 months was down from Pounds 376,000 to Pounds 300,000. Earnings per share fell from 2.99p to 2.39p. A final dividend of 2p, making a total of 3p, is recommended; for 1990, in addition to the 3p total, a special payment of 0.5p was made. Mr Val Fleming, chairman, said the lower UK content in the portfolio together with some dividend cuts and the fall in deposit interest received had collectively resulted in a reduction in earnings per share.</p>

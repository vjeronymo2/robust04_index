Regional party committee Secretary Zhao Fulin also delivered  a speech in which he spelled out the region's rural work tasks  in 1994 in accordance with the spirit of the recent central  rural work conference.    The teleconference was presided over by Cheng Kejie and  participants included regional party committee, government,  people's congress standing committee, and Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference committee leaders;  prefectural, city, and county party and government leaders;  Nanning-based central unit leaders; and persons in charge of  various organs directly under the regional authorities.    Secretary Zhao Fulin's important speech at the  teleconference  was divided into the following five parts:    1. Profoundly view agriculture as the foundation of the  country's national economy and make energetic efforts to promote  agricultural growth. [passage omitted]    2. Adopt practical measures aimed at securing steady  grain production; provide agricultural production with all types  of assistance, improved services, and sufficient supplies of  capital, water, electric power, chemical fertilizer, farm  chemicals, gasoline, farm machinery, and so on; implement to the  letter all policy measures aimed at boosting grain production;  and make continued efforts to successfully build commodity grain  production bases. [passage omitted]    3. Vigorously readjust agricultural structure and  increase the income of peasants. [passage omitted]    4. Make continued efforts to successfully build vegetable  production bases and increase the effective supply of farm  products. [passage omitted]    5. Further strengthen CPC leadership over agriculture and  rural work. [passage omitted]    Secretary Zhao Fulin concluded his speech by saying: The  principal party and government leaders at all levels in the  region should, after this teleconference, go deep into the rural  areas to carry out investigation and study. They should  conscientiously give heed to opinions and demands put forth by  cadres and masses at the grass-roots level, acquire a clearer  understanding of the situation in the rural areas where central  and regional policies have been implemented, and clearly  identify a series of major problems that have cropped up in the  course of Guangxi's rural reform and development in order to  work out feasible and effective measures. Furthermore, they  should make pragmatic arrangements for this year's agriculture  and rural work in light of the local realities and strive with  one heart and one mind to push Guangxi's agriculture and rural  work onto a new stage in 1994!</p>

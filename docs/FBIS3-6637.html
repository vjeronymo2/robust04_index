			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 19 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The  Malaysian Trade Union Congress (MTUC) has called on its British  counterpart TUC [Trade Union Congress] to put pressure on the  British press first before MTUC could help bring about normalcy  in British-Malaysian relations.    MTUC President Zainal Rampak said: As a matter of priority,  the MTUC has called upon the TUC, through its affiliates,  supporters and union members, to use its sphere of influence and  put pressure on the British press to retract its defamatory  allegations against Malaysian leaders and tender its apologies.    This would eventually pave way for British-Malaysian  relations to return to normalcy.    Zainal said in a statement that MTUC made clear that it was  the TUC which would have to take the first step to normalise  reletions between the two countries and MTUC would extend its  cooperation and assistance as a follow-up measure.    The MTUC received a letter from the TUC dated March 11  which,  among other things, requested MTUC to play a role to bring about  a speedy restoration of bilateral relations betweeen the two  countries in the light of the Malaysian ban on awarding public  works contracts to British companies, he added.    In reply, MTUC stated clearly that though it sympathized  with  the plight of British workers who faced the imminent possibility  of losing their jobs, we cannot, as a matter of principle,  condone the activities of any institution, including the press  aimed at tarnishing the image of Malaysia as an independent,  sovereign nation.    He also made it clear that the present state of affairs had  been spurred by adverse British media reports on Malaysian  political leaders.    Following the series of allegations of corruption against  Malaysian leaders by the British press, the Malaysian Government  imposed the ban on the awarding of contracts of government  projects to British companies on Feb. 25.    While the ban does not cover private sector ventures, the  two  governments said the policy did not affect their normal  bilateral relations.</p>

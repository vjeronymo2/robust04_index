			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Economic Watch: Exports lift German output Industrial ouput in west Germany grew 1 per cent in February over January, but year-on-year figures suggested that while exports were up, domestic demand remained flat. Output in January and February together grew 0.1 per cent against the same period last year. Production of investment goods and consumer goods, key indicators of domestic demand, fell 1.1 and 2.9 per cent respectively. Only raw materials showed significant growth, with output up 4.3 per cent year-on-year, driven by increased export orders. Year-on-year growth of 3.3 per cent in construction was higher than expected, although bad weather was blamed for a 7 per cent fall in February over January. Michael Lindemann, Bonn. The Association of European Airlines members' worldwide scheduled passenger traffic was 9.9 per cent higher in February against a year earlier, at 21.4bn passenger kilometres. The Greek wholesale price index rose by 1.2 per cent in February, taking the annual rise to 8.8 per cent. French car registrations were 14.3 per cent higher in March against a year earlier, at 188,600 units.</p>

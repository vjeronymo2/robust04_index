			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Quintal] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom  Party's [IFP] explanation of its failure to submit evidence to  the Goldstone Commission of inquiry into the violence during the  Zulu march in Johannesburg on March 28 was "wholly  unacceptable", Mr Justice Richard Goldstone said on Tuesday.    KwaZulu government and IFP legal representative Mr Maurice  Basslian told the commission the IFP had been unable to make  submissions because of April's public holidays, the lack of  manpower and records and the problem of finding witnesses.    Mr Justice Goldstone dismissed the explanation as  unacceptable, especially as the IFP had requested the probe as a  matter of urgency on March 29. He said other parties had made  their submission in spite of the public holidays. While he  could understand the difficulty of consulting witnesses, the IFP  leaders at least could have given instruction, he said.    Following the explanation, the IFP made a submission which  Mr  Basslian stressed had been prepared in haste.</p>

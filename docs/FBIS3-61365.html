			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Oleksandr Stoyan, head, Federation of </F> Ukrainian Trade Unions, by Volodymyr Oliynyk, correspondent:  "Stoyan Does Not Believe in a Mass Strike, But He Does Believe  in Cooperation Among All Trade Unions: A Timely Topic!"]    [Text] Protest actions by the trade unions comprised  the subject of the following conversation between our  correspondent and Oleksandr Stoyan, head of the Federation of  Ukrainian Trade Unions.    [Oliynyk] Mr. Stoyan, could you tell us how the branches of  government reacted to the recent protest actions by the trade  unions?    [Stoyan] Let me remind you that these protest actions lasted  for an entire week. They took the form of meetings, picketing  the state administrative offices of the presidential  representatives in various localities, and collecting signatures  in opposition to the government's anti-social policy. At the  same time, we were endeavoring to find a compromise with the  government side. And such a meeting did take place. The  government delegation was headed up by Acting Prime Minister  Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, while our side was led by members of the  Federation of Trade Unions Presidium and by leaders of those  trade-union associations which do not belong to our Federation.    We set forth 11 specific demands. After a lengthy and  difficult discussion during the ensuing week, the Cabinet of  Ministers issued several responses. One of them proposed that a  joint investigation be made--together with the trade unions--as  to who had actually raised the prices. For the state had  announced a two- or three-fold price hike, whereas, in fact,  they rose three-, five- and even eight-fold.    Working groups were also created. In addition to this, the  government sent commissions to 10 Ukrainian cities; thanks to  their work, prices were lowered by 20-25 percent in some  oblasts. We pushed our demands with regard to stabilizing  production. One of the demands, which we had not succeeded in  implementing for an entire year--and which consisted of revoking  the penalty fines for overdrawing the consumption fund--was  likewise met.    In parallel fashion we worked with deputies of the Supreme  Council. In the first place, we found a common language with  them. Whereas measures regarding stabilization of the  socioeconomic situation in Ukraine were listened to attentively,  a certain person proposed that this information be taken into  account and the session continued.    However, most of the deputies listened closely to the  telegram from the FPU [Federation of Ukrainian Trade Unions]  concerning our decisive actions, along with telegrams from the  localities which had been sent by the trade-union organizations.  And under such pressure the Supreme Council set up and approved  a commission. Because of the week's summaries of this  commission's work and under pressure from the grass roots, the  Supreme Council adopted the Decree "On Measures To Stabilize the  Socioeconomic Situation in Ukraine."    [Oliynyk] As far as we know, this December decree by the  Supreme Council encompassed all the demands made by the FPU. If  that is so, is this the first serious victory by the FPU or--to  put it more precisely--for those who are at or below the poverty  level?    [Stoyan] Inasmuch as the Supreme Council's Decree is a law  for the Cabinet of Ministers, the latter must now carry out its  obligations in this regard.    Among other things, such obligations include the following:  exempt enterprises and other institutions from the need to pay  penalty fines for exceeding the consumption fund; revoke the  telegram sent by the Cabinet of Ministers with regard to  prohibiting banks from issuing any kinds of credits; work out a  mechanism for aiding citizens in straitened circumstances. The  matter of the government--together with the trade unions and the  state administrations in the localities--introducing normative  distribution of foodstuffs for the most harshly affected levels  of the population is being looked into. Therefore, it can be  said that the protests by the FPU and other trade unions have,  for the first time, brought about a victory with regard to  people's social protection.    [Oliynyk] Mr. Stoyan, what is your prognosis with regard to  the strike activities at Ukrainian enterprises?    [Stoyan] The FPU is not calling for a strike. We are  proceeding along a different path, a path of pressure, talks,  and negotiations--a path of working together with all levels of  the state power structure.    A strike is being called for by the Ukrainian Free Trade  Unions. But everybody understands that their demands are  unrealistic. Judge for yourselves: They are demanding wages  which would raise the standard of living, but they do not want  to think about where the money is to come from. They are  threatening to stir up the people to strike on 18 January!  Moreover, they are making the following political demands:  resignation of the government, a new prime minister, and even  resignation of the president. I don't know whether they will be  able to rouse people by such slogans. People are already fed up  with politics; what they really want is a real piece of bread.    Therefore, I am quite convinced that this is just one more  bluff on the part of those trade unions which pay no attention  to reality, but merely call for strikes.    [Oliynyk] Let's imagine that this "bluff"--as you call  it--does indeed take place. Would the percentage of strikers be  large?    [Stoyan] In my opinion, this percentage would be very small.  Well now, there could be a certain number of miners; there could  also be some transport workers and airline dispatchers. That is  to say, such strikers would include those workers who belong to  the Ukrainian Free Trade Unions. This would be quite a small  percentage of the total. But I would not want even such a strike  to take place because it is no longer our goal to tear down the  state. We would do better to think about cooperating with it.    Incidentally, our demands were not for the purpose of  tearing  down the state, but instead we were working to improve  production. Nor were we striving to extract subsidies--of which  there are no longer any sources in any case. Even if such a  strike were to take place, it would not have any influence. It  could be only a political type of strike, a political game on  the eve of the upcoming elections.</p>

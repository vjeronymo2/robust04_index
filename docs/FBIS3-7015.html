			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Politicians Should Open Their Eyes To View the </F> World -- Thinking About Japan-U.S. Relations"]    [Text] During his recent visit to Japan, U.S. State  Secretary Warren Christopher used the words, "political risk," a  number of times. He used the words in a context in which he  stressed how U.S. President Bill Clinton has successfully  achieved important tasks, such as the enactment of NAFTA,  despite great political obstacles. Apparently, Christopher has  tacitly called on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to similarly  take "political risk" in exercising leadership.    One of the greatest reasons for the breakdown in the  Japan-U.S. summit talks held last month is said to be that the  United States was disappointed that Japan would implement income  tax cuts -- aimed at boosting its domestic demand -- strictly  for one year only.    In some quarters of the ruling coalition parties, voices can  now be heard saying that "the prime minister should have said  income tax cuts would be carried out not for only one year, but  for three years." If he had an accurate grasp of the situation,  the prime minister, as the highest-ranking official in charge of  Japanese politics, certainly should have been able to express  his "determination" to carry this out. This, then, must be what  it means to take "political risk."    Regarding political reform, Prime Minister Hosokawa said  immediately after his inauguration that he would "take political  responsibility if it cannot be carried out by the year-end." In  this regard, there seems to be a considerable gap in his  political stance then and the stance he is currently taking.    However, it is also true that should the prime minister have  made such a remark, there would again have been great turmoil  within the ruling coalition government. This is because  regarding the consumption tax issue in particular, the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which is the largest among the  ruling coalition parties, would persist in expressing  "opposition" to it, considering it wholly as a domestic issue --  and as a rather short-sighted election campaign slogan, at that.    Even now, there are "opposition" headquarters against the  consumption tax set up at the SDPJ headquarters and its local  chapters. Regarding consultations among the ruling coalition  parties on tax system reforms, circumstances are such that in  some quarters of the SDPJ, there have emerged voices expressing  pessimism about implementation of tax system reforms by the end  of the year. The party thus fails to see such matters in  relation to Japan-U.S. ties.    Recently, the official party organ of the SDPJ carried a  statement by Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic  Planning Agency, who said: "During the days when the SDPJ was an  opposition party, it would suffice, in many aspects, for the  party to chant the line, `Japan-U.S. relations are the most  important among bilateral relations.' Now, that is not enough."    However, the SDPJ never even chanted such a "line" when it  was an opposition party. What it has historically advocated was  a "pro-Soviet, anti-U.S." policy. Even now, the party still has  not formally withdrawn its opposition to the Japan-U.S. Security  Treaty. It remains indifferent to such concerns as that  deteriorated economic relations could eventually affect security  ties.    At a time when the post-Cold War situation continues to  drift, political parties -- regardless of whether they be ruling  or opposition parties -- bear the responsibility to decide on  policies and determine the course of their political action, not  looking only at domestic affairs, but also opening their eyes to  view the rest of the world.    The Diet, which, under normal conditions, should be  conducting serious deliberations toward restoring strained  relations with the United States, has been unable to hold budget  committee meetings. This situation is nearly tantamount to  political parties' failing to fulfill their responsibilities.    In view of the upcoming July Naples summit, the government  is  currently hastening compilation of a package of measures to  appease the United States. However, voices have emerged  pointing out that Prime Minister Hosokawa seems to have little  part in the process. It is believed the prime minister should  come forward and fulfill the responsibilities which accompany  his saying "no" at the Japan-U.S. summit meeting.</p>

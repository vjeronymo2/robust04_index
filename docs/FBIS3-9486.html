			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, March 24 (TANJUG) -- Slovenian Prime  Minister Janez Drnovsek has asked parliament to replace Defence  Minister Janez Jansa. In a statement for the public released on  Thursday, Drnovsek accused the defence minister of overstepping  his authority and violating the republican constitution and  elementary human rights.    Political circles in Ljubljana have indicated that Minister  Jansa might resort to repressive protection of his office, in  which, as assessed, he would have the support of part of the  military leadership. The Slovenian police raised the degree of  alert of its force on Thursday evening.    Jansa is the idol of the Slovenian extreme nationalist right  and, as his followers often point out, most deserving for  Slovenia's independence which followed a clash with the former  Yugoslav People's Army.    Several parties, associations, groups of citizens and  individuals have demanded the defence minister's resignation  over the past few days.</p>

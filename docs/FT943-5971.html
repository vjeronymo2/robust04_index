			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television ITV's appeal these days is to the innate conservatism of the British public: nothing here will shock or surprise you, everything is utterly familiar, any new series will look exactly like an old series. This evening they begin with a 22-year-old soap, Emmerdale, (7.00); move on to a 33-year-old nature series, Survival, devoted today to animals that fly (7.30); then to an episode of The Bill which began a mere 10 years ago (8.00). Downwardly Mobile is yet another crass house-sharing sitcom (8.30); People Like Us yet another lip-gloss mini-series from the US (9.00 and 10.40); and News At 10 is, well, News At 10. If you use television instead of Horlicks this should do the trick. BBC1 and BBC2 are stuffed with repeats, ranging from The Protectors, (11.50 BBC1) which was launched on ITV 22 years ago, to a nature series, Realms Of The Russian Bear, which natural history freaks can zap into the moment 'Survival' ends on ITV (8.00 BBC2). BBC2 alone has four repeats tonight, but the best is on BBC1: the episode of French And Saunders in which the girlies deliver a brilliant parody of the BBC's own 'House Of Eliott' (9.30).</p>

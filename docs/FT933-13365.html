			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour study slams pay disparity TWO-THIRDS of the population live in households with incomes below the Pounds 250-a-week national average, says the first paper published by a commission established by the Labour party to review tax and benefits. The Commission on Social Justice, which is chaired by Sir Gordon Borrie, the former director-general of fair trading, also found that the gap between the highest and lowest paid in the UK is now greater than at any time since 1886. It concluded that while many of the social evils which led to the creation of the welfare state have been rectified, social injustice continues to dog British society. The basic rights of citizenship continue to be denied to some 20 per cent of the population, according to Sir Gordon, who described the findings as 'a wake-up call to the nation'. 'Social justice in the UK today is shocking,' he said. 'It is a national embarrassment that 400,000 people are homeless, that over 3m are unemployed, and that over 3m children live in poverty.' A second paper issued by the Commission identifies four objectives for new welfare policies: Security - through preventing poverty rather than alleviating it. Opportunity - helping people to achieve more for themselves. Democracy - allowing people to make more decisions about their welfare. Fairness - unfair inequalities should be reduced and, if possible, eliminated. Removing unjust inequalities is as much about wealth creation as redistribution, it says, arguing that full employment is central to social justice and economic efficiency.

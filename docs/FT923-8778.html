			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / UK deficit revised up to Pounds 6.3bn: British net debt in 1990 believed to be first in almost 50 years BRITAIN'S current account defi-cit last year was Pounds 1.1bn greater than previously estimated, according to revised government statistics which also suggest the UK was a net debtor to the rest of the world in 1990. New figures showing worse-than-expected invisible trade results prompted the Central Statistical Office to revise upwards Britain's 1991 current account deficit to Pounds 6.32bn from the Pounds 5.2bn figure published in June and an earlier estimate of Pounds 4.4bn. More surprising was the CSO's disclosure that in 1990 the UK's net assets abroad were Pounds 407m less than its foreign liabilities. Although the CSO said valuation problems and omissions meant its figures could not be an exact measure of the UK's external debtor or creditor position, 1990 was the first year since records began in 1966 in which the UK recorded a net debt position. It probably marked the first time since immediately after the second world war that Britain had been a debtor nation. The disappearance of overseas assets reflects a remarkable change since the mid-1980s, when the UK was a large oil producer and investing its surpluses abroad. As recently as March 1987, Mr Nigel Lawson, the then chancellor, boasted in his Budget speech that UK net overseas assets were 'well over Pounds 100bn' (a claim not supported by the latest data) and 'second only to those of Japan'. These, he said, would 'provide a continuing support to the current account in the years ahead'. Last year, the government's annual balance of payments Pink Book estimated the UK had net overseas assets of nearly Pounds 29.6bn in 1990, a figure revised down to Pounds 20bn in the 1992-93 Budget. Yesterday's CSO release suggested that, by the end of 1991, the UK was back in the black with net overseas assets of Pounds 16.07bn. The latest data - released before publication of the Pink Book - also show previous figures painted too positive a picture. The deficit, which measures UK trade in goods and invisibles, such as services and dividend payments, is now put at Pounds 17.03bn in 1990 against Pounds 16.08bn previously. Ironically, the revisions reflect the government's efforts to improve official statistics. One effect has been to reduce the contribution investments and services make. The services surplus for last year is now put at Pounds 4.99bn against Pounds 5.37bn previously, while the contribution from interest, profits and dividends was revised to Pounds 328m from Pounds 898m.

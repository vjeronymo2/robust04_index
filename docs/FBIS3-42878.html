			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Roundup of deputies' comments, compiled by Oleg Zhirnov: </F> "Comrade Rybkin, Speaker and Man"]    [Text] The State Duma has elected as its chairman  Ivan Petrovich Rybkin, candidate of the Agrarian Party of Russia  faction. The 47-year-old politician is a native of Volgograd and  is a graduate of the Volgograd Agricultural Institute and a  candidate of technical sciences. He was a senior lecturer at a  higher educational institution and secretary of a CPSU district  committee in Volgograd and was head of a department in the  Central Committee of Polozkov's Communist Party of the RSFSR. He  is a leader of the Socialist Workers Party.    In the former Supreme Soviet he was cochairman of the  Communists of Russia faction and dealt with questions of the  work of the soviets and the development of local government. He  enjoyed among democrat deputies the reputation of a "communist  with whom you could negotiate." He ran for the Duma not from the  Socialist Party, which was extremely unsuccessful, but preferred  the company of the agrarians, who obviously had a better chance.    Ivan Rybkin won the competition for the post of speaker  by a one-vote margin. In the democratic milieu, his victory was  seen as a sign of a "Red revanche"; in the opposite camp, as the  triumph of common sense. For the deputies who did not come into  contact with Rybkin in the Supreme Soviet, and for the public at  large even more, he remains Mr. X and "the man from nowhere."    After a week of the speaker's activity, an OBSHCHAYA  GAZETA observer asked representatives of a number of Duma  factions and groups of deputies to introduce the chairman of the  Duma to our readers.    Sergey Shakhray (Party of Russian Unity and  Accord):    I have known Ivan Petrovich for three years and can say that  he is for parliament a far more dependable leader than  Khasbulatov in the former Supreme Soviet. He is restrained and  purposeful. He senses intuitively that, despite the fact that he  represents the communist-patriotic spectrum in the Duma, it is,  for all that, in the interests of the whole house to support the  minority also in order that it too be represented structurally  and be heard and participate in debate. He is afraid of allowing  a situation where there remain in the Duma only the right wing  and where Zhirinovskiy and Travkin take turns at the podium.    His stated desire to form in the Duma a political "center"  accords fully with ours. The Party of Russian Unity and Accord  faction has made at times successful, at times unsuccessful,  attempts to create some stratum between the radical wings so  that if the speaker's intentions are sincere, we are prepared to  interact with him.    Nikolay Travkin (Democratic Party of Russia  faction):    Rybkin is just the necessary compromise that it is  permissible to reach in this Duma with this alignment of forces.  It was clear, on the other hand, that a person oriented sharply  to the left or sharply to the right could not have gotten  elected to this position. And Rybkin is not a "revolutionary" of  either left or right.    As far as his style of chairing the sittings is concerned,  people may make of it what they will. I would prefer a stricter  style. I would not switch on the microphones in the hall at  all--only in case of a dire emergency. I believe that society  has already passed the stage at which everyone was inordinately  sensitive to whether a thing was "democratic" or "not  democratic." We are now more in need not of what is connected  with rights, but of what is connected with responsibility for  the accorded rights.    Nikolay Lysenko (unregistered Russian Way faction):    Rybkin is a professional, of course, but he is a person not  without inveterate apparatus habits. Despite the fact that by  European standards he is still quite a young politician, he is a  young politician "with an old suitcase." The communist baggage  that he carries with him and the most profound imprint of the  communist mentality in him are obvious to me.    I do not believe that Rybkin is the speaker whom the new  Russia needs. He is, perhaps, a pretty good speaker for the  troubled times in which we are living, even the optimum figure  for harmonizing the actions of the Duma with the Federation  Council and the president. But the new Russia should have a new  speaker not so much in terms of his age as in terms of his  ideological baggage. Sergey Baburin would for me, for example,  have been a far more acceptable candidate for this office.    Gennadiy Burbulis (Russia's Choice faction):    We should have the courage to separate the idea of a person  that was shaped by years of joint political struggle from his  normal possibility of self-renewal. For this reason I decline  comment on Mr. Rybkin's political past and believe that we may  be quite sincere in supporting the formulas that he has  promulgated as chairman of the State Duma. I personally, in  particular.    Parliament exists so that people might have better lives.  And  our entire ideological struggle should be subordinated to this.  I have the impression that Mr. Rybkin is interested in such a  position, and in this sense I will help him, as a man.  Sometimes, however, signs of a predetermined goal, which he is  attempting to achieve as aggressively as possible, show through.  There have been several topics where the natural right of the  deputy minority, even if this has been one deputy, has been  scornfully rejected. This is disturbing, it is impermissible.    Vyacheslav Marychev (Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  faction):    Our faction voted for Rybkin. But I have a very guarded  attitude toward him. I believe that this is an attempt to return  to power by people who have already been there. But to avoid an  intensification of the crisis in the Duma, the faction decided  to vote for Rybkin, and we voted "Aye."    I complained to Rybkin about the fact that he had not  recognized Lysenko. Although the faction gave me a telling-off  for this and although I do not know Lysenko personally, I was  angered by the disdain with which Rybkin had treated him. He  apologized to Lysenko, it is true, but this episode reminded me  of the communist past.    Irina Khakamada (unregistered Union of 12 December  group of deputies):    I can say only one thing: Yesterday and the day before, the  sittings were chaired by Speaker Rybkin; today they are being  chaired by Mityukov. Speaker Rybkin is a representative of the  Agrarian Party and of the pro-communist lobby, so to speak;  Mityukov is a representative of Russia's Choice. I like the way  the sittings were chaired yesterday and the day before better.  That is, I mean that Rybkin is a person who knows how to do his  job professionally.</p>

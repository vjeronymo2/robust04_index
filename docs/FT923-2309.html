			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Scargill says 30 pits to be closed MR Arthur Scargill, president of the NUM mining union, claimed yesterday to have obtained confidential documents showing that British Coal planned to close up to 30 collieries - with the loss of more than 25,000 jobs. The detailed list allegedly shows that three pits will close in the north-east; 11 in the Coal Board's Yorkshire area; nine in Nottinghamshire; two in Derbyshire; two in the Midlands; two in south Wales and one in Lancashire. A covering letter dated September 1 1992 accompanied the list and was purportedly from Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, to Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury. The DTI refused to comment on the allegations, as did British Coal. Mr Scargill said: 'Such butchery of the British coalmining industry would represent a catastrophe not only for Britain's miners and their communities, but also for the British economy, which is already on the verge of collapse.' Negotiations are nearing completion on new coal contracts with the electricity industry which will pave the way to the privatisation of British Coal. They are expected to lead to extensive pit closures as the corporation strives to become fully commercial.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 29 TASS -- Leader of the Russian  Liberal- Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovskiy plans to bring  an action against Vice-Premier Anatoliy Chubays and a number of  newspapers.    His lawyer Sergey Belyak has prepared a "new set of suits"  to  protect the honor and dignity of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, says a  report of the Liberal-Democratic faction's press service  circulated here today.    In the opinion of Zhirinovskiy, the newspapers SEGODNYA,  KURANTY and IZVESTIYA are guilty "of spreading German media's  fake report on alleged reception of Honecker money by the  Liberal-Democratic Party". The lawyer is sure each newspaper  will have "to pay at least 200 million rubles".    The reason for the action against Chubays is his accusations  of Zhirinovskiy of fascism. The report says the last straw was  Chubays' interview with the ARGUMENTY I FAKTY newspaper.</p>

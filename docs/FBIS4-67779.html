			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``What Is the CNEA: Atomic </F> Inventory'']    [Text] The CNEA [National Atomic Energy Commission]  includes:    --Three nuclear plants (Atucha-I and Embalse, in operation,  and Atucha-II, under construction).    --Three atomic centers (Bariloche, Constituyentes, and  Ezeiza).    --Eight associated enterprises (INVAP [Applied Research  Institute], Coratec [expansion unknown], ALTEC [expansion  unknown], ENACE [Argentine Nuclear Enterprise for Electrical  Power Plants], Nuclear Mendoza, CONUAR [Argentine Nuclear Fuel  Corporation, Inc.], FAESA [expansion unknown], and ENSI  [expansion unknown]).    --A uranium concentrate plant (San Rafael).    --A manufacturing plant (Cordoba, for the manufacture of  uranium dioxide).    --A heavy water industrial plant (Neuquen).    --A pilot plant for enriching uranium (Pilcaniyeu).    --Three reactors for research and training (Constituyentes,  Bariloche, and Pilcaniyeu).    --A reactor that produces radioisotopes (Ezeiza).    --A semi-industrial multipurpose plant for irradiating  foodstuffs and industrial materiel and for the sterilization of  disposable biomedical products (Ezeiza).    --A 20 million-volt particle accelerator for basic research  (Tandar Laboratory).    --Several centers for training human resources.    --A nuclear medicine school in Mendoza.    --A center for training nuclear and physics engineers  (Balseiro Institute, Bariloche).  <H5>  Atucha-I Nuclear Plant </H5>   --Net power: 337 net megawatts.    --Design: AECL (Canadian).    --Located at Embalse Rio Tercero, 100 km southwest of the  capital city of Cordoba.    This plant's design allows the production of the cobalt-60  radioisotope as part of the process. This radioisotope is used  in medicine, agriculture, industry, and the preservation of the  environment.    Argentina has 8 percent of the world market for this  radioisotope, and since 1986 it has been exported to, among  other countries, the United States, France, Belgium, Colombia,  and other American countries.  <H5>  Atucha-II Nuclear Plant (Under Construction) </H5>   --Power: 745 gross megawatts, 692 net megawatts.    --Design: Siemens-KWU.    --Work progress on 21 December 1993: 86.5 percent of the  total work.    --Personnel working in February 1994: 3,664 workers.    In addition, the CNEA participates as an associate in the  following enterprises: INVAP S.A. [Applied Research Institute],  Nuclear Mendoza SE, ENLACE S.A., CONVAR S.A., ALTEC SE., FAE  S.A., Coratec SE., and ENSI SE.</p>

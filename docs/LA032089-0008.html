			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> MUBARAK: 'NO MORE WARS'  </P> <P> President Hosni Mubarak, promising "there will be no more wars as of today,"  raised the Egyptian flag over Taba after Israel relinquished control of the  disputed strip of beach on the Sinai Peninsula. Mubarak was on a European tour  when the last Israeli policeman left the 250-acre strip overlooking the Gulf of  Aqaba last Wednesday. Israel had retained control of Taba when it pulled out of  the rest of Sinai in 1982; an international arbitration panel awarded the strip  to Egypt in September. Before flying to Taba, Mubarak laid a wreath at the tomb  of President Anwar Sadat, who was assassinated by Muslim extremists in 1981. It  was Sadat who signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, China's  vice-premier and foreign minister, held talks with M.J. Qhobela,  foreign minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho, here this afternoon.    During the talks, Qian and Qhobela exchanged views on  bilateral relations and on the international situation.    Qian congratulated the Basutoland Congress Party on its  success in last year's general election and the consequent  establishment of the new government of Lesotho, and wished the  new government well in making new achievements in maintaining  domestic peace and in the construction of the country.    Qian said that the resumption of diplomatic relations  between  China and Lesotho laid a foundation for the development of  bilateral relations, adding that he was confident that the  current visit to China by Qhobela would further promote  bilateral relations and cooperation.    Touching on the situation in the Southern African region,  Qian noted that the first general election without racial  discrimination is to be held in South Africa on April 27, and  that a new South Africa of racial equality is to be set up.    This was the result of the long-term struggles of the South  African nations and peoples, said Qian, and China supports the  peace process in South Africa.    The Chinese vice-premier noted that China is willing to  develop cooperative relations with the new South Africa in  various fields, on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  co-existence.    Qhobela said that the restoration of diplomatic relations  between Lesotho and China will inject new strength into the  promotion of bilateral relations.    Qhobela invited Qian to visit Lesotho again at his  convenience.    Qhobela and his party arrived here on April 10 as Qian's  guests.</p>

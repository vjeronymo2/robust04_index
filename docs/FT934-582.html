			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Shoppers bring Christmas cheer to retailers Shops around Britain yesterday reported a significant improvement in Christmas sales over last year, and said there were signs of confidence returning to the retail sector. Sales were reported to have been particularly strong in the past two weeks, after a slow November, but the picture around the country was mixed. Central London, Scotland and parts of south-east and north-east England reported buoyant trading, but the Midlands and south-west England were more subdued. The British Retail Consortium, representing 300,000 retail outlets, said it thought sales nationally had been between 13 per cent and 17 per cent up on last year over the last two weeks. 'Most retailers are seeing much more customer traffic, and they are really prepared to spend money,' the consortium said. 'But it is still very much in the medium and lower price bracket.' John Lewis Partnership said sales at its 22 department stores last week were up 10.6 per cent overall, and it was 'very happy' with trading this week. Littlewoods' 124 chain stores were said to have enjoyed sales on Sunday and Monday that were 40 per cent better than the equivalent days last year. Mr Tim Daniels, managing director of Selfridges and chairman of the Oxford Street Association in London, said his department store enjoyed a 'double figure' sales increase last week. He said most large stores on Oxford Street were likely to report similar results, in spite of the disruptive bomb alerts earlier this week. As well as traditionally popular presents such as perfumes, cosmetics, lingerie, books and clothing, items reported to be selling well included Lady Thatcher's autobiography, and the video, chart-topping record and doll of Mr Blobby, the tele-vision character. Nielsen, the market research company, said the pick-up in sales was not confined to gifts. It said grocery sales totalled Pounds 928m last week - 10 per cent higher than an average week. Not all this year's targets were exceeded, however. Barclaycard, the UK's largest credit card company, said spending on its card was up only 8 per cent for the month of December, compared with a forecast of 14 per cent - although it was 15 per cent up for last weekend. Some retailers reported customers using cash rather than credit cards. 'We hope they're saving the credit cards for the sales, which start on Monday,' said one shopping centre manager.

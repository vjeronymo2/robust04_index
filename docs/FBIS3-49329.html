			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beograd, 7 Jan (TANJUG) -- Following yet another  incident on the Yugoslav-Albanian border, which again seriously  violated the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia, when, on 3 January in the area of the Krstace border  watchtower an Albanian citizen lost his life while trying  illegally to enter the FRY territory, the Federal Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, while regretting the tragic event, emphasizes  that the sole responsibility for the incident lies with the  Albanian Government, which has constantly been stirring tension  at the Yugoslav-Albanian border with the aim of straining  bilateral relations, destabilizing the situation in the  autonomous province of Kosovo, and Metohija, and wider in the  Balkans region in order to realize its greater Albanian  aspirations.    With regard to this incident, the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry  said today, the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued  a statement which, in a well-known manner, shifts responsibility  to the Yugoslav side in an attempt to discredit the leadership  of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia before the  international community, although admitting at the same time  that the incident had taken place on Yugoslav territory.    According to an agreement between the two governments on  measures to prevent and resolve incidents on the  Yugoslav-Albanian border, a meeting of a local mixed commission  for border incidents has been place. It was established at the  meeting that the Albanian citizen concerned had on one other  occasion been stopped by the Yugoslav border guards while  attempting illegally to cross the state border and had been  handed over to the Albanian authorities. The statement by the  Albanian Foreign Ministry clearly shows that this is yet another  attempt to abuse the tragic incident for an unprovoked attack on  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.    Contrary to all international norms and standards, the  government of the Republic of Albania has continued to  underestimate the importance of its border with the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia, and also with its other neighbors with  whom, as it is widely known, it has had serious border problems.  Owing to the intentional policy of the Albanian Government, the  victims have primarily been its own citizens.    The Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes to recall  that  at a recently held session of the main Yugoslav-Albanian  commission for border incidents, the Albanian side took over  responsibility to carry out more effective border control and  prevent all illegal crossings outside the marked border  crossings. This was not observed by the Albanian side in the  aforementioned case. Therefore it bears responsibility for the  consequences. For all these reasons, and also for the fact that  Yugoslav bodies securing the border acted in accordance with the  law, the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs hereby rejects the  unfounded accusations contained in the Albanian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs statement.    The government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has on  a  number of occasions expressed a willingness for the  normalization and development of relations with the Republic of  Albania, and has launched initiatives for meetings and talks  between representatives of the governments of the two countries  on all issues pertaining to bilateral relations, including its  willingness to open new border crossings in order to improve  communication between the two countries. This has not been met  by the same willingness from the Albanian side. The government  of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia remains devoted to the  principles of good-neighborly policy and peace, and will  continue to pursue such a policy.</p>

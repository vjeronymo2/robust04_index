			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Syrian voters face limited choice There were no official campaign debates, no opinion polls and no election manifestos, but voting in Syria's parliamentary elections opened yesterday with more than 7,000 candidates standing for 250 seats in the People's Assembly. Voting ends today and the results are expected at the weekend. Since all important policy issues, such as the Middle East peace talks and Syria's foreign policy are strictly off-limits, voter choice was severely limited. Not only did all the candidates campaign in support of President Assad's policies, but the distribution of seats means that only one third of the assembly is directly elected. The others are chosen by the two official political parties. The ruling Baath party nominates 120 of its party members and the National Progressive Front (NPF), which is itself under the Baath party, is allocated 40 seats. The rest is left to the 'independent' candidates who in this election have been dominated by Syrian businessmen keen to play a role in pushing through faster economic reforms. Many are frustrated at the slow pace at which Syria is gradually liberalising its economy. With Syria's considerable potential for economic growth constrained by state monopolies and command-economy structures, the business community is keen to see a representative voice in the parliament and the independent vote is expected to swing its way.</p>

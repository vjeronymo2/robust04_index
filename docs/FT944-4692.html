			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Sterling Publishing rises 5% to Pounds 1.38m Sterling Publishing, which specialises in international business reference books and magazines, increased interim pre-tax profits by 5 per cent. The rise in profits to Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 1.31m) in the six months to September 30, was achieved on turnover up 46 per cent at Pounds 24.9m (Pounds 17.1m). Mr Roger Harrison, chairman, said the group's publishing cycle was still heavily biased towards the second half and as profits were only recognised on publication, the first-half results were not a good guide for the rest of the year. The two international business publishing subsidiaries, Sterling Publications and Cornhill Publications, increased operating profit by 14 per cent and introduced eight new titles. Fully diluted earnings per share amounted to 2p (1.9p). The interim dividend is increased to 0.75p (0.7p).</p>

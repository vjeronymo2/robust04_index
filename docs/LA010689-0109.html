			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: NCAA OFFICIAL DEFENDS THE PRACTICE OF GIVING IMMUNITY TO INFORMANTS  </P> <P> David Berst, director of enforcement for the National Collegiate Athletic  Assn., took issue Thursday with statements made by Ron Watson, assistant  athletic director at Oklahoma. Watson criticized the NCAA for giving Oklahoma  State wide receiver Hart Lee Dykes immunity in exchange for information  implicating four schools in recruiting violations.  </P> <P> "If you want to find out what really happened, you have to have limited  immunity," Berst told the Tulsa Tribune. "Without limited immunity we couldn't  find out a lot of what happens and wouldn't be able to penalize a lot of  institutions that are cheating."  </P> <P> Berst noted that an unidentified Oklahoma player also had received immunity for  testifying about the Sooner football program.  </P></p>

The Fraunhofer Society (FhG)  has recently announced that the system, which works  automatically, is ideal for use in mobile units and large test  batches and is cheaper and faster than conventional detection  methods.    The new process is based on the same test principle as  previous methods, exploiting the antigen-antibody reaction.  When a human being becomes infected with the HIV, which  triggers the lethal immune-deficiency disease, AIDS, his or her  immune system produces specific antibodies to proteins on the  surface of the pathogen. These proteins are termed antigens. If  a blood sample is exposed to artificially produced antigens, any  AIDS antibodies present in the blood will fasten onto them. In  the conventional enzyme immune test, which takes several hours,  this bond triggers a change of color.    The FhG reports that the new system detects the  antigen-antibody reaction in only 10 minutes. An injection  valve feeds the blood sample into a stream of liquid flowing  through a measuring chamber with a sensitive piezoelectric  oscillator. An electronic alternating field causes these thin,  pure quartz platelets, of the type used, for instance, in  watches and modern digital scales, to vibrate. If anything is  deposited on the quartz, the oscillation frequency changes, the  change being recorded by the oscillator and the frequency  counter.    The researchers used gold, to which proteins adhere well, to  coat the quartz platelets with AIDS virus antigens. As soon as  HIV antibodies fasten onto the sensor, its mass increases, as  does its oscillation frequency. It is reported that test  batches of a thousand samples each can be tested automatically  with this process. If the AIDS antibody is discovered in one of  the samples, the apparatus must be cleaned or the piezoelectric  oscillator changed. The society's report states that all  previous tests showed a marked difference in response to  positive and antibody-free serum samples. As the new test is  basically an offshoot of the conventional detection process, the  researchers assume that it is equally accurate.</p>

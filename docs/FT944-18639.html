			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): Indonesian fire A dangerous haze from thick smoke caused by Indonesian forest fires has been blamed for at least one collision between ships in the seas between Indonesia and Singapore. Air transport to Kalimantan has been paralysed by the smoke since early last week while flights to Indonesia's industrial island of Batam, near Singapore, have been disrupted. Malaysia's information minister said at the weekend that Malaysia was prepared to help Indonesia control the forest fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan. Pollution from the haze has reached a hazardous level in Kuala Lumpur, the worst-hit area, officials said.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Observer: Softly softly British fund managers tempted to head for China on a Dollars 5,000 'research tour' should think again. The trip, advertised in the American monthly magazine Institutional Investor, is payable 'in soft dollars through the broker of your choice'. In other words, it is a variation of the increasingly common practice whereby brokers barter 'research-related' services to a client who agrees to execute a minimum amount of business. But the regulators are on the trail. SEC chairman Arthur Levitt has been complaining that the practice 'doesn't feel right, taste right, smell right'. Imro, the self-regulatory body for the UK fund management industry, has gone further and has formally censured Abbey Life for sending fund managers on jollies to the US and Asia.</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Affected by rumours STERLING futures dipped yesterday afternoon as the pound slid against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges and rumours swept financial markets that Mr Norman Lamont, the UK Chancellor, had resigned. The September short sterling contract dipped 7 basis points to a low of 89.64 as the pound lost over  1/2 a pfennig on the foreign exchanges in the afternoon. UK officials said that the rumours of the Chancellor's resignation were totally unfounded,and this helped to stabilise the price. But sterling failed to recover and closed down  1/2 a pfennig from its previous close at DM2.8225. The September contract therefore closed down 5 basis points from its previous finish, at 89.65, and the December contract down was down 6 basis points at 89.74. Both prices assume that a cut in UK base rates is still a long way off. Trade in sterling cash was thin. The Bank of England forecast another small shortage of Pounds 350m and, once again, the market found this difficult to remove because each discount house waited for the next one to offer bills to the Bank. The stickiness forced the overnight rate up to a peak of 11 per cent but later dropped back to close at 9 7/8 per cent. Most period rates closed unchanged. Three-month interbank again closed at 10 1/4 per cent on the offered side, and 1-year money closed at 10 3/8 per cent. After forecasting its shortage, the Bank did not operate in the morning. The forecast was later revised down to Pounds 300m. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 10m in Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. It provided late assistance of around Pounds 215m. The Bundesbank's decision to drain a large amount of liquidity from the the German money market added to the bearish sentiment. The Bundesbank withdrew DM2.4bn from the money market in this week's round of security repurchase agreements, and this kept call money rates pinned to the central bank's emergency Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent. Traders had expected the German central bank to replace the DM35.2bn expiring this week in repos or perhaps add DM1bn to DM2bn because of the tightness in the money market and upcoming tax deadlines. But this did not happen.</p>

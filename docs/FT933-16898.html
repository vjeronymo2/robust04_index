			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Scholl paying Pounds 14.5m for French healthcare brand SCHOLL, the UK-based personal healthcare products group, is paying FFr125m (Pounds 14.5m) cash to acquire the Septivon antiseptic wash brand from Elf Sanofi, the French pharmaceutical group. The purchase of Septivon fits Scholl's strategy of acquiring niche personal health care brands with strong market positions which play to Scholl's distribution strengths in the western European and Pacific basin markets. Scholl, which reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.1m on turnover of Pounds 151.3m last year, has been pursuing growth through brand development, acquisition and the licensing and distribution of other leading brands. Last year the group acquired the Scholl retail operations in Canada from Schering Plough and Gerard House, the UK-based herbal medicines business. Septivon was introduced in 1972 and is one of France's leading antiseptic washes with a 17 per cent market share and sales last year of FFr60.8m of which FFr51.7m were in France and the remainder in Switzerland and a number of former French territories. In France one third of sales were by prescription with the remainder over-the-counter. The healthcare group believes there is scope to enhance the marketing and growth of the Septivon brand in France and to expand its penetration in other markets through Scholl's international distribution network.</p>

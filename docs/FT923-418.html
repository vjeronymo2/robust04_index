			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Drummond warns of first half deficit Operational problems at the Drummond Group are likely to result in a small loss for the half year to September 30, in which case the interim dividend will be passed. This warning was given yesterday by the group, which makes fabrics and associated products for the clothing industry. Since July the trading performance has deteriorated largely because of operational problems arising from the integration of the Courtauld Woollens business acquired earlier in the year. There were also production and technical problems within its own woollen and worsted divisions.</p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Time for a change of programme - A farewell note THIS IS NOT, after all, where I came in. The film looks much the same, but they seem to have jumbled the reels. At the start - in 1973 - we had a Conservative government which had abandoned exchange rate discipline and dashed for growth; Sir Alan Walters - plain Mr then - issued a strong monetary warning, which he quaintly called a memorial. Second time round, more Walters' warnings, but this time of collapse, and it might be worth inscribing on a memorial. My own first financial comments on pink paper were about unwise bank lending and hollowed-out balance sheets. I might say this was prescient, but in fact that was quite another episode - the time when it was rumoured (wrongly, as it turned out) that the National Westminster had made such losses that it might have to be nationalised. 'Would it matter?' asked one drinking companion whom I had tried to shock with this suggestion. 'After all, they wouldn't even have to change the name.' In the event, we inflated out of that trouble and settled for other problems instead. This may help to explain why the banks did it all over again a mere 15 years later - but it does not excuse them (or the authorities, for that matter). All we have achieved by the end of the cycle is to stand the old saying on its head: we have repeated history, but the first time as farce, and the second as tragedy. The Greek chorus is still muttering darkly about bank nationalisation here and now in Washington too. So there were mistakes; but at least we have a leaner, fitter manufacturing sector, don't we? Leaner, certainly. Nowadays you could buy up most of it for the capitalised salaries of a few privatised monopoly boards. They owe their seats to the biggest debt-for-equity swap in history. Economic result: we can resume our old borrowing habits without blushing much, for a time at least. It's not much to show for the march of enterprise, and all that oil. Certainly not what believers expected. Perhaps we should have taken the advice of Sir Michael Edwards, once paragon of leaner-fitter virtue. He suggested that rather than destroy our competitiveness, we should have left the oil under the sea as a strategic reserve. Now turn the reel upside down, and run it for coal; you might conclude that the only strategic reserve we will have left when they've finished is of cautionary tales. A sad couple of decades, really. Wait a minute, though; this is getting too grumpy. There must have been some benefits, even if they were unintended. The economy admittedly looks like the result of a forest fire; but one of the livelier arguments during the years I spent away in the US was about the effects of such fires. According to the experts, they do for trees very much what competition is supposed to do for industries: they clear away choked old growth so that new plants can reach the sunlight. (A bit like defeat in war, which did so much good to the old Axis powers, without the bombs. Let's hope so.) The financial Big Bang was supposed to perform a similar brush-clearing service for the capital markets. It certainly wiped out the old City - which was perhaps too comfortable, and certainly too profitable, but did the job. In its place we have a mess. The new City did offer better returns to depositors, until the money ran out; but now it seems stagnant and a bit putrid. At least, though, this episode may reteach the lesson which Adam Smith's recent disciples failed to learn from him: finance needs to be held in check. Right at the end, though, one unexpected benefit: the Treasury seems to have learned some humility. Open economic analysis, sensible new rules about investment - whatever next? There might be exciting new possibilities here. But there might not: the chances are that history will go on with its cyclical variations; and if that happens, could this column avoid repeating itself too? You may never find out, at least in this space. FT readers, I will miss you.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Digital likely to save Irish computer plant THE Irish government has apparently averted the total closure of a Digital Equipment Corporation manufacturing plant in the west of Ireland. The US computer manufacturer is poised between concentrating production of its new personal computer range at either the Galway plant or a similar one at Ayr in south-west Scotland as part of its retrenchment plans in Europe. About 1,000 jobs are at stake at each plant and the UK and Irish governments have been intensively lobbying Digital in the past few weeks to sway the decision in their favour. A high-level Irish government delegation that met in Boston, Massachusetts, yesterday with top Digital executives has apparently succeeded in its attempt to save the Galway plant. A final decision on the future of the plants, which make mini-computers and personal computers, is expected in the next day or two. Mr Rauiri Quinn, the Irish minister for employment and enterprise, who led the Irish delegation to Digital's headquarters in Boston, said the meeting was 'productive and satisfactory'. He added: 'We now expect the Galway plant to stay open in some shape or form.' Mr Quinn presented Mr Robert Palmer, Digital's chief executive, with new proposals, which according to the Industrial Development Authority in Dublin included a plan to locate Digital's European headquarters at Galway. According to a Irish government spokesman, Mr Quinn emphasised that if Digital decides in favour of Ayr, the growing Euro-scepticism in the UK 'and within the Tory party in particular, might create problems for Digital in European terms'. Mr Quinn also delivered a warning that any attempt to win the computer company's favour by breaking EC competition rules would be taken up in Brussels. Before leaving for Boston Mr Quinn said: 'Stories to that effect have been conveyed to us from different sources although we have received no absolute confirmation of them . . . The authorities in the Republic of Ireland and our representatives in the European parliament and commission will ensure that no unfair advantage of any particular kind that is in breach of competition rules will be used by any other government within the EC.' About 25 per cent of Digital's Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.75bn) European annual sales are in the UK market, and of this it is estimated that Dollars 400m comprises UK government contracts. If a reorganisation of manufacturing production between Ayr and Galway now goes ahead instead of plant closure, it is thought likely that Galway would retain its software, marketing, and research and development activities which employ about 350 people.</p>

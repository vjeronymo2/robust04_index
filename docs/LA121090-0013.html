			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: STARRY LINK TO GIS AN ENRICHING IDEA  </P> <P> Twinkle, twinkle little gimmick. Or: Canis Major, $39.95 and patriotism, too.  </P> <P> As Operation Desert Shield drags on, the San Diego-based Star Heritage Society  looks to the heavens for inspiration and profit.  </P> <P> For $39.95, you can have a genuine star (i.e. Polaris, Aquarius, etc.)  dedicated to your loved one serving in Saudi Arabia or the Persian Gulf. Plus  authenticity certificate and star chart.  </P> <P> The loved one gets a similar chart. The two can then gaze upon the same star at  the same time.  </P> <P> Says the promotional material:  </P> <P> "They are drawn together, joined in a brief communion that lets them focus on  each other; on thoughts of home, happier times and the day they will be  re-joined. It is an age-old pledging of love."  </P> <P> This is the work of Marv Gold, San Diego advertising man and president of Star  Heritage.  </P> <P> He's been selling stars for several years. Along came the standoff in the  desert, and Gold knew a good thing when he saw it.  </P> <P> Gold says he'll donate some of his profits to the USO, maybe 10%. Credit cards  welcome, an 800 number is available.  </P> <P> "There's so little for the troops to do," Gold said. "If the dedicated star  gives them something to look it, if it provides a little heart tug, a focal  point in the sky, it has redeeming value."  </P> <P> Of course, people could get their own star charts for free in any good  astronomy text.  </P> <P> "Yes, but they wouldn't have the certificate of dedication," Gold said.  </P> <P> People could also adopt the moon: big, lovable, identifiable, centuries of  poetry extolling it. "Stars are better. More personal."  </P> <P> And there is the time difference. Saudi Arabia is 11 hours ahead of San Diego  (also several centuries behind, but that's a different story). Dark here, light  there and vice versa. Making simultaneous stargazing difficult.  </P> <P> Details, details.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Politcal Payoff Overdue  </P> <P> It might be best not to mention the names Pete Wilson or Duke Cunningham at  Point Loma Nazarene College.  </P> <P> The day before the Nov. 6 election, a Republican operative appeared at chapel  (students must attend chapel three times a week) with a tempting offer: $50 for  each student willing to spend an afternoon walking precincts.  </P> <P> Plus a $300 bonus for each of the five students whose precincts showed the  highest voter turnout. Payment within five days.  </P> <P> A hundred students signed up and were shipped to precincts from Southeast San  Diego to Chula Vista. A month later, they're still waiting to be paid.  </P> <P> Stan Cherry, 22, a sociology major, called Cunningham's office, Wilson's office  and Republican headquarters.  </P> <P> Cherry says he was told: The check is in the mail, your W-2 was filled out  wrong, there's been a snafu because so many students answered the call.  </P> <P> "We got out there and hustled votes," he said. "Cunningham barely won. We put  him in office, now we want to be paid."  </P> <P> A Republican Party spokesman says the payroll people have been swamped but that  the checks should arrive in a week or so. Cherry says he'll believe it when he  sees it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Foot-Sore Attorney  </P> <P> Shoes are made for walking. Not removing.  </P> <P> Rancho Bernardo attorney Mike Klarfeld is fighting to overturn a rule that  allows security guards to force people to remove their shoes to enter the  federal courthouse in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> If the metal-detector goes buzz as you pass through the portals, you may be  ordered to remove your wingtips.  </P> <P> Klarfeld sees no reason to remove his loafers and walk 20 feet over a dirty  floor to retrieve them. "A bureaucratic abuse," he fumed.  </P> <P> He filed suit. Thrown out.  </P> <P> The U.S. attorney in Los Angeles says the shoe rule is needed to guard against  terrorism. Assistant U.S. Atty. Jim Sullivan calls Klarfeld "a knowledgeable  and likable gentleman."  </P> <P> Also persistent. Last week he appealed to the 9th Circuit Court in Pasadena.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 4 Jun (AFP) -- Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,  center-left presidential candidate, has received an anonymous  death threat in Oaxaca, in southern Mexico, where he is on a  campaign tour, the official NOTIMEX news agency reported on  Saturday.    The anonymous threat against Cardenas stated: "We are ready  to eradicate social blights. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is one of  them. Remember what happened to Colosio. Say good-bye to your  candidate, this week he dies."    Colosio, presidential candidate of the Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI), was assassinated on 23 March and  although the perpetrator was arrested, the motive has yet to be  clarified.    The source indicated that the anonymous threat, which was  received by the Oaxaca state committee of the Party of the  Democratic Revolution (PRD, center-left), was sent by an  organization called Lady of Guadalupe Archdiocesan Sanctuary.    In an event in the community of Macuiltianguis, Oaxaca,  Cardenas scoffed at the threat, indicating that "their bark is  worse than their bite." He added, "when someone wants to do  something, he does not announce it. There is nothing to worry  about."</p>

Andrey Pecherov, chairman of the standing  commission for issues of planning, finances, the budget, and  prices, particularly noted in his speech that a change of  parliament would inevitably occur. It is not ruled out that the  functions of the president could be changed this year. There is  in fact no prime minister or institution for managing the  economy. Under these conditions it is necessary to confirm the  fundamental indicators of both the plan and the budget.  Pecherov proposed that the state budget be compiled for the  year, but with confirmation every quarter. He assured the  deputies that specialists are guaranteeing the implementation of  indicators for both the plan and the budget. Touching on the  proposals made by commissions concerning the expenditure part of  the budget, Pecherov stressed that expenditure on the Army does  not meet today's needs and contradicts military doctrine. This  expenditure for 1994 is envisaged at 16,823,610,000,000  karbovantsi. On behalf of the commission, Pecherov proposed  that the military part of the budget be reexamined by the  Defense Council and presented to parliament for confirmation by  15 April.    As regards pensions the commission chairman proposed that  the  pension fund be transferred from the Ministry of Social  Protection to the Ministry of Finance, and that tough controls  be established. The Commission for Issues of Planning, the  Budget, Finance, and Prices made this proposal: "Until order is  brought to the system of payment for labor in the national  economy, to make additional payments as from 1 January to  specialists in education, science, culture, health care, social  security, and physical education, to the level of the average  monthly wage of employees in the national economy as a whole,  and to finance the said expenditure by general grants from the  budget. On average 21 billion karbovantsi per month are needed  for this, and approximately 12 trillion per year. The  commission proposes that the government elaborates a procedure  within two weeks for paying the said increases."    Deputy Pecherov subjected the actions of the government to  harsh criticism. The government does not want to assume  responsibility. If this continues, noted Pecherov, then we will  have nothing to discuss with the government.</p>

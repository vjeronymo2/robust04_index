			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Small Business: Private life in Prague - A look at a couple who found a gold lining in the velvet revolution Shortly after Prague's 'velvet revolution' of November 1989 an enterprising Welsh bride, and her chartered accountant husband, started hawking brightly coloured T-shirts from a rucksack to the first tourists to this baroque jewel of a city. Four years later, Melissa Woolf runs eight strategically-placed 'Melissa' stores along the city's main tourist routes. She still hangs T-shirts from racks on the white-washed walls of her shops. But her main business, worth more than Pounds 2m last year, is selling Czech toys and exquisite Bohemian glassware. Her husband, James, has become one of Prague's biggest property developers. His company, Flow East, refurbished 60 city centre properties last year, turning crowded flats into smart offices and apartments and buying new homes for former tenants in the suburbs. The Woolfs came to Prague in 1990. They were unimpressed by the prospects in recession-hit Britain and intrigued by media coverage of enthusiastic crowds milling in squares of baroque beauty and the possibilities offered in a post-communist state. They found the opportunities the opening-up of a centrally planned economy presented for service industries such as tourism, retailing and property development. Their entrepreneurial flair and willingness to work a seven-day week has allowed both to build successful businesses. 'I now employ 117 people full-time. I visit every shop at least once a day and spend two or three days a week on the road talking to suppliers and placing orders,' says Melissa. She buys what she likes, and when she really takes a fancy to a product, such as the wooden puzzle toys on display in her shop on the approach to the historic Charles Bridge, she buys a stake in the company. James helps with the accounts and the property transactions. But apart from that, the two run their business lives separately. James works from offices in his own refurbished building close to the city centre shared with tenants as varied as Saatchi and Saatchi, the German Tourist agency, two banks and lots of lawyers. 'I started operating on the principle that incoming foreign companies and local entrepreneurs would want to locate themselves in the heart of this beautiful but long-neglected city,' he says. 'After investing heavily up front, however, most foreign companies are cutting back on expensive expatriate employees and training locals. They also expect rents and other expenses to be paid out of local income while the supply of refurbished office space is increasing all the time. So rentals have stabilised over,' he says. Prague, he points out, is as big as a medium-sized British provincial city, such as Ipswich. But Ipswich, and similar towns in western Europe, developed on capitalist lines after the war. Prague in 1990 was different. Once-elegant shops, apartments and other properties were stolen from their owners, either by the Nazis after 1938, or by the communists after the Prague coup of 1948. Most were roughly converted into over-crowded communal flats, storehouses and the like, or allowed to decay for 50 years. One of the priorities of the Czech republic's free market-oriented government has been to return as much property as possible to rightful owners and sell state property. But the task is complicated. . To whom, for example, should a property expropriated from a Jewish owner by the Nazis, then sold and later confiscated by the communists, be returned? So James decided to buy only fully restituted properties with a clear owner. Once bought, his next problem is persuading tenants with low fixed rents to leave. For most life in the city centre means over-crowded, badly-maintained flats. James employs a small staff to comb local newspapers for property in the suburbs. James then buys on behalf of tenants who thus become owners of their own homes - leaving him the empty buildings. 'The property market here is about buying, refurbishing and renting. A resale market has not emerged yet, but it will,' he says. Until capital value can be unlocked by resale, cashflow profit is ploughed back into the business. It is a similar story for Melissa, whose company has no debt and is financed from retained earnings. 'We have three Czech construction companies working for us full time and the quality of their output is rising steadily. Many are Yugoslavs or Russians. They work seven days a week, nights as well if required,' James says. 'It takes only six to seven weeks to convert a flat in Prague which would take three to four months in London.' James looks after the legal and financial side of the business. His partner, Stephen Davis, oversees the construction. Problems include finding good, loyal staff - not easy with unemployment in Prague only 2.5 per cent - and the bureaucracy. Companies employing more than 25 workers are subject to wage control and there are fines for slow or non-payment of VAT at 23 per cent. Finance is less of a problem, thanks to the establishment of foreign banks. 'Komercni Banka, the biggest Czech bank, is only prepared to lend for a maximum of four years at 14.5 per cent, or seven years by private treaty. But why bother when you can get 10-year loans from German and Austrian banks with less hassle? As for UK banks, they have missed out on this market completely,' said James.</p>

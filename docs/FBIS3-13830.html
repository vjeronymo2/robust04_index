			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, in </F> Amman, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo, date not given; from  the "Dialogue From Afar" program--recorded]    [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What is Jordan's impression of and  stance on the Security Council's resolution denouncing the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre?    [Al-'Anani] The Jordanian Government met on Saturday morning  following the announcement and held an extensive debate on it.  The government decided that the resolution, Security Council  Resolution 904, is generally positive, contains some points that  we regard as positive, and advances the issue it dealt with,  primarily the protection of the Palestinian people and their  security on their national soil.    We found the clear reference to the occupied Arab  territories, including Arab Jerusalem, to be positive. We  believe that the clear and strong denunciation of the massacre  was one of the positive points. The note on the need for Israel  to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1945 in all occupied  Arab territories, including east Jerusalem, was a positive point  in that resolution. We believe it is now necessary to adopt  practical measures to translate the resolution into a tangible  reality, because the Jordanian Government notes with extreme  concern that the injuries and killings in the occupied Arab land  since the massacre on 25 February are increasing considerably.  We must take measures that will guarantee the protection and  security of the Palestinian people.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] After Security Council Resolution 904  denouncing the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was passed, is it now  certain that the peace process will be resumed?    [Al-'Anani] You know the massacre happened while  consultations were under way among the heads of the delegations  of the countries participating in the negotiating process. But  after consultations among themselves, these delegations made a  collective decision on the need to suspend the negotiations  until measures are decided following the horrible carnage in  Hebron. We believe the resolution has contributed to creating a  favorable atmosphere for resuming negotiations to reach a  comprehensive, just, and durable solution based on UN  Resolutions 242 and 338 as well as 425, which concerns Lebanon.  Jordan believes the road is now open to return to negotiations  but, as happened before, the decision [to resume talks] must  come after coordination among the negotiating countries or among  the foreign ministers of the cordon states that held previous  meetings in which Egypt participated, represented by its foreign  minister.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Where does the Jordanian-Israeli track  stand?    [Al-'Anani] The Jordanian-Israeli track of the negotiations  at the end of the consultations among the delegation heads in  Washington almost reached the point of formulating some topics  on the agenda and a detailed subagenda was agreed for  negotiating these topics. On water, energy, and the  environment, there was agreement on most of the topics that must  be discussed in this framework. But security and the borders,  as some of the key topics on the agenda, on the basis of which  an agreement will be reached on the mechanism of Israel's  withdrawal from the Jordanian occupied territories, are not yet  settled. Besides, the issue of refugees still needs discussion.  We can say that there is an atmosphere that calls for optimism  about progress but we cannot say that any (?positive) progress  has occurred on substantial issues.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What is your [words indistinct] Arab  coordination, especially with the resumption of the peace  process in April?    [Al-'Anani] Jordan has always believed in the need for full  Arab coordination to support and continue the peace process  because Arab coordination unifies Arab stances and precludes  unilateral measures. Some issues on the agenda on the Arab  track are interlinked and we want to make sure that the Arab  stances are harmonious and integrated.    We believe the horrible massacre of Hebron has provided  clear  evidence that any decision or measure affecting a single track,  such as the Palestinian-Israeli track, is bound to have obvious  repercussions and effects on other Arab tracks that would block  their progress. We believe that Arab coordination  (?strengthens) Arab stances and prevents unilateral measures and  competition among Arab tracks at their own expense.</p>

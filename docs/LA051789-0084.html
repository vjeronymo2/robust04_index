			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: TRANSPORTATION;  </P> <P> TRANSCON FOCUSES ON SILVER LINING IN REPORT ON ITS LARGEST LOSS EVER  </P> <P> Transcon Inc., a large Orange-based trucking firm, lost $23.7 million last  year. But you have to turn to Page 17 of the company's annual report to find  that figure.  </P> <P> In an upbeat message to shareholders and employees, Chairman Orin S. Neiman  starts by stating that Transcon closed the year with "a small, but meaningful  profit" of $142,000 for the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> He goes on to mention that $23.9 million was lost in the previous three  quarters, but the net loss for the full 12 months is not reported for another  15 pages. In between are six, full-page color photographs of Transcon customers  giving testimonials and details of operating improvements made by the company  over the past year.  </P> <P> The tone of the 1988 report is much different from a year earlier. When the  company lost $19.9 million in 1987, the loss was listed on Page 1 of that  year's report, and Neiman's message was blunt. It started: "Transcon suffered  badly in 1987 . . . our biggest loss ever."  </P></p>

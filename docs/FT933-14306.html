			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / European Court rules on equal pay THE ADVOCATE general of the European Court of Justice yesterday said that employers must justify any differences in pay between groups of men and women doing jobs of equal value, even if the differences result from collective agreements which do not appear to be discriminatory, Diane Summers writes. The advocate general's opinion, which will influence a ruling expected from the court in the next few months, relates to a British equal pay case that has been running for eight years. Dr Pamela Enderby, a senior grade speech therapist with Frenchay Health Authority in Bristol, is claiming comparability with a senior grade pharmacist. Speech therapists in the National Health Service are generally women, while 70 per cent of pharmacists in higher grades are men. Speech therapists may earn only 60 per cent of the salary of pharmacists.</p>

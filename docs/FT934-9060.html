			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Chinese trainee airline pilots arrive in Oxford THE FIRST GROUP of Chinese trainee airline pilots to go abroad has arrived at the Oxford Air Training School, Adrian Michaels writes. This follows September's announcement that the Chinese Civil Aviation Authority had awarded its first overseas civilian cadet training contract to the school. The pilots, all of whom are on their first trip outside China, will be put on a 56-week course costing Pounds 55,000 each which will qualify them for a full British commercial pilot's licence and instrument rating. They are then due to return to China for further training. The school sees their arrival as an acknowledgement by China that it has a fast-growing civil aviation sector but is short of pilots and lacks access to the latest technology. The school said: 'Their English is excellent and so far they have taken to the change in circumstances very well.' The trainees will spend their first four weeks in the classroom at the school, which said it had trained 10,000 from 40 countries since it was founded in 1962. They will be living in Oxford with a group of nearly 200 other trainees from 18 countries.</p>

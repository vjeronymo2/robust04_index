			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Mutual assurers 'in survival fight' TRADITIONAL life offices the mutual assurance companies owned by their policyholders - will have to fight competition from banks and building societies to survive, a report to be published next week says. Life Assurance 1993, to be published on Friday by Mintel, the market analysts, says the life assurance market has become overcrowded both with new domestic players, such as the recently established insurance arms of some banks and building societies, and with foreign companies entering the market. This has led to pacts, such as the exclusive distribution deal between Halifax, the largest UK building society, and Standard Life. It has also resulted in foreign buy-outs such as the purchase of Equity &amp; Law by Axa, the French insurance group. The link-up between life offices and banks and building societies benefits both partners. The life office gains a valuable distribution channel while the banks and building societies earn commission for the sale of life products. Mr Paul Hersey, senior finance analyst for Mintel, remarked: 'The mutuals are disappearing slowly. The traditional medium-size Scottish offices are coming under attack . . . The traditional composites will also suffer unless they make a firm decision regarding which segment of the market they want to target.' The survey also reports that the independent financial adviser is winning the confidence of clients. People are less prepared to return to their bank manager for further financial advice, it says. In 1991, 34 per cent of those who sought financial advice in the previous 12 months said they would go back to the bank manager, but of those who sought advice in the previous 12 months this year that figure declined to 26 per cent. Yet 17 per cent would return to their independent adviser for further advice, compared with 13 per cent in 1991. Life Assurance 1993. Mintel International Group, 18-19 Long Lane, London EC1A 9HE.

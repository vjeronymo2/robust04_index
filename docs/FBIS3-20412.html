			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Qiu Xiaohua (6726 2556 5478), Chief Economist, </F> State Bureau of Statistics: "Fixed Capital Investment Under  Macroeconomic Control"]    [Text] Since the advent of the 1990's, some new changes  have occurred in the Chinese economy. On one hand, the basic  needs of food and shelter for people living in towns and  villages have been resolved, allowing them to progress toward a  comparatively more well-off life. As a suitable balance between  income and consumption levels has not been reached, a new state  of heated consumption exists. Consequently, the people's overall  consumption level is only in a temporary stage of stable growth,  with part of the money transferred from the consumption base  into the investment base. On the other hand, the people's  economy is entering a new phase which is placing greater demands  on the infrastructure. Add to this the need to revise the  structure of enterprise and property, the opening up to the  outside and the increasing use of foreign capital, all of which  have sent the need for fixed asset investment into a relatively  prosperous phase. This shows that growth in the national economy  will increasingly depend on growth in capital investment to  drive it. Such a leading investment model of economic activity  has been maintained for three years. Since its beginning in  1991, fixed asset investment in China has continued its rapid  growth, with fixed asset investment for the whole society that  year showing a 23.8 percent growth over the year before. Growth  for 1992 was 42.6 percent over that for the year before, and  growth for the first half of 1993 was 61 percent over that for  the same period a year ago (growth in some units was 70.7  percent). Historically, such rapid growth was seldom seen  (except that during three years of the "Great Leap Forward").  Driven by this rapid growth in fixed asset investment, China's  economic growth had also increased noticeably, so that the total  value of the gross national product (GNP) in 1991 increased 8  percent over that for the year before; that for 1992 increased  13.2 percent; and that for the first half of 1993 increased 14.1  percent.  <H5>  Preliminary Results of Macroeconomic Control </H5>   However, because overly rapid growth in fixed asset  investment has exceeded the nation's present capacity to  accommodate it, some outstanding problems accompanying this  heated growth in the national economy have surfaced. Add to this  the confusion in the financial order which has further  precipitated a crisis in the supply of production materials  because of this excessive investment growth. This was  accompanied by serious inflation, import growth exceeding that  of exports, a drop in foreign exchange and savings, market  instability, and other such problems. As the result, beginning  in June 1993, the Chinese government adopted measures to  strengthen macroeconomic control, with hopes that by regulating  the financial order and strengthening control over investment  projects, it could control this overly rapid growth in fixed  asset investment. During the last three months, exercise of  related policies have seen some results, the chief of which are  noted as follows:    -- A marked drop in fixed asset investment. In June, fixed  asset investment in state units showed growth of 76.7 percent  over that for the same period a year ago, but the increase in  July showed a drop of 71.7 percent; for August, a drop of 58.1  percent, and for September, 56.8 percent. For the third quarter,  a total of 182.4 billion yuan (PRC currency) had been invested,  a drop of nine percentage points from that for the first half of  the year. Of this, investment in infrastructure increased 56.2  percent, investment in replacement and remodelling, 57.3  percent; and investment in commercial housing, 120.8 percent;  each of which respectively fell back 11.7, 10.8, and 19  percentage points. From the first quarter to the third quarter,  completed cumulative investment totalled 401.5 billion yuan, a  growth of 66.4 percent over that for the same period a year ago,  but a drop of 4.3 percentage points over that for the first half  of the year.    -- Slowdown in various types of privately raised capital  and loans made domestically. In the third quarter, capital  investment in infrastructure and replacements and improvements  totalled 138.3 billion yuan, an increase of 48.9 percent over  that for the same period a year ago, but a fall-back of 3.9  percentage points over that for the first half of the year. Of  this, 33.9 billion yuan were domestic loans, an increase of 18.6  percent, but a fall-back of 5.4 percentage points. Various types  of privately raised capital totalled 70.3 billion yuan, an  increase of 75.8 percent, but a fall-back of 10 percentage  points.    -- Noticeable reduction in new projects. In the third  quarter, new infrastructure construction and improvements  totalled more than 14,400 projects, a reduction of 3,400 over  the figure for the same period a year ago, and a great  turnaround from the huge increase for the first half of the  year. In particular, control was effective with a number of  large new local projects, and major national construction  projects also experienced a correspondingly smaller reduction.    -- An investment slowdown in all regions. During the third  quarter, completed fixed asset investment in the eastern region  of the country totalled 101.4 billion yuan, an increase of 68.9  percent over that for the same period a year ago, though the  increase fall-back was 12.3 percentage points of that for the  first half of the year. For the central region, completed fixed  asset investment totalled 43.8 billion yuan, an increase of 48.5  percent, with a fall-back of 4.6 percentage points. For the  western region, such completed investment totalled 25.3 billion  yuan, an increase of 48.6 percent, with a fall-back of 2.6  percentage points. While the investment situation in the  eastern, central, and western regions does not show any greatly  noticeable changes as a whole, it is still the eastern region by  itself that shows much more rapid investment growth than the  other two areas, the proportion of its growth comprising more  than 60 percent of the total figure.    -- Noticeable increase in availability of capital for  major construction projects. During the first half of the year,  because of the massive scope of investments and an excessive  number of newly started projects, distribution of capital was  scattered, so that major national construction projects  experienced a capital shortage, with less than 20 percent of the  total needed being available, and almost 20 percentage points  lower than that usually available in other years. Since the  third quarter, because of active regulatory measures taken by  the state, this unfavorable picture has improved considerably.  According to studies made, investment for major national  construction projects had stepped up noticeably by September,  and capital availability had risen to over 80 percent, of which  96 percent of the capital needed for railroad construction was  available. Capital availability for nine major industries such  as railroads, electrical power, steel, chemicals, petroleum,  petrochemistry, coal, communications, and construction materials  averaged 82.8 percent, an increase of 16.2 percentage points  over the figure for the same period a year ago. Judging from  present developments, it can be predicted that new increased  productivity resulting from the major construction projects  planned by the state will come to pass, which is favorable to  enhancing the after effects of economic development.    The changes described above show that the policy measures  taken by the Chinese government to strengthen macroeconomic  control of fixed asset investment are showing some preliminary  results in the third quarter. There is no doubt that they will  have an active effect in improving the macroeconomic environment.  <H5>  Remaining Problems </H5>   At the same time, it should be seen that because reforms  in the investment system have yet to be attained, present  investment activity is still driven chiefly by the government,  and enterprises have yet to truly become the principal body for  investment. As the result, investment activity lacks  understanding of risk, and blind investing with no thought of  benefits is more commonly seen. The task to control investment  growth and improve the investment structure is still rather  arduous.    Important problems remaining in the investment area are  the following:    1. Increasing investment growth remains on the high side,  and no noticeable change is seen in this picture. For the nine  foregoing months, the rate of increasing investment growth  remains over 60 percent. Preliminary figures for total  investment by the society at large for the whole year may  possibly exceed 1.1 trillion yuan, an increase of more than 360  billion yuan over the figure for the year before, an increasing  growth of more than 46 percent, and expected to exceed the plan  by more than 40 percent. Whether the increasing investments are  in volume or in the rate of growth, they are the most numerous  and the highest since the 1980's. The root cause of overly rapid  investment growth for the year is the overly large scope of  infrastructure construction. During the foregoing three  quarters, the number of ongoing investment projects totalled  more than 90,000, of which new projects comprised 38.6 percent,  the highest proportion for the same period during the last few  years. Infrastructure construction was allotted more than 1.7  trillion yuan, an increase of more than 500 billion yuan over  last year, a growth of 40.2 percent. Because the scope is much  too extensive, it will affect stable investment growth for some  years to come.    2. The problem of investment structures not always being  logical remains outstanding. Generally speaking, investment  structures have undergone revision, with strengthening of some  short-line assets, particularly transportation and  telecommunications, which have shown noticeable growth. From the  first quarter to the end of the third quarter, 71.5 billion yuan  of investment capital were processed, a growth of 106.4 percent  over that for the same period a year ago. The proportion of  investment comprised rose to 20.5 percent from an earlier 15.8  percent. The pace to invest in major engineering projects such  as the Beijing-Kowloon Railway was noticeably speeded up.    But the problem of investment structures not being logical  all the time remains, and this is manifested chiefly in three  areas. First, investment growth in the third stage industries,  with the exception of transportation and telecommunications, has  been advancing too fast. In the foregoing nine months, completed  investments in the third stage industries totalled 154.3 billion  yuan, a growth of 95.7 percent over that for the same period a  year ago, and 69.3 percentage points and 55.8 percentage points  respectively, over that for investments in the first stage and  second stage industries. The proportion of industrial investment  rose from 36 percent to 44.1 percent. Except for the 82.7  billion yuan invested in transportation and telecommunications,  this increasing investment in the third stage industries grew  87.3 percent, 27.7 percentage points higher than investment  growth for the nation as a whole. The proportional investment  was as high as 23.7 percent, a rise of 3.5 percentage points  over that for the same period a year ago.    Second is the fact that the proportion of investment in  the infrastructure continues to drop. For the past three  quarters, investment in the first stage industries was 7.9  billion yuan, a growth of 26.4 percent over that for the same  period a year ago, the proportional investment dropping from 2.9  percent to 2.3 percent. Among the second stage industries,  investments in energy and raw materials totalled 113.7 billion  yuan, a growth of 33.6 percent and a proportional investment of  36.8 percent, a drop of 7.1 percentage points from the 43.9  percent figure for the same period a year ago.    Third is inadequate emphasis on investments to be clear,  and of good quality and high grade. From January to September,  among investments made by state units, 135.9 billion yuan was  invested on new construction projects, a growth of 86.5 percent  over that for the same period a year ago, and 20 percentage  points higher than the national average. The proportional  investment rose from 33.3 percent to 38.8 percent. But  investments used for remodeling and expansion totalled only  187.4 billion yuan, an increase of 50.7 percent, but a fall-back  from a proportional investment of 56.7 percent to 53.6 percent.  This does not agree with the state's regulatory goals.    3. The heat on real estate is still on. The disjointed  contradictions in property sales is comparatively obvious.  During the foregoing nine months, investments in commercial  housing nationwide totalled 51.9 billion yuan, an increase of  134.2 percent over that for the same period a year ago,  completing the state's 43 billion yuan plan ahead of time. For  the year, this figure could possibly exceed 100 billion yuan, a  one-fold increase over that a year ago. At the same time, the  sale of commercial housing had been less than ideal, for total  sales in the third quarter was only 14.4 billion yuan, a growth  of only 35.6 percent over that for the same period a year ago.  In comparison with growth in production, this was an almost  one-fold slowdown. At present, commercial housing yet to be sold  nationwide adds up to an area of more than 50 million square  meters. This is due chiefly to overly rapid investment growth,  illogical structure [poor design], oversupply of upscale  buildings, and overly high prices which make such housing beyond  the reach of average-salaried citizens. Of course the difficulty  in selling commercial housing is also related to slow reforms in  the low-rent system. Actually, there is not much construction of  commercial housing on the Chinese mainland at present, for  housing is far from adequate.    Besides this, the phenomenon of capital defaults in the  construction field still exists; this affects the requirements  for the construction industry to operate normally.  <H5>  Important Countermeasures </H5>   An extended look into the coming months sees growth in  fixed asset investment continuing its steady decline, and the  structure of fixed asset investment being further revised.  However, for the state to achieve ideal macroeconomic control,  further effort is still required. At present, it is most  important to concentrate and improve on work in the following  areas:    First is sufficient scientific grasp of investment control  to the extent that such growth will adapt to the need for stable  and healthy growth of the people's economy. I feel that to  maintain China's economy at a growth rate of about 10 percent,  we must have fixed asset investment growth at a rate higher than  20 percent. An investment rate maintained around 35 percent  actually nets investment growth around 10 percent. So it is not  advisable to constrict investment too much. It is also important  to avoid overly rapid investment growth, which may cause  economic activity to lose control. This, in turn, will aggravate  tension between various factors.    Second is attention to improving the investment structure,  so investment in infrastructure, basic industries and facilities  can develop at an even faster pace. We must concentrate the  necessary financial resources to strengthen the buildup in  agriculture, transportation, energy, and important raw  materials. While this is the driving force that assures stable  economic growth, it is also the condition necessary to support  the next cycle of rapid economic development in a healthy  direction. Because of this, we must step up the pace of reform  in the finance and investment system, and establish banks to  finance and develop basic industries, expand the issuance of  special bonds, encourage development of shareholder enterprises,  further correct the pricing system, and stimulate and promote  funneling of social capital toward construction of  infrastructure and basic facilities. As to investment in most  processing industries, all effort must be made to utilize  available local resources, and manage them according to market  rules. We must suitably reduce active investment by the state  into these areas, to support development of short-line  industries, and really loosen "bottleneck" restricting  contradictions.    Third is greater effort to improve investment efficiency,  and cut down on loss and waste. Toward this end, we must step up  legislative action pertaining to investment to improve the  democratic and scientific aspects of investment policy, and  systematically assure the efficiency of construction projects.  At the same time, we must strengthen macroeconomic control of  investment at the source, and exercise necessary management of  capital flow, to guarantee the capital needs of the state's  important construction projects. Furthermore, information on the  state's property policies must be issued in a timely manner, to  strengthen guidance, and to reduce blind investment by society.  With respect to public investment and use of foreign capital, we  must move gradually from ownership management to property policy  management, and prepare corresponding policy measures to assure  that the state's overall situation be scientific and logical.    Basically speaking, we must implement a body of investment  gradually, for it to evolve from the government toward  enterprises and individuals, thereby overcoming the abuses of  "everyone eating from the same pot."</p>

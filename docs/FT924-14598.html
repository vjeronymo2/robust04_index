			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Dutch scale down air crash toll THE DEATH toll in Sunday's crash of an El Al cargo aircraft into two Amsterdam apartment buildings is now thought to be less than the original estimate of 250, but city officials say the true number may never be known. Rescue workers have recovered 49 badly burnt bodies and do not expect to find any more victims in the twisted wreckage of the 80 flats. A city spokeswoman said the fierce temperatures of the fires which engulfed the flats meant some bodies might be irrecoverable. The number of dead is still expected to exceed 49, 'but we are cautiously optimistic that the figure of 250 will prove to be on the high side'. The Amsterdam rescue team is to be helped by British investigators involved in the recovery of bodies after the explosion of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988. Yesterday, the town council of Lockerbie sent a wreath of flowers to Amsterdam to express the town's condolences over the Dutch air disaster.</p>

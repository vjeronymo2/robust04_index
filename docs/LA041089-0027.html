			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Former Rep. Mario Biaggi of New York, convicted of taking a payoff and  obstructing justice, headed for 2 1/2 years in a federal prison in Ft. Worth,  his pride intact and protesting his innocence. The 71-year-old Democrat, who  served 10 terms on Capitol Hill after becoming a highly decorated policeman,  was convicted of accepting an illegal gratuity for taking two vacations with a  girlfriend in Florida at the expense of Meade H. Esposito, a longtime friend  and the former Democratic boss of Brooklyn. The government said the trip was a  payoff Biaggi received for using his influence in Washington, while Biaggi has  maintained he accepted the Florida vacation as a friend of Esposito. Biaggi was  sentenced to 30 months in prison and a $500,000 fine.  </P></p>

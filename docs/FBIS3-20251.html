He stressed that he  had not proposed simultaneous referendums -- he had simply  defined the "area in time" in which the Finnish referendum could  be arranged.    As far as the simultaneous timing of the referendums is  concerned, he merely admitted that "it is possible to find  reasons for holding a referendum at the same time as the Swedish  referendum," but nothing more.    Questions on the matter were put by Green Eduskunta deputies  Paavo Nikula and Pekka Raty. Nikula pointed out that the  president of the Republic had just expressed some very different  views about the possibility of simultaneous referendums than  those Aho voiced in his interview in LALLI on Wednesday.    Briefly Aho had stressed that it is impossible to fix a firm  date for the Finnish referendum before the EU has resolved its  internal disagreements on institutional matters and before it  has become clear when our EU membership agreement can be signed.  He had also been speaking against the background of the  discussions that have been held on the matter inside the  government.    And on the basis of these discussion the referendum should  be  held in the fall "long enough before the Eduskunta election so  that we can as it were concentrate separately on this major  national issue." Asked about the possibility of holding a  referendum at the same time as Sweden's, he had replied that  this is a very late date, but it still remains the latest  possible date if it is to be possible to hold the referendum  without upsetting the Eduskunta elections and the preparations  for it.    The thrust was therefore that the "area of time" available  stretches from early fall to mid-November.    Social Democratic Party chairman Paavo Lipponen for his part  was strongly critical yesterday in his reaction to Prime  Minister Esko Aho's remarks about the possibility of holding  simultaneous referendums in the Nordic area.    "The prime minister's vague statements about the timing of  the EU referendum give rise to doubts about the government's  real determination to adhere to the EU timetable," he said.    According to Lipponen, Finland must reach an independent  decision on its own referendum without bring in Sweden's and  Norway's timetables. It is true that it is in Finland's  interest that all the Nordic applicants become EU members, but  Finland has its own vital interests to consider. That is why  Finland cannot tie its own membership to the decisions of the  other Nordic countries.    "If there is a majority for EU membership in the Finnish  referendum Finland will join the EU even if Sweden and Norway  were to remain outside," Lipponen said.    He also called on the government to stop its dawdling on the  EU issue. Once the questions of interpretation have been  resolved in a positive manner for Finland the EU agreement  should be given its final form without delay and without any  further maneuvering. For example, the government should  announce without any further delay whether it approves the  results negotiated by its own members in the EU membership  negotiations.</p>

On Friday, EL  TIEMPO published a report quoting a denial by the head of  military intelligence, statements by the Cuban ambassador, and  Caracol's version of an alleged telephone call from the Cuban  president to [Colombian] Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin.    EL TIEMPO has been publishing reports, without any evidence,  of an alleged meeting in Havana of Colombian guerrilla leaders  and Bishop Nel Beltran, which both the Cuban Government and the  bishop have denied.    EL ESPECTADOR newspaper's front page headline read "Nel On  Fantasy Island." An article, covered on an inside page, reports  the Disney Reservation Center in Florida confirmed that  Monsignor Beltran stayed there between 24-25 January.    This newspaper also publishes on its front page a poll taken  by the National Consulting Center, which shows that most of the  440 people asked favor maintaining diplomatic relations with  Cuba even if it turns out that the guerrilla summit in Havana  was held. Of the people polled, 51 percent replied that  diplomatic ties should not be severed, 30 percent said yes they  should, and 19 percent said they did not know.</p>

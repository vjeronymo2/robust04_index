			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RACING AT DEL MAR;  </P> <P> AN EASTERNER LOOKS TO THE WEST AND SEES NOTHING BUT A BLUR  </P> <P> In other parts of the country, a race such as the Bing Crosby Handicap at Del  Mar wouldn't have merited special attention. After all, the purse was only  $100,000, and the three principal combatants -- Olympic Prospect, Sam Who and  On The Line -- were merely specialists at the six-furlong distance. But to  California racing fans, this late July matchup was a compelling attraction,  because it was a test of the quality they love and admire: pure speed.  </P> <P> Indeed, when a visitor from the East spends time at the tracks here, and  compares the nature of racing on each side of the country, he can sum up the  major differences in one word: speed.  </P> <P> When the gate opens for a typical race in the East, a jockey will look to see  the way the race is going to develop and try to get his horse in a good  tactical position. If the pace appears slow, he may make a move for the lead;  fast, he may try to settle behind the leaders. Rarely will a rider put his  horse in high gear immediately. D. Wayne Lukas, who campaigns on both coasts,  thinks the Eastern style is based as much on tradition as logic: "Trainers and  jockeys all say 'Don't rush them' and like to see their horses settle into the  race. It comes from 50 years of doing it that way."  </P> <P> Here there is no such patience and caution. When the gate opens, most of the  jockeys will be pushing and shoving furiously, asking their horses to run as  fast as they can for the first quarter of a mile. In mid-race they may look  around to examine the tactical situation, but if they have hesitated before  that, they are already out of contention.  </P> <P> The style is dictated by the nature of the California tracks. Sun-baked and  very fast, they are conducive to speed. Horses don't tire quickly on them for  the same reasons that human runners can go farther and faster on an asphalt  track than they can on a sandy beach. Trainers understand that horses need  speed to win, and they work to develop that speed. Horses are trained hard and  fast from the start of their careers. In a maiden race for 2-year-old fillies  here recently, one of the horses had drilled five furlongs in 57 3/5 seconds;  another had sizzled a half mile in :46 1/5.  </P> <P> Judicious Eastern trainers would rarely drill a young horse so hard; they want  to teach horses to relax, not to make them speed crazy. Even a great horse like  Easy Goer would typically work five-eighths in 1:00, a half mile in 48, as he  was developing.  </P> <P> Californians think their emphasis on early speed is an absolute virtue. "I  think it's what's made our racing so good," said John Sadler, trainer of the  brilliantly fast Olympic Prospect. "To be a good horse in California, you've  got to be able to run all the way."  </P> <P> "East Coast speed," Lukas said, "is not the same thing as West Coast speed."  Never has this truth been better demonstrated than in the 1987 Breeders' Cup.  </P> <P> Groovy had swept through an unbeaten season in New York so impressively he was  being touted as a horse-of-the-year candidate. Nobody could get close to him.  Speed handicappers said he was a Secretariat of sprinters. But then he came  west for the Breeders' Cup at Hollywood Park, where the filly Very Subtle had  no difficulty outrunning him for the lead and then beat him decisively. Groovy  had been cruising to the lead at a relatively slow pace in the East, but now he  had learned what West Coast speed is all about.  </P> <P> Racing fans in California have a special fondness for those horses that emerge  from the tough competition as the fastest of the fastest. Just as Easterners  might ardently debate the merits of classic runners like Affirmed and Alydar,  Westerners may argue who was the quickest of the great speedsters they have  seen here -- horses like Chinook Pass, Phone Trick, Zany Tactics and Cherry  River, for whom a half mile in :44 would be like a canter in the park.  </P> <P> The latest in this great tradition of California speedballs is Olympic  Prospect. He is modestly bred and started out in $50,000 claiming company,  where Sadler bought him. He has had an assortment of knee problems. He has  little stamina and no versatility. But he has more raw speed than any other  thoroughbred in America.  </P> <P> "Since I claimed him and put the blinkers on him," Sadler said, "nobody's ever  been in front of him in the first quarter-mile. The most amazing race he's ever  run was his first race at Santa Anita last year, when he went the first half  mile in :43 flat. I've never seen that before. But he's run as fast as he has  without catching a really fast, fast track."  </P> <P> Olympic Prospect needed all his speed in the Crosby, which brought together the  strongest field of sprinters in the country this year. On The Line had equaled  Santa Anita's six-furlong record of 1:07 3/5 during the winter and had  subsequently won the Carter Handicap in New York. Sam Who had won five sprint  races in a row, twice running six furlongs in 1:08.  </P> <P> When the gate opened, it was an aptly named long shot, Speedratic, who exploded  out first. His jockey, Pat Valenzuela, is widely regarded as the best gate  rider in America, one who habitually gets the jump. But after a couple of  strides, Olympic Prospect was in high gear and he quickly opened a three-length  lead. His time for the first quarter-mile was 21 2/5 seconds.  </P> <P> On The Line was chasing the leader, Gary Stevens urging him steadily so Olympic  Prospect wouldn't get too far away. On the turn, he accelerated sharply. The  Teletimer flashed a number Eastern racing fans will rarely see: 43 4/5 seconds  for the half mile.  </P> <P> Olympic Prospect was finished. As he weakened, On The Line opened a commanding  lead in mid-stretch and scored a five-length victory over Speedratic. The final  time for six furlongs was 1:08 flat. On The Line had established himself as the  best sprinter in the West, in America, the horse to beat in the $1 million  Breeders' Cup Sprint in the fall. He will next display his speed for Del Mar  fans in the $75,000 Pat O'Brien Stakes over seven furlongs next Wednesday.  </P> <P> California has plenty of memorable attractions for a tourist -- vistas on the  Pacific, Peking-duck pizzas -- but what could be more breathtaking than to see  a half mile in 43 4/5 and six furlongs in 1:08?  </P></p>

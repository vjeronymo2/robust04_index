			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii was accused in the Diet on Tuesday [24 May] of making a  controversial remark, calling the poor rice harvest last year a  heavenly gift to aid the government's policy of reducing rice  production. The accusation was made in the House of  Representatives Budget Committee by Hiromu Nonaka, a member of  the opposition Liberal Democratic Party.    Nonaka said Fujii made the remark in an informal meeting  with  reporters at his home last December. Nonaka also quoted Fujii  as saying last year's harvest, the worst in the postwar era,  spared the government extra efforts in working out ways to  reduce the country's annual rice output by 400,000 tons.    Fujii also was alleged to have said no one in the government  considers it necessary to subsidize farmers who convert their  paddies to grow other produce because they will be gone in 10 or  15 years. Fujii did not confirm or deny the allegation but said  he wanted to stress the importance of the government's  agricultural policy and political reforms.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, "Jerusalem minister in </F> the Palestinian National Authority," by Mahmud Abu-'Id in  Jerusalem; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Abu-'Id] What is the aim of your upcoming  visit to Saudi Arabia?    [Al-Husayni] Actually it will be my third visit to Saudi  Arabia. But it is the second with regard to the Jerusalem  issue. The main aim is to discuss the city's position in the  current political process, in addition to the Saudi political  and moral role. [passage omitted]    [Abu-'Id] You talk about practical measures in the face of  Israel's escalation with regard to Jerusalem. What measures do  you believe should be taken?    [Al-Husayni] Israel has recently stepped up its measures  against Jerusalem, closing and besieging it, hence forcing its  residents to depart. It has prevented them and continues to  prevent them from building [their homes]. This is in addition  to the demolition of hundreds of houses and buildings on the  pretext that these buildings were built without licenses. But  on the other hand it has stepped up the building of Jewish  settlements inside and around the eastern part of the city.    Israel's aim behind all these measures is to destroy the  infrastructure and economic structure and prevent Jerusalem from  communicating with West Bank cities and the Gaza Strip.    These practices require from us a resolute position in order  to confront the challenges. I believe that this can only be  done through practical organization. [passage omitted]    [Abu-'Id] What is your opinion of the Israeli practices  aimed at preventing the setting up of self-rule institutions in  Jerusalem?    [Al-Husayni] The Palestinian institutions present in  Jerusalem should not be hampered. According to the message we  have received (from Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and  the Norwegian foreign minister), these institutions should be  encouraged. As for the institutions set up after this message  to play a role alongside the Palestinian National Authority  under the recent accord, it is natural for them to be in the  self-rule areas. In practice, there are no self-rule  institutions in Jerusalem.    The media clamor aroused by Israel regarding Jerusalem  institutions reflects some Israeli concerns that this  Palestinian presence, which has begun to develop its mechanisms,  is alarming them.    [Abu-'Id] Have Israeli authorities asked you personally to  move to Jericho to live?    [Al-Husayni] Actually no one has asked me to live there.  They said that, if I want to be a National Authority member, I  should move my offices to Jericho. What is meant is the office,  not the accommodation.    [Abu-'Id] And are you prepared to take such a step?    [Al-Husayni] No. From the outset I have stressed my  agreement to join the National Authority, provided this is not  going to keep me away from Jerusalem. And as Jerusalem requires  a lot of time, I prefer to be responsible for issues related to  Jerusalem.    [Abu-'Id] Will Jerusalem be subject to political bargaining?    [Al-Husayni] East Jerusalem is the capital of the  Palestinian state.</p>

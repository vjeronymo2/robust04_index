			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Small business doubts over banks OWNERS OF small businesses appear confident that banks will pass on in full Tuesday's reduction in base rates of 1 percentage point. Yet they remain concerned about the willingness of banks to provide finance for an economic upturn. The accounts of the two thirds of business customers who borrow at rates tied to the base rate were adjusted with immediate effect, the main banks said, though customers will not see the impact until they receive their statements. The 1 per cent reduction was being passed on in full. Mr Clifford Blake, chairman and managing director of Metal Spinners Group, a Newcastle upon Tyne manufacturer of metal components, said he believed the banks would pass on the cut in full. The company, which has turnover of Pounds 8m and 110 employees, said its bank had been applying tougher lending criteria. Some businesses say they are suffering from banks' refusal to lend to certain sectors. Eagletrans, a Middlesbrough-based transport company with Pounds 1m turnover, has had to manage without a bank overdraft. It has grown by using finance houses to fund the purchase of vehicles, making repayments from retained profits. 'As far as the banks are concerned we've got leprosy,' said Mr Gordon Mitchell, managing director. 'I don't think unless I signed my life away they'd be interested in giving me an overdraft.' At Caldene Autoland car showrooms in Tipton, West Midlands, general sales manager Mr Anthony Randall has sold 55 new cars this month, 23 more than his January target. 'We are the victims of our own success,' he said. Tight control of overdrafts made it difficult to obtain extra cash to restock. Accountants confirmed that their clients had problems raising finance. Mr Charles Hatton, a partner in Moore Stephens at Southport, Merseyside, with more than 100 small corporate clients, said: 'The only companies the banks will lend to nowadays are those which don't need it. Those which do are still finding it very difficult indeed.' Banks will typically lend only 50 per cent of fixed asset values and 30 per cent of money owed by customers, said Mr Charles Burton of the Bradford office of Haines Watts. This compared with 70 per cent and 50 per cent respectively before the recession began. Declining property values have meant the actual money available is even less than first appears when compared with 1989 benchmarks.</p>

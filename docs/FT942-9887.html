			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Management: Insead bears up to change pains - Competition, recession and poaching / The challenges facing one of the world's best-known business schools The story goes that there were three reasons why Insead's founding fathers chose Fontainebleau as the site for an international business school in 1959. The nearby Nato headquarters meant that the area had the sort of infrastructure which would appeal to an international clientele; Orly airport was within half an hour's drive; and the centre of Paris was a mere 70 kilometres away. As it happened, Nato quickly moved to Brussels, Charles de Gaulle subsequently became established as France's international airport, and modern traffic conditions turned the journey from school gate to Arc de Triomphe into a two-and-a-half hour rush-hour slog. But none of this has seriously impeded Insead's progress. Helped by a period of hectic expansion in the mid to late 1980s, the European Institute of Business Administration, to give it its full title, is today one of the best-known management education centres in the world, running the largest MBA programme and one of the most extensive executive training facilities on the Continent. It is no small irony, however, that Insead itself is now undergoing some of the change pains which its professors are so good at analysing in other companies. In common with rival business schools it is grappling not only with recession but with more fundamental challenges to the concept of management education and the direction of an increasingly competitive market place. The MBA, for example, which not long ago almost guaranteed career and financial advancement, appears for the moment to have ceased growing. The executive education business, comprising both open and company-specific programmes, must satisfy the increasingly short-term requirements of corporate clients. Most worrying of all, though, is a growing tendency for big companies to organise in-house management development courses. The prospect of using technology to 'deliver' education direct to the workplace rather than on campus is being taken seriously in the industry. Insead's very size - its more than 80 permanent faculty members and an annual budget of FF284m (Pounds 33m) are large by European, if not US standards - has exacerbated its vulnerability to change. Budget pressures necessitated a salary freeze last year, while outside consultants were brought in to advise on fund raising. By comparison with many well-endowed US business schools - and even some European rivals - Insead suffers from a relatively small capital base. But it is Insead's response to the wider market challenge which will perhaps be more eagerly watched, not least the actions of the school's recently appointed co-dean Antonio Borges. Previously deputy governor of the Bank of Portugal, Borges was director of Insead's MBA programme in the heady growth days of the 1980s. 'As the management education industry matures we must do other things, and faster,' says Borges, who shares the job with Ludo Van der Heyden. 'Insead originally transported the US (business school) model to Europe, which was a very successful story. But it is no longer enough.' Internationalisation (of curriculum, students and faculty) is a fashionable campus cry on both sides of the Atlantic - with Insead no exception. The school has been in the vanguard from the start, though some French critics deride the strong US influence (notable in the educational background, if not the nationality, of much of the faculty). 'In Europe we must learn to rely more on our own leadership and here at Insead, for example, we must shake off our dependence on American source material,' says Borges. For this reason, he adds, 'we need a stronger emphasis on research output, but it must be strongly rooted in an interface with the business world. Our aim is to achieve a synergy between the three aspects of teaching, research and consulting'. Borges' solution - that innovation holds the key to Insead's continuing place in the top league of international business schools - may not be original but is hard to dispute. Good ideas, like most good products, only have a shortish shelf life and, as he admits, there are a growing number of competitors claiming to offer to do the same sort of job for half the price. Among the priority areas for Insead, says Borges, are the challenge of corporate renewal and transformation, the new borderless Europe and entrepreneurship (including how to keep big businesses innovative and competitive). 'We are in close contact with many of the world's leading corporations. What we can do is study why some fail to achieve their objectives, why some can adapt and some can't. The differences have important implications for managers. All areas (of the world) in rapid transition raise important issues for western companies seeking to manufacture and trade across intercontinental boundaries - we have to be there ahead of these trends offering insights and analyses for businesses to apply.' Business schools are increasingly affected by technology, not least by the potential effect of the multi-media revolution on the delivery of management education. 'We do invest in these things but that's normal for the age we live in,' says Borges. 'But alone it's not enough. The important thing about Insead is what goes on in the classroom. If you want to change and develop people, which we do, then you have to have a strong message and give them a unique experience.' Borges is adamant that Insead's productivity must increase - 'like many clients we must achieve more with fewer people', he explains, while emphasising that faculty numbers will not be cut. He makes no apologies for the 1980s expansion, which he says has produced 'a better school, the 'all-round' business school'. He cites Insead's PhD programme, which is extremely expensive in terms of scholarships and faculty time but is enhancing the school's reputation in the international market. 'We are in the business of supplying human capital and our PhDs are perhaps the most tangible evidence of this,' says Borges of recent academic appointments by US institutions to three Insead participants. That reputation - endorsed by alumni and corporate participants - is the school's most precious asset. While MBA numbers have fallen in Europe over the last couple of years, Insead says its courses remain oversubscribed: this year there were 2,500 applicants for 466 places. 'Don't forget the investment they make in themselves: almost all of the MBAs are paying their own way,' Borges says. Filling Insead's 'open' executive courses - used by about 1,400 international managers each year - has proved a more formidable challenge. Numbers fell in 1992-93 - most dramatically in the last quarter - but they have perked up again in the last 12 months when demand for 'tailor-made', company-specific programmes has increased. Insead's marketing - inevitably neglected in the good years - has been organised more professionally on product rather than country lines. But Borges is not complacent: 'We must pay attention to our relative weaknesses, in Germany, for example, which we feel is common to others.' Outsiders believe Borges has the right combination of academic flair and financial discipline to reassert Insead's position. Recent donations from Shell, Sandoz, Heineken and the Boston Consulting Group are important votes of corporate confidence, but there is still work to be done to establish a more viable capital base. 'Towards the end of this academic year we will assess the level of capital we would be looking for and whether we are to approach this process formally,' says Borges. Further belt-tightening will almost certainly be necessary.</p>

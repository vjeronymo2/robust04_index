			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Bonds: East Japan Railway launches Dollars 600m Eurobond offer Several issuers took advantage of yesterday's bounce in leading government bond markets to get their planned international bond offerings off the ground. The main deal of the day was East Japan Railway's widely-expected Dollars 600m offering of 10-year Eurobonds. The pricing of the bonds, to yield 55 basis points over comparable US Treasuries, was judged to be fair to generous by the market so syndicate managers involved in the deal were surprised at the disappointing level of interest from the Far East and some areas of Europe. However, they reported brisk demand for the bonds from UK and German institutions and from US offshore accounts in the afternoon. Lead manager Merrill Lynch said that by the close of business in London it was left with around Dollars 25m worth of its allocation of just over half of the whole offering. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread was largely unchanged from its launch level. Meanwhile, the market was limbering up for the imminent launch of the much-heralded 10-year global bond offering from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Price talk on the proposed Dollars 750m transaction, which is being jointly led by IBJ International and Salomon Brothers, ranged between 16 and 20 basis points over US Treasuries. Syndicate managers expected the ADB deal to be launched at the start of Tokyo trading today. The African Development Bank has awarded the mandate for its forthcoming Dollars 500m offering of 10-year Eurobonds to Lehman Brothers and Salomon Brothers. The bonds are expected to be priced to yield around four basis points above the yield on the ADB offer. Elsewhere, Tokyo Electron raised FFr1.1bn through a four-year bond issue with warrants attached. Lead manager Nomura France said the offering was the first of its type by a Japanese company since 1991 and reflected renewed interest in the Euro-French franc market by Japanese issuers. The Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday signed a Pounds 1.5bn Euro-medium-term note programme. The multi-currency programme has been arranged by Merrill Lynch. Moody's, the international credit rating agency, has placed New Zealand's double-A3 foreign currency rating on review for a possible upgrade. Around Dollars 7.8bn of long-term debt is affected. Moody's said its move reflected signs that the restructuring of the New Zealand economy, which has been under way for a number of years, was having the expected salutary effects. Moody's review will focus on the sustainability of present economic trends in a changing political environment, since the new electoral system may mean that coalition-building becomes the norm, contrary to New Zealand tradition.</p>

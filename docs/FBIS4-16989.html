			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nadezhda Garifullina report: "Tradition Lives On!"] </F>   [Text] The Moskva-Sortirovochnaya workers' depots  dedicated their action last Sunday to the 75th anniversary of  the first communist subbotnik. Together with members of Working  Russia, they cleaned up the area around the monument to the  participants in the first communist subbotnik. Working Perovo  has decided to sponsor this rayon.    Several hundred people also went to the monument to Karl  Marx  that day. During the operation to clean up the adjoining public  garden an enormous number of used disposable syringes were  discovered among the mountains of garbage which the "democratic"  authorities are too busy to remove. Addressing a rally, Working  Russia leader Viktor Anpilov said that the time has come to  clear not just the city of garbage but society of the filth  which we have acquired from the capitalization foisted on us by  Yeltsin's reforms. While there I managed to snatch a brief  impromptu interview from Anpilov on the actions which Working  Russia intends to carry out in the near future. Here is what he  said:    "Active preparations for the May Day demonstration are  underway in all Russia's cities. The assemblies of residents of  Tyumen, Ishim, and Voronezh and the congress of working people  of Moscow and the greater Moscow region have sent telegrams to  Prime Minister Chernomyrdin demanding that the May Day  demonstration by Moscow's working people on the 1 May state  holiday be held without interference. The appropriate  notification has been sent to the Moscow authorities by the  Russian Communist Workers Party, the Union of Communist  Parties-CPSU, and the Union of Communists.... At 1000 hours on  23 April Working Russia will hold a congress at the Reutovo  Palace of Culture in which delegations from communist and  workers parties from Brazil, Greece, the United States, Syria,  Turkey, and Finland will be taking part. Incidentally, we are  inviting Soviet and foreign journalists and accreditation will  take place one hour before the congress opens."</p>

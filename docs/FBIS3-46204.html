Last year the overseas-oriented province launched 685  cooperation projects with other provinces and 1,438 new  enterprises based on internal cooperation, absorbing three  billion yuan from other parts of the country.    The achievement was made by offering domestic enterprises  the  same preferential policies given to Sino-foreign joint ventures  and rural enterprises, who enjoy autonomy in employment,  distribution and management systems, among others.    In 1993 more than 550 domestic firms were registered in  Xiamen city alone.    Cooperation thrived between the province's coastal areas and  the mountainous interior. Fuzhou, Xiamen and Quanzhou cities  formed economic and technological partnerships with four inland  counties and cities to support the development of natural and  the human resources.    Economic and trade cooperation with neighboring provinces  also flourished. More than 1,200 projects were implemented last  year, generating an output value to the tune of 2.9 billion yuan  and profits taxes of 220 million yuan.    Some of the cooperative projects were signed through  representative offices set up in Fujian by other provinces.  Last year the province received 2,000 groups of visitors from  other provinces who came to seek cooperation opportunities.</p>

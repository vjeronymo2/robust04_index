			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN WOULD LOWER WATER BILLS OF POOR  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council approved a motion Tuesday that will reduce the  water bills of about 40,000 low-income residents.  </P> <P> The reduction, which would apply only to customers of the city's water lifeline  program, is meant to offset a 27% increase in sewer service fees scheduled to  go into effect next month.  </P> <P> The amount not paid by customers with reduced rates will be subsidized by other  customers, who will be charged about 7 cents more a month, said officials. The  measure, initially proposed by Councilwoman Gloria Molina, must now be approved  by the Board of Water and Power Commissioners.  </P> <P> Although the water lifeline program, like several other special rate plans, is  currently only offered to the elderly and disabled, the council instructed the  chief administrative officer to study the possibility of such reductions being  expanded to include all the city's low-income residents.  </P></p>

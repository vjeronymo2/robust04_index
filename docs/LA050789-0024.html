			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHERE'S GETTY?  </P> <P> I wish to protest the fiction, which the Los Angeles Times connives at, that  the J. Paul Getty Museum is in Malibu. It is in Pacific Palisades, and  therefore in the city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In the interests of truth and accuracy, to which I believe the Times is  committed, I ask that this erroneous designation be rejected in the future.  </P> <P> H. A. KELLY  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P> <P>  Lori Starr, head of public information for the Getty, says the museum has a  Malibu address because several hundred feet of the property facing the ocean is  in Malibu. The much larger portion of the acreage is in the Pacific Palisades  area of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P></p>

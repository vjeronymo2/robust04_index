			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: DC Gardner warns of second-half downturn DC GARDNER Group, the personnel training company, issued a profits warning yesterday, replaced its chief executive, Mr Barry Topple, after less than a year and appointed Sir Kit McMahon, former chairman of Midland Bank, as non-executive chairman. The group, which has undergone a substantial restructuring in the past 18 months, said the results for the second half of 1992 would be 'less than current market expectations,' and 'well below' the Pounds 930,000 pre-tax profit achieved in the six months ending June 30. 'At that stage the revival of business confidence following the General Election was expected to continue but in the event confidence subsided,' said a trading statement issued by the board. As foreshadowed at the time of the interim results, the UK market for the group's training and publications division has been 'very difficult' in the second half and the division's results have been adversely affected by the continuing recession. However the group's outplacement division continues to perform well and while profits for the second half will be less than those for the first, the board expects another record result for the year, helped by overseas expansion. The company said the performance of its residential conference centres, 'has been satisfactory and the division should finish the year strongly with its best ever quarterly results.' The latest boardroom changes follow a string of other appointments and departures culminating in the resignation last month of Lord Walker of Worcester, the former Welsh Secretary. Sir Kit succeeds Mr Stephen Johnson, as chairman. Mr Johnson, a former chairman of Coutts Consultants, the group's outplacement subsidiary, is taking over as chief executive. See Observer</p>

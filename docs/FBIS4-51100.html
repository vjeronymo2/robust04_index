			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Wei (1728 5633): "Summon Up Our Courage, </F> Fortify Our Confidence, Check the Slide, and Halt Deficits"]    [Excerpts] On the morning of 9 May, the provincial meeting  on halting deficits and increasing profits was held at Liaoning  People's Theater in Shenyang. The meeting summarized the 1993  work in halting deficits and increasing profits, analyzed the  present situation in industry, and called for efforts to  mobilize all the people in the province to summon up their  courage, seek unity of thinking, fortify their confidence, and  try every possible means to check the slowdown in the tempo of  production and the increase in deficits among the state-owned  industrial enterprises of the province.    At the meeting, Xu De, secretary general of the provincial  government read out the provincial government's decision on  commending the localities and enterprises who were exceptional  in halting deficits and increasing profits and on criticizing  the four enterprises that each incurred over 10 million yuan in  deficits. Cong Zhenglong, vice governor of the province,  attended the meeting and gave a speech. At the meeting, mayors  of various cities signed certificates of responsibility for  halting deficits.    In 1993, the province achieved some results in halting  deficits and increasing profits, and the industrial economy  maintained a trend of relatively rapid progress. According to  the statistics compiled among the province's budgetary  state-owned industrial enterprises, last year, 464 enterprises  in the province were operated at a loss, accounting for 26.04  percent of the total, 5.26 percentage points lower than that in  1992, if calculated in terms of the comparable standards not  covered by the general rule on financial affairs of enterprises  and the standards for enterprise accounting. Meanwhile, the  volume of deficits of such enterprises was 800 million yuan, 250  million yuan fewer than the deficits incurred in 1992, with the  margin of decrease in deficits reaching 23.52 percent. As a  result, the province fulfilled the task of decreasing the range  of deficits by 5 percent and the volume of deficits by 15  percent, that was assigned to the province by the state at the  beginning of 1993.    Since the beginning of 1994, the province's industrial  economy has kept on the trend of relatively rapid progress. By  the end of April, the province as a whole realized 99.666  billion yuan in the gross value of industrial output, an  increase of 31.2 percent over the same period last year, and  realized 57.533 billion yuan in sales value, an increase of 9.4  percent. However, during this period, the province's  state-owned industrial enterprises fell into an extremely grim  situation, showing signs of slow growth, poor efficiency,  increasingly serious deficits, and a soaring range and volume of  deficits. According to the statistics complied in the first  quarter among the province's budgetary state-owned industrial  enterprises, 1,123 enterprises were operating at a loss, 271  more than the figure at the same period last year; the range of  deficits was as high as 67.57 percent, 17.13 percentage points  higher than the same period last year; and the volume of  deficits was 903 million yuan, 524 million yuan more than the  deficits incurred at the same period last year, with the margin  of increased deficits reaching 138 percent. At the same time,  all of the 14 cities in the province and all of the 10 trades  that are under key examination experienced increases in deficits  at varying degrees and 25 enterprises incurred over 5 million  yuan in deficits each, 17 more than the figure of the same  period, last year.    Vice Governor Cong Zhenglong said in his speech: At present,  the deficits incurred by state-owned industrial enterprises has  become the most conspicuous problem hampering economic  development and affecting the social stability of the province.  All localities, all departments, and all enterprises must list  the work of halting deficits and increasing profits as a major  item on their daily agenda and must adopt effective measures and  try every possible means to halt deficits and increase profits.  In line with the guidelines of the executive meeting of the  provincial government, Cong Zhenglong set the following demands  on how to halt deficits and increase profits.    We should summon up our courage, seek unity of thinking, and  take a more urgent attitude in halting deficits and increasing  profits. The second quarter of this year is the key period of  halting deficits and increasing profits. Whether we can reduce  the range of deficits to 50 percent or lower in the second  quarter of this year is critical to fulfilling the target of  reducing the annual range of deficits by 5 percentage points and  reducing the annual volume of deficits by 10 percent. [passage  omitted]    We should energetically push forward the reform of property  right system and operational methods of enterprises and  accelerate the change of operational mechanism of the  enterprises operating at a lose. [passage omitted]    We should strengthen the system of assuming responsibility  for attaining the target of halting deficits and increasing  profits and establish a system under which each level assumes  responsibility for the work of the next lower level. [passage  omitted]    We should further strengthen leadership over the work of  halting deficits and increasing profits and better construct  leading bodies for enterprises operating at a loss. [passage  omitted]    In conclusion, Cong Zhenglong stressed that this year's  endeavor of halting deficits and increasing profits should be  focused on Shenyang, Dandong, Jinzhou, Fuxin, and Tieling whose  range of deficits has been higher than the average provincial  level by 10 percentage points and whose volume of deficits has  surpassed 180 million yuan each; on enterprises of the textile,  light, chemical industries whose range of deficits exceeds the  the province's average level and whose volume of deficits  surpasses 200 million yuan each; and on enterprises that have  incurred more than 5 million yuan each.

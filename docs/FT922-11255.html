			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / UK Company News: China Light advances 13% to HKDollars 1.55bn CHINA Light and Power, the Hong Kong utility controlled by the Kadoorie family, announced HKDollars 1.55bn (USDollars 200m) profits after tax and transfers under the Government Scheme of Control for the six months ended March 1992. This represented a 13 per cent increase from the HKDollars 1.37bn in 1991 and was broadly in line with market expectations. CLP said that present indications suggested a slow down in the growth of earnings for the full year. Turnover increased 14.4 per cent to HKDollars 5.6bn from HKDollars 4.9bn while profit after tax but before scheme of control transfers increased 38 per cent to HKDollars 1.28bn. The directors declared a second interim dividend, representing a half year pay-out of 44 cents. This was 22 per cent higher than 1991.</p>

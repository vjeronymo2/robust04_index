			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Privatisation Agenda Speeded Up"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 4 -- The daunting privatisation  task facing the next government was given a boost by the  out-going executive which approved a law decree speeding up the  process for three placements due in the near future.    In one of the final cabinet meetings of the government led  by  Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the sell-off of the insurance group INA  [National Insurance Institute] was helped along by including  Uniorias, controlled to the tune of 40 percent by INA, part of  the deal.    The road was smoothed for the formation of a `Superagip'  comprising the core industries of the ENI-owned [National  Hydrocarbons Corporation] petrol giant, while some of the tax  burden incurred by off-loading publicly owned properties was  removed from government shoulders in the new version of the law  decree.    The executive to emerge from on-going government-formation  talks will have to deal with a host of privatisations, extending  from insurance to radars, and from shipbuilding to supermarkets.    The approximate timetable for the placements is as follows:    Steel (expected privatisation date: May-June): The ailing  steel-making giant Ilva has been put into liquidation, and its  component parts have been split up into Ilva Laminati Piani  (Ilva steel sheet), Acciai Speciali Terni (Terni special  steels), and Dalmine, all of which are up for sale. For the  first two companies, the sale is in its final stages, while the  third, which is already quoted on the stock market, will be sold  off without mediation. Proceeds from the sale will go to IRI  [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction].    INA (expected privatisation date: by June): INA's board of  directors has already given its green light to a public  placement, with the sole shareholder, the Treasury, still to  decide what percentage of its 100 percent holding it will put up  for sale. All indications suggest that the state holding will  go below 50 percent, with INA policy holders given preferential  treatment. Also involved in the sale will be Uniorias, an  insurance company in which INA has a 40 percent stake. Proceeds  from the sale will go to the state.    GS-Autogrill (expected privatisation date: by the summer): A  first attempt to auction off this motorway refreshment and  supermarket chain brought no bids of sufficient weight, so the  race is now on for a second time. Proceeds from the sale will  go to IRI.    STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company] (expected  privatisation date: end of summer): In what Italians have dubbed  "the mother of all privatisations," the telecommunications  holding company STET will be sold off with a percentage of  shares being floated on the open market, with the rest remaining  in the hands of one or more larger shareholders. Proceeds from  the sale will go to IRI.    ENEL [National Electric Power Board] (expected privatisation  date: end of 1994): The privatisation of the electricity board  is being hampered by disagreement over such thorny issues as  length of the exclusive concession and the creation of a  price-setting authority. The government's intention to hand out  a 99 year concession has drawn fire from the antitrust committee  and from the private employers' association CONFINDUSTRIA  [General Confederation of Italian Industry], which have  complained that it is too long. Proceeds from the sale will go  to the state.    Superagip (expected privatisation date: 1994-5): All of the  energy interests of the ENI fuels conglomerate will be merged to  form a super-holding which will then be sold off in a  privatisation process which is still in its initial stages. The  law decree approved recently made the merger process easier,  lifting some tax burdens on the new-look company. Proceeds from  this sale will go to ENI.  <H5>  State Property </H5>   The sale of state-owned real estate will be overseen by  Immobiliare Italia, a company set up specifically for this  purpose. The process of selling it off, however, has run out of  puff after an initial push ran into disagreement over what could  and could not be sold. Proceeds from sales will go to the state.    Alongside these privatisations, the new government will have  to deal with numerous other sales of parts of conglomerates and,  possibly, of services such as public transport and the railways  which to date have not come up for sale to the public.    Finmeccanica, IRI's technological wing, could go private in  a  flotation underwritten by those banks which are owed money by  the defunct EFIM [Manufacturing Industry Holding and Financial  Company] holding, the defence sector companies of which have now  passed over to Finmeccanica.    The flagcarrier airline Alitalia, now under new management,  is said to be seeking a partner to enter into its share capital,  while the Aeroporti di Roma handlers, also owned by IRI, has  already given signs that it is intending to seek permission to  begin privatising in the not-too-distant future.    IRI's motorway building and maintenance wing Autostrade may  be floated completely, while the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro now  has a governor, Mario Sarcinelli, who makes no bones about  privatisation being one of his top priorities.    Still in the banking sector, the 27 percent of the IMI  [Italian Institute for Financing Personal and Real Property]  merchant bank which remains in state hands after the recent  extremely successful placement may go under the auctioneer's  hammer.    RAI, the public broadcasting company, is also a possible  contender for privatisation, with IRI already having said that  it would be willing to hand control of the company over to the  Treasury, usually a first step down the privatisation road.</p>

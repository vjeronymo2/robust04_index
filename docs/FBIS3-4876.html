It is irritating to see the government act  slowly.    After the Japan-U.S. framework trade negotiations and talks  between Prime Minister Hosokawa and U.S. President Clinton broke  down, there have been fears about the future of Japan-U.S.  relations, calls for early resumption of the trade talks and  proposals to lessen the friction between the two countries.    While there has been sharp criticism of each other, Japan  and  the United States agree on the basic principle that bilateral  relations must not be damaged.    Therefore, swift action by Japan is the key to breaking the  deadlock.    Hosokawa must have had a plan ready when he said "no" to the  U.S. Government's demands. How is Japan going to change and  become a more open nation? We would like to hear Hosokawa's  specific plan as soon as possible.    At the same time, Japan must keep up a constant dialogue  with  the United States not only at a government level but also at the  private sector level.    During an upcoming meeting of finance ministers and central  bank heads from the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations  in Germany, a finance ministerial meeting between Japan and the  United States is also expected to be held. We urge Finance  Minister Fujii to make sure that the United States will  correctly understand Japan's measures for boosting domestic  demand, including the implementation of a tax cut far ahead of a  tax increase.    In the first half of March, U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher is scheduled to visit Japan. Since the U.S.  Congress supports the Clinton administration's negotiating  stance toward Japan -- including the submission of a bill  demanding that Japan open its markets or face sanctions --  Christopher will likely come to Japan with some very strong  words.    But the Japanese government should not map out a package of  market-opening measures because of such pressure from the United  States. It should do so on its own and announce it to the  world. Under the circumstances, Hosokawa is now required to make  a political decision.    For help on his decision, the prime minister can look to  Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate  Executives [Keizai Doyukai], who has proposed that a goal be  voluntarily set for reduction of Japan's current account  surplus, that tariffs on manufactured products be reduced to  nearly zero, and that foreigners' direct investment in Japan be  completely liberalized. Such market-opening measures, which are  easy to understand, are worth considering.    However, while Japan's bureaucrats are certain to oppose all  of these measures, we are tired of listening to explanations  emphasizing only what cannot be done, instead of what can be  done. There will be no way out from this impasse unless a new  way of thinking is instituted.    Japan can increase its imports much more if it uses the  strength of the high yen. It can also reduce the current  account surplus.    According to a survey conducted by the Management and  Coordination Agency and released on 24 February, there are quite  a few factors within the administration to arrest the growth of  imports.    There are still many unnecessary restrictions on importers,  and the import promotion tax system has not been fully utilized.  In addition, about 70 percent of importers surveyed did not  know there was an Office of Trade and Investment Ombudsman (OTO)  that had been set up within the government to deal with  complaints about problems related to opening Japan's markets.    The survey also showed that nearly 40 percent of the  importers failed to bring up complaints, even though they had  some. One reason was that they were afraid that if they made a  complaint against a government office, their relations with the  office would suffer. If such a climate is not changed, no  revisions of a system and no calls to increase imports will  prove effective.    We urge that relevant government offices thoroughly examine  what is going on and improve the situation quickly. We also  would like to see private companies gather enough courage to  cooperate in implementing a reform to promote imports.</p>

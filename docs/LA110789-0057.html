			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> NEW SIGN-CODE RULES WILL BE CONSIDERED  </P> <P> The City Council will consider four amendments to the city's sign codes for  commercial businesses tonight in an attempt to keep up with rapid development  in the city, officials said.  </P> <P> The proposed amendments would "provide ample advertising for businesses but  avoid too much clutter," City Manager Frank Benest said.  </P> <P> "The new code will establish the various sizes of signs depending on the amount  of street frontage available," senior planner Pat Shoemaker said. Signs will be  limited according to the size of the businesses.  </P> <P> Although the codes will "provide for some flexibility," they will also require  developers and businesses to submit proposals to the city before erecting  anything, Shoemaker said.  </P> <P> The amendments, which address commercial and industrial developments, were  passed unanimously by the Planning Commission in September.JENNIFER MOULTON  </P></p>

In Churkin's opinion, it is precisely due to the use  of this term that various misunderstandings have resulted and a  negative reaction has come from some former USSR union republic  capitals. In Churkin's opinion, the Baltic countries can in no  way be included in the near abroad because those countries left  the USSR even before it disintegrated and are not likely to seek  CIS membership.    At the same time, Churkin emphasized that the term near  abroad should not be interpreted as a threat against the  sovereignty of any state because Russia, the CIS, and the Baltic  countries were united into a country for years; consequently,  they also have many problems in common, including the issue of  the Russian-speaking population, said Churkin.    A meeting of representatives of Russian communities living  in  the near abroad took place in Moscow, with nearly 70 people  attending. All those present found that there are human rights  violations taking place in Latvia and Estonia, a fact that lifts  international legal acts above the national ones. As a  consequence, the Russian-speaking population has become  stateless in those countries. [passage omitted]</p>

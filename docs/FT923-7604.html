			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: Delta Air pilots add conditions to pay deal PILOTS at Delta Air Lines, one of three US 'mega-carriers', have refused to make wage concessions until they have reviewed the company's finances - a process which could take some months, agencies report. Delta, which took over Pan Am's transatlantic routes last year in a key expansion move, has recently been making heavy losses. Having reported a Dollars 506.3m loss after tax in the year to end-June, the airline announced plans last month for a 5 per cent staffing cut, greater use of contract services, more seasonal flights and other cost-cutting measures. The airline is understood to have asked its pilots - the only group of its employees who are unionised - to delay a 5 per cent wage increase due to take effect in September. In a recent letter to pilots, the company described the recent 'fare wars' in the airline industry as an 'economic bloodbath' which could threaten the company's future. Traditionally, Delta has been viewed as one of the more benevolent airline employers, and its last pilots' contracts made Delta pilots the best paid in the US. The pilots, however, have already agreed to extend that contract, originally due to expire in August 1993, to allow the carrier to digest the Pan Am assets. Trans World Airlines has reached an agreement in principle with the 6,000-strong Independent Federation of Flight Attendants under which the union would acquire a 45 per cent equity stake in the carrier. TWA said the deal contemplated the workers giving 15 per cent wage, benefit and work rule concessions in exchange for the equity. The airline said the flight attendants' union was the first of its three unions to agree to the deal. It said the deal remained subject to certain conditions, including bankruptcy court approval and execution of agreements with the carrier's other unions.</p>

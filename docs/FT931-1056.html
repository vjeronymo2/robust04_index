			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / World Trade News: China takes on the world shipping market - A new-found freedom from state controls will allow more commercial flexibility CHINA's merchant navy may still be some way from ruling the waves commercially, but the recent 'corporatisation' of the China Ocean Shipping company seems certain to lead to a more aggressive Chinese presence in world shipping. Mr Zhang Da Chun, executive vice-president of the newly-constituted China Ocean Shipping Companies Group, said in an interview that the freeing of Cosco from state control would allow it more flexibility to pursue its core shipping interests and develop activities in banking, finance, insurance and real estate. A priority was to expand and modernise Cosco's fleet to include the new generation of container ships, and add a number of smaller dry-cargo vessels. Some would be built in China, but Cosco would be guided by the market. 'If it is cheaper and better, we will buy abroad, but all things being equal, we will buy in China.' China, with 20m dwt, ranks ninth in total world merchant shipping tonnage, but fourth in container-ship capacity. Cosco, dwarfing China's 200-or-so shipping companies combined, has over 600 vessels on its register, or some 15m dwt, and is the world's largest shipping conglomerate. Mr Zhang said the freeing of Cosco from direct central bureaucratic control represented an enormous chance for the shipping concern. 'We will now have much more power in our own hands. Before, if we wanted to buy ships, we were obliged to win the permission not only of the ministry of communications, but also the state planning commission.' Cosco, with 60,000 employees, will have some 80 companies under its umbrella at home and abroad, whose activities range from providing bunkering facilities at China's ports to the country's largest road transport company. Its plans to extend the range of its business activities include establishing a bank and trading corporation, along with redevelopment of some of its valuable real estate which includes hotels in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao. It is also investing in container Port No. 8 in Hong Kong, and is planning to develop its own container terminals in the British colony and elsewhere. Other avenues for expansion include an extension of its bunkering operations, ship repair and maintenance facilities, and agency business. Mr Zhang indicated Cosco was interested in foreign acquisitions. 'Maybe in the future we will buy into foreign shipping lines. We are also planning closer co-operation with other shippers to try to ensure market stability.' Cosco was seeking to increase the scope and range of its activities, he added, partly because of difficulties in the financially 'risky' shipping business, including relatively low returns on investment of around 3-5 per cent. Business was especially tough in China these days, because of big increases in stevedoring and other costs. Mr Zhang firmly rejected complaints by international shipping companies that China was a difficult market to break into. Foreign shippers complain about restrictions on cargoes that might be carried in non-Chinese bottoms, and also about difficulties posed by bureaucratic interference at Chinese ports. Last year, Mr Zhang said, some 200m tons of imports and exports were cleared through China's ports, of which Cosco shifted 50-60m tons. But he also observed that the volume would be much greater if capacity was increased. This in turn would depend to an extent on foreign investors such as Hong Kong tycoons who were starting to play a more active role in China's port development. Mr Zhang was vague about Cosco's expansion financing plans, but he indicated that the company was considering a bond issue and was also talking about seeking a listing on the Shenzen or Shanghai exchanges to raise additional capital. He described the present level of borrowing as 'manageable' without providing details.</p>

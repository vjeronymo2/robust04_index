			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Multimedia Cardiff is rarely mentioned in the same breath as Hollywood, but last week both towns were offered a glimpse of the multimedia future. The trouble is that no one knows if it will work. Viacom, which conquered Paramount with a Dollars 9.7bn bid, now has to prove that its industrial vision makes financial sense. By contrast, TCI's decision to take a 20 per cent stake in the Welsh ITV contractor, HTV, involves an outlay of just Pounds 27m. The deal may come to be seen as marking a symbolic shift in power from Channel 3 to cable and satellite television. Similar deals are almost certain to follow, which makes Granada's tilt at LWT appear almost parochial. HTV argues that advertising growth prospects for Channel 3 franchises will be limited by the proliferation of rival television networks. Alternative revenue streams are therefore essential. The link-up with a cable operator, such as TCI, gives it an effective way of recycling its existing programmes and an alternative channel for new productions. Cable television operators foresee all kinds of possibilities for broadening their services, with telephony and interactive home shopping just the start. In such a thrilling world, it seems almost impertinent to observe that few cable operators have yet made money. Some critics argue that they never will. The delivery of television programmes may simply become a commodity service. Television may follow the trend in computers, where power has slipped from the hardware to software suppliers. The value attached to programme makers is likely to grow significantly with the demand for programming hours forecast to triple by the end of the decade.</p>

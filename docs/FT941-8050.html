			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Islamic state waits in Algeria's bloody wings: A look at a nation contemptuous of the old and distrustful of the new Never has the holy month of Ramadan meant such misery for millions of Algerians. They do not have to wait for the agreement being negotiated with the International Monetary Fund - which is bound to include a hefty devaluation of the dinar - to appreciate the extent to which the government has lost control of the economy. The price of onions has nearly trebled since December, that of coffee has doubled and of cooking oil has increased by more than half. On the black market, lentils cost three times more than in state shops, while sugar costs 50 per cent more. Meanwhile the confrontation between the security forces and armed Islamic groups is claiming at least 100 dead every week. The death of a Russian civilian technician last Thursday and of a French shopkeeper yesterday brings the number of foreigners slain since last September to 30. Foreigners have withdrawn to the major coastal cities of Algiers, Oran and Annaba or, in the case of foreign oil companies, to the comparative safety of the southern desert. Although Ramadan has brought a little life and some cars into the streets of Algiers after dusk, most people lock themselves up at home as soon as the sun sets. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, sleep in a different apartment or house every night. The most radical group, the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), has threatened to kill women, intellectuals and civil servants who dare question the need to impose Islamic 'sharia' law. Earlier this month a GIA spokesman publicly stated for the first time that his movement would attack 'Jews, Christians and other non-believers because they support a colonialist plot. This will help the return of Islam as defined by the prophet Mohammed'. Last week the group stepped up pressure by threatening 17,000 tax collectors, arguing that under Islam, zakat is the only acceptable form of revenue collection. Tax revenues excluding the oil sector and customs duties were AD112bn (Pounds 3.2bn) last year, AD41bn of which came from direct taxation. In the Mitidja plain around Algiers local 'Islamic enclaves' flourish, where Algerian newspapers in French are banned, as is smoking. Many Algerians who two years ago applauded the army for suspending the second round of elections, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win, now appear resigned to the advent of an Islamic state. Many simply pray that violence will stop and that the increasingly savage acts of terrorism will be halted. The nervousness of many young soldiers manning roadblocks and policemen bear witness to the distress and confusion that the events of the past two years have brought to 26m Algerians. In his first speech as head of state, General Liamine Zeroual recently made clear his belief that security measures alone would not help Algeria out of a crisis which requires a total rethink of the economic, social and cultural policies adopted since independence. He acknowledged Algeria's aspirations for 'radical change'. General Zeroual is however faced with a dilemma. Many members and leaders of the now banned FIS movement appear willing to talk, but are increasingly outflanked by their more radical supporters, a number of whom are switching support to groups such as the GIA and the myriad other proponents of violence. Those Algerians who oppose an Islamic state are not united, but millions find it difficult to tolerate the same faces on television and in the newspapers that they have had to endure since independence in 1962. Their resentment at 32 years of single-party rule and the corruption of a state command economy is considerable. Yet senior officials continue to make public statements that few Algerians believe. Mr Baba Ahmed, the director of the treasury, said last week that negotiating with the IMF was a decision 'freely' taken by the government. Mr Mourad Benhachenhou, the minister of the economy, whose vitriolic attacks on the reforming government led by Mr Mouloud Hamrouche in 1989-91 have not been forgotten, said that the kind of medicine Algeria will accept from the IMF must be 'defined in such a way that it does not bring about any kind of social unrest'. For his part, Mr Redha Malek, the prime minister since August, who was confirmed in his post by the new head of state, insisted that terrorism has gone 'beyond the stage of barbarity and must be liquidated'. As Algerian ambassador to Washington, he played a key role in securing the release of the US diplomats held hostage in Tehran in 1981, but his language and manner cut little ice with the mass of his countrymen, two thirds of whom are under 30 years of age. The prime minister and other senior Algerian officials are pleased with the French government's 'clear policy' of support for Algeria. The prime minister insists that the time for declarations is finished. Referring to the desperate need to loosen the burden of Algeria's foreign debt payments, which this year will absorb all the country's oil and gas income, he added: 'We will now count our friends.' Most western capitals are worried and bewildered by the violence which is increasingly engulfing North Africa's largest country. Many believe dialogue with the radical Islamic groups is inevitable, and all know it will be difficult. Some even fear that it might prove impossible. The Algerian army, which holds centre stage, has tried and failed to convince respected members of the former Hamrouche government to take senior government posts. It knows that Algerians want to see new faces. It also knows that, were its ranks to split, disaster could ensue.</p>

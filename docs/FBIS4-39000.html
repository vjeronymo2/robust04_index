			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [SEGODNYA report under the "Special Services" rubric: "A </F> New Directorate Will Be Set Up in the FCS"]    [Text] A special operations directorate is likely to be  created in Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS].  FCS sources confirmed to INTERFAX 3 June that this possibility  was discussed in the course of Russian Federation President  Boris Yeltsin's visit to the counterintelligence service's  headquarters late in May. It is supposed that power structures  -- special units of the "Alfa" and "Vympel" groups type -- will  be set up under the special operations directorate.    Earlier both groups were part of the KGB structure before  they were transferred to the Main Directorate for the  President's Security, while some time ago "Vympel" was once  again reassigned, this time to the Russian Federation Ministry  of Internal Affairs. A number of officers of this special unit  refused to be transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs  and were taken on by the FCS. Mr. Yerin's agency is planning to  create a special union named "Vega" on the basis of what remains  of "Vympel." Let us remind you that the "A" group ("Alfa") was  created on Andropov's initiative to combat terrorism, whereas  "Vympel" is a former unit of the KGB's First Main Directorate  (Foreign Intelligence Service) designed to carry out "in-depth  intelligence activities" (intelligence-sabotage-terrorist  activities in the rear of the potential adversary).    Mr. Stepashin told a news briefing that in the FCS structure  there are several off-the-books "commando groups" [gruppy  zakhvata] within the major territorial directorates. According  to information from confidential sources, it is not ruled out  that the forming of the new directorate will be entrusted to  General Dmitriy Gerasimov, former commander of "Vympel."</p>

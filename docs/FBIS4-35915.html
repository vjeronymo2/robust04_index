			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ayman al-Safadi] </F>   [Text] Amman -- A draft law on youth welfare, which  requires the segregation of sexes at "sports centres, including  swimming pools," does not apply to hotels, public beaches or  clubs, lawmakers asserted Monday.    Deputies said the draft law, which was endorsed by the Lower  House of Parliament Saturday, only applies to commercial "sports  training centres" and was meant to regulate this mushrooming  industry which includes body building and martial arts training  centres.    Former Minister of Youth, Deputy Salih Irshaydat told the  JORDAN TIMES Monday that the draft legislation will not thus  "change anything on the ground since sports training centres  were built with the knowledge that they will be segregated."    "The youth welfare law has nothing to do with sports  activities at clubs, hotels and touristic sites because the  Ministry of Youth has no jurisdiction over these place," Dr.  Irshaydat said. Tney are governed by separate laws and  regulations, he said.    Islamic Action Front (IAF) Deputy 'Abd-al-Rahim al-'Ukur  agreed with Dr. Irshaydat, saying the Islamists were only  concerned with having training sports centres including swimming  pools segregated.    "People who coach swimming should be of the same sex but we  are not concerned with swimming pools at hotels and touristic  areas," Dr. al-'Ukur said.    "We are aware of coeducation at universities and we are not  trying to stop that or to segregate sexes at touristic sites,"  said Dr. al-'Ukur.    Echoing Dr. Irshaydat and Dr. al-'Ukur, Deputy 'Abdallah  al-Nusur, confirmed that it is not within the jurisdiction of  the Ministry of Youth to decide how hotels and touristic sites  operate.    The House Sunday voted down an amendment by the Upper House  of Parliament (the Senate) to delete the clause requiring the  segregation of sexes at sports training centres.    Thirty-seven out of 64 deputies present at a session of the  House Saturday voted in favour of maintaining the clause, which  was introduced to the draft law by the Muslim Brotherhood bloc  at the 11th Parliament in 1992.    Deputies said the Senate amendment was defeated because many  of the "liberal deputies" who would have supported it were  absent from the session. But they expected the clause to be  dropped when the two houses meet in a joint session no later  than two weeks to settle the issue.    The two Houses convene in a joint session when the Lower  House turns down amendments by the Senate and the Upper House  insists on its decision. Resolutions are taken by a two-third  majority of the two Houses and it "should not be difficult to  obtain this majority," 10 lawmakers said.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Business failures show 56% rise for 1991 MORE THAN 4,000 UK com-panies went into receivership last year, a rise of more than 50 per cent on 1990 but still only a small proportion of the companies in difficulty, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm. For every one company that went into receivership there were three or four others which faced financial difficulties and had been put on their banks' 'special watch' or 'intensive care' list, said Mr Tim Hayward, head of corporate recovery. If there is no market for a business or its assets, receivership leading to insolvency is a last resort which only leaves the bank with a bad debt. Well over half the companies helped by their bank survive, Mr Hayward said. In 1991 4,112 companies went into receivership, an increase of 56 per cent on 1990, according to Peats. In 1989 the number of receiverships was 1,187. Receiverships were spread fairly evenly last year with about 1,000 in each quarter. Peats expects at least as many receiverships this year as the international business scene becomes increasingly bleak. The prospects of a 'double dip' recession in the US and the sharp decline of the Japanese stock market make the outlook for UK exporters more difficult. Mr Hayward said he did not expect a marked recovery for at least another year. Even when it came it would lead to 'second-round failures' as business picked up and overwhelmed companies' financial resources. Failures by retailers accounted for 7.5 per cent of the total and are expected to increase after the new year sales end. But many businesses in this sector are small and will therefore appear as liquidations or bankruptcies and not as receiverships. Construction companies accounted for 16 per cent of receiverships last year and property companies for a further 6 per cent. As companies finish work on projects begun before the recession receiverships will rise because there is little prospect that they will be able to find new work. Manufacturing companies made up 29 per cent of 1991 receiverships and Peats foresees no improvement this year because of the poor outlook for exports. Hotels and catering accounted for 5 per cent of receiverships. This sector continues to suffer from a downturn in the corporate hospitality and conference trades but this year should be better than last when the Gulf war depressed demand still further. By region the south-east recorded the largest number of receiverships with 2,171 (1,354 in 1990) followed by the Midlands with 621 (327), the north-west with 390 (266) and the north-east with 346 (306).

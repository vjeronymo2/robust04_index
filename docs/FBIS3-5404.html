			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the  Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland  Sunday issued its information No. 645 denouncing the recent  sword-brandishing suppression of the just struggle of South  Korean people and students by the traitor Kim Yong-sam clique.    Recalling that the traitor Kim Yong-sam clique recently  cracked down on a demonstration of the participants in a rally  marking the 75th anniversary of the March 1st popular uprising  at the point of bayonet and is continuing to suppress the  righteous struggle of people of all walks of life for  independence, democracy and reunification including the struggle  against rice market opening, the information said:    Such suppression, which was committed at a time when the  traitor Kim Yong-sam issued an order to crack down on the right  struggle of the South Korean people, labelling it "illegal" and  "violent" one, is a clear proof that the South Korean puppets  are throwing away even the formal "civilian" veil, openly  resorting to the sword-brandishing fascist rule. The  suppression at the point of bayonet cannot save the Kim Yong-sam  group from the crisis of power.    As long as the traitor Kim Yong-sam as crafty as a fox  remains in power, independence and democracy can neither be  realized nor can existence itself be kept. The South Korean  people should rise up in the struggle to overthrow the Kim  Yong-sam group.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / (CORRECTED) The Property Market: Controversial cornerstone - The upwards-only rent review is a pillar of property investment. But it must be reformed Correction (published 11th June 1993) appended to this article. When Mr Robin Leigh Pemberton, the out-going governor of the Bank of England, recently remarked that 'upwards-only rent review clauses seem designed for a world which had the certainty of an upwards-only pattern of property values', he touched a raw nerve. It was 'an uninformed, impoverished statement that was greatly damaging to the industry', said Mr John Ritblat, chairman of British Land, the UK's fourth-largest property company by market capitalisation, at about Pounds 700m. But Mr Ritblat can no longer turn a blind eye to what is an increasingly controversial cornerstone of property investment: that the upwards-only rent review is in need of reform. The origins of the upward-only rent review clauses go back several decades. Until 40 years ago there were virtually no reviews built into leases. Originally leases were for 999 years or 99 years. These treble and double nines were later known as straight leases; that is, the same rent, often a peppercorn, was paid throughout the entire period. The fight for stepped increases was launched by property analyst George Bridge of the Legal and General. He was supported by the Coal Board Pension Fund whose property adviser was Aubrey Orchard-Lisle of Healey and Baker, the property consultants. Their campaign was prompted by the large number of sales and leasebacks on behalf of the big retailers of the day such as Montague Burton, Charles Clore, Hugh Fraser and Edward Erdman. These retailing tycoons raised large sums by selling the freeholds of their stores and leasing them back for 99 years; they then resold their 99-year leases but then renegotiated shorter leases. Such activity in retail properties fuelled the initial impetus of the property upsurge of the early 1960s. Retail shares on the stock exchange soared while the shares of property companies climbed to similar levels. The fact that institutions such as the Coal Board were losing out on the so-called straight leases incensed Mr Bridge. In the face of fierce opposition from the retailers, Mr Bridge insisted on stepped increases, first every 33 years, then every 21, l4, and seven years. Eric Young, head of the Coal Board's property department, remarked years later that: 'It may sound ridiculous to think that we were sweating to get reviews at 33 and 66 years, but in this way we made a start.' In fact, property investment companies went much further than the institutions, introducing what has come to be known as the five-year upwards-only rent review clause. This now notorious clause was designed not so much to come to terms with inflation but to evaluate the exact amount of rent to be paid on review, the evaluation being based upon 'comparables', that is current market rents. The increase in rental values dictated by the market could therefore be greater than the rate of inflation. In other words with more demand than supply and with, say, zero inflation, the rent review could still operate upwards. Moreover, if the upwards-only review clause had been inflation-linked as is customary on the continent and not upon 'comparables' (only new leases being subject to market forces), this would also have brought to an end the expensive renegotiations on 'comparables' every five years. This argument every five years over reviewing 'comparables' has been a curse of the property industry. So whereas the original institutional pioneers fought to seek redress against inflation, property owners, characteristically, went straight for market forces. They did well and continued to do so until the property crash of the 1970s. Market forces have since caused havoc and we are now enduring possibly the worst property slump for some six decades. Landlord power is much reduced; tenant power is strident, making exceptional demands and obtaining unprecedented concessions. Undue tenant power is poison to a well-regulated property investment market and, ominously, there are signs of long-term structural changes - break clauses, short-term leases, and, for the first time, upwards and downwards rent review clauses. The upwards-only rent review has become academic, at least for the foreseeable future. And with the relatively new phenomenon of over-renting - where the current rent is much more than the rent that would be agreed in the open market - growth prospects have declined so far that the income from a property investment often resembles that of a fixed-interest stock. Purchases and sales have become more like financial transactions than property deals. Many institutions and entrepreneurs must be wondering why they ever went into property. Institutions which were attracted to property investment for its long-term combination of rising income plus capital appreciation, are now wary of relying on what many believed to be inevitable rental increases. Their sums will need to be reworked on the basis that property investment, the hybrid between fixed interest and equities, is, in today's global markets, more attractive as a fixed-interest stock than as an equity. The upwards-only rent review, the reviled equity aspect of property investment, will prove to be of lesser importance than a higher initial yield; and the original aim to counter inflation may become the yardstick instead of 'comparables'. The governor of the bank of England may yet have the last laugh.

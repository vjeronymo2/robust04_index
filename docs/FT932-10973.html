			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Sale of BT shares poised for mid-July THE sale of the government's shares in BT is to take place in the middle of July. Ministers believe the regulatory issues posed by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into British Gas should not affect the BT sale. The MMC's report is due in July. A number of companies planning to go public have already brought forward their flotations in anticipation of the timing of the BT sale and others looking at a flotation may now consider going early. The government yesterday expanded its share shop scheme, established as part of the second tranche of BT shares sold in 1991. SG Warburg, the government's global co-ordinator, announced that more than 150 companies with around 10,000 outlets will act as share shops in the third sale of BT shares. Last time the government selected eight preferred retailers. The gap between the close of the retail offer and the book-building exercise and the start of dealing is to be less than one week. The marketing campaign will be launched on May 24 after publication of BT's full year results on May 13. The government is expected to sell most, if not all, of its 22 per cent BT stake - worth more than Pounds 5bn. Share shops, including the four big clearing banks, will be entitled to market their services under the branding of the share shops symbol, a bull and a bear, and to display the offer logo from the launch of the sale. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: 'We believe the share shop scheme will be a major step forward in helping share dealing services become more accessible to the public.' Small investors will be able to choose between registering with the government's share information office or registering with a share shop. Those registering with and applying through a share shop will receive greater preference in allocation if there is heavy demand for the shares. Warburg will be responsible for running the book-building exercise in every region of the world. Companies with impending floats include RJB Mining, the Nottinghamshire-based coal mining group, RPC Group, the rigid plastic packaging company, and Carpetright of London.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  articles and editorials from ROK vernacular newspapers published  on 14 February on the future of the North Korean nuclear issue  following the remarks made by a spokesman of the North Korean  Foreign Ministry on 12 February and ROK Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu's recent visit to the United States.    The moderate CHOSON ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a  1,200-word article by correspondent Pak Tu-sik from Washington  on the possibility of a new turn in the North Korean nuclear  issue.    Reviewing the contents point by point, the article analyzes  that the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's 12 February  comment implies another new turn in the North Korean nuclear  issue, which has been aggravated since a statement was issued by  a spokesman of North Korean Foreign Ministry on 31 January.    The article says that although it cannot be expected that  the  North Korean nuclear issue will be resolved through dialogue by  21 February, it notes: "it has been confirmed that North Korea  does want a breakthrough of the current situation which could  only result in UN Security Council's measures."    The article notes North Korea's sudden assertion that it  received "new facts" that the United States is willing to  continue dialogue and that the inspections of the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are purely for the continuity of  safeguards -- while the two conditions are not new at all -- are  to "accumulate pretexts for internal reporting procedures."    The article concludes that the behind-the-scenes  communications between the United States and North Korea in the  remainder of the week will be noteworthy.    The moderate CHOSON ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 an  800- word editorial on the follow-up measures on the nuclear  issue.    The editorial says "if it is inevitable to seek resolutions  in the frame of sanctions instead of negotiations, the  government should clearly convey to North Korea that the  sanctions are not threats but a reality, and should be prepared  to clearly interpret North Korea's response."    Therefore, the editorial urges that a communications channel  is established to quickly communicate our decision to the top  decision maker in North Korea in order to prevent a crisis  resulting from delayed communications.    If this does not work out, the editorial says crisis  management measures should be sought at this stage. The  editorial stresses that the most important thing at this stage  is to cautiously manage the domestic systems in the ROK and the  United States so that a prudent countermeasure to minimize the  crisis can be carried out with a national consensus of opinion.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO in Korean publishes on page 2 a  600-word article by correspondent Nam Chang-sun from Washington  entitled "Main Role and Supporting Role in Handling the North  Korean Nuclear Issue."    Noting that there had been frequent contacts between South  and North Korea a year ago for the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula, the article regrets that now the nuclear issue  has become an issue to be resolved between North Korea and the  United States or the IAEA.    The article analyzes that North Korea succeeded to exclude  South Korea from the issue because "it was aware of the effects  and limits of South Korea's carrots and sticks and disregarded  them."    The article says Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's hasty visit  to the United States to pull back the Clinton Administration  from rushing into a hard-line position and to "confirm" that the  U.S. policy on the North Korean nuclear issue was the same as  ours, vividly shows the ROK's supporting role.    The article asserts that we should seek a way to play the  main role in the North Korean nuclear issue because it is  directly linked with our destiny.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3  a 1,400-word article by correspondent Yi Sung-chol from  Washington analyzing the possibility of a breakthrough in the  North Korean nuclear issue.    The article notes that the comment made by a spokesman of  North Korean Foreign Ministry was announced on the same day  NODONG SINMUN carried a hard-line commentary that any sanctions  will be regarded as a proclamation of war, and quotes an ROK  Government official as saying: "the NODONG SINMUN commentary  and Foreign Ministry spokesman's comment can be analyzed as a  fake operation."    The article reports North Korea seemed to have put  considerable emphasis on the Foreign Ministry spokesman's  comment because it even distributed copies of the contents to  ROK and Western correspondents in the United States.    The article analyzes that "such a move of change resulted  from the North Korean leaders' crisis awareness" as well as "the  ROK Foreign Minister's efforts during his recent visit to the  United States to create an atmosphere for North Korea's change."    The article worries that optimism can be destroyed at any  moment if the real emphasis was on the NODONG SINMUN commentary  and the other comment was a harassing tactic noting that no  changes were seen in North Korea's contact with the United  States in New York or with the IAEA in Vienna.    The article reports the ROK and U.S. Governments are  establishing phased countermeasures while analyzing North  Korea's real intent.</p>

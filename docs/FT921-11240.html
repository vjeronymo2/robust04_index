			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Motoring: A lower-profile launch for BMW's new coupe This is BMW's new 3-Series coupe, which goes on sale in Germany later this month and reaches Britain in April. There will be three versions; a four-cylinder 318i and straight-six 320i and 325i (pictured). All engines have four valves per cylinder and develop 140, 150 and 192 horsepower respectively. The coupes look (but, in fact, are not) longer than the saloons because they are slightly lower and wider. Power-operated windows are programmed to open a crack automatically to make the wide doors easier to close. Both front seats are height-adjustable and the rear seat back-rests fold flat to extend the boot so that long items can be stowed inside.</p>

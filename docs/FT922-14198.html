			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / FT Law Report: Bank fraud issue can be tried OWENS BANK LTD v BRACCO AND ANOTHER House of Lords (Lord Griffiths, Lord Bridge of Harwich, Lord Ackner, Lord Goff of Chieveley and Lord Browne-Wilkinson): April 1 1992 DEFENCE allegations that a Commonwealth judgment was obtained by fraud can be tried in English proceedings to register the judgment, irrespective of whether or not there is fresh evidence to establish fraud. The House of Lords so held when dismissing an appeal by the plaintiff, Owens Bank Ltd, from a Court of Appeal decision that an issue be tried as to whether a judgment obtained by the bank in St Vincent and the Grenadines against the defendants, Mr Fulvio Bracco and Bracco Industria Chimica SpA, had been obtained by fraud. Questions on an issue relating to the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 had been referred to the European Court. LORD BRIDGE said that the bank had applied to register a judgment of the St Vincent High Court against Mr Bracco and Bracco Industria for more than 10m Swiss francs. After initial registration Bracco applied for an issue to be tried under section 9(2)(d) of the Administration of Justice Act 1920 as to whether the St Vincent judgment had been obtained by fraud Sir Peter Pain gave judgment in favour of Bracco. The bank's appeal was dismissed. The bank's claim in the St Vincent action was that on January 31 1979 Mr Armando Nano, the bank's managing director acting on its behalf, lent Bracco Industria SFr9m. The bank said the loan was acknowledged on documents signed by Mr Bracco, which gave the St Vincent court jurisdiction in the event of dispute. Mr Bracco denied the transaction, asserting that no loan had been agreed, no cash had been handed over, and that the loan documents were forgeries. In the St Vincent court after the bank's case was closed, Bracco sought to set up a new defence that the signatures on the loan documents were genuine but had originally appeared in the wide margins of a different contract; that the margins had been cut off; and that Mr Nano or someone on his behalf had typed in the rest of the document. The court did not permit Bracco to set up that defence at such a late stage, and gave judgment for the bank. An appeal was dismissed. Before, during and after the St Vincent proceedings, criminal and civil proceedings were commenced in Italy in which the issue of fraud had been raised. Mr Nano and a co-defendant had been convicted of certain charges and the loan documents were held to be forgeries. Section 9 of the 1920 Act provided that, where judgment had been obtained in the Dominions, the judgment creditor might apply to the High Court within 12 months to have it registered. Subsection (2)(d) provided that no judgment should be registered 'if . . . the judgment was obtained by fraud'. The bank submitted that section 9(2)(d) must be construed as qualified by the Common Law rule that an unsuccessful party could not challenge a judgment on the ground that it was obtained by fraud, unless he could prove the fraud by fresh evidence which was not available to him and could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence before judgment was delivered. Here, it was said, there was no such fresh evidence. That was the rule to be applied in an action to set aside an English judgment on the ground that it was obtained by fraud. The question was whether a defendant seeking to resist enforcement of a foreign judgment, either by Common Law action or statutory machinery, was in the same position as a plaintiff seeking to set aside an English judgment on the ground that it was obtained by fraud, and could therefore only rely on evidence which satisfied the English rule. A foreign judgment given by a court of competent jurisdiction was treated by the Common Law as imposing a legal obligation on the judgment debtor, which was enforceable by an English court in an action in which the defendant would not be permitted to reopen issues of fact or law decided against him by the foreign court. In Abouloff v Oppenheimer (1882) 10 QBD 295 Lord Coleridge CJ said: 'It is a principle of law that no action can be maintained on the judgment of a court either in this country or in any other, which has been obtained by fraud.' Lord Justice Brett said: 'The defendants will not be barred at the trial of this action from making the same charge of fraud and from adducing the same evidence in support of it.' In Vadala v Lawes (1890) 25 QBD 310 Lord Justice Lindley said what the judgments in Abouloff amounted to was that, 'if the fraud upon the foreign court consists in the fact that the plaintiff has induced that court by fraud to come to a wrong conclusion, you can reopen the whole case even although you will have in this court to go into the very facts which were investigated, and which were in issue in the foreign court'. Those decisions had been criticised by academic writers and had not been followed in the Canadian courts. If the issue were governed only by Common Law, it would have been necessary to examine in detail the authorities prior to Abouloff. But that was not the position. Enforcement in the UK of Commonwealth judgments was governed by section 9 of the 1920 Act. Enforcement of judgments in countries with which the UK had concluded reciprocal enforcement arrangements was governed by the foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933. It provided by section 4(1)(a)(iv) that registration was to be set aside if the registering court was satisfied 'that the judgment was obtained by fraud'. The 1920 Act was preceded by a report in 1919 of a committee chaired by Lord Sumner on 'the Conduct of Legal Proceedings between Parties in this Country and Parties Abroad and the Enforcement of Judgments and Awards'. The report commented adversely on adoption of a principle of strict reciprocity giving all judgments within the Empire equal status and currency in all parts of the Empire. The committee accepted the criticism and recommended a much more cautious approach. That caution led to recommendations which were directly implemented by section 9(1) and (2)(a)-(e) of the 1920 Act. Even without reference to the Sumner Report, section 9(2)(d) would have to be construed with reference to the Common Law as understood in 1920. But the context in which the recommendations came to be embodied in section 9(2) left no room for doubt. Having rejected the strict reciprocity principle, the committee's recommendation, that fraud should be one of the express bars to enforcement of a Commonwealth judgment, could only have been intended to apply the much wider rule applied in Abouloff and Vadala. Section 9(2)(d) must be construed accordingly. An English judgment was final and conclusive as to the issues decided. It was to preserve that finality that any attempt to reopen litigation, even on the ground of fraud, had to be confined within very restrictive limits. In Abouloff and Vadala the Common Law declined to accord the same finality to foreign judgments, but preferred to give primacy to the principle that fraud unravelled everything. Section 9(2)(d) of the 1920 Act, construed as it must be, as an adoption of the Common Law approach to foreign judgments, specifically denied finality to the judgment if it could be shown to have been obtained by fraud. There might be a strong case in the 1990s in favour of according overseas judgments the same finality as English judgments. But enforcement of overseas judgments was now primarily governed by the 1920 and 1933 Acts. The whole field was effectively governed by statute and if the law was now in need of reform it was for the legislature, not the judiciary, to effect it. For the bank: Martin Mann QC and Michael Gadd (Jaques &amp; Lewis). For Bracco: Barbara Dohmann QC and Thomas Beazley (Clifford Chance).</p>

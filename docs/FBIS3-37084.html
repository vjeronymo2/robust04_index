			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 14, BNS -- The Russian Embassy in  Estonia issued a statement taxing Estonian politicians and mass  media with interpreting a recent statement by Russian Foreign  Ministry official Mikhail Demurin in an "uncivilized manner."  Demurin, speaking about a program "to protect ethnic Russians  in the CIS countries and the Baltic states," noted that  "diplomatic means are not sufficient to resolve the problem."    Estonia's reaction to Demurin's statement was sharp:  Estonian ambassador to Moscow was instructed to present a  demarche and President Lennart Meri asked Russian ambassador in  Tallinn for explanations.    The Russian embassy in Tallinn disseminated the full text of  Demurin's address. It reads as follows: "The program is being  drafted because, in our opinion, solely diplomatic means are  insufficient to solve the problem of Russians in the territory  of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Baltic states.  The work on a program to protect the interests of and to  support ethnic Russians began over a year ago. It concerns  measures such as special tele- and broadcasts, humanitarian aid  to the needy, support for Russian businessmen, customs and other  preferences, support for enterprises that mostly employ  Russians, cooperation between banks, etc."    "It is perplexing that some Estonian mass media and  politicians should take one phrase out of context and interpret  it as another threat," the statement of the Russian Embassy says.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, June 17 (XINHUA) -- An Indian  businessmen team organized by the Confederation of Indian  Industries (CII) is leaving tomorrow for China to look for  business and cooperation opportunities.    This was announced by CII President Subodh Bhargava today at  the luncheon hosted by CII in honour of visiting Chinese  Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Trade Wu Yi.    The CII mission will visit several places in China during  the  period from June 20 to June 24, Bhargava said.    "The main objective of the mission is to look at the  possibilities of developing trade, business and investment  cooperation between the two countries," the CII president said.    He expressed the hope that the CII will send another team to  China later in the year and to meet the industrialists in the  interior provinces of China.    Bhargava said that he was very happy at the considerable  improvement of bilateral trade between India and China last year.    "With economic and trade liberalization in India and China  opening its market to the world and also to each other, CII will  play an effective and catalytic role enabling members of Indian  and Chinese industry to take the advantages of the open-door  policy of the two governments," he said.    The CII president noted that Chinese overseas trade is of  the  order of nearly 200 billion U.S. dollars per year while the  India- China trade stood at less than 700 million U.S. dollars  last year.    "Both have a developing economy and therefore the potential  for mutual beneficial business can well understood by any  businessmen," he said.</p>

			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Observer: Passing the banking buck Every one knows that Olympia &amp; York's Reichmann brothers, Heron's Gerald Ronson, and Speyhawk's Trevor Osborne are in deep trouble because they borrowed too much money. They stand to lose a lot, if not their jobs. But who can remember the name of a single banker, as opposed to a bank, who lent them so much loot? Take Barclays Bank, for example. If one adds in its involvement in the highly leveraged 1989 takeover of Imry Merchant Developers then it appears to have made a series of ill-judged property investments (sorry, loans). Over the last five years its UK property lending has risen from Pounds 1.2bn to Pounds 5.4bn, or two and a half times as fast as its overall balance sheet. While it is impossible to tell whether heads have rolled inside Barclays as a result of what looks like over-zealous lending, one fears not. Indeed, Sir John Quinton, who has headed Barclays during its property binge, stresses the bank's 'relatively cautious' approach to the property sector. Were it not for the fact that accident-prone NatWest is once again more highly rated than Barclays, one would not suspect that the latter had a problem. Perhaps Sir John will use the occasion of this month's annual meeting to sound a note of contrition?</p>

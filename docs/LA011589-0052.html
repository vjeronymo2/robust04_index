			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFICIT: 'WHY NO OUTRAGE?'  </P> <P> Of course there is outrage at Reagan's budget. Every clear-thinking citizen who  heard of the proposed $92.5-billion deficit is outraged and disgusted.  Evidently, after eight years of the state of California budget preparation and  eight years of the same exercise in the White House, Reagan has learned  nothing. He spends the nation's money the same way Nancy replenishes her  wardrobe . . . borrowing, keeping, and never paying the debt. Reagan's last  budget only makes George Bush all the more welcome.  </P> <P> JACQUELINE KERR  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

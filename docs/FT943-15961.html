			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Brussels probes Eko Stahl aid The European Commission said it had begun proceedings against Eko Stahl, the loss-making German steelmaker, into the legality of state aid to the company. The case increases pressure on the German government to find a way of saving the plant in former east Germany. A rescue plan collapsed two months ago. It assumed that Riva, the private Italian steelmaker, would buy the company, modernise it and cut the workforce from 3,000. Riva's withdrawal means that loans and guarantees paid to Eko Stahl fall foul of Commission guidelines. The chances of a buyer being found, however, appear slim at a time of confusion in the industry over how best to make capacity cuts. The Commission said yesterday that since early May, the Treuhand privatisation agency had provided loans of at least DM15.6m (Pounds 6.4m) to Eko Stahl, and had guaranteed DM149m in bank loans. Brussels also announced yesterday that it would investigate the granting of loans by the Hamburgische Landesbank to another steel plant, the Neue Hamburger Stahlwerke, which may again contravene EU guidelines on state aid. It was also looking closely at a third steelmaker, Saarstahl, which refused Commission officials access this week to investigate a DM120m loan to modernise one of its plants.</p>

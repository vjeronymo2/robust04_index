			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Power profits to be investigated PROFESSOR Stephen Little-child, electricity regulator, said yesterday he would investigate concerns about regional power companies' profits as he launched a review of their distribution businesses. Distribution accounts for more than Pounds 4bn of the regional companies' turnover. Charges relating to it represent about a quarter of electricity bills. Prof Littlechild invited public comment on issues including the relative merits of price and profit controls, valuation of assets, costs of capital, standing charges and energy efficiency measures. Comments from the public and small businesses are being invited by the end of December. They should be sent to the Office of Electricity Regulation, Hagley House, Hagley Road, Birmingham B16 8QG.</p>

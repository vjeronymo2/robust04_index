			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Nigerian cabinet named Nigeria's new military ruler named an all-civilian cabinet yesterday, confusing detractors by choosing politicians from across the political spectrum including several known for their opposition to military rule, AP reports from Lagos. Among those named to a federal ministerial council to administer the nation under a provisional military council were former oil minister, Mr Donald Etiebet, and finance minister Mr Aminu Saleh, both in the interim government that General Sani Abacha ousted last week. No portfolios were announced for the cabinet. Other prominent members included three presidential aspirants in the run-up to annulled June 12 elections and people who have been outspoken supporters of Mr Moshood Abiola, the billionaire who claims to have won the poll. On Wednesday, Gen Abacha stunned the nation by appointing three military critics to the cabinet, including Mr Abiola's running mate, Baba Gana Kingibe, to take his case to the world as foreign minister. Yesterday's announcement appeared a further effort to counter international condemnation of the military takeover.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES;  </P> <P> AQUINO AUTONOMY PROPOSAL REJECTED  </P> <P> President Corazon Aquino said she will not be bullied into negotiating with  Mindanao separatist rebels of the Moro National Liberation Front after Muslims  and Christians sharply rejected her government's autonomy offer. In a  plebiscite Sunday, at least nine provinces in the country's battle-scarred  southern region voted "no" to autonomy, handing Aquino's government its first  electoral setback since it was swept to power in 1986.  </P></p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Upbeat forecast from Saint-Gobain Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials group, should raise profits this year even without the impact of capital gains due to be earned from the sale of its paper and packaging activities, according to Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman. In an interview with La Tribune Desfosses, the French financial daily, Mr Beffa said the group could count on satisfactory growth this year and improve on 1993, when group profits fell by 45 per cent to FFr1.31bn (Dollars 245m). He cited strategic factors behind the FFr5.6bn sale of its paper and packaging activities, mostly held by its Cellulose du Pin division, to Jefferson Smurfit of Ireland. 'A group like ours has to develop its activities with the aim of being among the leaders in each area. The wood and paper businesses lacked this dimension,' Mr Beffa said. Cellulose du Pin, he said, was 'too small and too French' and would have stronger prospects as part of a larger international group. The disposal will also remove a source of losses for the French group. Last year, Cellulose du Pin lost FFr1.1bn, as the sector reeled under the impact of a severe recession. Recovery is under way, however, and rationalisation measures prompt industry analysts to predict an improved performance this year. The sale should also help reduce Saint-Gobain's debts, already trimmed from the FFr15bn at the end of 1993 by a FFr3.6bn capital increase launched in March. After that, the debt to equity ratio was reduced from almost 40 per cent to about 28 per cent. Most important, however, the sale of the paper and packaging operations will allow Saint-Gobain to focus its management and financial resources on its core activities - glass, building materials and ceramics. Mr Beffa said the group was entering a new phase of industrial investments. Next year, he said, would see a clear increase above the FFr4.2bn of investments already made. All core businesses would benefit, according to Saint-Gobain, but particular emphasis would be given to its flat glass activities. Expansion would be achieved through direct investments and possibly acquisitions in emerging markets, such as eastern Europe and Asia, and in areas where the company is not already present.</p>

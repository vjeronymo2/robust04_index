			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zhang Junxiong (1728 6511 7160), Li Yunlong (2621 </F> 0061 7893), and Dou Mang (4535 5345): "Nanjing Military Region  Logistics System Model Commendation Meeting Ends; Leaders From  General Logistics Department and Military Region Present Prizes  to Advanced Collectives and Individuals"]    [Excerpts] On 11 January, a meeting to commend models of  the logistics system under the Nanjing Military Region came to a  successful conclusion. A total of 182 advanced individuals and  representatives from advanced units went up to the platform to  receive their prizes.    Zhou Youliang, a leader from the General Logistics  Department; Nanjing Military Region's leaders Gu Hui, Fang Zuqi,  Guo Xizhang, He Qizong, Yan Zhuo, Wang Yongming, Lan Baojing,  Chen Bingde, Wang Tongzhuo, Wang Chuanwu, and Shi Shuizhou  attended the closing ceremony.    Yang Zhuo, deputy commander of the military region read out  a  notice of commendation for advanced units and individuals in  logistic construction in the Nanjing Military Region. [passage  omitted]    Guo Xizhang, deputy commander of the military region, spoke  at the meeting. He said: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee and the CPC National Congress has further  specified and systematized the goal of establishing a socialist  market economic system. From now on, the pace of developing a  market economy will be further quickened, and a number of new  policies will gradually be introduced. The development of a  socialist market economy has not only brought about historic  opportunities for logistic construction, but also has made many  new demands on logistics guarantee work. Logistics units at all  levels should, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  earnestly study the impact of the market economy on logistics  work; deepen reform; and do a good job in providing logistics  guarantee under the conditions of a market economy.    He stressed: In order to meet market needs and deepen  reform, we must properly handle the relationship between  carrying forward tradition and blazing new trails. Over a long  period of time, our army has built up a whole set of fine  traditions; it is a unique and superior feature of our army. Be  it military, political or logistics work, we should seriously  carry forward the fine tradition. Presently, reform is the  current of the time, but when we emphasize reform, it does not  mean we no longer need the effective part of our glorious  tradition. We should say that notwithstanding the fact that the  guiding ideology, principles, and methods for our army's  logistics guarantee were formulated under the planned economy,  they have embodied the nature of our army's logistics work;  possess the characteristics of a military economy; and, on the  whole are still practicable. When we carry out partial reform,  introduce the competition mechanism, the benefit mechanism, and  the incentive mechanism, we should never overlook the direction  of logistics services; and when we apply the general principles  of the market economy to guide logistics reform, we must never  forget the nature and special law of the military economy so as  to ensure the healthy and steady development of logistics reform.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Stanion moves to Norwest Holst Britain's hard-pressed construction industry cont-inues to ring the management changes. The latest move involves John Stanion who becomes chief executive of Norwest Holst, a wholly owned subsidiary of Societe Generale d'Entreprises, the large French construction group. Stanion, 40, was formerly managing director of Beazer Kier which formed a big part of the contracting division of Beazer Group which was acquired last year by Hanson. Beazer's contracting arm, without Stanion, was sold to its employees and management in a deal worth Pounds 52m earlier this month. Stanion, who speaks German and French, worked for five years in Germany with Philipp Holzmann, the large German contractor, before joining Amec, the UK construction group where he spent six years. He replaces William McGrath who became acting managing director of Norwest Holst following the departure of Chris Bucknall who, after only a few months in the job, returned to Compass Services, the contract catering and health services company, where he became managing director. Peter Mason, formerly executive chairman of Norwest Holst, earlier this year replaced David Cawthra as chief executive of Balfour Beatty, the construction arm of BICC engineering group, when he moved to the Miller Group.</p>

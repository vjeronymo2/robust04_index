			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Field at premium Field Group, the packaging company, made a very impressive market debut. The shares were offered for sale at 250p a share and more than seven times oversubscribed. The stock began trading at 276p, with buyers moving in and pushing the volume up to 13m. It was the market's third most heavily traded stock yesterday. The shares ended the day at 279p. Field's warm reception had been expected. According to one trader, a premium of 10 per cent on the offer price had been anticipated, while it closed just short of a 12 per cent premium. 'There is a healthy demand for well-managed companies such as this,' said the trader. The company is the leader in the paper/packaging market and was part of a Reedpack management buy-out in 1988 and underwent a second MBO two years ago from SCA. The company intends to complete a Pounds 6m acquisition soon. Policy Portfolio, a marketmaker in second-hand endowment policies, joined the market with a placing of 3.6m shares at 130p. It began trading at 143p and ended the day 3 down at 140p. Sun Alliance was the best performer in the composite insurance sector, with the market increasingly suspicious that Transatlantic, the insurance group owned jointly by Liberty Life, of South Africa, and UAP, of France, may have been quietly adding to its 3.01 per cent stake in the UK group. The shares moved up 7 to 360p. Transatlantic revealed what is described as a 'strategic' stake in Sun early last month, triggering a rush of specula-tive buying in Sun shares, although some analysts dismissed talk of imminent bid moves as premature. Dealers said there had been persistent support for the stock yesterday, with turnover reaching 1.9m shares, the highest single day's activity since the middle of June. Any increase of a percentage point or more above the 3 per cent level has to be notified to the Stock Exchange. Big exceptional provisions, largely against a US subsidiary, took the shine off Dixons' results and the shares fell 15 to 195p in exceptionally heavy turnover of 10m, the second largest in three years. The restructuring charges set against Silo confirmed the worst fears of many in the market. 'Dixons should cut and run on Silo,' said one disgruntled analyst. While the UK business was holding up well, stores specialists said Dixons' determination to put the business to rights will probably continue to overhang the shares for several months. Strong two-way business in Forte was prompted by a downgrade and reinforced negative stance from NatWest Securities. The broker cited discounts being offered by the hotel group in its business class hotels as evidence that discounting was more widespread than was previously thought. The shares, which have enjoyed a good run in recent weeks, initially dropped on the news, but recovered as investors continued to believe the recovery story. The stock closed unchanged at 226p after a hefty turnover of 11m shares. A 'take profits' recommendation issued by Kleinwort Benson Securities on the insurance broking leaders upset companies such as Sedgwick and Willis Corroon. Ms Julianne Jessup, Kleinwort's analyst, highlighted the strong outperformance of the stocks over the past three months and recommended a switch into the smaller broking issues. Willis lost 7 at 217p and Sedgwick 4 at 196p. International trading group Lonrho, which earlier this week appointed James Capel as its joint broker with Strauss Turnbull, added 3 1/2 at 129 1/2 p on talk of an imminent disposal. Inchcape shed 12 1/2 to 545p, with Robert Fleming said to have turned cautious on the stock. Further reflection on the recent restructuring plans benefited Rothmans International, sending the stock forward 15 to 669p. Sellers of Chubb Security, notably of a line of 6m at 300p, brought volume to 11m as the shares dipped 3 to 310p. Shares in British Aerospace recovered from an early retreat after the release of a government study supporting its proposed regional jets joint venture in Taiwan. The stock declined last week on fears that the deal signed early this year may have to be aborted due to a lack of funding. One analyst said: 'This will be good news if it means the joint venture can now go ahead, otherwise the regional jets division faces closure.' Sentiment yesterday was also boosted by talk that Airbus Industrie, in which BAe has a 20 per cent stake, was about to win a lucrative order for 44 Airbus aircraft. BAe shares closed 7 up at 399p after trade of 2m. The big sell note from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken on Rolls-Royce continued to exact a heavy toll on the stock and the shares relinquished 3 to 138p as volume rose to 3.8m. British Steel was the subject of a tax-related 'bed and breakfast' deal which brought total turnover in the stock to 29m shares, including a block of around 9m. The shares hardened 2 1/2 to 91p, with a leading US securities house said to have recommended the stock. Fears that the Vickers subsidiary Rolls-Royce Motor Cars will not break even this year as expected, due to poor car sales, brought an early slide in the shares. At the day's worst, Vickers was down 9 at 140p, before bargain hunters helped to trim the decline. The shares were finally 4 off at 145p. A squeeze in VSEL following an agency cross of around 100,000 shares at 845p left the stock 20 stronger at 830p. Bank of Ireland weakened 9 to 241p after announcing a one-for-six rights issue that is intended to raise IPounds 100m. The bank said it would use the funds to strengthen its capital base.

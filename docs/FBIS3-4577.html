			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 27 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Sunday [27 February] he will deliver a policy  speech to the Diet probably on March 7 instead of Friday as  earlier planned.    Responding to a reporter's question if the speech will be on  March 7, Hosokawa said, "Yes. It will probably be so."    Hosokawa also said his government is likely to submit the  73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 to the Diet on Friday.    The prime minister, foreign minister, finance minister and  the economic planning agency director general usually give  speeches in late January at the start of a 150-day ordinary Diet  session.    Hosokawa and the three ministers have yet to deliver the  speeches to the Diet because of a delay in the compilation of  the state budget for fiscal 1994 which starts April 1.    The government usually compiles the budget at the year-end  but this time carried compilation over to February because of  prolonged deliberations on the political reform package, which  was enacted in January.</p>

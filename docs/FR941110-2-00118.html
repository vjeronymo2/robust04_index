The requested exemption would relieve two security officers from meeting the distant visual acuity requirements in one eye, which was not discovered at the time of their initial employment screening in 1989 and 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 10 CFR Part 73, Appendix B, security personnel who are responsible for the protection of special nuclear material on site or in transit should, like other elements of the physical security system, be required to meet minimum criteria to ensure that they will effectively perform their assigned security-related job duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR Part 73, Appendix B, Section I.B.b.(1)(a), ``Vision,'' specifies, in part that: For each individual (security officer), distant visual acuity in each eye shall be correctable to 20/30 (Snellen or equivalent) in the better eye and 20/40 in the other eye with eyeglasses or contact lenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the time of their employment in 1989 and 1990, the two subject security officers were screened using a licensee-generated form that was based on the requirements of Appendix B to 10 CFR Part 73. However, the form did not properly reflect the correct distant visual acuity requirements of the ``other eye.'' On July 28, 1994, the discrepancy between the licensee's form and the requirements of 10 CFR Part 73, Appendix B, Section I.B.b.(1)(a) was noted for the first officer. A review of the visual examination records for all security officers found a second instance in which the distant visual acuity requirement was not met for another security officer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee has provided expert professional medical opinions asserting that each officer has normal peripheral vision, normal peripheral depth perception, and normal binocular acuity. Further, each security officer uses the right eye for firearms siting and each currently tests 20/20 in the right eye. Finally, the licensee has committed to have each security officer's vision tested by its optometrist every 6 months to ensure no significant visual deterioration occurs. The criteria to establish that no significant visual deterioration has occurred will be: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Vision in the better eye will be at least 20/30 corrected or uncorrected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Vision in the other eye will be monitored. If eyesight in the other eye should worsen, immediate testing will be performed to demonstrate that the individual is physically capable of meeting all the requirements of the Maine Yankee Security Training and Qualification Plan prior to being reassigned duties of an armed security officer. (This testing will include the complete firearms qualification course.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The remaining vision criteria of 10 CFR Part 73, Appendix B, will be met or exceeded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action, including the expert professional medical opinions, vision screening results, firearms qualifications, and the proposed alternate qualification criteria the licensee has documented. The expert professional medical opinions assert that the diminished central visual acuity for each officer's left eye has existed since birth for one, and since about the age of four, for the other. Thus, the early age of onset and the nature of both conditions contribute to relative functional normality for each officer. Further, each officer has normal peripheral vision, normal peripheral depth perception, and normal binocular acuity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The underlying purpose for requiring vision criteria for security officers is to ensure that they can effectively perform their assigned security-related job duties. Expert professional opinions assert that each officer has relative functional normality and that an exception could thus be made because of the longevity of their vision loss (they have adapted and effectively compensate for diminished central visual acuity in their left eye). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Commission concludes that an exemption to allow continued service of the two subject employees as security officers at Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station would not result in a reduction in the physical protection capabilities for the protection of special nuclear material_either on site or in transit_or of Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station. Consequently, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological impacts associated with the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to the action would be to deny the request. Denial of the requested action would not significantly enhance the environment in that the proposed action will result in visual capabilities for two security officers that are substantially equivalent to the existing requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative Use of Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement Related to Operation of Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and Persons Consulted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated August 5, 1994, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, at the local public document room located at the Wiscasset Public Library, High Street, P.O.

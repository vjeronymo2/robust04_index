			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Irina Shchegoleva] </F>   [Text] Sochi February 10 TASS--The Abkhazian leadership has  agreed with the proposed deployment of peace-keeping forces  along the border river of Inguri, but not in Abkhazia itself.    Abkhazian Prime-Minister Sokrat Dzhindzholia told ITAR-TASS  on Thursday that "this is necessary to prevent new combat  activities and stabilize the situation".    Commenting on the joint message sent by Russian President  Boris Yeltsin and head of the Georgian state Eduard Shevardnadze  to the U.N. secretary-general, Dzhindzholia agreed that the  U.N.-and Russia-brokered accords between Georgia and Abkhazia in  Geneva indeed "mentioned the deployment of peace-keepers just  along the border line but not on the territory of Abkhazia  itself".    Yeltsin and Shevardnadze proposed that the Security Council  discuss "the launching, by the United Nations or with its  approval, of a peace-making operation, involving, if necessary,  a Russian military contingent".    Dzhindzholia said it was inadmissible for peace-keepers to  carry out police functions giving them the right to maintain  public order and disarm the Abkhazian Army.    The prime minister rejected Georgian media reports, which  claimed that the recent military operation staged by the  Abkhazian forces in the Gali region was directed against the  civilian population of Georgian villages. "The operation was  aimed against groups of terrorists, not against civilians", he  stressed.    "Every state has the right to maintain order on its  territory  using its own forces. That is exactly what we are doing",  Dzhindzholia said.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (8): Better ways of mapping the data - GIS If you're a woman terrified of suffering a melanoma (skin cancer), move to Brecon in Wales, where it hardly occurs. Men in Wales, however, suffer a high incidence of stomach tumours, and cancers associated with sexual behaviour. A report published at the end of March, The Atlas of Cancer Incidence in England and Wales 1968-85 has for the first time examined the locational occurrence of cancer, and identified many different forms with specific locations. This use of a Geographical Information System (GIS) illustrates how the technique of mapping data to a physical location can reveal gems of information. Based on data gathered over 18 years, the report has mapped occurrences of different illnesses. The information may throw light on causes and effects, and can certainly help to plan for health resources. GIS has proved to be one of the boom areas of computing in the last years. Newcomers include computer software houses, hardware suppliers, and consultancies, all muscling in with determination on a territory that used to be the cosy domain of geographical specialists. Once limited to expensive dedicated equipment, the GIS is beginning to appear down-market, and become a more accessible tool in commerce. Established IT giants - Sema Group, Logica, Unisys, Informix and Oracle among them - are showing an interest in the potential of GIS revenues. Report and estimates about the boom in GIS have been appearing for some time. According to the most recent results from IT researchers Dataquest, published in March 1994, the total GIS market worldwide rose from Dollars 587m in 1992 to Pounds 654m in 1993. 'We anticipate a compound annual growth rate of 16 per cent per annum until 1995, which makes it one of the fastest growing areas of the software markets,' says Petra Gartzen, a senior analyst and specialist in computer aided design and GIS for the research group Dataquest. 'New applications and technologies are constantly coming on the market, such as improved access to satellite communicated data and geographical positioning systems (GPS).' Some of the main areas in GIS are obvious: utilities recording assets, local authorities planning future schools and services, road and transport planning, retailers targeting their markets. Locational information has become relevant in a world of compulsory competitive tendering, where purchasing authorities 'outsource' to 'service providers.' The GIS market is poised for its boom partly because the hard slog of the groundwork - literally in the following case - has neared completion. In the UK, the Ordnance Survey has been working for two decades creating the data. Early efforts were not flexible enough for the emerging market. But in November 1992, at the national conference of the Association for Geographic Information, the OS announced Land-Line, the large scale digital map data products which are at the heart of GIS user-systems around the country. They have also now solved 'edge matching' - a problem where the paper-based medium had stretched or shrunk so that the digitised versions did not quite match when meeting on borders: 230,000 maps should be available in one seamless whole by 1995. One thing discovered by the early users of GIS is that the problems of mapping data by location are by no means only technical. Viewing data 'spatially' has a fundamental effect on the way that organisations work. Although there are great savings in cost and efficiency to be gained, the investment of time, money and energy up-front produces expectations that may take some time to come to fruition. The exercise of re-focusing operations through a GIS is not unlike business process re-engineering: it involves cross-disciplinary and departmental co-operation, and has to be driven from the top. This culture shock might explain why the market has shaped niche specialisations. Strategic Mapping, MapInfo, and ESRI have all established strong positions in the low-end market. ESRI's ARC/Info GIS has nearly half the government GIS business worldwide, 27 per cent of the transportation market, and over 20 per cent of the utilities. In 1992 it is attributed with 35.7 per cent of worldwide software-only sales: Intergraph, its nearest competitor is credited with 17.2 per cent. Smallworld, the UK specialist based in Newmarket, has carved out a niche with utilities - electricity, gas, water and telecommunications - by offering a specialised 'hand-holding' service that eases the process of data conversion, customisation, and business re-engineering. Its clients include six cable companies, and seven out of the 12 UK electricity companies, and has recently won a contract with German Bundespost. Automated mapping and facilities management (AMFM) is specific to the utilities providers which use it to map and define assets overground and underground, and even in the air, to provide information on charging and maintenance planning. The largest sector in terms of market potential is business marketing and sales, according to Dataquest's Petra Gartzen - 'we've done some analysis about the business market because the technology has become so much more accessible with powerful PCs. A lot of the business GIS is PC-based and we anticipate that it will grow to Dollars 174m or more by 1997 from a humble Dollars 10m in 1990. 'The market leaders are mainly US companies, Strategic Mapping and MapInfo; overall leaders are Intergraph and ESRI. But the low end PC-based business is where the growth is, penetrated by companies with an existing user-base elsewhere, such as Autodesk.' Visual information is becoming readily available. In March, President Clinton overruled the CIA and ruled in favour of market forces, making visual information commercially available from US satellites.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Military Council of Internal Troops issued a  statement to the Belarusian public which says that some of the  mass media and speeches by representatives of political parties  and by some people's deputies are presenting the activity of the  internal troops as antipeople, antidemocratic, and antistate.  Attempts are being made to show them as an instrument of  political pressure and blackmail.    This was shown especially clearly on 9 November 1993, on the  day of the opening of the latest session of parliament, when  internal troops were deployed to maintain civil order. This was  caused, the statement says, by the fact that in Minsk the day  before, leaflets appeared with a call to get rid of the  government and for armed protest. One of the leaflets was read  at the session. In a number of cities there were gatherings of  people who were antigovernment for [words indistinct] and  exerting pressure on the authorities. There was information  warning about possible terrorist acts from the Embassy of the  Russian Federation. The Belarusian KGB was unaware of a  breakthrough by aggressively inclined representatives of the  (?BZV) [expansion unknown] toward the government building.    In this way, the statement stresses, the Ministry of  Internal  Affairs had sufficient grounds for considering that on the day  of the opening of the session there could arise conditions which  would threaten civil peace and the security of citizens.  Therefore, a plan for ensuring law and order was put into  practice.    The actions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs on 20  January  this year were described in the same [word indistinct]. In the  report on the deputies' investigation published in NARODNAYA  GAZETA it was alleged that subunits of the internal troops were  sent to intimidate deputies who did not support the government  line, that the troops were concentrated in numbers intended to  carry out military action.    The Military Council of Internal Troops categorically denies  this allegation. We solemnly declare that the internal troops  of the Republic of Belarus will never be an instrument for the  ambitions of politicians who struggle for power by illegal  means, says the statement. We appeal to political parties and  movements, to the mass media, and to the public asking and  insisting to stop dragging the internal troops into the  political arena. The troops stand on guard of the law. They  acted and will act within the law.</p>

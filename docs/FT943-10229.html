			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Database 'key to mad cow rules' Computerised data about cattle auctions could provide the key to farmers trying to trace the history of their cows before they can export them, according to Mr David Jones of Newline Systems, in Newton Abbot, Devon. Rules introduced by European Union agriculture ministers two weeks ago mean that before farmers can export carcasses to the Continent they must certify that their cattle over six months old have never been in a herd with BSE. The difficulties involved in providing this information mean that the export market for carcass beef has in effect been closed to most farmers. This has pushed livestock prices at cattle auctions around the country down by at least 30 per cent. Mr Jones, whose company provides a computerised system for cattle auctions, said it would not be difficult to gather information from his database on cattle transactions and merge it with other electronic auction data. This would provide a record of the bulk of cattle sales across the country. When cattle are traded their ear-tag number is recorded. Part of this number relates to the farm selling the beast. Mr Jones said it would be a fairly straightforward process to trace the homes of cattle going back 10 years: 'We have data from over 100 auctions in the country so we can create a fully comprehensive record of animals' movements. It would be a godsend for many farmers at the moment.' Some farmers may face bankruptcy if they are unable to export beef carcasses as a result of the change in the rules. Other producers, such as dairy farmers, expect a sharp fall in their profits as they are unable to export carcasses of old dairy or cull cows. Mr Jones has offered access to his database to the government so that it could be combined with the information held on BSE and offer it as a service to farmers. He said: 'We were told that our system is two years in advance of the Ministry of Agriculture and that there was nothing they could do about it.' The agriculture ministry holds a record of BSE-affected farms but cannot release names and addresses of farmers for fear of infringing data protection laws. In addition, the ministry's computers for England, Scotland and Wales are separate, making it difficult to trace cattle that have moved between regions. The ministry said yesterday that it was close to finding its own solution for providing more information and was preparing an announcement. It is looking into the legal implications of releasing more information from its database. Farmers are anxious to trace their animals' histories. Mr Martin Burtt, a livestock farmer in north Yorkshire, said: 'It means lots of cattle can't be certified by default because we can't get the tangible evidence that they have not been in contact with BSE.' Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, will meet Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, on Monday to press for more information and outline farmers' concerns about the new rules.

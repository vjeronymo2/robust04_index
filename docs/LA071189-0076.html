			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALSH REPLACES OLSEN AS NBC FOOTBALL ANALYST  </P> <P> Merlin Olsen is out as NBC's top football commentator and Bill Walsh, who has  no broadcasting experience, will replace him.  </P> <P> NBC made the surprising announcement Monday night after word came out of San  Francisco that Walsh would resign as executive vice president of the San  Francisco 49ers to take the NBC job.  </P> <P> Friends of Olsen have said recently that the former Ram was tired of his  commentating job and was looking to devote more time to an acting career.  </P> <P> Also, Terry O'Neil, the new executive producer of NBC Sports, had been critical  of Olsen in the past, when O'Neil was at CBS.  </P> <P> What is most surprising about NBC's announcement is that the inexperienced  Walsh, who last season coached the 49ers to a Super Bowl title, would  immediately become NBC's No. 1 analyst.  </P> <P> Walsh will be teamed with Dick Enberg.  </P> <P> NBC had planned to announce the change at a news conference Saturday in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Walsh, 57, led the 49ers to three Super Bowl championships before quitting as  head coach last January.  </P> <P> He moved into the front office and was replaced as coach by George Seifert.  </P> <P> Walsh's business manager, Stefan Kay, in an interview with San Francisco TV  station KGO Monday, said: "Bill needs a challenge and missed coaching."  </P> <P> Walsh's relationship with 49er owner Ed DeBartolo Jr. began to sour in 1987  when Walsh was stripped of his title of team president after the 49ers lost in  the first round of the playoffs for the third consecutive season.  </P> <P> Walsh's record with the 49ers was 102-63-1. He also was head coach at Stanford  and an assistant with the Cincinnati Bengals, Oakland Raiders and San Diego  Chargers.  </P> <P> Walsh, DeBartolo and Olsen were unavailable for comment Monday night.  </P></p>

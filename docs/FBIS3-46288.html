The source, who asked to remain anonymous, said "It is  inevitable that Paraguay will establish trade links with the  mainland under pressure from its business sector."    The South American country, however, will definitely not  sever its official ties with Taiwan.    Paraguay Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner  Tuesday  made clear his government's stand to a visiting Beijing trade  mission, the source said.    Minister Ramirez last month also explained his government's  China policy to a parliamentary mission which is scheduled to  visit Beijing next month.    While briefing a group of ranking Paraguay military  officials  on his country's foreign policy last week, Ramirez reaffirmed  Paraguay's diplomatic relations with Taiwan and expressed the  hope that Taiwan would increase investments in Paraguay.    Beijing has recently launched a series of diplomatic  offensives towards Paraguay, starting with visits to Asuncion by  a National People's Congress delegation last October and then by  a trade mission, which is currently in town, in addition to  inviting the Paraguay mission to visit the mainland.    The head of the Beijing trade mission in a closed-door  meeting with Ramirez said, according to a source present at the  meeting, that Beijing would increase its purchase of cotton from  Paraguay and diplomatic ties should eventually be established  between Beijing and Asuncion.    Minister Ramirez told local journalists after the meeting  that "It is impossible for Paraguay to simultaneously recognize  two Chinas and it should study how to make a choice in the  future".</p>

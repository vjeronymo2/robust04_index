The Forum on Law and Business is organizing a seminar with a  triple objective: reviewing the stages of deregulation of  telecommunications in Europe; anticipating its effect on the  different segments of the market; and presenting the attitude of  the operators concerned. The important thing here in particular  will be to measure the real impact of opening the field up to  competition. The British example shows what this means: After  ten years of deregulation, BT still holds 90 percent of the  telecommunications market on the other side of the English  Channel, perhaps with a quasi-monopoly over local  communications. A radical change in the regulatory setup is, of  course, necessary so as to open telecommunications services up  to the private sector; in the light of this, one particular  effective opening is determined by the existence of authorities  charged with daily monitoring compliance on the part of the  competition. Along with Bruno Lasserre, director of the  Directorate of General Regulation, Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications, Maev Sullivan, of Mercury Communication, the  BT challenger, an official from the Brussels Commission, and  Joachim Scherer, a professor at Frankfurt University, will share  their experiences.</p>

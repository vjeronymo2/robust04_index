			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 3 SAPA -- Basie Smit -- the police  general embroiled in a controversial Goldstone report that  allegedly implicates top policemen in "third force" activities  -- is to retire at the end of May.    Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe said in a statement  on Tuesday [3 May] night Lt-Gen Smit "has decided to retire from  service on superannuation at the end of May 1994. It is indeed  sad to lose such an experienced and dedicated general and I wish  him and his family everything of the best."    In the same statement, Gen van der Merwe pledged the SAP's  [South African Police] "wholehearted" support for Transvaal  Attorney General Jan D'Oliveira who had apparently criticised  police for a lack of cooperation in the investigation into  alleged "third force" activities. "I wish to give the assurance  that the South African Police will, as in the past, continue to  give its wholehearted support to Dr D'Oliveira and his team and  that everything possible will be done in order to prevent the  investigation being hindered in any way," said Gen van der Merwe.    He added: "I also wish to dispel any impression which may  have been created that the South African Police is in conflict  with the Goldstone Commission. The South African Police will,  as in the past, continue to offer its complete cooperation to  the Goldstone Commission."    Gen van der Merwe also committed the SAP to the country's  new  dispensation. "...I wish to emphasize that the South African  Police has committed itself to enter the new dispensation with  confidence and enthusiasm, and will protect and serve the  government and the community with dedication."</p>

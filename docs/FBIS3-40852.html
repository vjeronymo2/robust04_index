The Failure Analysis Committee  (FAC), constituted to look into the cause of failure of the  first development flight of PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch  Vehicle) (PSLV-D1) which took place on September 20, has  submitted its report to the Chairman, Indian Space Research  Organisation (ISRO).    The national level committee, chaired by Mr. N. Pant, member  of the Space Commission, included experts from academic and  R&amp;D  institutions in the country, besides ISRO. The analysis and the  recommendations were reviewed in detail by Prof. U.R. Rao,  Chairman, ISRO along with senior experts from both within and  outside ISRO.    Based on the analysis of the extensive telemetry data from  the flight, the committee has confirmed that all the major  systems, which had been integrated in the PSLV, including the  giant solid booster and the liquid propulsion systems flight  tested for the first time, had worked as planned and that there  were no serious lacunae in the design of the vehicle: PSLV-D1  would have achieved the intended orbit but for a minor  deficiency.    The committee has said the failure of PSLV-D1 to reach the  intended orbit was primarily due to a software error in the  pitch control loop of the onboard guidance and control  processor, which occurs only when the control command exceeds  the specified maximum limiting value.    The present limit value was exceeded due to the disturbances  experienced during transition between the second and third  stages of the rocket. These disturbances were caused by the  programmed gimbal pulling of the second stage, 3.7 seconds  before the ignition of the third stage, leaving the disturbances  during the above period of the second stage tail-off  uncorrected. Also the failure of two small retro rockets led to  a contact between second and third stages, during the separation  of the second stage. The committee has further said that in  spite of the disturbances, the PSLV rocket design is so rugged  that it would have reached the intended orbit but for the  software error.    The major recommendations of the committee, consequently are  to rectify the software implementation error and to delay the  pulling of the second stage by about 2.0 50 2.5 seconds.  [sentence as published] The committee has said that the  deficiencies noted and the modifications suggested are quite  normal for the first few developmental flights of a large  complex system like PSLV and ISRO should have no difficulty in  operationalising the PSLV launch vehicle very soon.    Preparations have begun for the next developmental flight of  PSLV targeted for the third quarter of 1994, after implementing  the committee's recommendations.</p>

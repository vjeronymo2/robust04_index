			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  moved to rally public support for his precarious minority  government Wednesday [18 May] by announcing a freeze on planned  hikes in public service charges.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai announced at a press  conference a sweeping freeze until the year-end of raises in  public charges, including domestic telephone charges, public  housing rent, taxi fares and tolls for the nation's expressways.    It was the first such wide-ranging freeze on public charge  hikes since 1964, when the government was combating strong  inflationary pressure.    The announcement was made amid an increasingly vocal  broadside from the public and business to the planned hikes.    On Tuesday, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Federation of  Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), urged Construction Minister  Koji Morimoto to freeze the planned raise in tolls for the  nation's highways for two years.    The leading business mogul excoriated the government over  the  plan, arguing a hike in the tolls would put a big damper on the  nation's flagging economy.    The move was prompted by concerns in the government that the  planned series of public charge raises could cast a pall over  the nascent recovery of the economy as well as by public  criticism, government sources said.    It is also Hata's apparent bid to rally public support for  his government in the face of the opposition's relentless attack  on his shaky political standing, analysts said.    Kumagai made clear at the press conference it was a  "political decision" by Hata.    He said the premier, "with reckless valor," made the  decision  after taking into consideration "the criticism from every  corner" of the proposed hikes.    "The people are displeased with the planned charge hikes,"  Kumagai said, adding, "we have to respond to the people's  voices."    He said the government will also ask local authorities to  follow the government's example and not raise public-sector bus  and subway fares.    Asked about the decision, to be endorsed at a cabinet  meeting  Friday, Hata said it is the government's response to the  criticism that it is too willing to raise charges for its  services while the private sector is going through a tough  restructuring to tide over the slump.    Hata also hinted the move is designed to sweeten the  government's proposed tax reform, which is expected to include a  hike in the consumption tax.    "Well, we will have to obtain support for the tax reform and  some other things," he said.    Political pundits were skeptical of the move, calling it a  claptrap.    "It is a stopgap effort to gain popularity. (Hata) is simply  pulling the wool over the people's eyes," said Makoto Sataka, a  social commentator.    Hata heads the first minority government in four decades.    The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest bloc in the  opposition camp, has signaled it will submit a motion of no-  confidence in the government after the overdue state budget for  fiscal 1994 passes the Diet.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the second largest  opposition group and a partner in the ruling coalition of Hata's  predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, has also called for an early  general election for the House of Representatives.    The move is also aimed at selling Hata's "strong leadership"  and his compassion for people's hardships as a snap election  grows more likely, analysts said.    Business and consumer groups, however, mostly welcomed the  decision.    Nikkeiren's Nagano said at a press conference it will  benefit  the Japanese economy. "I am happy to hear the news. It is good  for the economy," he said.    A senior executive of a major chemical company said, "I  really appreciate Mr. Hata's decision."    Some companies and government ministries, however, were  perplexed by the sudden decision to freeze the public charges.    An official of the Transport Ministry, which supervises the  taxi industry, said, "it was a bolt out of the blue. I cannot  comment until we receive an official notice."    A taxi company executive said, "we will be in trouble if the  taxi fare hike is not permitted. But...we cannot revolt against  the order."    Kosaku Yamada, who heads Japan Highway Public Corp., which  has planned an average 10.6 percent hike in highway tolls, said,  "we can do nothing but to accept the government decision."    Nonlife insurance companies were also rocked by the freeze,  which covers fire insurance premiums.    "I was really surprised by the sudden announcement," said  Takashi Onoda, head of the Marine and Fire Insurance Association  of Japan.    Some government economists voiced skepticism over the move.    "It is a political decision by the cabinet. If the hikes are  postponed the margin of raises may have to be larger later,"  said Koichi Tani of the Economic Planning Agency.    "(The decision) is undesirable from an economic policy point  of view. The planned hikes would not have put a major drag on  consumption."    The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the No. 1 opposition  party, also took a dim view of the move.    "It is a mere postponement. The hikes in the next year may  be larger than planned," said Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the  LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council. It should be called  "claptrap," Hashimoto said.</p>

This was said in the statement by the  Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin faction (leader Yavlinskiy) in the  State Duma published on Wednesday. The statement points out  that "involvement of the NATO military-political bloc into an  armed conflict beyond NATO's sphere may break the  military-political balance in Europe and contradicts Russia's  national interests."    According to the faction's deputies, the lifting of the  embargo on military deliveries to Bosnia and Herzegovina would  inevitably make non-European forces (Muslim states) get involved  into the conflict. The statement underlined that such actions  could cause a serious domestic problem within the Russian  Federation - a split between Christian and Moslem peoples.    The faction's statement emphasized that it was  "non-productive" to continue implementation of the economic  sanctions against the new Yugoslavia since Yugoslavian civilians  and the economy of the neighboring states were the first victims  of these sanctions. In connection with this, the  Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin faction insists on the lifting or  "gradual softening" of the sanctions against Yugoslavia (which  now consists of Serbia and Montenegro-IF note), which does not  directly participate in the war.</p>

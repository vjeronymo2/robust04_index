			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Phoenix Timber reduces losses Reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 561,000, against a restated Pounds 4.19m, were announced by Phoenix Timber Group for the year to March 31. The outcome for the property care and flooring group follows a fall in administration and financing costs in the second half together with a Pounds 125,000 surplus from land sales. Turnover fell to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 21.6m) with Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 4.64m) from discontinued operations. Losses per share were cut to 2.1p (23.8p). The current year had started slowly in both principal trading companies, Mr Hugh Try, chairman, said. The level of orders at Durabella was encouraging, although pressure on margins remained. Protim needed a continued upturn in the housing market to exploit its potential, he added. Bank borrowings had been cut by Pounds 3.38m to Pounds 2.2m during the year and Mr Try said the realisation of assets from discontinued operations continued.</p>

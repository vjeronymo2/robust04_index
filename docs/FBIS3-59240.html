			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho: "Union, But on </F> Finnish Terms"]    [Text] The question most frequently put to me these days,  both at home and abroad, is: Will Finland become a member of  the European Union [EU] on 1 January 1995 or not? Before  dwelling on the intricacies of the negotiations going on in  Brussels, I would first like to tell you a story about our most  famous Finnish composer, Jean Sibelius.    In his younger days, Sibelius used to spend a lot of time in  Helsinki restaurants. When one particular spree had lasted  several days, his wife finally telephoned her husband to ask for  a tentative forecast of when he was likely to come home.    "My dear," Sibelius sighed, "I am a composer. My vocation is  to compose, not to make forecasts."    In a similar vein, I would prefer to refrain from detailed  forecasts at this critical and delicate juncture in Finland's  negotiations over European Union accession. However, I am more  than keen to explain the background to our membership initiative  and the high stakes involved in the process under way.    Finland has always been a thoroughly European nation.  Western and Eastern influences have met on our Nordic soil,  moulding our culture and lifestyle. Much of our heritage and  civilisation is of West European origin. Since the Middle Ages  Finns have travelled to European capitals to study and do  business. The idea that Finland is knocking on the door of  Europe for the first time gravely distorts the historical facts.    The profound European transition that started in the late  1980s has led us to assess our European policies in an  open-minded way. In this exercise, we have been guided by our  postwar policy of neutrality and active economic intergration.  Many things have changed around us while some others have not.    In the modern age, Finland's economic links have always  pointed to West Europe. More than two-thirds of our foreign  trade is carried out with our EU and European Free Trade  Association partners. Germany, Sweden and Britain top the list  of our individual trading partners. Finnish companies have  vigorously broadened their activities abroad. Nokia, Neste,  Repola, Outokumpu Kemira, Metra, Enso, Valmet and many other  names with a Finnish ring remind European business people of our  industries' high level of skills.    In order to grow and prosper, Finland needs access to  Europe's single market. Much of this essential aim has been  accomplished through the recently enacted European Economic  Area. But to have real influence where the decisions on the  political and economic future of our continent are taken, we  have applied for membership of the EU.    We also trust that we can make a positive contribution. The  Nordic candidates, in particular, would bring the Union new  territories and natural resources. But more than that, they  would bring developed, stable societies, valuable traditions and  advanced economies.    It has not been difficult to find common ground on  enlargement. To many observers, the process has seemed quite  straightforward, apart from the many technicalities which always  abound in issues of integration. While this overall picture has  been largely correct, it has perhaps concealed a number of real  problems that must be settled.    Therefore, no one should be surprised that now, in the  final straight, we have a set of tough issues on our hands. As  a rule, the difficulties in question stem from a single source:  our unique geographical location and harsh climate. In the  negotiations we are genuinely seeking to ensure that Finland  will be able to reach the objectives of the various EU policies.  We have to find innovative solutions to problems such as short  grow ing seasons, harsh winters and long distances in a sparsely  populated country.    These handicaps are permanent and can be compensated for  only  through a permanent support system based on clear and objective  criteria. One possibility would be to use the criterion of  latitude, in line with that of altitude already used in hill  farming, to define less-favoured agricultural areas.    We are convinced that without proper solutions to these  problems, Finland as a whole, and our rural areas in particular,  will face untenable consequences. Both our politicians and most  of our people are keenly aware of that. A number of EU studies  also support that conclusion.    In spite of the recent polls in favour of EU membership, I  believe that ultimately the terms of accession will be decisive.  Therefore, my government can only submit to referendum a  negotiated result which meets our basic requirements.    In these circumstances, our firm choice is to press ahead  with the negotiations under the tight schedule that we have  agreed to observe.    While we fully recognise the advantages involved in  completing the negotiations quickly, in view of the approaching  end of the European Parliament's term, we cannot make the  timetable more important than the substance of our assessment.    We need a satisfactory set of terms for accession and we are  prepared to fight hard for our corner in the remaining  negotiations. As far as I can recall, a similar spirit  characterised the final phases of previous enlargement  negotiations.    We understand that the solutions to our agricultural and  regional problems must be tailored to meet our specific needs.  In this way we can avoid any spillover of the Nordic support  systems.    Finally, let me draw attention to one further aspect. The  accession process with we Finns may occasionally prove to be  tedious, but once happily concluded EU partners will be able to  count on our solidarity, common sense and seriousness in all EU  affairs. It lies deep in the Finnish character to keep one's  word and stick to one's commitments. We can be stubborn but  only on issues of vital interest to us. Even there, we are  always open to pragmatic solutions if they are honestly designed  to take our concerns into account.    Finland's European policy is based on a practical assessment  of our own needs and of European political and economic  developments. EU membership offers answers to many of our  aspirations, but only if the terms of our accession properly  take into account our specific circumstances.</p>

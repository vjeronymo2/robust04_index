			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (3): New box of risk-management tricks  -A look at the sell side: commercial and investment banks IT IS ONE of the great paradoxes of the derivatives industry. Some leading US commercial banks, battered in the 1980s by excessive concentrations of lending to third world countries, the property sector and leveraged buy-outs, have set themselves up in the 1990s as experts in risk management. Is an industry which proved so lax in controlling its own risks - and which has been bailed out only by the lowest US interest rates in memory - really in a position to advise others on theirs? The banks say they have emerged stronger and wiser from the experience of the 1980s. 'Banks have learned as an industry that concentration is not a good thing,' says Mr Peter Hancock, head of derivatives at J P Morgan, a bank which came through the excesses of the 1980s better than most. Bankers Trust remains the most extreme example of the phenomenon which has turned banks from pools of risk themselves into providers of risk management instruments. Stuck with third world debt and bridge loans which it was unable to sell on through the securities markets, the US's seventh biggest banking group (in terms of assets) slumped to a near-Dollars 1bn loss in 1989. Yet the experience coincided with an early move into derivative markets which left Bankers Trust as the most profitable commercial bank in the US last year, with a return on equity of 23 per cent. Not surprisingly, derivatives and risk management are now virtually a religion inside Bankers Trust. 'It's not a product - it's more a way of life,' says Mr Brian Walsh, head of derivatives. The most obvious embodiment of this: the bank's much-emulated method of allocating capital based on an analysis of both credit and market risk through a unified model. Known as 'raroc' (for 'risk-adjusted return on capital'), this capital-allocation model was adjusted a year ago to take more account of the liquidity risk implicit in different types of asset, Mr Walsh says (the lower the liquidity, the higher the capital charge applied internally.) The re-emergence of risk-taking in commercial banks has been most pronounced in the swaps markets. They may have retreated from commercial lending in the 1990s (in part because the strongest companies can raise money at better rates direct from the capital markets), but this has not stopped banks taking on new credit risks. As counterparties to swap transactions, most banks have been adding off-balance sheet credit exposure to replace shrinking on-balance sheet risks. Mr Hancock calls it 'the rebirth of bank intermediation'. It has provided a route for banks to reinvent themselves as credit institutions - and this time, they claim, the risks are being spread more evenly through the system. Bankers Trust, which invested earlier than most in the people and technology needed to run a derivatives business, and J P Morgan, with its strong balance sheet and good relationships with many big companies, have been the most profitable 'money centre' banks in the US this year. Much of this is due to derivatives, though neither bank reports profits from derivatives separately. To hear these banks talk, their new box of risk management tricks offers almost limitless possibilities. Most big decisions taken by their corporate customers - such as whether to build a new factory, or buy another company - involve the taking of many different business and market risks. Through the derivatives markets (whether currency, interest rate or commodity) those risks can be split apart and managed separately. Mr Walsh points to one example: the ability to lock into a fixed oil price for up to 10 years. 'That must have a profound effect on the way oil companies are run,' he says. If companies respond to these blandishments, then the most successful intermediaries in the derivatives markets will be those best able to act as the lightning conductors through which risk is transfered from one group to another. The ability to price and hedge exposures - many of which, unlike equities or fixed income securities, have no underlying cash market - will also be an important determinant of future profits. Risk-management skills learned in the equity, currency or fixed income derivatives markets are already taking commercial banks into new areas. Insurance could prove the next great opportunity. The risk transfer mechanism in the insurance industry is dominated by a limited number of large institutions, whether insurers or reinsurers. Much like the banking industry, these institutions carry large exposures and are vulnerable to unforeseen events: one big US hurricane, say, could wipe out a whole year's property/casualty insurance profits in one go. Through the same risk-transfer mechanism pioneered in other derivative markets, both Bankers Trust and JP Morgan say they are already linking the exposures in the insurance industry to the wider capital markets. According to Mr Hancock: 'Just as derivatives have brought regional capital markets together, it will help to connect that (insurance) market with others. It leaves you with a bigger pool of risk takers to absorb the shocks.' The effect on the giants of the insurance industry could be profound. 'It's the last area in financial services to go through significant change,' says Mr Walsh, though he hesitates to suggest that the capital markets will eventually prove a better mechanism for transfering insurance risks than the insurance companies. It is not surprising, therefore, to see some big insurers moving into the derivatives markets themselves.</p>

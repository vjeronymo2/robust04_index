On this tape there was a recording of a  payment demand for $500,000 and 500 million rubles. If these  terms were not met, the terrorists threatened to detonate  explosions at important vital installations.    ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's special correspondent called the  Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Ministry of Security and asked the  officer on duty, Lieutenant Colonel Sergey Telegin, to spell out  the details of what had occurred.    [Ignatyev] Sergey Vladimirovich, how did all this begin?    [Telegin] At 0900 hours on 1 February, an unidentified  person dropped a cassette tape off in the lobby of city hall and  asked Tamara, the secretary, to give it to her superiors. The  cassete lay around in the lobby nearly all day, and it was only  toward the evening that someone remembered that it was there.  When the tape was played, an unusual 10-minute recording was  discovered on it.    A calm male voice announced that a terrorist group named  "Revenge" is operating in Yakutsk; it has the capability to  carry out sabotage and terrorist acts, blow up vital  installations in the city -- namely heat supply stations,  gasworks, and water supply systems -- and also perform acts of  violence against the civilian population on bus routes and in  airport waiting halls if the authorities do not meet the  relevant conditions. The conditions are these: On 4 February  the authorities must hand over $500,000 and 500 million rubles.    The extortioners proposed the following plan of action: At  1900 hours local time on 3 February, there should be an  announcement on the 12th channel of Yakutsk television in which,  if the conditions had been accepted, a contact telephone number  should be indicated for communication purposes.    The terrorists named a vehicle -- a Moskvich station wagon  --  together with its registration number. According to the  criminals' information, it is a private vehicle that carries  paying passengers. The money must be handed to the driver.  Between 1000 and 2100 hours on 4 February he has to drive  around the city picking up anyone who hails him and asks to be  taken to the airport. Every 50-60 minutes the driver has to  turn up at the cabstand at the airport. The driver must not be  replaced by an officer. The capture of the person arriving to  collect the money would also result in serious consequences:  The terrorists would open fire indiscriminately on people  outside and in the airport waiting hall.    A pack of "Rodopi" cigarettes is to be fixed to the  windscreen of the "Moskvich" to identify it. The voice warned  the driver not to touch it, it was none of his business.    [Ignatyev] What action did you take to prevent a tragedy?    [Telegin] As soon as the chief heard about the message, an  operational staff was set up with the participation of  representatives of the Internal Affairs Ministry, Federal  Counterintelligence Service, prosecutor's office, and Committee  for Civil Defense and Emergencies. We put extra guards on all  important installations in the city. There was a joint session  of this staff and the government of the Republic of Sakha  (Yakutia). The terrorists' conditions were accepted. We found  the driver indicated by the criminals and handed him the money.  The contact telephone number was read out on local television  channel 12. An operation was carried out to search for and  disable potential explosive devices. None has been found so  far. The relevant services are ready at any time to take all  the necessary steps to prevent a tragedy. The Transbaykal  regional center of the Russian Federation Emergencies Ministry  has been placed on red alert. A special team will come from  Moscow to assist if necessary.    A ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA special correspondent asked mayor of  Yakutsk, Aleksey Tomtosov, about the situation in the city.    [Tomtosov] All is quiet in the city at this time, all  institutions and enterprises are operating. It is probably an  unsuccessful hoax. I hope there will be no explosions or  terrorist acts. The criminals are just after the money.  Nonetheless, it is not nice when these situations occur. We  have tighter supervision at heating plants and other vital  installations, since the winter has been unusually severe this  time round. As I talk with you, the temperature is -41 outside.  The Arctic winter has ended and the days are considerably  longer. We are looking forward to some warmth. And we are  hoping for better things.    STOP PRESS: As is known, the terrorists set a deadline for  the receipt of the money -- 2100 hours local time. That is 1500  hours in Moscow. We telephoned the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)  Security Ministry duty officer and he said that none of the  bandits had arrived to collect the money. It had been decided  to extend the operation until around 2300 hours local time.    The Yakutsk prosecutor's office has instituted criminal  proceedings for extortion.</p>

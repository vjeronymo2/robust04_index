			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Fire damages east German property files AN EAST German castle which contains 13 km of property registers for the territory was severely damaged in an arson attack at the weekend. The attack appears to have been a dramatic attempt to disrupt the restoration of east German properties to their former owners, including Jewish families dispossessed by the Nazis, and opponents of the former communist regime. Only a small proportion of the files was totally destroyed or severely damaged by the fire and water - initially estimated at some 400 metres of shelving, or about 3 per cent. However, the entire collection will now have to be moved to other buildings, causing new difficulties and delays in the very complex restitution of property. Most of the roof and floors of Schloss Barby, an 18th-century mansion near Magdeburg, were burned out after the attack, which was started in eight separate places, according to a spokesman for the justice ministry in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. 'This was not just some individual pouring a little petrol in a remote corner of the building,' Mr Thomas Ahrens, the spokesman, said. 'This was a rather professional job, carried out in a sophisticated manner.' It was impossible to say whether the arsonist or arsonists were motivated by the desire to destroy individual files, or intended to disrupt the entire property restitution, he said. 'It does not look like the work of a single person. Many people might be annoyed at the whole process of restoring property to former owners, although scarcely enough to try to burn down the entire land registry,' he added. The federal German government has insisted that, wherever possible, property in the east should be restored to its rightful owners, and compensation paid only as a second-best solution. Opposition critics say compensation should be the norm, to prevent the possible eviction of innocent occupants. Before the latest attack, the staff at Barby had been inundated with tens of thousands of requests for titles to properties confiscated before and after the second world war. They were expecting to spend years searching in files which had been stored in damp cellars, and deliberately damaged by the Nazis to destroy evidence of Jewish ownership. The castle was once owned by Prince Heinrich of Saxony. Under the communist regime in East Germany, it was used as a garrison for Soviet troops, then as a hostel for migrant workers from Cuba and Vietnam, and since 1979 as a top-secret registry under the control of the Stasi security police.</p>

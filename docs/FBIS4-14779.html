			<p>BFN     [Text] The position of Armenia on a settlement in Nagorno  Karabakh remains the same. Armenia stands for stable guaranteed  armistice, lifting of the blockade of communications and only  after this negotiations on the political status of Nagorno  Karabakh, the Armenian Supreme Soviet's Chairman, Babken  Ararktsyan, stated after the meeting between Armenian President  Levon Ter-Petrosyan and the CIS Inter-Parliamentary Assembly's  mission. The CIS mission is led by Kyrgyz Parliamentary  Speaker, Meditkan Sherimkulov.    Ararktsyan was satisfied with the negotiations with the CIS  mission held by the Armenian president and the Armenian Supreme  Soviet.    Ararktsyan stressed that it was to give any evaluations to  the negotiations first before the working groups finished  discussion on the issue.    Ararktsyan suggested that the mission's activities in  Nagorno  Karabakh would be of great importance. The mission will leave  for Nagorno Karabakh on April 2. The final stage of the  mission's activities provides for trilateral negotiations  between Armenian, Azerbaijani and Nagorno Karabakh  representatives. Ararktsyan did not rule out that the issue  might also be discussed at the CIS summit in Moscow planned for  April 15.    Sherimkulov told journalists on his way to Yerevan that the  meeting with Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev in Baku on  Friday morning had justified his expectations. "I hoped for a  frank conversation and we had it," Sherimkulov emphasized.    Commenting on the changes introduce to the schedule (the  mission had intended to leave Baku for Stepanakert), Sherimkulov  announced that the Karabakh party had failed to guarantee  security for the mission when crossing the line of  Armenian-Azerbaijani confrontation.    Sherimkulov said the mission would try to go to Karabakh  from  Armenia.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Culinary kids - Cordon bleu for children My most enjoyable gastronomic experiences recently have not been in a renowned dining room or even in a newly-discovered eatery. Instead, they have taken place at Saturday lunchtime around the kitchen table at home, when one of our children has returned from a morning spent at Les Petits Cordons Bleus, the Saturday culinary workshop for children aged 8-14. Our son, William, in his splattered apron and a small chef's hat, brings home two plastic containers with our lunch: mussels in a cream sauce; a delicate fish stew cooked with herbs in a court bouillon; chicken leg, sauce diable and mashed potato; a rillette of salmon with lime that was so delicious a friend insisted on the recipe; and a creamy bread and butter pudding. He has also appeared with florentines, macaroons, brandy snaps, flapjacks and strawberry cheesecake for our tea. These courses began in Paris three years ago and proved so successful that they were adopted by the London branch of Le Cordon Bleu last year. Each session lasts from 10am to 12.30pm and costs Pounds 25. This covers teaching, ingredients - and, effectively, provides lunch for parents. Le Cordon Bleu, 114 Marylebone Lane, London W1M 6HH.

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI MEDICAL CENTER'S LOSSES AND THE HEALTH CARE CRISIS  </P> <P> The plight of the poor and the necessity for medical research and education  have come into horrible conflict in our county. Orange County and the state are  relying on an institution whose primary purpose is to expand knowledge, teach  physicians and improve health care for all of us. The UCI Medical Center cannot  be expected to carry the burden of indigent health care.  </P> <P> How tragic it would be if health care in Orange County deteriorated. How  precarious our lives would become if our only Level 1 trauma center closed, our  nationally recognized burn center shut its doors, our extraordinary neonatal  intensive care facility no longer saved our children.  </P> <P> UCIMC is a precious resource. We should not stand by and watch the crisis in  indigent health care jeopardize an institution whose existence is crucial to  all of the people of Orange County. UCIMC should not become a victim to  circumstances over which it has no control.  </P> <P> MRS. WILLIAM FICKER  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Support Foundation Inc.  </P> <P> UC Irvine College of Medicine  </P></p>

He is joining the board of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi as a non-executive director on October 3. He joined the board of Forte last October Sir Paul, 68, a chartered accountant who joined Glaxo in 1965, is filling a vacancy on the board of the international advertising group left by the planned retirement at the end of the month of Stuart Cameron, a former director of American Brands. Cameron has turned 70 and believes it is now appropriate to step down from the board although he was re-elected for a further term at Saatchi's annual meeting in June. Cameron's job as chairman of Saatchi's nominations committee will be taken by Sir Peter Walters, the former chairman of BP and Midland Bank. However, there is still no word yet on Sir Paul's replacement as chairman of Glaxo, Britain's fifth biggest company.</p>

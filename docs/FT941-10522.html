			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television Did you know that the RAF made regular spy flights over the Soviet Union long before America's U2 spy plane was shot down in 1960? That more than 40 'allied' aircraft were shot down and 250 aircrew lost? That 138 are still unaccounted for, and that relatives are still trying to find out today what happened to them? Timewatch tells the story (8.00 BBC2). In Middlemarch the Lydgates' money worries worsen and when Tertius tries to advertise their house for letting, Rosamond countermands his orders and demands that they move to Bath or London. Flighty hussy. Raffles returns to squeeze more money out of Bulstrode (you knew he would) and Ladislaw discovers the spiteful terms of Casaubon's will (9.30 BBC2). Walk On The Wild Side promises to report on those aspects of youth culture that 'youth programming' tends to ignore. So instead of drink, violence and crime on some Scottish housing estate, this will be about pony clubs and queueing for the Proms? Er, no. This is about drink, violence and crime among teenagers on a Glasgow housing estate (11.05 C4).</p>

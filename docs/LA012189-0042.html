			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PREVIN CONDUCTS BRAHMS REQUIEM  </P> <P> Comparisons can be odious -- but they are also inevitable.  </P> <P> For the third of the 12 programs he leads with the Los Angeles Philharmonic  this season, music director Andre Previn has put together a provocative and  exigent agenda: Benjamin Britten's oft-neglected Sinfonia da Requiem (1940) and  Johannes Brahms' familiar "Ein Deutsches Requiem."  </P> <P> Britten's wondrous, purely instrumental, liturgically based canvas had not been  heard on any Philharmonic concerts since 1971 -- when Lawrence Foster  introduced it to subscribers.  </P> <P> But the Brahms Requiem, last performed at these concerts seven years ago, has  long been a specialty -- as are many Brahms works -- of former music director  Carlo Maria Giulini. On that occasion, in October, 1982, Giulini led it with an  affecting and transcendent sense of calm (his soloists were Kathleen Battle and  Sigmund Nimsgern). Thursday night in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music  Center, the reading achieved by Previn and the Philharmonic, in collaboration  with the Los Angeles Master Chorale and soloists Dawn Upshaw and Thomas  Hampson, went beyond tranquility and resignation, the emotional outer shell of  the work.  </P> <P> In Previn's aggressive but equally sensible approach, Brahms' wide musical arch  became bridged with contrasts, supported by myriad colorful details, integrated  in its formal and textual resonances.  </P> <P> Though broad in scope, this performance never grew noisy or outspoken, never  lacked for continuity. Previn shaped each of its movements in clear  relationship to the others and paced the total masterfully.  </P> <P> The Philharmonic's playing proved as inspired as its leader's vision, and the  L. A. Master Chorale, mellow and sumptuous in sound, textually sensitive,  technically impeccable and abundant in legato, has seldom sung so tellingly.  </P> <P> In the baritone solos, Hampson brought to Brahms' exposed challenges all the  richness of tone, word connection and sensitivity to musical line that seem to  characterize, with equal weight, his international opera and recital  appearances. Upshaw's pure and gorgeous sound, though not invariably used for  text-coloration, added luster to the fifth-movement solo.  </P> <P> Before intermission, Previn and the orchestra gave a vehement, clarified and  potent performance of the Sinfonia da Requiem, another touching installment in  the conductor's ongoing survey of Britten's works.  </P></p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Italians agree new labour deal A NEW national Italian labour agreement was reached on Saturday after 40 days of negotiations between the government, Confindustria - the Confederation of Italian Industries - and the unions. The agreement provides a new framework for industrial relations and wages bargaining following last year's abolition of the Scala Mobile, the cost of living-linked automatic wages escalator established in 1945. Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said the agreement 'certainly contributes' to improving the conditions for the lira's return to the European Monetary System. And though he would not comment directly on the prospects of a reduction in the Italian bank rate, a drop of half or one point in the interest rate was widely expected by economists. The agreement's main points include: A four year national contract to regulate labour relations. Wage increases to be kept within the projected inflation rate and reviewed every two years in light of effective inflation. Individual companies to raise wages only if they have made profits, and on the basis of productivity increases. Government, employers and unions will meet twice a year to define common objectives on inflation, GNP and employment levels. Once a national contract has expired and in the period in which a new one is being negotiated, only limited increases will be allowed for inflation. The hiring of trainees and apprentices will be simplified. Companies will also be able to hire staff on a temporary basis from new agencies to be created to 'rent out' labour. Labour Minister Gino Giugni termed the agreement a 'constitution for industrial relations' which brought Italy closer to the northern European model for industrial bargaining. It would, he said, have positive effects on inflation, employment and public finances. The parts regarding trainees and apprentices and temporary workers were alone expected to create 200,000 jobs.</p>

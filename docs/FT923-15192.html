			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Sims Food rises 13% to Pounds 9.3m - Current year warning trims 25p from share price SIMS FOOD Group, the meat processor and supplier, yesterday tempered its announcement of continued growth in profits and turnover in the year to March 31 with the caveat that 'the opening weeks of our current year have continued the disappointing trend seen in the final quarter of last year.' The shares fell 25p to 250p. Mr John Stone, chairman, said flat demand in the retail side, increasing prices for livestock and supermarket-driven pressure on margins were all factors in the downturn, although he expected the effect to be short term, impacting mainly on the current first-half results. Pre-tax profits for the year under review expanded 13 per cent to Pounds 9.31m (Pounds 8.22m) after exceptional charges of Pounds 403,000, relating to compensation to three departing board members. With turnover up 10 per cent to Pounds 251.4m (Pounds 228m) and operating profits ahead 19 per cent at Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 9.54m), margins improved from 4.2 to 4.5 per cent. Consumption of meat was down, Mr Stone said, with volume purchases down 3 to 5 per cent, though the amount consumers spent on meat was up. However, he warned that the recession was 'far from over'. The catering division had suffered most with an organic decline in turnover of 12 per cent as consumers ate out less. Capital expenditure stood at Pounds 10m, but is expected to fall to Pounds 5m-Pounds 6m in the current year. Some Pounds 3.5m was spent upgrading plants to meet the Common European Standard on meat production and especially abattoirs, and Pounds 5.5m went on new capacity, particularly dedicated plants for specific supermarket chains. Following November's Pounds 13.5m rights issue, gearing fell to 22 per cent (50 per cent) at the year-end and net debt to Pounds 8m. Withdrawal from the chicken abattoir and food machinery agency businesses led to extraordinary charges of Pounds 1.96m while earnings rose to 23.4p (22.3p) per share. A final dividend of 8.25p is proposed, giving a total of 11.25p (10.25p).</p>

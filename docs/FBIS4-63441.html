			<p>BFN     [Text] An officer from the Georgian Defense Ministry press  center said in an interview with Interfax that the reports on  the armed clashes between the Georgian and Abkhazian formations  in the Inguri River on May 19 evening given by the Abkhazian  military departments was "more misinformation."    The Georgian Defense Ministry press center affirmed that  yesterday there had been no military action on the line of  confrontation between the Georgian and Abkhazian troops. The  same source suggested that the misinformation was aimed at  torpedoing the peace settlement and hampering the return of  Georgian refugees to Abkhazia.    The Abkhazian Defense Ministry announced this morning that  two Georgian formations had tried to break through the Abkhazian  troops near the Inguri River Hydro Electric Power Station. The  Georgian formations had met resistance and had been forced to  retreat. One Abkhazian soldier was killed and two wounded.    As a result all Abkhazian armed forces were put on alert.    The Abkhazian government stated that there had been more  provocations on the part of Georgia. A total of seven Abkhazian  servicemen had been killed by Georgian sabotage militants in May  alone.    The Abkhazian government stressed that such actions were  violating the Moscow agreements and laying the peace settlement  open to violations.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Phillimore goes in Minorco shake-up MR ROGER Phillimore, a joint managing director of Minorco, the Luxembourg quoted overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, is to leave the company, having lost a contest for the chief executive's role. Minorco effectively has had three managing directors. Mr Phillimore, 42, and Mr Tony Lea, 42, were joint managing directors, and Mr Hank Slack, 41, was president. The company has opted for a simplified management structure, with Mr Slack as chief executive. He will operate with a management committee and be based in London. Mr Lea remains on the Minorco board and will be taking a senior position - so far unspecified - with Anglo in Johannesburg next year. Analysts noted that Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson remains chairman of Anglo, its sister company, De Beers, and Minorco, in spite of some recent criticism from the investment community. Mr Lea, Mr Phillimore and Mr Slack took over at Minorco in 1988 with a plan to change it into a 'hands on' operating group. They launched a Pounds 2.9bn (Dollars 4.4bn) bid for Consolidated Gold Fields of the UK and, since this failed, have been using the Pounds 1.5bn raised from selling Gold Fields' shares for less adventurous acquisitions. Minorco is also renewing links with SG Warburg, broken at the time of the 1988 Gold Fields bid because Warburg faced a conflict of interest. Mr Peter Wilmot-Sitwell, chairman of S G Warburg Securities, is joining the Minorco board as a non-executive director. Mr Peter Burnell, formerly managing director of Anglo's South American operations, is also joining the Minorco board. See Observer</p>

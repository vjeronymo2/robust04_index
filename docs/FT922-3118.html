			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Perot faces moment of truth: Little old lady upsets apple cart of the master of folksy aphorisms MOMENTS OF political truth do not often happen on sunny Thursday mornings in June, but there is no reason why they should not. One may have happened to Mr Ross Perot just after eight east coast time yesterday. The prospective independent candidate for the White House had breezed through the first hour on Today, NBC TV's breakfast time show, taking calls from the public and some questions from Katie Couric, the presenter. He had happily agreed to blast away for an extra hour, intent on upsetting the establishment apple cart. Then an obviously elderly woman asked a seemingly innocuous question: Mr Perot did not really want to take away social security benefits from retired people with incomes of more than Dollars 60,000 a year, did he? The Perot response was, to put it mildly, involved. It began with an accusation that the Bush administration was maligning him, it digressed into a discussion he had had four years ago with 'a prominent national economist' about 1988 figures which now needed updated computerised number crunching. It wandered into the fact that he was wealthy enough himself not to need social security, it invoked the spirit of hope in the musical Annie, and it said old people were always making sacrifices for the young. At the end of which, the little old lady, asked by a bemused Ms Couric if she was satisfied, bravely said: 'I don't think he really answered the question.' This set Mr Perot off again on the same tack. 'If people say 'I've got mine and the heck with you' then we're all sunk.' But his eyes had narrowed and he did not look pleased that someone who was not a professional journalist had dared to demur from what he had himself proclaimed to be the self-evident truth. Talk-and-celebrity show app-earances are now de rigueur for political candidates. Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas is doing it all the time and this week the White House confirmed that President George Bush had agreed to appear on two such programmes, one with his wife, Barbara, when he returns from Rio. Mr Perot is a master of the folksy aphorism and yesterday's performance was stuffed with them. The balanced budget amendment now before Congress 'is an excuse not to do anything'. And again: 'We throw away more money than we print right now.' Mr Bush, he said, sent delegations to Iraq before the Gulf war 'to burp, diaper and pamper Saddam Hussein'. National health care reform was 'like buying a new car - you check it out'. But glints of real policy also shine through the soundbites and one clear element of Mr Perot's is going to be to blame pernicious foreigners for many of America's domestic ills. Thus, borrowing from the well-known anti-Japanese polemicist, Mr Pat Choate, he squarely put the blame for the plight of American dairy farmers on foreign interests. His words yesterday bear quoting at length. 'Make it illegal for foreign nations, foreign companies, foreign individuals, to lobby the US Congress or to get money directly or indirectly in any way, and make it illegal for former government officials to cash in by making Dollars 25,000 or Dollars 30,000 a month lobbying for foreign countries,' he said. Americans like this sort of language, more, at present, than Mr Bush's contradictions and Mr Clinton's finely measured wordiness. But like the little old lady worried about her social security, not everybody yet understands - or agrees with - Ross Perot.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by General Fernando Ochoa Antich, Venezuela's </F> former defense and foreign minister: "The Coup d'Etat"]    [Text] I read Hilarion Cardozo's statements with great  interest, not only because of their striking content but because  he has always accurately interpreted the Venezuelan military's  thinking and feelings. His position is clear. He says there  are three groups in the Armed Forces. The first one, described  as conservative, will follow ideas similar to the ones endorsed  by the 27 November coup leaders and which are close to economic  right-wing groups. Another one is located, as far as I  understand, in the organization's middle ranks and has  progressive tendencies. It maintains contacts with radical  groups in our political sector. A third group prefers to give  the Caldera government the military strength to face the current  crisis. Cardozo is right. Three groups exist and have existed  in the Armed Forces since 1958.    We recall the initial efforts of Rodolfo Jose Cardenas, the  right-wing trend of the conspiracy against Luis Herrera, and the  first basis of military support for Romulo Betancourt when he  decided to put a stop to leftist congressmen of the era  following the Encanto train attack. I believe it is necessary to  clairfy Cardozo's proposal. Two groups have always existed in  the Armed Forces, united by a national feeling: one, a majority  devoid of political passion, which carries out its professional  military job, and the other, which thinks the Armed Forces is  the path to power.    What Cardozo failed to explain in his statement is that the  politically-influenced group requires sufficient social  deterioration to convince the majority of the Armed Forces of  the need for a coup d'etat. Without those special conditions  existing in the country, a coup simply would fail and would not  be more than a coffee shop conspiracy. President Caldera and  his government have sufficient political experience to prevent  the forming of support around the minority group that might  stage such a coup d'etat. I am certain of that. What does  concern me is the vast popular unrest that exists against the  leadership sectors for maintaining excessive privileges and  unbridled ambitions. We Venezuelans blame that leadership for  the misguided administration of the country. Until 1970, we had  faith in creating a modern, developed, and different society.  Expectations ended in utter failure and frustration. That  perception permeated the Armed Forces and was the cause of the 4  February and 27 November coups. The prospect that Rafael  Caldera would come to power, with all his moral authority and  abilities, calmed the country during those historic moments and  again created new confidence in the Armed Forces. That is the  true origin of the existing institutional stability.    Certainly, Rafael Caldera must reestablish a national  consensus to avert a coup d'etat. Hilarion Cardozo is clear on  this, but he does not interpret or say this consensus can only  be secured by achieving profound national change. That is the  government's dilemma. If it does not face the existing  political, financial, labor, and judicial state of affairs and  continues with sweeping reforms, popular resentment will again  infiltrate the Armed Forces' ranks, creating the climate for a  coup d'etat -- hence the real fear of Hilarion Cardozo and  traditional party leaderships. They know the first obligation  of a politician, moreso if he is a chief of state, is to  preserve power. What will Rafael Caldera do if he feels that  the very basis of his government is threatened? Will he permit  a climate for conspiracy or, on the other hand, will he prefer  to lead the national resentment, conducting the big changes  required by the country? Only time will tell.</p>

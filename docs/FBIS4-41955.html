			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Anatoliy Krasnov and </F> Vladimir Solntsev]    [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun -- PRC President Jiang Zemin, who  will pay an official visit to Russia in September, will discuss  with Russian President Boris Yeltsin the question of  how,"looking towards the 21st century, from the point of view of  a strategic perspective, to build the future" of bilateral  relations. This was stated today by Qian Qichen, PRC vice  premier and foreign minister, who is in Moscow on an official  visit, speaking at Moscow State University.    The head of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that the  results of Boris Yeltsin's visit to China in December 1992  "initiated a new era in Sino-Russian relations." The minister  noted that he was "very pleased" with today's meeting with the  Russian president.    "China's consistent policy regarding development of  relations  with Russia," he said, "is based on the fact that it fully  respects the choice of the Russian people and always aims at  developing long-term and stable relations of neighborliness,  friendship, and mutual cooperation on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful coexistence, regardless of how the  domestic situation in Russia might change." The minister said he  was absolutely certain that China and Russia "must and will  definitely be friends for a long time to come."    The minister said that the views of Moscow and Beijing  "either coincide or are similar" on many very important  international problems. He stressed that China "is not taking  part in the arms race or any military alliances. And it neither  does nor will lay claim to hegemony anywhere or ever -- either  now or subsequently, when it becomes a powerful country."  [sentence as received]    The head of the Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed a rather  skeptical view regarding the possibility of a direct transfer of  the experience of Chinese reforms to Russian soil. "China's  experience is applicable only to the specific conditions of our  country. Russia's reality is different from that of the PRC," he  said. At the same time, the minister expressed readiness to  develop contacts in the sphere of the implementation of reforms,  having noted that it is useful for both countries to exchange  and to borrow experience from one another. He said he was  certain that "Russia will undoubtedly find a path of development  suitable to its own reality. It will definitely overcome the  current temporary difficulties and will be able to restore its  economy."    Qian Qichen admitted that in the conditions of rapid  development of Russian-Chinese contacts "some problems have  arisen." The most important is "incidents where a few criminals  cross the border and engage in criminal activities, or where  unscrupulous traders sell fake and inferior goods for a quick  profit." The minister stressed that Chinese Government is  prepared "to cooperate with Russia in taking legal measures  against Chinese citizens who violate Russian laws."    According to Qian Qichen, the Chinese people "are thinking  about and are doing only one thing: developing the country's  economy is their major aim." He stressed the need for the  gradual implementation of reform while maintaining social and  political stability and avoiding social unrest. The minister  dismissed claims that China "is only implementing economic but  not political reforms" as "misunderstanding."    According to Qian Qichen, claims that China has become the  world's third economic superpower also "do not correspond to  reality." "We believe that China continues to be among the less  well-off developing countries and it will take efforts of  several generations to make it a medium-developed country." The  minister recalled that the Chinese reforms have been carried for  "only 15 years." "It will take another 20 to 30 years to create  a complex of more mature and complete systems," he said.</p>

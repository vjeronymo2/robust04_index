			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tougher entrance qualifications would reduce student numbers Sir, Your editorial, 'Open universities' (March 4) confronts the problem of limited government funds for universities and the likely denial of places to students wanting them. Your solution is to make students repay, in the future out of their enhanced earnings, some of their tuition fees. If you actually worked in a university, particularly one of the 'new' ones (ex-polytechnics etc), you might well see the problem rather differently. Seen from inside, the central fact is that in recent years there has been great pressure from the government (mediated through vice-chancellors, deans and so on, all on performance-related pay) to increase student numbers. This has been achieved, first, by recruiting anyone who could be found with remotely plausible qualifications (a couple of E grades at A level, for example), and, second, by retaining those students whom one has got, almost regardless of performance. The latter aim is achieved, among other methods, by partially replacing exams with a mandatory minimum of 'continuous assessment', that is project work done in the students' own time but all too often not by their own unaided effort. Added to all this is a Department of Education-inspired culture which regards all failures by students to complete their courses as 'wastage' which reflects badly on the university concerned. The result is a recipe for the production of great numbers of poorly qualified graduates who may well never achieve the higher incomes from which they will supposedly repay their fees. If numbers are now to be limited, the best way to do it, both for the sake of equity and for the restoration of the quality of higher education, is to toughen entrance qualifications. This should be to the point where getting into university is once again seen by a young person's family and friends, as it used to be, as a significant achievement rather than just a way of keeping away from the dole queue. Exams should also be toughened within the universities to the point where graduation is again seen by employers as evidence of that young person's ability to work effectively, to reason accurately, and to write grammatical English.

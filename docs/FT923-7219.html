			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: New chief appointed at Hickson HICKSON International, the chemicals group which has been subjected to two years of management upheaval, yesterday named Mr Dennis Kerrison, former chief operating officer, as its new chief executive. Sir Gordon Jones, who became chairman in June last year, said the appointment of Mr Kerrison left Hickson with a 'very strong professional board'. There would be 'no more madcap schemes, and no more major acquisitions,' he said, referring to Hickson's 19 purchases between 1985 and 1989. Mr Kerrison replaces Mr Ken Schofield, who retired in May after just 18 months in the post. Mr Schofield was responsible for launching a disposal programme to refocus the group on its core chemicals businesses. The appointment was announced as the group reported more than doubled interim profits of Pounds 16.9m, aided by lower interest charges. The pre-tax outcome compared with Pounds 7.9m last time, although this had been struck after a Pounds 6.2m exceptional charge for losses on disposals and restructuring costs. Interest charges fell from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 960,000, and gearing was 18.2 per cent. The ratio of debt to equity had been reduced from 134 per cent through the Pounds 70m rights issue in September last year. Disposals depressed turnover, which fell from Pounds 214m to Pounds 162.4m for the six months to June 30. Like-for like sales rose by 3 per cent. Similarly, operating profit fell by 4 per cent to 17.7m, due to disposals. In the first half, Hickson added a further Pounds 2m in extra-ordinary charges to the Pounds 9.6m taken last year, to provide for losses on disposals. The company plans to sell the two remaining floor covering operations. The best performance came from protection and coatings, which increased profits by 12 per cent to Pounds 3.8m. 'Previously, when Hickson made some of these acquisitions, the company did not manage them,' said Mr Kerrison. The main fine chemicals operation increased profits by 4 per cent to Pounds 7.5m. Earnings per share rose from 5.57p to 7.44p. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.85p. COMMENT Sir Gordon is very aware that the City wants to be convinced about the credibility of the new management team. Until then, Hickson has little hope  - or even intention  - of returning to shareholders for more cash. The latest appointment will be seen as the final seal on what should be a more stable era. Meanwhile, these results show a respectable performance, albeit largely due to a rescue rights issue. In the short-term, the group sees no sign of an upturn, and further difficult trading in the US. In the longer-term, the acquisition of Angus Fine Chemicals in July will provide good growth from 1993. Annual forecasts were revised downwards following the group's cautious comments on the second half from about Pounds 35m to Pounds 31.5m. The shares fell in tandem, from 188p to 174p. On a prospective p/e of about 13 times, the shares appear to be a better investment for long-termers.</p>

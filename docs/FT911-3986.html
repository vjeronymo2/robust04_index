			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Dublin hint of shift on claim to Ulster MR GERRY COLLINS, foreign minister of the Irish Republic, has hinted that his country's constitutional claim on Northern Ireland could be up for negotiation when talks on the province's future start on April 30. British and Irish ministers will meet this week for the last conference meeting under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement before the April 30 talks, arranged by Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary. Mr Collins said on BBC Radio in Belfast yesterday that the talks could well include Unionist leaders' deep-seated concern about Articles two and three of the republic's constitution, which lay claim to the north. The talks will cover a successor to the 1985 agreement and devolution. 'There is no restriction on anybody to raise any matter they want,' Mr Collins said, adding that he expected a 'vibrant and open' dialogue. His comments come amid hopeful signs of mutual goodwill among all parties involved in the talks, but optimism is tempered severely by an appreciation of the sectarian differences in Northern Ireland. Mr Collins said that if talks succeeded, 'the reason for the terrorists' existence will no longer be there'. Mr Brooke told businessmen in the US last week that he thought success was a 'possibility' rather than a probability. Northern Ireland's political parties have been busy preparing - mostly in secret - position papers for the talks which will see Unionist and nationalist leaders meeting for the first time in 15 years. Each side is expected soon to nominate a three-man negotiating team plus seven in support. Friday's meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference has deliberately been kept short although the agenda includes recent allegations over leaks to IRA terrorists by the Irish police, the economy, tourism and transport issues, as well as the political talks. Conference meetings under the 1985 pact have been abhorred by Unionists because of the influence they are seen to give to the republic's government in the affairs of the province. The round-table discussions will start with bilateral talks between Mr Brooke and all the parties, followed by plenary sessions in Belfast on devolution. Friday's meeting is expected to consider the location of the subsequent strands of the talks, which include alternatives to the 1985 agreement. The aim is to cover 'the totality of relations' within Ireland and with the UK. No points will be agreed until a complete package is in place. The Northern Ireland Office is offering administrative back-up to the political parties involved - the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, the Alliance party, the Democratic Unionist party and the Ulster Unionist party. Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, said at the weekend that it was the 'last chance' for some of Northern Ireland's senior politicians to take part in what could be a historic settlement, a thinly veiled reference to Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, veteran leaders of the Ulster Unionist and Democratic Unionist parties respectively.</p>

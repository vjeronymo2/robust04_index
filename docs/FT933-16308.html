			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Exchange rates main factor in European car price comparisons: The European Market - European motorists are paying not for profiteering but for the industry's lack of competitiveness On May 1 this year Italy and Spain were easily the cheapest markets in which to buy most new car models, according to the first comparative European Community price lists for selected new cars, published last week at the behest of the European Commission. A year earlier, the Commission's own study showed Spain as the highest priced market, with Italy third highest. Early last year UK consumer groups were vocal in their condemnation of the excessively high prices asked of British motorists; Last week's lists show the British market to be the cheapest in Europe for many executive and luxury cars, and about the EC average for many 'ordinary' vehicles. What has happened to change the picture? The answer to the past year's price upheavals disclosed by the lists is to be found almost entirely within the currency markets - as the Brussels-based industry lobby group, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, leaped to point out the moment the comparisons were published. What they have demonstrated conclusively, the EAMA trumpets, is that it is unrealistic to make meaningful price comparisons - let alone have 'harmonised' prices - when some currencies remain so volatile. Between July last year and the middle of May, the main EMS currencies - German, French, Belgian, Dutch and Danish - rose 22 per cent against the lira (briefly touching 32 per cent in April), 20 per cent against the peseta, 17 per cent against sterling and 15 per cent against the Portuguese escudo. 'Manufacturers - particularly non-local manufacturers - cannot be expected to make instant double-digit price changes,' the EAMA contends. The lists come as close as possible to comparing 'like for like' in terms of models and prices. They provide information on 55 European and 17 Japanese popular models, based on recommended retail prices, adjusted for equipment differences and with prices given in local currencies both before and after tax. Supplements for options such as air conditioning and power steering are given, as well as the premium for right-hand-drive models for the UK market. Differentials are arrived at by converting the local currency prices into Ecus. As an EC-wide comparison, the lists have inbuilt compromises. One is that they take no account of the widely varying discounts available in individual markets. More important, the lists exclude Denmark and Greece, because local taxation  -of over 100 per cent - is seen as excessively depressing pre-tax prices. But Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal are included even though national taxation in each can add 50 per cent to the cost of a new car. Manufacturers selling in these countries, too, have a strong incentive to keep pre-tax prices down in order not to have tax-inclusive prices beyond the reach of consumers. Given such an obvious distortion, the Commission indicated after last year's report that governments with such high tax regimes would have to be 'leaned on' to reduce such large obstacles to the internal EC trade in cars. But so far, there is no real sign that Brussels is doing any leaning. And until there is, the underlying probability remains that one government's high tax take on a car, and the manufacturer's low pre-tax price in that market in order to sell it, stand to be subsidised by a higher pre-tax price (and fatter manufacturer profit margin) in relatively low-tax countries like the UK, where the only tax now paid on a new car purchase is the standard 17.5 per cent VAT. And that consideration underlines the biggest flaw in the EC's drive for price 'transparency'. The lists should let consumers see at a glance roughly what they can expect to pay for given models in Europe's main markets and where they might most fruitfully go for the best deal. Thus they now know that, for example, that there is no point going to Germany to buy an Audi 100, because it is cheaper in the UK than anywhere else. On the other hand, they could save up to 35 per cent by buying various Fiats, Rovers, Vauxhalls and Volkswagens in Italy. And with even consumer groups acknowledging that manufacturers are being less obstructive towards private cross-border purchases, taking advantage of cheaper markets should be no problem. But the lists cannot tell consumers what they should pay in each market, based on the fundamentals of manufacturers and their dealers receiving an equitable return on investment. Not surprisingly, no manufacturer wants to disclose its exact profit - or loss - margin on each car in individual markets, particularly if, as is almost certainly the case, low-tax countries are shown to be higher-margin ones. But given the sea of red ink washing over most European producers, the tendency of consumer groups to see profiteering round every corner strikes a jarring note with many industry analysts. As a number of studies have already shown, European car prices as a whole are high measured against those of Japan and North America. What this year's plunge in the European new car market has exposed is the signal failure of much of Europe's car industry properly to attack costs and efficiency during the boom years of the 1980s. The bottom line appears to be that Europe's motorists are paying the price not of profiteering but of the European industry's lack of competitiveness and the disparities in EC taxation and currency regimes.</p>

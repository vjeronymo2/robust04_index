			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ISRAEL;  </P> <P> HELP IN ABSORBING SOVIET JEWS SOUGHT  </P> <P> Simcha Dinitz, a leading Israeli immigration official, said the government  should seek at least $3 billion in grants from the United States and Germany to  help pay the costs of absorbing Soviet Jews. Officials predict that an  estimated 1 million Soviet Jews will arrive in Israel by the end of 1992, with  more than 92,000 having arrived since the start of this year. Dinitz, chairman  of the Jewish Agency, told Israel Radio that the Jewish community worldwide  must make greater contributions and the government must tighten its belt to  absorb the newcomers.  </P></p>

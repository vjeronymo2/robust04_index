			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: Fiat sets up loan to cushion heavy spending FIAT, Italy's biggest private company, will sign a L2,000bn (Dollars 1.29bn) stand-by loan next week to bolster its finances at a time of large-scale spending. The deal, to be led by Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, will come in two tranches of L1,000bn covering maturities of 18 months and five years. Terms for the transaction and the names of the banks involved will be revealed next week. The new facility will provide an extra cushion to meet the needs of the group's L46,000bn investment programme between 1992 and 1996. About L28,000bn of the total is being spent on the cars side, where Fiat has announced a new model programme. Investment spending on cars will use a further L12,000bn between 1997 and 1999, while the company may also announce further spending during that period for other industrial activities. Fiat's investments have already had a big impact on finances. Its net financial position, which surged to a deficit of L3,849bn at the end of 1992, could reach L10,000bn by end-December. Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman, has said Fiat would try to alleviate the effect of continued heavy investments by selling non-strategic assets.</p>

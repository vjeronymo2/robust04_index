Mikhail Poltoranin Is Ready To  Give Them Other Channels' Programs"]    [Text] The State Duma has also taken to heart "the  questions of objective coverage" that used to concern the  Supreme Soviet. The Committee for Information Policy and  Communications under Mikhail Poltoranin has drawn up a draft  State Duma decree designed to resolve the problem of television  coverage of the State Duma's activity. In order to persuade the  deputies to approve the decree, Mr. Poltoranin has promised them  that a corresponding law will be enacted by 21 March. In  addition, the deputies have been offered as a present one-third  of the entire capacity of the "RTV-Parliament" complex left from  the Supreme Soviet. The government and the Federation Council  will also take over one-third each.    These abstract projects do not suit the deputies, however,  who want to make their own television program. Mr. Poltoranin's  committee has suggested that before the law is enacted they use  a "provisional broadcasting schedule." The schedule, Mikhail  Poltoranin said, which has already been approved by chiefs of  the "Russia" and "Ostankino" channels, will give the deputies a  good half of political programs. Aside from reports on the  State Duma's deliberations on the "Russia" channel every Friday  and daily reports in the "Vesti" and "Novosti" programs, it is  planned to oblige other programs, such as "How We Are Going To  Live," "Sirs-Comrades," "A Dialogue Live," and "The Peasants'  Question," to give the floor to deputies, and also to have  programs such as "Details," "Man and the Law," and so forth,  feature "burning reports."    It is possible that the deputies will accept so "generous" a  present from Mr. Poltoranin today. The chairman of the  Committee for Information Policy and Communications, however,  has not offered them anything new. It should be noted that even  the fact that the television programs are state-owned does not  entitle the State Duma to interfere in their authors' activity.  This does not seem to be of great concern to Deputy Mikhail  Poltoranin, who is trying to push a pig in a poke on his  colleagues.    State Duma members themselves, as they urge "objective  coverage," to all appearances will accept air time in other  people's programs without any guarantees, meanwhile drafting a  law on how their own activity should be covered. This process  may drag on and on, so television viewers are for the time being  insured against a torrent of State Duma broadcasts.</p>

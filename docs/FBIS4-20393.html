Responsible editor: Sun Ye (1327 0396)]    [Text] The resolution of the 14th CPC National Congress to  the effect that establishment of the socialist market economy  shall be the target of the reform indicates that China has  entered a new phase in its transition from the highly  centralized system of planned economy to market economy, a  system abounding in vigor and vitality. Energetic pursuit of  the new forms and new tasks of developing the socialist market  economy entails the need for our party to deal with  circumstances and conditions that are different from those of  the past. As a consequence, party building will have to face  extremely complex and very special contradictions. The urgent  and effective resolution of these new and particular  contradictions is of important theoretical and actual  significance for the strengthening of party building, for the  enhancement of party guidance, for the socialist modernization  with Chinese characteristics, and for the development of all  undertakings of reform and opening to the outside world.    First Contradiction: The contradiction between the complex  composition of the party membership and society, on the one  hand, and the unanimous call for progress by the party  membership, on the other hand.    The political party is the organization and political  representation of the class; the composition of the party  membership is directly and closely related to the particular  economic structure of the society and to the class and strata of  this society. As China is now developing a market economy and  establishing this new system of market economy while it is still  at the initial stage of socialism and possessing only backward  and unevenly developed productive forces, the realities of  China's situation demand, objectively, the development of a  pluralistic economic structure, where the system of public  ownership and distribution according to work are the primary  constituents and where other economic sectors and distribution  methods are supplementary. With the advances in China's reform  and the extended existence and common development of pluralistic  economic components, changes in China's economic structure will  become more widespread and thoroughgoing. The complex changes of  the economic structure will naturally result in changes in the  component members of China's society and particularly in the  composition of its strata, and it will furthermore, to a certain  extent, have an effect on the economic composition of the party  membership. For instance, in the actual present-day economic  life, changes have already occurred in the economic relations of  some party members, as some party members have distanced  themselves from the original public ownership economy, are  engaging in individual economy, private-run economy, or  foreign-financed economies. There are others who are engaged in  individual and other kinds of economies who are now joining the  ranks of party members. If we compare the complexity of the  present social composition and economic relations of party  members with the artificially changed production relations prior  to the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee,  the much too early elimination of nonpublic ownership economic  sectors and the social composition of party members with the  corresponding conditions of the unitary economic structure of  the public ownership system (ownership by the whole people,  ownership by the collective) and the unitary class and strata  structure (workers, peasants, intellectuals), the situation now  certainly appears not as "pure" and "simple" as in the past. We  have to affirm that the complexity of the social composition and  economic relations of party members has adapted to the nature  and condition of China's socialist force at the present stage.  However, due to the special circumstances and specific  influences of different economic relations, it was not possible  to prevent that some party members--though with the precondition  of uniformity of basic standards and demands for  progress--engender certain divergences with regard to the extent  of their political consciousness, awareness of the social  stratification, value concepts, and methods of actions to be  taken. The Chinese Communist Party is the vanguard of the  Chinese working class; the demands of the party and those of  each party member are essentially identical. The Party  Constitution prescribes: Members of the CPC are vanguard  fighters of the Chinese working class. They are imbued with  communist consciousness, they must serve the people  wholeheartedly, must be ready to make any personal sacrifices,  and must dedicate their lives to the realization of communism.  In view of the complex social composition of the party  membership under the conditions of market economy, a problem  that we are now faced with and that must under no circumstances  be ignored, a problem in matters of party building, is how to  bring onto one denominator the exemplary role and the particular  demands of party members in the different economic sectors, and  how to achieve conformity of their actual actions in their  various individual economic activities, a conformity with the  prescribed standards of party membership. A related problem is  how to set up and run party organizations in different economic  sectors and to develop the functions of their particular  specialties so that they may also conform with the demands of  the party organization. This too has to be carefully explored in  actual practice.    Second Contradiction: The contradiction between the  complexity of the party-masses relationship under the conditions  of market economy, on the one hand, and the fundamental identity  of party and masses interests, on the other hand.    The Chinese Communist Party is the faithful representative  of  the interests of the Chinese people of all nationalities. The  lofty ideal of every member of the CPC is to serve the people  wholeheartedly, without regard for special personal interests.  Precisely because this is so, the party has always maintained  flesh-and-blood ties with the masses during the protracted  periods of revolution and construction, and has evolved the  excellent tradition and working style of relying on the masses  and closely linking up with the masses. As we are presently  energetically promoting the socialist market economy, we must  push on with the liberation and development of the productive  forces, impel all-round progress in society, and bring happiness  and prosperity to the masses. On a foundation of this kind, the  relationship between the party and the masses is bound to become  even closer. However, the energetic development of market  economy, especially in its initial stages, may manifest some  complex relationships between party and the masses. This has  easily led to many contradictions between the party and the  masses, as well as between party cadres and the masses,  contradictions that are characteristic for the market economy,  and it is these contradictions that have generally manifested  themselves particularly openly and visibly.    The party-masses relationship is after all one of interests,  and its fundamental demand is that the party faithfully  represent, and make every effort to realize, the interests of  the broad masses of the people. Enduring, stable, and close  party-masses relations are built on a certain objective material  basis and on the foundation of common interests, and these  comprise present vested interests as well as also the pursuit  and expectations of future interests. Reform, opening to the  outside world, and market economy have stirred up much  enthusiasm and creativity among the broad masses, to increase  economic production and to strive for prosperity. In the  practical execution of the reform by the entire party and the  entire society, material interests and economic interests have  become the important problems that have now most of everyone's  attention. Development of the socialist market economy is, of  course, apt to bring immediate and long-term benefits for all,  including party members, but it is not possible to provide these  benefits simultaneously and equally for all, some will still  temporarily remain without certain benefits. Especially during  the initial stage of the developing market economy, when certain  of its aspects have not yet matured and perfected, it is  particularly difficult to avoid that certain contradictions will  show up with regard to material benefits, and this can, in turn,  become the cause of increasing dissatisfaction and louder voices  of discontent among the masses. If it were the case that all of  us party members, especially party members who are cadres in  leading positions, would lack the mass viewpoint, would have  inflated selfish desires, would misuse powers for private gain,  show unhealthy tendencies, or even be party to all kinds of  corrupt practices, this would with certainty aggravate the  contradictions among the masses and add to the conflicts with  the masses. Development of the market economy is bringing with  it certain complex circumstances that affect the party-masses  relation. They demand of us that we earnestly and effectively  set about the task of party building in all its various aspects,  and that we energetically explore how to utilize, under the new  situation, the mechanism of the market to harmonize and resolve  the contradictions in mentalities and in ways of doing things  within the party-masses and cadre-masses relations. We must  also, one step further, consolidate the flesh-and-blood ties  between the party and the masses.    Third Contradiction: The contradiction between the  complexity  of inner-party contradictions under the conditions of market  economy, on the one hand, and the unity of party ideology and  party organization, on the other hand.    As the vanguard contingent of the working class, the party  is--like everything else--an entity consisting of complex  contradictions. Inner-party contradictions reflect the objective  realities of society, as these contradictions manifest  themselves in different forms under different conditions. The  inner-party contradictions under the new situation manifest  themselves roughly in the following three respects:    First, contradictions of ideology and political  consciousness. This refers mainly to various divergences in  ideology and political consciousness engendered by the sharp  collision and confrontation of new and old thoughts and  concepts, and of the new and old modes of thinking, among party  members during the period of China's social remolding. This  remolding progresses from seclusion to opening up, from natural  and semi-natural economy to commodity economy, and from the  planned economy system to the system of socialist market  economy. It is an inevitable trend of conflicts involving  inner-party ideological and conceptual contradictions that they  will adapt to the demands of the new ideology and new concepts  of socialized large-scale production and market economy  development. They will gradually take the place of the old  ideology of small-scale production methods combined with the  planned economy system. With intensified development of market  economy, and the continuous manifestation of its superiority,  there will gradually be no more market for those "Leftist" or  rightist things. However, we must not overlook the fact that as  a consequence of the intensified reform and the broadening of  opening to the outside world, the value concepts of members of  the CPC may become exposed to assaults from Western pluralistic  value concepts, and may be invaded by various decadent feudal  and bourgeois ideologies, which may make it difficult to  maintain a high degree of ideological uniformity throughout the  entire party.    Second, contradictions in the course of practice. The  development of socialist market economy is placing a new task  before the members of the CPC. It requires liberation of minds,  seeking truth from facts, opening up new paths and creating new  things, study of the new situation, resolving new problems,  creating new experiences, and setting up a new system. The  difficulties of accomplishing this new task in the course of  actual practice can well be imagined. It will of course entail  large contradictions and problems, and be the cause of many  differing opinions and differing outlooks in the work to be  performed. Under these conditions, it will certainly be  difficult to keep the entire party altogether in step.    Third, contradictions of inner-part interests. The Party  Constitution prescribes that party members must accept the  interests of the party as the uppermost concern in life. The  individual interests of every CPC member must unconditionally be  subordinated to the interests of the party and the people. The  party organization, on the other hand, must also be solicitous  of and show consideration for the individual interests of the  party members; this is a fundamental rule for the settlement of  contradictions involving inner-party interests. Reform has set  in motion an interest-promoting mechanism among the people, a  mechanism working for liberation and development of productive  forces, and the long-suppressed individual-profit consciousness  has become liberated among all members of the society, including  the members of the CPC. Now, the individual interests of party  members are indeed also prominently put forward for due  consideration, and are frequently, publicly, and "sensibly"  arrayed on par with the interests of the party and the people.  In the past, some party members would have been ashamed to bring  up openly demands for consideration of individual interests, but  now they dare discuss and put forward such demands. They even  dare to "haggle over prices," and in some cases even create  certain "confrontational" situations in questions of inner-party  interests. Contradictions between individual party members, on  the one hand, and the party and the people, on the other hand,  are fundamental factors that actually -- under the conditions of  market economy -- adversely affect the cohesion within the  party, and its attractiveness and fighting strength. If these  contradictions are therefore not effectively resolved, it will  be impossible for the party to maintain a high degree of unity  in ideological, political, organizational, and operational  respects. It will then also be impossible to shoulder the  leadership responsibilities for reform and opening up and for  the socialist modernizations. Under the new situation, the  complexity of the inner-party contradictions not only increases  the difficulties for party building, difficulties that have to  be overcome within the body of the party itself, it also  provides party building with an enhanced impetus for efforts to  resolve the internal contradictions and for continuous  self-perfection and self-development.    In this new historical era, the circumstances the party  finds  itself in and the tasks to be shouldered by the party have  greatly changed. Due to these changes the party has to face many  new complex situations and new problems in ideological,  political, organizational, and in working style respects. The  new reality demands of us that we must abide by the fundamental  political line of the party, that we must uphold the principle  of having the party control its party members and strictly  administer the party, and that we strengthen and improve party  building. The task that is presently most important and pressing  is in the sphere of ideological buildup. We must give utmost  attention to the party's theoretical buildup, and, with the  party's theoretical buildup as nucleus, we must strengthen the  party's entire ideological buildup, making an effort to arm the  entire party through the buildup of socialist theory with  Chinese characteristics. As to the organizational buildup, our  objective must be to enhance the party's centralized, unified  leadership, to strengthen democratic centralism, to perfect the  leadership system and the mechanism of the party's internal  political life. As to the build-up of the party's working style,  we must make close linkage of party and masses the fundamental  concern, must correctly deal with the internal contradictions of  the people, and resolutely control negative, decadent phenomena,  reducing them to their lowest level. Through strengthening and  improving party building and by directing our efforts to  enhancing the governmental and leadership qualities of the  party, we shall place the party, which will then have assumed a  completely new attitude, at the front line of reform and  modernization. It shall become a party with courage to reform to  reform, a party imbued with vitality, a strictly disciplined, a  just and honest party, that will select worthy and capable  people to fill positions, and a party that will be eminently  effective in its service to the people.</p>

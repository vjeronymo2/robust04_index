			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: OUT OF EARTHQUAKE'S RUBBLE RISES SOVIET-U.S. TEAMWORK  </P> <P> Turning on his TV as he sat down to breakfast last Dec. 7, Ron Altoon expected  to see the usual commemoration of Pearl Harbor. But the images on his screen  were more immediate in their horror.  </P> <P> An earthquake that measured 6.9 on the Richter scale had wrought terrible  destruction in Soviet Armenia: 55,000 people would die and 500,000 would be  homeless as whole towns collapsed into rubble.  </P> <P> As an architect, Altoon was deeply affected by the destruction. As an Armenian,  he was personally touched by the deaths of thousands of his countrymen.  </P> <P> "It could be my own family dying out there," he said. "I wrote several checks,  but they didn't make me feel any better. I felt strongly that I had to step  into this more personally."  </P> <P> So Altoon, a commercial architect in Los Angeles with his own firm, Altoon and  Porter, decided to organize a team of American architects to visit the Soviet  Union to help plan the rebuilding of an Armenian city. After months of  bureaucratic and diplomatic delay, six Californians, led by Altoon, spent two  weeks in late March in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, laying out a proposal for  the reconstruction of the demolished city of Spitak.  </P> <P> The California team's plan was a success and ultimately was selected by the  Soviets in place of their own design for the new city of 25,000 people. The  Altoon group's vision was more imaginative than the Soviet architects': It not  only took into account the hillside setting of Spitak, but it also favored  traditional Armenian architectural style instead of cold, impersonal concrete  buildings.  </P> <P> "You have understood the culture of our land better than we ourselves have,"  said Ashod Alexanian, chief of the Armenian division of Gosstroi, the Soviet  state construction agency. "You have helped us understand our past and the  vital role it can play in our future."  </P> <P> Yuri Platonov, head of the Union of Soviet Architects, reportedly hailed the  California plan as a double first. The California team was the first group of  U.S. architects ever invited to collaborate with Soviet colleagues. And the  Spitak plan was the first time an American concept had ever been adopted for  the design of a Soviet city.  </P> <P> In the months before he was able to enter the Soviet Union, Altoon and the five  other architects, who are from the Bay Area, studied the architecture,  politics, history and poetry of Armenia.  </P> <P> "Although I'm Armenian, I was raised American in Los Feliz," Altoon said. "I  speak a few words of the language, and that's about it. The quake made me eager  to understand the spirit of a people who've always had to struggle for  survival, against human persecution and natural disaster."  </P> <P> Southern California is home to about 350,000 Armenians, the largest population  outside the Soviet Union. The California team arrived in Yerevan, the capital  of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, on March 20. Its visit to Armenia  was backed by the Los Angeles branch of the Armenian Assembly and sponsored by  the state chapter and the national Washington headquarters of the American  Institute of Architects. Touring the quake-shattered region of northern Armenia  revived and intensified Altoon's sense of shock at the magnitude of the human  tragedy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Like Bombed Cities'  </P> <P> "Spitak and Leninakan were like bombed cities," he said. "Three months after  the event, rubble was everywhere. People still looked stunned. I remember one  old man outside Spitak who stood staring at the ruined town for hours on end.  He seemed turned to stone by the horror and the loss -- except for the single  tear that ran down his cheek from time to time." Thirty-two mountain villages  surrounding Spitak had been destroyed, Altoon's team discovered.  </P> <P> The Soviets welcomed the Americans warmly but were skeptical about the  usefulness of yet another bunch of well-intentioned "tourists." Teams from  Norway and Italy and from two Soviet republics were already in Armenia planning  cities and building new hospitals and temporary housing.  </P> <P> One difficulty for the Californians was the primitive and bureaucratic  character of the Soviet building industry.  </P> <P> "Put simply, Soviet construction technology is a disaster," Altoon said. "Since  the Russian Revolution, the Soviets have used a precast concrete system that  requires much more precision than their primitive methods are capable of."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Designs Ignore Differences  </P> <P> The standard Soviet building designs consist of cement units actually poured in  a factory and then transported to sites and assembled. If the assembly isn't  done very carefully, they are prone to problems. Altoon added that the  centrally planned units used all over the vast territory of the Soviet Union  ignore "regional climatic, seismic and geological variations."  </P> <P> The collapse of thousands of such badly built structures was a principal cause  of death and injury during the recent quake. In addition to the shoddy  construction technology, the Soviet system provides for no independent  supervision of building quality by architects or inspectors. And there is no  Soviet seismic building code setting strict standards for earthquake resistance  similar to the ordinances that govern the construction of buildings in  California.  </P> <P> "There's no area where Gorbachev's famous perestroika (restructuring) is more  literally needed than in the Soviet construction industry," Altoon said.  "Cities like Spitak were disasters waiting to happen."  </P> <P> The first task for the U.S. designers was to critique the plan for Spitak's  reconstruction drawn up by the Soviet architects. This potentially sensitive  moment was made easier by the invitation, expressed by Hratch Poghossian,  director of the Armenian Design Institute, to "take your gloves off, comrades.  We're all architects here."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Outdated Planning Ideas  </P> <P> The Americans found the Soviet design inadequate. Their proposed layout,  consisting of a rigid street grid with oversized boulevards, failed to take  into account the hillside site for the new Spitak, several miles away from the  destroyed city. The American team's consensus was the Soviet plan represented  an outdated 1950s notion of city planning long discredited in the West, with  boring, straight, endless blocks of no visual interest.  </P> <P> Rolling up their sleeves, the Californians set to work for up to 17 hours a  day. They sketched, argued and sketched some more. Their inspiration was in the  architectural tradition of Armenia and the desire to offer the traumatized  people a new kind of city -- open, communal and filled with light and air.  </P> <P> "Spitak means white in the eastern Armenian dialect," Altoon said. "The  traditional local building material is a soft volcanic stone called tufa, which  varies in color from a soft beige to a reddish brown. When the sun catches it,  it turns to gold. An airy sense of white and gold was the feeling we wanted in  our design." And tufa is a major component in the Americans' final design for  the city.  </P> <P> Tufa churches and monasteries celebrating an ancient Armenian Christianity dot  the bare hillsides of the republic and neighboring Azerbaijan. The style of  such 14th-Century masterpieces as St. Stephanos or St. Thadei' Vank is fortress  Romanesque. Castle walls enclose towers and spires in golden stone covered with  elaborate carvings of shepherds and warriors.  </P> <P> When the California architects presented their Spitak design to the Soviets on  March 31, they were greeted with great applause. Stopping over in Moscow on  their way home, the Californians were also warmly hailed by architects in the  Soviet capital. "What you have done is put in place a U.S.-Soviet collaboration  that has eluded us for years," Platonov said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Convention Visit  </P> <P> As a follow-up, Platonov will visit the AIA national convention in St. Louis in  June to participate with Altoon and his colleagues in a panel discussion of the  Spitak plan. And on Thursday, Altoon will make a presentation of the plan to  the local chapter of the AIA in the Pacific Design Center.  </P> <P> The Armenian disaster, Altoon said, "has taught me a great lesson in humanity."  </P></p>

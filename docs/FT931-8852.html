			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Fujitsu launches multi-media games machine FUJITSU, the world's second largest computer company after International Business Machines, took a bold first step into the consumer electronics market with the launch yesterday of a multi-media video games machine. The new machine, which is a multi-media CD-ROM player, plugs directly into a television set to display images, graphics and text stored on a compact disc. It will also play conventional CDs and comes with a floppy disc drive to display material compiled on a PC. The new machine, which goes on sale in Japan this month and will be known as Marty, marks a diversification for Fujitsu into the highly competitive consumer electronics market. It also reflects the blurring of borders between the computer and consumer electronics industries with the spread of digital technology. Computer manufacturers in the US and Japan have been working to develop multi-media technology, which combines data, graphics, text, video and sound, not only as an added feature for PC users but as a means to enter the consumer market. Dataquest, the high technology consultancy, expects the multi-media market to be worth Dollars 1.6bn by 1996. For Fujitsu, the move is a logical step after the launch of its multi-media PC, FM Towns, four years ago. The consumer machine will run software for FM Towns in addition to titles which will be launched specifically for the new consumer machine. Fujitsu plans to have 300 software titles available by the end of March and 400 by the end of the year. It aims to sell 200,000 of the new machines in the first year. However, Fujitsu's foray into the home entertainment and education market faces substantial hurdles. The market already appears crowded, with Nintendo and Sega, the video games manufacturers, maintaining a firm grasp on the hearts and minds of young games players. The two companies have a distinct advantage over newcomers in the large number of installed machines and the popularity of their games titles, and have been moving aggressively into new software developments such as games using real film footage. Meanwhile, other companies, such as Philips, the Dutch consumer electronics manufacturer, and Tandy of the US have launched their own CD-based multi-media entertainment machines that aim to provide more than video games. Fujitsu does not have any experience of marketing consumer products. The company has set up a consumer products division in its personal business department, and plans to market the new machine not only in electronics and computer stores, but also through retailers such as department stores, supermarkets and electrical goods stores. Although Fujitsu has attempted to differentiate its new machine from conventional video games machines by emphasising its educational potential, there is little evidence to suggest that the appeal of educational material could provide a strong boost to sales. For Fujitsu, the move is a gamble. In the six months to September 1992, it posted its worst results, turning in a loss of Y7.5bn (Dollars 62m) on a consolidated basis against a profit of Y30.9bn previously.</p>

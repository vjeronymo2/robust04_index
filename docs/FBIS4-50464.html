			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Huang Ju Speaks at the 12th Municipal </F> Enlarged Executive Meeting; At the Meeting, He Emphasizes  Tackling Economic Reform and Opening Up To Promote Economic  Development and To Alleviate Problems and Enhance Social  Stability"]    [Text] At the 12th municipal enlarged executive meeting  held yesterday, Mayor Huang Ju emphatically stated that it is  necessary to have a clear understanding of the situation, to  work hard, to find the best balanced point in our efforts to  achieve reform, development, and stability; and to strive to  maintain good momentum for Shanghai's sustained, rapid, and  healthy economic development.    The meeting reviewed and summed up Shanghai's economic  development, reform, and opening in the first quarter and made  plans for the work in the second quarter. Mayor Huang Ju made  an important speech at the meeting. First of all, he affirmed  various achievements accomplished by the city government during  the first quarter. He said that Shanghai achieved marked  results in seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening up,  promoting development, and maintaining a stable situation by  carrying out the goals, principles, and tasks put forward by the  second plenary session of the sixth municipal CPC committee and  the second session of the tenth municipal people's congress. He  said: Shanghai carried out various tasks this year under an  unprecedented situation in which reform was extensively  implemented, interests were widely readjusted, and new  situations and problems continuously cropped up. Shanghai had a  good start in carrying out this year's work because the city,  under the leadership of the municipal CPC committee and  government, wasted no time in unifying thinking, made good plans  for the work of all fronts, and promoted a thorough work style.  Shanghai continued to maintain a fairly rapid speed in  developing the national economy. In the first quarter, it  created 42.05 billion yuan of gross national product, an  increase of 13.1 percent over the same period last year. Its  total industrial output value reached 87.05 billion yuan,  representing an increase of 13.9 percent over the same period  last year. Its exports increased month by month, with an  increase of 19.9 percent over the same period last year. Its  economic efficiency increased simultaneously, with a fairly  large increase in local revenues. Shanghai's economic structure  improved. For the first time, the value added of its tertiary  industry was higher than that of its secondary industry. Its new  pillar industries enjoyed rapid growth. Its high-standard urban  construction made good progress, with major projects including  the inner traffic link, the overall renovation of People's  Square, the First Line Subway, and the Tongfang Mingzhu  Television Tower all proceeding smoothly. The 7-million-square  meter housing project which is expected to be completed by the  end of this year was in full swing. The work to remove houses  from the area where the Chengdu Road Viaduct will be built was  basically completed. In terms of utilizing foreign funds,  Shanghai maintained fairly good momentum, with a marked increase  in the use of foreign funds for industrial and new high  technology projects. With the growth of Pudong district, the  gross national product of this new district was 9 percent higher  than that of the city itself. We achieved results in  coordinating and promoting reform, development, and stability.  A multilayer and multichannel poverty relief program was  gradually institutionalized, thus laying a fine foundation for  the stability of society.    Huang Ju emphatically said: While fully affirming the  results, we should clearly recognize some new and outstanding  contradictions existing in the city's economic life. We should  also attain a complete understanding of some temporary  difficulties cropping up in the course of our reform and opening  drive. Faced with these new challenges, we should have a  scientific attitude and the courage to overcome them. We should  be good at exploring new methods. We should be persistent and  move ahead so as to promote to a new height the city's work in  all aspects.    While talking about the second quarter's work, Huang Ju  said:  The key to promoting the overall interests of reform,  development, and stability as well as to carrying out the  current work lies in two things: first, persisting in the  promotion of reform, opening up, and economic development; and  second, persisting in alleviating problems and enhancing social  stability. He urged cadres at all levels to further emancipate  the mind, seek truth from facts, correctly deal with the  relations between reform, development, and stability, and strive  to maintain a good economic growth rate by producing quality  commodities which can find ready markets and by enhancing  economic efficiency. We should take the overall situation into  account and strengthen comprehensive coordination so as to  fulfill all quotas for national economic and social development  set for the first half of 1994. We should strive to fulfill the  second quarter's work ahead of schedule and lay a solid  foundation for realizing this year's goal.    Huang Ju put forward seven requirements for the second  quarter's work as follows: First, it is necessary to treat  marketing as a primary task in Shanghai's current economic work.  We should seize the opportunities and actively expand the  domestic market, in accordance with the requirement of promoting  a socialist market economy and gearing our work toward the  country as a whole. We should take active measures to readjust  our marketing measures. Instead of waiting for customers to come  to Shanghai, we should go out and set up shops across the  country. Instead of doing business as a small merchant or  peddler, we should engage in a large-scale goods trade. In this  way, we can provide better service to the country as a whole,  particularly to the hinterland and rural areas. Meanwhile,  continued efforts should be made to expand foreign markets. We  should spare no efforts in carrying out the "dragon head plan"  for foreign trade. We should attach importance to  foreign-funded enterprises and help them increase export  earnings. We should tap and bring the role of village and town  enterprises' potential into play.    Second, regarding the  utilization of foreign investment, we should tackle thorny  problems. We should show enthusiasm and initiative, compete for  projects, and strive to locate a new breakthrough point through  which we can open wider to the outside world. Third, we should  earnestly intensify work to raise and distribute funds, improve  our efficiency in utilizing funds, and ensure that we reach our  goals for economic growth, particularly concerning progress in  key projects. Fourth, on the one hand, we should focus on these  three key supplementary points: key products and backbone  industries which show prospects for development, village and  town industries in rural areas, and joint investments by big  state-owned enterprises; on the other, we should focus on  helping some state-owned enterprises surmount difficulties, and  strive to maintain the favorable trend for industrial  development. Fifth, we should unswervingly, and actively but  steadily, push forward the deepening of reform and open up wider  to the outside world. We should experiment with the modern  enterprise system and with innovations in the enterprise  organization system, accelerate the construction of a modern  market system, and conduct relevant studies and concentrate our  energies on developing central commercial districts, on  promoting joint investments by state-owned large backbone  enterprises, and on supporting policy measures which promote  "Chinese-Chinese-foreign" investment in village and town  enterprises. We should also continue to expand our experiments  on the shareholding system and actively develop the shareholding  cooperative system. Sixth, we should galvanize the whole  municipality into action and whip up an upsurge in turning our  municipality into a national hygienic municipality. Our general  objective is to basically build a national hygienic municipality  this year and fully complete the relevant efforts next year. To  achieve this, governments at all levels must list this as an  important item on their agenda, which is a great undertaking  with an impact on the image of Shanghai in reform and opening up  and on the construction of a modern international metropolis,  and a practical task which will effectively improve people's  lives and work environment. We should implement the leadership  responsibility system; set our sights on accomplishing our work  in time for "May 1st," "July 1st," and National Day; and launch  comprehensive activities to make improvements in a well-planned,  systematic way, focusing on one aspect at a time. We should  extensively mobilize the entire society to participate in and  support our "construction" work so that the concept of "making  Shanghai cleaner and prettier" takes root in the heart of people  and becomes known to all. Seventh, we should seize the  initiative to do work, provide prompt instructions, resolve  conflicts, and maintain social stability. Right now, cadres at  all levels, particularly principal leading cadres, should regard  the effort to preserve social stability and ensure safety in all  quarters as a major task. We should be adept at discerning  public sentiments and at resolving conflicts promptly, further  deepen campaigns to "show care," and conduct relevant efforts on  a regular basis and systematically. We should also combine our  efforts with ideological and political work and actually carry  out work to overcome difficulties at various levels.    In summing up his speech, Huang Ju said emphatically: Cadres  at all levels in the municipality must fulfill their duty and  responsibility, judge the hour and size up the situation, work  in full cooperation with unity of purpose, thoroughly plan their  work, be single-minded, and ensure that the favorable trend in  economic and social development is maintained in Shanghai.    Attending the meeting were vice mayors, and responsible  persons from various committees, general offices, bureaus, and  district and county governments. Vice Mayor Xie Lijuan made  arrangements for the construction of a national hygienic  municipality. Also invited to the meeting were responsible  persons of the municipal people's congress, the municipal  committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference, and relevant authorities.</p>

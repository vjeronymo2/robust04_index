			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 19 (AFP) -- NATO will make no  decision on air strikes to protect UN safe areas in  Bosnia-Herzegovina until the governments of member states show a  "political will" to act military, NATO officials said Tuesday  [19 April].    NATO military commanders must also closely study the  situation in the UN-declared safe zones under Bosnian Serb siege  before replying to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who  asked NATO Monday [18 April] for airstrike authorisation.    Bosnian Serbs are on the point of taking the Moslem town of  Gorazde, one of the six so-called safe areas.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Whitbread turns to eating out in quest for growth WHILE some of the UK brewers have been chasing volume to offset flat or declining beer sales, Whitbread has been looking elsewhere for its growth. As yesterday's results highlight, the UK's fourth largest brewer is increasingly concentrating on its managed retail business, which includes Whitbread Inns, Beefeater, Pizza Hut and TGI Friday's restaurant chains as well as the expanded Thresher's high street off-licence business. This is no accident. There is excess capacity in the brewing sector, margins are under pressure as a result of aggressive discounting by Whitbread's larger competitors, and the Supply of Beers Orders have necessitated a wide ranging reorganisation of the tied house estate. In contrast the eating out market has been one of the fastest growing consumer markets over the past decade. Between 1982 and 1992 UK consumer spending on eating out grew in real terms by 70 per cent, while beer sales were flat. Last year consumers spent Pounds 16.6bn on eating out compared with Pounds 13.5bn on beer. With a modest upturn in consumer spending under way Whitbread's recent investment in its managed retail operations appears to be beginning to pay off. Whitbread Inns, the group's managed pub business, increased profits, turnover and market share last year. Drinks sales grew by 6 per cent while food sales increased by 11 per cent. Overall, Whitbread's managed estate derives 35.9 per cent of its business from food, while the competition manages only 13.7 per cent. Within the restaurants businesses all three domestic chains managed to increase sales and profits. Beefeater increased its sales by 2 per cent and profits by 4 per cent, despite a decline in average weekly covers from 1,120 in 1989 to just over 900 in August last year. Similarly, Pizza Hut recorded a 3 per cent growth in sales and a 24 per cent increase in profits. Since November Mr Peter Jarvis, Whitbread's chief executive, said sales have grown strongly each month and significant efficiency gains are benefiting margins. TGI Friday's also benefited from emerging economies of scale as sales grew by 15 per cent and profits more than doubled. The other star performer in the division was Thresher. Following the acquisition of Peter Dominic from Grand Metropolitan last year Thresher now has 1,600 shops and is the leader in the Pounds 5bn-a-year home drinks market. The expanded off-licence group managed to increase profits by 30 per cent and sales by 40 per cent. Whitbread's concentration on building its beer brands has also helped it in the take home business. Although the beer and drinks division itself only managed a modest increase in sales and profits last year, Whitbread claims the largest share, 17 per cent by value, of the take home market. Overall the Whitbread's managed retail estate businesses boosted profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 135.7m (Pounds 119.9m) on turnover of Pounds 1.56bn (Pounds 1.38bn) last year and now accounts for almost 60 per cent of group turnover and more than 51 per cent of profits from continuing operations.</p>

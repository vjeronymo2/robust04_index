			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Dean Witter and NationsBank to form joint brokerage firm DEAN Witter Financial Services, the securities brokerage arm of retailing group Sears, Roebuck, plans to form a jointly-owned brokerage firm with NationsBank, the fourth-largest commercial bank in the US, that will sell mutual funds and other investment products to bank customers. The new company, Nations Securities, will begin operations early next year with 400 investment professionals located in NationsBank's branches in nine US states. The company also intends to market products and services to other US commercial banks. Although still subject to regulatory approval, the agreement is the latest example of how the once-strict divide between the commercial banking and securities businesses, enshrined in the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, is being dismantled. Several big banks, including JP Morgan and Bankers Trust, are already major players in the securities underwriting business, and only last week the Federal Reserve gave Republic Bank of New York approval to open a securities brokerage. The joint venture is also an attempt by companies from two increasingly inter-connected industries to exploit their respective strengths. Dean Witter will provide the brokerage expertise and distribution channels of a big Wall Street firm, while NationsBank will provide wide customer reach through its branches, as well as the financial muscle of a major bank. Other banks are likely to follow in NationsBank's footsteps. The sharp fall over the past two years in the interest-rate earned on bank savings products, such as certificates of deposit, persuaded many bank customers to look elsewhere for higher returns on their money. By offering customers in-house access to a wide range of higher-yielding investments, NationsBank and other banks hope to stem the outflow of deposits caused by the sharp fall in the returns earned by bank savings products.</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LABORER FOUND DEAD; 3 MEN SOUGHT  </P> <P> A laborer was killed early Monday morning in East County and law enforcement  officials said they were seeking three Latino males who may have fled to  Mexico.  </P> <P> Dead was Felipe Manjarrez, 54, who was discovered at his home in the 2000 block  of Willow Glen Drive near El Cajon. The man, found partially clothed,  apparently suffered severe trauma to his head, but officials were awaiting the  results of an autopsy before pinpointing the cause of death.  </P> <P> According to Sgt. Danny Goodrich of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department,  Manjarrez had been seen arguing with three men earlier in the week. After the  body was found, Border Patrol officials were called in to help track shoe  prints that Goodrich said indicated the suspects fled toward Mexico.  </P> <P> The suspects were identified as Juan, 5 feet, 3 inches tall, 130 pounds with  short, black wavy hair and brown eyes; Daniel, 5-foot-11, 170 pounds, with  brown wavy hair, brown eyes, a large nose, a deformed left thumb and partially  deaf; and Chino, 5-foot-4, 140 pounds, curly black Afro-style hair, brown eyes  and fair skin.  </P></p>

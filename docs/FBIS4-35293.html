			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, minister of planning  and development, has rejected any UN Security Council  intervention in the Yemeni crisis as an intrusion upon a  domestic Yemeni affair. Yemen's position on any resolution that  the council may pass will be influenced by its wording, the  minister told Radio Qatar during an interview it carried today.  Asked to comment on a political initiative by the [Yemeni]  Socialist Party [YSP], the minister said he thought Sanaa and  unionists within the YSP in Aden were in touch in an attempt to  fashion a mutually agreeable formula. If such a formula is  worked out, he added, it will mark a point of departure. The  minister stressed that any such arrangement should provide for  Yemen's unity, preserve legitimacy, produce a cease-fire, and  ensure the unity of the military. These are key elements of the  consultations, he pointed out.    A decision about whether the forces of legitimacy would  enter  Aden, al-Iryani said, would be made with reference to political  considerations and a concern to spare civilians the horrors of  war.    The Arab League's approach to the developments in Yemen must  respect the country's national unity, Constitutional legitimacy,  and the unity of the Armed Forces. Any Arab mediation effort  not grounded in these principles will be non-productive, the  foreign minister stressed. Arab mediation efforts have yet to  go beyond exhortations to stop fighting to a well-defined plan  for a practical solution. This kind of approach was plausible  before the war broke out. However, with a war now raging, there  is a need for a political agreement that will rule out a future  recourse to force of arms.    Dr. al-Iryani praised Qatar's position underscoring Yemen's  unity and Constitutional legitimacy.</p>

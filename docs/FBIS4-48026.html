			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ade Obisesan] </F>   [Excerpt] Lagos, 9 May (AFP) -- Lagos workers on Monday [9  May] largely failed to heed a stay-at-home call by Nigeria's  opposition Campaign for Democracy (CD) in protest against the  military regime of General Sani Abacha. Hundreds of people made  their way to work in the sprawling commercial metropolis, while  journalists told AFP that the protest call was also ignored in  the federal capital Abuja and the second business city, Kano in  the north. Not many commercial vehicles were seen in Lagos  early Monday, but this may have been due to a persistent fuel  shortage and rain early in the morning, observers said.    The CD, an umbrella grouping for some 40 pro-democracy and  human rights organisations, last week called on workers across  Nigeria to stay at home Monday in its first protest against the  latest military regime, which it described as "illegitimate".  But the Campaign failed to win the support of the Nigeria  Labour Congress (NLC), which urged workers not to follow the CD  call, warning that it would not be able to defend any of them if  they abstained from work. "It does not make any sense to embark  on any strike action now," an NLC official told AFP on Monday.  "The call looks senseless and ill-timed as there seems to be no  justification for it."    The Lagos State government, in a special early morning radio  announcement urged workers to go to their jobs and described the  CD's call as "unpatriotic and irrational."    The call for protest was seen as a test of support for the  CD, which last Tuesday issued a statement blaming the Abacha  regime for the "catastrophic" state of Nigeria. The country,  though a major oil producer, was then gripped by drastic fuel  shortages, which led the military government to call in  representatives of oil companies to discuss measures to remedy  the situation.

Hong Kong immigration  authorities are believed to be assisting them apply for asylum  in South Korea.    But South Korea is already entangled in a diplomatic row  with  its northern rival over an increasing flow of defectors heading  south-- the incidence of which the Pyongyang government  maintains is being fabricated by South Korea. The Hong Kong  government has kept a firm lid on details about the two illegal  immigrants since they were picked up separately by border  patrols at Sha Tau Kok within two days of each other a week ago.    The first was detained last Friday, and the other on Sunday.  They crossed the border on foot during daylight--one picked up  at the fence, the other further across the border. Initially  regarded as illegal immigrants from China, the two revealed  their identities during questioning. They were then handed to  immigration authorities, and are being held at an undisclosed  location.    A Security Branch spokesman issued only a brief statement in  response to questions about the detainees. "We can confirm that  two illegal immigrants who claim to be from North Korea arrived  in Hong Kong separately on the 11th and 13th of March," he said.  "The matter is now being investigated."    Security sources have voiced concern that Hong Kong may face  a wave of refugees from North Korea as Pyongyang wrestles with  economic hardship and food shortages. The Hong Kong Government  remains anxious not to disclose details of the detainees in case  Hong Kong is forced to become a conduit for North Korean  defectors heading for South Korea. The number of North Korean  defectors had increased in recent years since Pyongyang's  European communist allies began disintegrating in 1989. Since  then, 60 North Koreans have been allowed to enter South Korea,  mostly through third countries.    But South Korea's acceptance of the defectors is  exacerbating  tensions between the two Koreas. In fact, South Korea has  already become a sanctuary for a stream of North Koreans  defecting from Russia and China. Hundreds of North Koreans are  reported to be wandering through Russia and China after escaping  from logging camps in Siberia. South Korea's ambassador to  Beijing, Hwang Pyong-tae claimed that in China, five or six  people a week tried to defect to South Korea.    Late last year, a young man claiming to be a North Korean  soldier attempting to obtain asylum in South Korea, was detained  in Hong Kong after crossing the border from China. He was sent  back to China when the South Korean Consulate could not verify  his account.</p>

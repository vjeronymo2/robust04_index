			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santiago, 28 Mar (EFE) -- Enrico Gimelli, president  of the Italian Government firm Alenia, has said that Italian  companies are trying to recover their presence in Chile, which  was lost after the September 1973 coup that installed a military  regime that remained for almost 17 years.    Gimelli was one of the foreign executives invited to the  Eighth International Aerospace Fair (FIDAE) in Santiago, which  closed on 27 March. Delegations from 33 countries attended the  fair.    In today's issue EL MERCURIO published Gimelli's comments  that the Italian presence at FIDAE was considerable, because  Italy wanted to show its interest in participating in the  modernization process of the Chilean Armed Forces.    Gimelli was optimistic about future cooperation with the  Chilean Armed Forces. Regarding the military fields in which  Alenia works, he said his company could cooperate in systems for  strengthening naval units, in changing radar systems, and in air  defense.    He added that the best way to invest in Chile is to  manufacture in cooperation with Chilean companies, in the way  his company has done in Spain, the United States, and in other  countries for a long time.    He indicated that the level of economic growth and the  responsibility of Chilean businessmen convey trust. He added:  "The idea is to exchange our products again. Coming to FIDAE  was the first step."    Alenia is carrying out several technological projects in  South America, such as construction of the Argentine satellite  "Nahuel," which will control all communications in that country.    Alenia is also working on the "Global Star" system, which  will interconnect all the world's cellular telephones, while in  the military sector it produces anti-air systems; radar for  ships, aircraft, and airplanes; satellites; and helicopters,  among other military products.</p>

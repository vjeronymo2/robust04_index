			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Survey of Marmara (3): Thermal baths and grass skiing - The region's attractions You can no longer swim in many parts of the Marmara. Indeed, the Union of Marmara Municipalities even produces a map designating which areas are safe  -and they are rapidly shrinking in number. But there are other attractions in the region: Bursa Once one of Turkey's grandest cities, Bursa has suffered slightly from the pace of development. Nonetheless, you can wash off the grime of the city in one of the thermal baths. The best is the well-preserved Ottoman 'hamam' in the Kervansaray Thermal Hotel, where for less than Dollars 5, you can soak in a marble pool and have a massage. There is even an outside pool fed from the same spring, with water at a pleasantly tepid 32 degrees. Gallipoli The Commonwealth and Turkish war graves in the Dardanelles peninsula remain a popular destination, particularly for Australian and British tourists. The graves are wonderfully tended by a young Australian botanist, Mr Jeffrey Mish and his Turkish wife. 'We try to plant a combination of local flora and also flowers associated with the countries who lost men here,' he says. Iznik A sleepy town now, this ancient centre was the site of the Council of 325 which has set the ground rules and was a landmark in western ecclesiastical history. Iznik is also famous for its tiles. Uludag The slopes of Mount Olympus, or as the Turks call it, the great mountain of Uludag, attract an increasingly international set of ski fanatics. Mr Erdem Saker, the new Bursa mayor, is a keen ski enthusiast and represents Turkey on the grass ski committee of the FIS, the international ski federation. Bursa hosted the world grass ski championships in 1991. The Bears of Bursa No, this is not an American football team, but a project co-ordinated by the local university veterinary faculty to create a sanctuary for the Ursus Arctos, the dancing brown bear, once all too familiar to tourists on the streets of Turkish cities. The scheme is being aided by experts from the London-based World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA). The project managers are currently looking after 19 bears, all of whom were rescued from the streets and their gypsy minders. Now the bears are being trained to recognise electric fencing before being sent to the newly constructed 25-acre sanctuary at Karacabey, near Bursa. Other curiosities Constantine died near the Ankara road, although there is little to mark the spot today. Hannibal, the Carthaginian general, committed suicide near Iznik.</p>

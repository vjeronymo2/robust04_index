			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (12): Big issue revisited - Can Chicago's South Shore Bank experiment act as a model for inner-city regeneration / Local investment 'COMMUNITY CAPITALISM' By Richard P Taub Harvard Business School Press Dollars 14.95, 151 pages One of the more obscure economic indicators is the use of the work 'trickledown'. Beloved of those who believe in the regenerative powers of large-scale projects - interestingly bridging Margaret Thatcher and Maynard Keynes - trickledown is currently in hibernation and there is a touching revival in community and local initiative. However the big issue in local investment is just that; who invests and is it really investment or is it a grant? With the British Government preparing to back a trial local investment scheme in two areas of the UK, the new edition of Richard Taub's Community Capitalism is very timely. The book is a history of Chicago's South Shore Bank and its strapline 'Strategy for Neighbourhood Revitalisation' sums up the author's ambitions for its scope. The South Shore Bank is often mentioned as the model for inner city regeneration both in the US and the UK and increasingly in parts of east and west Europe where urban decline has become a fact of life. In particular, it is deemed to show that regeneration can be investment rather than grant or subsidy-led. Taub is very good at analysing the outline of the successes and the failures of the Bank since it was 'reborn' in 1973. This was when a group of four non-traditional bankers took over a fully-operating, neighbourhood bank - albeit in sharp decline - which as Taub describes it had deposits of Dollars 38m, a conservative staff, and a reputation for not being very helpful to the new members of the community. The latter phrase is crucial. South Shore is a typical urban neighbourhood. An area covering seven by 12 blocks with a population of 75,000, it is sited on the shores of Lake Michigan. Originally built to house rail workers, it was a traditional, middle-class Chicago neighbourhood. Unusually, it contains a wide range of housing from the mansions of Jackson Park Highlands to tenement blocks. The transition began after the war, when the lack of repairs in South Shore combined with the temptation of purpose-built housing in the suburbs to attract local residents to move out. South Shore proceeded to go through a period of decline with shops closing, the old infrastructure being torn down, and crime starting to rise. This in turn increased the outflow of the old population and left South Shore as a run-down residential area for poor blacks to move into, 50 per cent of whom had emigrated from the South. The four managers, who raised the Dollars 3.2m to buy the South Shore Bank, had all come into banking from differing backgrounds. Their leader was Ronald Grzywinski, who had grown up within five miles of South Shore and, after a career with IBM, had joined a local bank where he operated an urban development division which built up an impressive track record in backing minority entrepreneurs. This experience caused him to look at creating a local banking and investment body with a strong community focus. The original concept was for the local residents, in addition to investing, to take an increasing role in running the operation. After some false starts this led the group to consider buying an existing body. They purchased the bank with a substantial loan, backed by personal guarantees, and sought to run it like a conventional bank while remaining true to their commitment to community values. Deposits, which now total well over Dollars 100m, were built up by direct mail to sympathisers all over the US. This new strength was then used to invest in local projects and businesses. The new regime established a formula of lending to local property owners and buyers in which they both stood to gain, by an upturn both in property values and people's perceptions. The emphasis switched to responsible and careful development and extended to Minority Enterprise Lending. In time the bank's holding company was restructured into four divisions: the bank; a for-profit real estate development company which renovated property and sold it on; a Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Company (Mesbic); and the not-for-profit Neighbourhood Institute which was designed to cope with the effects of change. The bank is now earning profits of more than 1.5 per cent of assets. Where the book is tantalising is that it has a new preface written in 1994 but it is still essentially the text of 1987. It is also light on the actual lending process - the very area which makes South Shore different. Nonetheless it is particularly relevant for the apprehensive climate of the nineties and the need to rebuild.</p>

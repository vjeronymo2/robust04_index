			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Books: A taste for the aristocracy - A publisher with a penchant for name-dropping REMEMBERING MY GOOD FRIENDS: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY by George Weidenfeld HarperCollins Pounds 20, 483 pages Lord Weidenfeld, the publisher, has written an autobiography called Remembering My Good Friends of whom he seems to have so many that the book can be read as an exercise in name-dropping. It is perhaps fortunate that he does not drink alcohol; otherwise he might have treated a list of French wines in much the same gushing way. It might be said of him - indeed Weidenfeld suggests it several times in the course of these memoirs - that he was the great innovative publisher of the post-1945 period. More critical readers might recall, however, that the list of authors is more impressive than the books produced or the evidence of them having been much edited. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson is not alone in this, but the firm was the pioneer of bulk memoirs, often too hastily written, too long, and insufficiently checked. That led in turn to partial serialisation, which frequently gives a wholly misleading impression of the book. The temptation to write them and publish them has not diminished with time and Weidenfeld has himself succumbed. It should be an interesting story. Weidenfeld was a well-educated refugee from Austria who made his way up in England first through the wartime service of the BBC, then through publishing. It was an imperial world he left behind, and at least an aristocratic world to which he looked forward. Weidenfeld writes that his family had taught him that Vienna was the centre of the universe, so much so that nobody bothered to teach him English. In Britain he saw his challenge as being how to turn his condition of being 'with the English but not of the English into an advantage'. The old background served him well. The chapter 'English Life: the Learning Process' is devoted almost entirely to a study of the English upper classes: aristocrats mingling with writers and the odd politician. In a later chapter, 'Manhattan Mosaic', there is a similar approach to life in New York: so-and-so, the younger son of a publishing family 'was adopted and rumoured to be the illegitimate child of a member of the British royal family.' The taste for the well-born extends even to Israel where Weidenfeld dwells on the charms of the old Zionist aristocracy. In London he delighted in being introduced to what he calls the 'British haute Juiverie'. Israel forms the most serious parts of the book. Weidenfeld has no qualms (nor should he) about the support he has given the Zionist cause over the years. And yet there must be a question of balance, especially in a country that is neither Jewish nor Arab and also a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Here Weidenfeld writes in slogans, dismissing the British Foreign Office - which he says that otherwise he admires and should be given more money for entertainment - as having sold out to the Arabs from the start, and accusing George Brown of becoming an 'Arabist' after helping to push through UN Resolution 242 on the Middle East. As even Weidenfeld admits, it was that Resolution which led to subsequent dialogue. A little more humility towards the Arabs and occasional criticism of Israeli intransigence might be in order. These matters are subjective, but some readers might find errors in taste. For example, the wife of an English MP whom Weidenfeld hoped to marry, but who went off with somebody else, is described simply as 'an anglicized blonde of Austrian-Jewish origin'. Readers might not take kindly either to sentences like 'Shimi Lovat was known as the handsomest man in Britain'. They might have some sympathy with Evelyn Waugh, who thought that Weidenfeld and his set were pretentious and pushy. There are also some errors of fact. The aspiring French diplomat and future foreign minister who gave Weidenfeld helpful advice in Vienna was Jean Sauvagnargues, not a 'Monsieur Savarnargue' as Weidenfeld calls him. The name of the German central bank before the war was the Reichsbank, not the Reichbank. The first name of Chancellor Brandt was Willy, not Willi. Those may seem quibbles, though one would have thought that a seasoned publisher would have had someone check the proofs. They are as nothing compared to the story of Hugh Dalton and the economics writer, Nicholas Davenport. 'Had Dalton been made chancellor of the exchequer, as he nearly was,' Weidenfeld claims, 'Nicholas might well have become governor of the Bank of England.' That seems unlikely, especially when one remembers that Dalton actually was chancellor of the exchequer from 1945-1947, the very years in question.</p>

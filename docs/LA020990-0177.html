			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> KEARNY QUITS THRIFT BAILOUT POST  </P> <P> Daniel M. Kearney, head of the Cabinet-level board overseeing the rescue of the  nation's thrifts, resigned today, a board spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Kearney was brought in to head the Resolution Trust Corp. oversight board four  months ago.  </P> <P> The $164-billion bailout effort has been slow in getting off the ground and has  been under heavy congressional criticism.  </P> <P> The oversight board sets policy and direction for the government's effort to  close hundreds of failed thrifts and dispose of billions of dollars of assets.  </P> <P> Kearney was named chief executive of the oversight board Oct. 3. A prominent  Wall Street real estate finance expert, he had served in the Nixon and Ford  administrations.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, Kearney and other members of the board, including Federal  Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, have  come under fire from the House Banking Committee, which is concerned with the  slow pace of the thrift bailout.  </P></p>

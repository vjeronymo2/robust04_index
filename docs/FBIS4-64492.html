			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jacques Amalric: "Indecisive President Clinton"] </F>   [Text] Is there a President in the White House? An  increasing number of European and Asian leaders have begun to  wonder. While they put the question more politely, they are  genuinely worried by the vacillation of U.S. foreign policy,  which too often seems to boil down to what one of them terms an  "export of national policy." This lack of a coherent foreign  policy, which brings to mind certain aspects of Jimmy Carter's  presidency, is even worse in a world which has lost its bearing  following the collapse of the Communist bloc: It encourages  today's international adventurers and will lead to more disorder  throughout the world.    The list of presidential fumbles is a long one; on some  days,  the President reportedly spends no more than half an hour on  world affairs, while he has increased tenfold White House  spending on opinion polls. First on the list is the Somalia  debacle, where the U.S. contingent was literally ousted by the  fighters of one lone warlord, General Aideed, pronounced public  enemy number one by the United Nations. U.S. public opinion  demanded and obtained total withdrawal; the last GI has now left  the former Italian colony. Rwanda's murderous presidential  guard, if not encouraged by this inglorious retreat, can  nevertheless keep slaughtering cheerily, as the U.S.  Administration announced on Sunday [1 May] that any U.S.  intervention was out of the question, even as part of a UN  operation.    This overt refusal to even consider sending ground soldiers  has already wreaked havoc in Bosnia, where the Serbs have known  for a long time that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops will  always be in insufficient numbers to be efficient. There too,  President Clinton's main concern is to follow as closely as  possible the whim of opinion polls: Yes to air strikes around  Sarajevo last January and around Gorazde in April, but no  engagement on the ground whatsoever, even though the Pentagon's  best experts have repeatedly stated that air strikes would not  do much to damage Serb forces. Indeed, this became all the more  clear during the first days of the offensive against Gorazde,  when Serb troops felt free to keep advancing. This episode  proved particularly costly, not only for the Muslim population,  but also for the credibility of NATO, whose main pillar is the  United States and which candidate Clinton pledged to strengthen.  All this does not keep the White House, which is incapable of  choosing between negotiation and its refusal to commit itself on  the ground, from advocating the end of the embargo on arms  delivery to the Muslims one day, and a gradual lifting of  sanctions against Serbia the next.    Such an inability to devise a clearcut policy has been  evident not only to Belgrade or Pale. Haiti's military rulers  swiftly understood how they could take advantage of America's  vacillation in Somalia. As a result, they refused any  arrangement with President Aristide, whom they ousted in 1991.  Vivid in everyone's memory is the sight of that U.S. ship  driven back by a handful of tontons macoutes. But do people  remember candidate Clinton condemning President Bush for his  refusal to take in Haitian "boat people?" The U.S. President is  currently pursuing the exact same policy. True, he has now  pledged to alter it slightly, because of some polls showing that  black Americans are increasingly incensed by it, and Bill  Clinton needs their votes if he is to be reelected in 1996.    One can be assured that Saddam Hussayn, who is still in  power  after his defeat in the Gulf war because the Americans do not  want Iraq to fall apart, has been looking with interest at  Washington's bogus determination, after exploiting for all it  was worth the downing of the two American helicopters by U.S.  fighters within Kurdistan airspace. The same may be said of Kim  Il-song, North Korea's old tyrant, who has been ignoring  injunctions from the United States and the inspectors of the  Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency and still keeps  the lid on his atomic military programs. Meanwhile, China will  not help as long as America has not renewed its most-favored  nation status, so sure it is of President Clinton's bottomless  capacity for doing nothing.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Haimin (0491 3189 3046)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- Faced with the great  tide of reform and opening up, people in Hunan have begun to  think: As a large agricultural province, how can Hunan bring  its strong points into play and do its best to work out its  potential? NPC Deputy and Hunan Governor Chen Bangzhu said:  Hunan is working on a new framework for agriculture to meet  China's and the world's needs.    Over the past few years, Hunan, a province with more than 50  million peasants, has made gratifying achievements in reform and  opening up. It made major strides in reforming the agricultural  structure, expanded acreage of top quality rice, increased  production of cash crops by a wide margin, and made a  breakthrough in developing breeding of special aquatic products.  For the first time, Hunan's total output of agricultural  production topped 50 billion yuan. The proportion of non-grain  crops in the total agricultural output increased from 38.3  percent to 40 percent; the proportion of forestry, animal  husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries in total  agricultural output increased from 47.4 percent to 48.6 percent;  and in the total social output value of rural areas, the output  of non-agricultural sectors increased from 47.9 percent to 56  percent. Every year, Hunan exports more than 2 billion jin of  grains and more than 5 million hogs to support other regions.  In Hong Kong, one-quarter of the hogs on the market come from  Hunan.    Although Hunan has made such brilliant progress, Chen  Bangzhu  is still not satisfied with its agricultural development. He  believes it is unacceptable for Hunan not to make progress under  the new situation.    Chen Bangzhu arranged a new "blueprint" for this reporter on  the tea table using an ashtray, tea cups, and document pouches  to explain his plan.    Chen Bangzhu said: "We should gear science and technology  toward agriculture." He continued: We need science and  technology to guide us on the road of seeking high yields, and  improving product quality and farming efficiency. Beginning  this year, we will focus on tackling problems in agrotechnology,  and developing science and technology in all agricultural  fields. We will pay close attention to 40 counties in which  commodity grain bases were established, 15 high-quality cotton  bases, and three special model areas known for their high-yield,  high-quality, and efficient agriculture. Hunan will quicken the  popularization and establishment of a science and technology  service system, especially the construction of agrotechnology  education centers in towns and townships. We will set up  agrotechnology education centers extensively, to broaden the  scale of scientific and technological popularization, and  increase projects in this field in a bid to carry out the  strategy of comprehensively supporting, systematically  developing, and wide- rangingly popularizing agrotechology.    Chen Bangzhu said: We must make efforts in agricultural  development. We must integrate resource exploration with market  demands and comprehensive development of mountain areas with the  scheme of helping the poor. Hunan is blessed with rich natural  resources. It has more than 0.2 billion mu of mountainous land,  20 million mu of water areas, 4 million mu of vegetable plots,  and more than 5 million mu scattered pieces of land, showing  great development potential. Since last year, Hunan has begun  to quicken development. It has increased 0.2 million mu of  cotton filed; 0.355 million mu of improved tea-oil tree plots;  16,000 mu of newly- developed water areas; 26,000 mu of shoaly  land; 40,000 mu of model bases of high-quality economic forests;  new production bases for cows, sheep, rabbits, and aquatic  products; and gardens for high- quality fruits. We have opened  up the road of development and will continue to make major  strides in the future.    Chen Bangzhu said: "Exchange-earning export of agricultural  products is a pillar of our new agricultural framework." Last  year, Hunan earned $210 million from exporting agricultural and  sideline products. However, the production of finely processed  products is still insufficient. We need to make efforts to  increase the added value of our farm products. We must develop  some leading products and gradually set up production areas and  operate them on a large scale.    "People in Hunan should pay attention to both domestic and  foreign markets. A new chapter will definitely be added to  Hunan's agriculture," said Chen Bangzhu confidently.</p>

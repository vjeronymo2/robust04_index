			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Letter: Re-evaluating UK economic policy Sir, It is almost beyond belief that, in the present state of the UK economy, the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, should not merely be considering an increase in interest rates but is actually advertising his readiness to do so in an attempt to reassure speculators of his determination to beat inflation. After examining the devaluations of 1931, 1949 and 1967, Sir Alec Cairncross and Barry Eichengreen, in their book, Sterling in Decline, concluded that despite the variety of circumstances, such as terms of trade and behaviour of money supply, there is little evidence in any of those three episodes that the immediate gain in competitiveness was quickly extinguished by an inflation of wages and prices. Mr Lamont might do well to get this book out of the Treasury library. L Bell, Tyrrells, High Street, Limpsfield, Oxted, Surrey RH8 0DR</p>

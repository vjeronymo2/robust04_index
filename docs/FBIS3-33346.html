			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Feb (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  this morning stated that any new trial of the military officers  who ruled Argentina between 1976 and 1983 "would be double  jeopardy" and noted that the presence in Argentina of Italian  judges to investigate alleged cases of torture of Italian  citizens "is pointless."    Menem said: "As everyone here knows, we have an amnesty law,  a due obedience law, court sentences, and a pardon decree" and  thus this is "a closed matter."    Menem made these remarks shortly before leaving for Ecuador  where he will be received by President Sixto Duran-Ballen, with  whom he will sign several bilateral integration agreements.    In an unscheduled news conference at the military sector of  the Aeroparque metropolitan airport, Menem said he finds it  strange for "Italy to try to meddle in these affairs" now that  "several years have elapsed since the time of repression in our  country."    "Those cases to which the double jeopardy principle is  applicable cannot be reopened," Menem said.    He said that the subject "has been artificially  resurrected,"  adding that the presence of Italian judges in Argentina "is  pointless at this time."    Asked by reporters if the Italian judges could request the  extradition of former de facto President Jorge Rafael Videla,  Menem said: "No, they have no right to do that because he has  been sentenced and pardoned."    Menem reiterated that the government has great interest in  the approval of the labor reform bill being discussed in  Congress.    At 0702 this morning Menem left for Ecuador where he will  sign several bilateral integration agreements and, on 21  February he will go to Colombia to meet with President Cesar  Gaviria.</p>

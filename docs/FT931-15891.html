			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Books: A triumph of family capitalism - The success of Schroders SCHRODERS: MERCHANTS AND BANKERS by Richard Roberts Macmillan Pounds 25, 616 pages IT READS like Buddenbrooks-on-the-Thames. Johann Heinrich Schroder, 17-year-old son of a prosperous merchant family, left his native Hamburg in 1802 and settled in the City of London, joining his elder brother's business. Sixteen years later he started his own firm, J. Henry Schroder &amp; Co. And, until retiring in 1849, he ran it and a sister firm in Hamburg with an iron hand: strongly Lutheran and equally strongly devoted to the profit motive, his world-view was encapsulated in advice to a St Petersburg agent in 1846: 'Take pains to become a sensible human being, acquire good, unassuming manners, don't dream of Spanish castles in the sky.' Other Schroders followed but the culture remained the same. A crucial moment occurred in the early 1890s. John Henry (son of Johann Heinrich) was childless: who would come through from the third generation? His 25-year-old nephew, Bruno, started work in the firm's Leadenhall Street office on the day in January 1893 that the FT turned pink. At once he was discovered examining the bills of exchange that had come in to be guaranteed hy Schroders: trade finance was the very backbone of the firm's business and it was obvious he was the man. There was probably no more German house in the City. Most of its clients world-wide were of German origin; even by the turn of the century German was still the language of the office; and the Schroders themselves continued to take German brides. The partners of other merchant banks were increasingly attracted by politics and high society, but these held no allure for the serious-minded Schroder partners. The results were apparent by the Edwardian period: on the eve of war, Schroders was arguably the City's most successful merchant bank. Issuing foreign loans as well as lubricating world trade, it was consistently achieving a rate of return on capital of some 16 per cent - three times greater than that of British banking as a whole. All done with 40 clerks and two partners (Frank Tiarks as well as Bruno Schroder), it was a triumph of family capitalism. Then came a series of crises. The First World War would have been a disaster anyway, because of the firm's heavy commitments in Central Europe, but was doubly so because of the perceived German allegiance of Bruno Schroder, his situation little helped by having been made a baron by the Kaiser. Patient rebuilding followed in the 1920s - including opening a New York firm, Schrobanco - but all was blown aside by the European financial crisis of 1931, which for over a decade left the firm hobbled. The Second World War was merely a further blow. Would a phoenix arise? 'It is vitally important to our own happiness that we should make up our minds quite definitely, once and for all, that to run JHS &amp; Co is what we want to do more than anything in the world. That we want to and can deal with and master awkward folk and awkward unpleasant situations and enjoy doing it.' So in 1944 wrote the fourth Schroder (Helmut) to the third Tiarks (Henry). Tiarks' reply was whole-hearted and by the 1950s the firm was again on the move, reflecting the revival in the City at large of corporate finance and international banking. There was one more central figure: not from Hamburg but from Nottingham; not a City man but a successful lawyer up to the age of 40. Gordon (now Lord) Richardson joined Schroders in 1957, in an inspired piece of recruitment, and over the next decade and a half was its dominant presence, imbuing the firm with revived professionalism and sense of thoroughness. There are affinities with Siegmund Warburg, though without Warburg's creative streak: and now, 20 years after Richardson left to become Governor of the Bank of England - years in which the firm has generally got right the important decisions, above all a low-key approach to 'Big Bang' - it is appropriate that Schroders lies second only to Warburgs in the merchant bank ratings. All this is told by Richard Roberts with a formidable technical grasp but also a pleasantly light touch, including a good joke about Yoko Ono's father, a well-known Tokyo banker. There are also wonderful photographs of the partners enjoying Christmas dinner in 1956, complete with crackers, nuts and port. Johann Heinrich may have been spiritually a man for the phoned-in sandwich, but even he would have agreed that a chap needs sustenance if he is to avoid those Spanish castles in the sky.</p>

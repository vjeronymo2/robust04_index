			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jute sales authorised despite short crop IN SPITE of a big drop in the raw jute crop because of the near absence of pre-monsoon showers, the Indian government is allowing shippers to export up to 150,000 bales (180 kg each) to hard currency areas during the 1992-93 (July-June) season. According to Mr RN De, the jute commissioner, the objective is to make India, which is the second largest exporter of jute goods after Bangladesh, a regular exporter of raw jute. The government has stipulated that medium and inferior grades must comprise at least 80 per cent of cut jute exports and 75 per cent of uncut exports. This makes exporting a difficult proposition, says Mr Shankar Ladia, spokesman for the shippers. And foreign buyers do not like the idea of the Jute Corporation of India, a government undertaking, being the sole agency to certify the 'quality, condition and weight of export consignments'. The only thing in the shippers favour is that international jute prices are higher than Indian domestic prices. Last year India could ship only 11,000 the 200,000 bales sanctioned because there was hardly any demand for medium and inferior grades. While last year, the entire quantity was sold to the US and European buyers, Mr Ladia thinks India can find buyers for jute in Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Egypt. An Indian jute team will soon be visiting Pakistan, according to Mr De.</p>

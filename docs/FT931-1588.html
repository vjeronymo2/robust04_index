			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Private hope for hit-list pits: Companies eager to run British Coal mines WHEN the government publishes its white paper on coal, probably tomorrow, it will attempt to focus much attention on people such as Mr Richard Budge. The head of a private mining group, RJB Mining, Mr Budge may not be mentioned by name in the white paper. But the entrepreneurial spirit he represents will contribute strongly to the flavour of a document expected to stretch to more than 150 pages. The white paper will almost certainly fail to match the aspirations of MPs who want British Coal to keep mining, under its ownership, at least half the threatened 31 pits. But, with the help of the private sector, the government may offer hope of a future of some kind for at least 20 of the 31. By drawing in private companies to run pits no longer wanted by the corporation, the government will also be able to claim that it has started the privatisation which it hopes to complete within three years. Companies such as RJB, Ryan International and Edwards Energy are almost certain to be invited to bid for licences to run the 10 pits that British Coal has already said it wants to close immediately and others which may be mothballed. That could lead to about six pits being saved, although the number of employees would have to be cut significantly. Under existing legislation licensed miners can only employ up to 150 people underground, whereas the average British Coal mine employs 1,000. Changing the law would take some months and may not be possible before the end of this parliamentary session in the autumn. In any event, companies keen to mine under licence may hold back before making their bids until the corporation concludes contracts with the electricity generators for coal additional to 'base tonnage' deals likely to be finalised later this week. That will probably take several months, and only then will the private sector be able to judge the size of the market available to it. The chances are that the additional contracts will be for about 40m tonnes over five years, leaving some space at least for the private operators. Why should the private sector be able to make a success of mines which the corporation says are not viable? Mr Budge's ambition to buy up to 10 British Coal pits is based on his belief that he can achieve far greater efficiencies than the corporation, and supply coal at world prices far more speedily than British Coal's projection of up to five years. He believes that the corporation's problems are the product of its nationalised past. 'It is a culture, an attitude,' he says. 'We would be happy to pay similar wages to British Coal but we would get far more out of workers.' Mr Budge, whose company already operates two deep coal mines in north-west England and has significant opencast interests, also believes that British Coal suffers because of what he sees as a preoccupation with the electricity supply industry market. He says: 'BC is directing all its attention to one market and satisfying others, like those for households and industrial users, with what falls off as a result.' Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former British Coal marketing director who hopes to lead a consortium to licence up to four mines in the York-shire region, agrees with Mr Budge. 'If BC closes all 31 mines, they will not be able to supply some of the specialised markets,' he says. 'Supplies to the household market would reduce if BC closed both Markham Main and Rossington. Neither they nor Frickley and Bentley, which we are also interested in, have achieved their full potential. I am confident they could be a long-run success.' In Wales, companies including Ryan International say they could make a success of the Betws mine which produces high-quality anthracite coal but which British Coal is no longer interested in because of depletion of reserves. Ryan says its interest in the corporation's mines ends with Betws. At the other end of the scale, Hanson is constantly rumoured to be interested in large parts of British Coal's business. That will become clear only after publication of the white paper.</p>

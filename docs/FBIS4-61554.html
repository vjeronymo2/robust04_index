The  ITAR-TASS correspondent was informed of this in the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic press and information department.    It was reported from Stepanakert at the same time that this  morning the Azerbaijani side embarked upon a large-scale  offensive in the north of Markadertskiy Rayon towards the  villages of Chailu, Leninavan, and Karmiravan.

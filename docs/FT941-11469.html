			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Trade accord boost for global standardisation - Common technical, health and safety standards to facilitate the free flow of goods The global trade accords concluded in the Uruguay Round last December will give a big boost to the power and prestige of the numerous international organisations concerned with the setting of technical, health and safety standards for industrial and agricultural products. New agreements on food safety and animal and plant health regulations, and on technical barriers to trade, urge governments to make maximum use of international standards to prevent unnecessary obstacles to the free flow of goods. Unlike the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's current voluntary 'standards' code, which has about 40 signatories, the strengthened Uruguay Round accords will apply to all 115 Gatt members. Moreover, the dispute settlement mechanism which will come into force with the new World Trade Organisation next year will give governments better redress against the use of standards as disguised trade barriers. The Uruguay Round accord on technical barriers to trade, which covers non-farm goods, requests countries to use international standards where they exist unless 'ineffective or inappropriate' for the task. It also encourages them to join and participate actively in the 28 or so international standards-setting bodies, especially the Geneva-based International Organisation for Standardisation and its sister institution, the International Electrotechnical Commission, which sets standards in electrical and electronic engineering. The agreement can be expected to reinforce the impact of expanding world trade, globalisation of production and the increasingly rapid development of new products and technologies which have already prompted a big rise in demand for international standards to ensure worldwide compatibility. This has been magnified in recent years, according to Mr Lawrence Eicher, ISO secretary general, by the spread of regional trading blocs, the integration of developing and former communist countries into the world trading system, and recognition of the need to avoid new trade barriers as tariff walls crumble. ISO, a federation of 100 national standards bodies, has published more than 9,000 standards since it was set up in 1947, covering everything from screw dimensions and container sizes to car bumper heights and ski-boot bindings. Between them ISO and IEC, which has 42 active members, produce about 800 new and revised international standards each year. In ISO's early days, the emphasis was on harmonisation of national standards. Now, increasingly, industry does not bother to formulate a national standard but asks immediately for an international one. This process has gone furthest in the European Union which decided near the outset of its single market programme that it was not going to repeat at an international level the trauma of harmonising standards across the 12 members. Since 1991, the EU's standards bodies - Cen (European Committee for Standardisation) and Cenelec (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation) - have worked in parallel with ISO and IEC, producing the same or consistent standards which are issued simultaneously. For electrotechnical standards the overlap is already nearly 90 per cent and for other international standards it is 40-50 per cent. Apart from saving time and effort in standards development, the EU move represents a big competitive advantage for European companies which can avoid the cost and inefficiency of playing to different sets of rules for the domestic and export market. The lesson has not been lost on members of other groupings, including the North American Free Trade Agreement which links the US, Canada and Mexico. US companies have historically taken relatively little interest in international standards because they could prosper in the huge home market. As the importance of trade to the US economy has grown, so too have problems caused by a lack of standardisation. Many US companies, for instance, still operate on the imperial system of weights and measures, 20 years after most of the rest of the world went over to metric. Harmonisation of technical standards between the US and Canada under their 1988 bilateral free trade agreement has proved an arduous task, aggravated by the contrasting standards-setting systems. The US has several hundred industry and local government organisations contributing to national standards, while Canada has just a few standards-writing bodies. The Nafta accord attempts to avoid adding unduly to these problems by requiring national standards to be based on international ones. Any more stringent measures will have to be harmonised at regional level. The growing emphasis on international standards has made the writing of those standards itself a highly competitive industry. Under ISO procedures, if at least five countries agree to participate actively in developing a standard, a technical committee is set up with one of those countries providing the secretariat. There is strong country rivalry for these secretariats, since it increases the chances that the international standard will reflect the priorities of the domestic industry.</p>

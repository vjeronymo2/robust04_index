			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREGNANCY DIABETES  </P> <P> Question: If a woman is found to have diabetes when she becomes pregnant for  the first time, does that mean she'll probably have the same problem each time  she becomes pregnant?  </P> <P> Answer: It is estimated that about one-third of women who develop diabetes  during one pregnancy will not have a recurrence during a subsequent pregnancy.  </P> <P> Some of the reasons suggested to explain this are changes in diet, exercise  habits, the degree of stress they may be subjected to and other life-style  factors that may affect diabetes.  </P> <P> Women who develop diabetes during one pregnancy as well as during a subsequent  pregnancy are more likely to be heavier than women who don't.  </P> <P> For Perry, Princeton, N.J.: Basketball players should trim their fingernails  before a game. This would reduce the risk of corneal abrasions, which are quite  common.  </P></p>

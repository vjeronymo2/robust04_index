			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By CRIME-PRESS correspondent Olga Solodova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 18 TASS -- A group of unidentified  gunmen burst on Sunday into headquarters of Russia's newly-born  Party of Scientific and Technical Intelligentsia (PNTI) and  sprayed the ceiling with automatic gun fire from two  Kalashnikovs, the party press service told CRIME-PRESS on  Monday. At the same time, another group of intruders robbed a  money exchange office which was located next door.    Party leader Aleksandr Krasnov is sure it was a mock  robbery,  since only 2,000 roubles (about one dollar) were stolen, while  the real aim of the break-in was to scare party-members. Last  fall, Krasnov, a scientist and former chairman of the Moscow  Krasnopresnenskiy District Soviet, reportedly supported the  dissolved parliament in its stand-off with President Boris  Yeltsin.</p>

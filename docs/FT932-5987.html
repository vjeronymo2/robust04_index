			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Raising cash from the wreck of BCCI: Sources to be tapped by liquidators CREDITORS WERE last week offered a faint glimmer of hope for repayments from the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was closed by regulators in July 1991. At an angry creditors' meeting, Mr Christopher Morris, a partner with accountants Touche Ross and one of the liquidators to BCCI under English law, offered the prospect of a dividend some time next year. He said creditors could expect to receive 15p in the pound next year if the liquidators' proposals were successfully endorsed. He stuck to a 'conservative' estimate of a total dividend of 30p to 40p in the pound 'some years' in the future. Several obstacles still need to be overcome and additional assets to be recovered. Any dividend will come from four principal sources: Contributions from the majority shareholder. The liquidators have negotiated an agreement with the government of Abu Dhabi, which owns 77 per cent of BCCI. That could lead to payments of between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 2.2bn, permitting a dividend next year. Much of this money could already have been released but is dependent on ratification by the Luxembourg courts following an objection by three BCCI creditors. They want a larger contribution or the right to sue Abu Dhabi - which would be sacrificed under the agreement. The court is reconvening in a few weeks to consider the matter further. Asset recoveries from BCCI. The liquidators have so far realised just 4.5 per cent of the stated Dollars 14bn in assets of the bank in July 1991. They are continuing to maintain some loans made by the bank, and estimate they will be able to realise a further 6.7 per cent. They are still charging commercial rates on outstanding loans but are not applying bank charges against depositors. Interest will be paid until the date BCCI passed into liquidation, January 3 1992. Legal action. Writs have been issued in London for more than Dollars 8bn by the liquidators against Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney - now part of Ernst &amp; Young - as auditors to BCCI, and for Dollars 10.5bn in the US against the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, its former chief operating officer. Last week the liquidators also issued a writ against the Bank of England on behalf of depositors for allegedly failing in its role as regulator. There may be other writs to come. Investigations. Teams of accountants are still tracing unspecified sums of money removed from the bank over many years into a complicated network of offshore trusts and secretive bank accounts. But the recoveries will probably be small. Much of the outstanding money shown in BCCI's books appears to have been squandered through bad loans or was falsely reported and never existed. In addition, some creditors have already been able to take advantage of deposit protection schemes in their own jurisdictions - such as the English creditors, who are offered 75 per cent of the value of their deposits up to Pounds 15,000. But that presents some problems. Those who used the equivalent scheme in the Isle of Man, for instance, have handed all their powers to the island's financial supervision commission. This makes it difficult for them to sue the commission if they decide it failed as a regulator. More generally, creditors will be keeping an eye on the results later this month of the ballot to choose five from the 23 candidates to sit on the formal BCCI creditors' committee. This group will oversee the work of the liquidators and advise them on future actions - including further writs - while monitoring the fees, which so far run to more than Dollars 133m (Pounds 85m).</p>

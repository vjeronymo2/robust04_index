			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading INVESTORS continued to speculate on a fall in the Amstrad share price in the traded options market yesterday following the dismissal of Mr Barry Young, its UK managing director. The news fanned concern about current trading, particularly in office computer sales. Institutions were strong buyers of Amstrad September 60 puts and purchasers of June 70 calls. The dealing in options encouraged selling of underlying securities and the shares ended 2 lower at 72p on turnover of 4.2m. A total of 1,719 Amstrad options changed hands, equivalent to more than 1.7m shares. Speculation about a bid for Allied-Lyons boosted turnover in its options, while the strong rally in the underlying securities prompted profit-taking in the July 600 calls. A total of 1,604 Allied-Lyons options were traded. The takeover talk surrounding Allied prompted a strong rise on the futures market, the June FT-SE contract rising to a premium of more than 30 points against the spot index. With futures traders and equity marketmakers short, the rally prompted active short-covering, which pushed the share market still higher. The June FT-SE closed at 2,536, up 26 points on the day. June's premium to the spot index finished at 30 points, against fair value of 15.</p>

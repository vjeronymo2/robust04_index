			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: STEVIE B PROSPERS IN A WOMAN'S WORLD  </P> <P> Dance music is a genre that is mostly saturated by flowery, baby-voiced female  artists such as Paula Abdul, Sweet Sensation and the Cover Girls, but Stevie B  (nee Stevie B. Hill) lends a decidedly macho perspective. Supported by three  muscular, pin-up perfect dancer/back-up singers, Stevie B wasn't a model of  flowery charm -- or creative substance -- at the Palace on Friday night.  </P> <P> This Florida-based performer wasn't above throwing out some brusque,  four-lettered admonitions to his followers when their response to the cuddly  warmth of "Spring Love" and "In My Eyes" didn't reach a fevered pitch quickly  enough to suit him. Stevie B's lyrics are as innocent-sounding as those of The  Cover Girls, but he punctuated them with an overt sexuality. Crass, yes, but  effective. He eventually got fans on their feet and dancing. Still, his success  seems largely due to the fact that he is one of the few men in a woman's  musical world. CONNIE JOHNSON  </P></p>

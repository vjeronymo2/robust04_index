			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by economics department reporter Hideyuki Konaka] </F>   [Text] An official of a foreign securities firm operating  in Japan still bitterly complains of invisible barriers to entry  into Japanese markets, saying, "It took five years from the date  of the application until a permit was issued by the MOF. MOF  officials would listen, but the process was very slow because of  the vagueness of both standards and detailed procedures used in  the approval process."    The law governing operation of foreign securities firms in  Japan provides approval standards such as "adequate assets to  ensure sound operations" and "adequate social trust," but it  lacks any detailed regulations. That means that approval is  subject, to a great degree, to the discretion of the officials  handling each approval application. Moreover, foreign firms  constantly voice the dissatisfaction that "the preliminary  hearing stage leading to tentative approval is inordinately  long."    During the preliminary hearing stage, the MOF provides a  variety of "administrative guidance" concerning systems required  to operate a securities firm in Japan. It is said that each  piece of administrative guidance issued by the MOF must be  followed by submission of a written response by the applying  firm and that each submission reaches a thickness of almost 10  centimeters. Once this process is completed, submission of a  formal request is finally approved by the MOF. MOF officials  admit that it is normal that "the process of tentative approval,  submission of application, and formal approval takes one month,  but inclusion of the preliminary review stage extends the normal  time requirement to one or two years." In other words, the  advance "guidance period" consumes the majority of the total  processing time.    MOF officials rebut charges of vagueness by saying, "Unlike  the United States where you start with the submission of an  application for a permit, we provide appropriate guidance  beforehand. We feel that you can call this a case of being  helpful," but to foreigners such Japanese-style administrative  guidance systems have a tendency of appearing to be "vague."    Even in the "financial services" sector of the Japan-U.S.  trade talks, a strong case is being made for attaining  transparency in approval and legal systems. This issue first  surfaced in the "Japan-U.S. Yen-Dollar Committee" meeting of  1984 and has since been mentioned at every opportunity,  including the Japan-U.S. framework talks.    During the insurance sector talks held on 1 and 2 June in  Tokyo, the U.S. side's trade and commerce action officer said,  "We would like to see the establishment of transparency and  clarification of provisions for permits and regulation and the  provision of clear-cut standards for approval of insurance  products," and renewed their request for improvement of  administrative guidance. The U.S. officials also stressed that  "transparency has been made a topic in trade talks for as many  as 10 years," and made no effort to conceal their frustration at  Japan's slowness in making improvements.    The U.S. perception of the situation is reflected in the  report concerning trade barriers compiled at the end of March  1994 by the U.S. Trade Representative.    Under the item concerning "financial services" in Japan, the  report discusses as a system issue the "lack of transparency."  The report first covers the current situation by referring to  the specific case of the insurance law by commenting, "It is  limited to general rules and relies on administrative guidance  for specific regulation." Additionally, it states that  participation by foreign firms is difficult because of the lack  of clear-cut standards and a problem exists in that there is no  way to determine whether the MOF treats foreign and Japanese  firms in a different manner.    The Japanese Government has finally shown signs of reviewing  the status of administrative guidance in response to criticism  of this nature from overseas sources.    The first move in this direction is the Administrative  Procedures Law to be implemented in October 1994. That law is  aimed at providing for fairness and transparency in  administrative procedures to the degree possible by establishing  common rules for handling permits and related actions which were  previously covered in individual pieces of legislation.    The law provides for delineation of "purpose," "content,"  and  "responsible individuals" concerning administrative guidance and  provides that oral guidance must be issued in writing to cover  the three listed points whenever so requested. The law will  provide for comprehension of such documentation by third parties  and affected parties hope that it will eliminate vague  administrative guidance.    However, comments are being made that this law alone will  not  provide for the resolution of vagueness in administrative  guidance. A source at a city bank gives as a reason,  "administrative guidance is the product of collusion between  government agencies and industry. A problem exists in industry  which has "accepted vague administrative guidance from  government agencies through a process of telepathy." It appears  we can say that the system reflects Japanese-type perceptions  symbolized in administrative guidance which requires  modification.</p>

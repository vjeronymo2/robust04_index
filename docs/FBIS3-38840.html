As NATO ambassadors met here, diplomats said that Canada was  the main opponent of a U.S.-French proposal to threaten bombing  raids if the Serbs do not withdraw their big guns from Sarejevo  in seven to 10 days.    Pro-Serb Greece has also come out strongly against the use  of  air strikes, but reluctantly went along with a European  Community statement Monday to back the option to free Sarajevo  from the Serbs' grip.    Meanwhile Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev warned  Wednesday that air strikes on Bosnia's Serbs would have "grave  consequences" in a telegram to UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali.    The alliance was considering action following Saturday's  mortar attack on Sarajevo's market, which killed 68 people in  the worst single incident in the 22-month old conflict.    "It is time to act. We had enough words," NATO Secretary  General Manfred Woerner said after months of empty threats that  have left the credibility of the West's Bosnia policy in tatters.    The United States favoured a seven-day deadline for the  Serbs  while the French, who have UN troops on the ground protecting  relief operations, are proposing a 10-day limit, one NATO  diplomat said. [passage omitted]    Any action by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  requires  the unanimous approval of all 16 alliance members. The NATO  diplomat said it would also need a final clearance from the  United Nations.    Diplomats said Britain had also presented a proposal with  the  main difference being over at what level to take a decision on  airstrikes. They gave no details.    A Western diplomat said Canada, which has expressed fears of  reprisals against Canadian and other troops in the 10,000-strong  UN force, had put forth a text backing the idea of a deadline  but much more vague on any action to follow.    Diplomats said NATO would likely avoid using the word  ultimatum in their message to the Serbs. EC foreign ministers  on Monday rejected the French proposal for a deadline and kept  their call for air power vague.    "Most of the members are coalescing around the French-U.S.  proposal," said the diplomat, who asked not to be named.  Another NATO source said "a majority, not everybody" supported  the idea of a precise warning to the Serbs. [passage omitted]    In August, the alliance authorised the use of its warplanes  to end the strangulation of Sarajevo and other Serb-besieged  Moslem communities if requested by the United Nations.    NATO leaders reaffirmed the offer at their summit last  month.    But Butrus-Ghali has yet to give the green light for any air  operations by NATO, which has 170 aircraft, including 80  warplanes, already deployed to enforce a no-flight zone over  Bosnia.</p>

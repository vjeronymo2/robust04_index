			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> EASTWOOD RECALLS SERGIO LEONE  </P> <P> Clint Eastwood, paying tribute to Sergio Leone at a film festival, said one of  the joys of working with the late Italian director in the 1960s was that he  lacked Hollywood's ingrained self-censorship.  </P> <P> "Sergio was not afraid to attack things that were forbidden," Eastwood said.  </P> <P> "For instance, you couldn't show a character getting shot. Sergio didn't know  that, so he went ahead and filmed it."  </P> <P> The two met in 1963, when Eastwood accepted an offer to go to Italy and make "A  Fistful of Dollars," a Western modeled on Akira Kurosawa's samurai movie,  "Yojimbo."  </P> <P> The only Italian word Eastwood knew was arrivederci, and the only English Leone  knew was goodby, the actor told movie buffs Wednesday at the Sundance United  States Film Festival. As a result, Eastwood said, "I just did my own thing, and  Sergio went along with it."  </P> <P> One of Leone's trademarks was the extreme close-up, sometimes framing only a  subject's eyes.  </P> <P> "Actors love those tight shots," said Eastwood, 59. "But I was younger then.  Now I tell them to take the camera back."  </P></p>

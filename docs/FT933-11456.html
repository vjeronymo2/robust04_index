			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Northern Foods in milk deal NORTHERN FOODS is adding to its liquid milk business through the Pounds 7.2m purchase of MD Foods' activities in the south-west of England Northern said the deal would strengthen its position as a substantial milk buyer when the Milk Marketing Board is abolished next year. The acquisition is conditional on not being referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and is unlikely to be completed before October. MD Foods, the UK subsidiary of Denmark's largest dairy group, bought the business as part of its purchase of Co-operative Retail Services' dairy division in July 1992. It decided the Bristol dairy, which handles 42m litres a year, and has annual sales of Pounds 19m, was too small to justify the capital expenditure needed to bring it up to the standards of its other dairies. Northern is buying seven depots but will not take over the Bristol dairy, which MD will close with the loss of 125 jobs. Northern Foods will upgrade its own dairy at Thornbury, north of Bristol.</p>

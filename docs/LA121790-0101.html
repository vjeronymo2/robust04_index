			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES: IF IT WALKS LIKE A DUCK . . .  </P> <P> As legal battles go, this one is pretty fowl.  </P> <P> A federal judge in San Francisco recently ruled that Sharper Image Corp. -- an  upscale retailer and catalogue operation known for its unusual doo-dads -- did  not infringe on a patent held by Sunnyvale-based Nobell Inc. when it sold the  Quacky IV Fone.  </P> <P> The Quacky IV Fone is a telephone that looks like a mallard duck decoy, and it  quacks and moves its beak instead of ringing. Nobell's feathers were ruffled  because it holds a patent on a toy that moves or makes sounds or flashes lights  when a telephone rings.  </P> <P> "The patent covers any personalized telephone signaling device," said Irving M.  Weiner, Nobell's lawyer.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge D. Lowell Jensen disagreed, saying that Nobell's device was  separate from the telephone, while the quacking and beak-moving were an  integral part of the Quacky IV Fone's operation. Nobell is appealing the  ruling. Sharper Image no longer sells the Quacky IV Fone.  </P> <P> Still pending is a section of the suit concerning the Fido Phone. Nobell  contends that San Francisco-based Pacific Orient Trading Co. violated its  patent by once importing a telephone that -- what else? -- barks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sniffing Out Counterfeiters  </P> <P> In recent months, Giorgio Beverly Hills has had as much success sleuthing as it  has selling its renowned perfumes, Giorgio and Red.  </P> <P> The sleuthing is not part of a new detective-services subsidiary at Georgio. It  is aimed at protecting Giorgio's core business -- fragrances -- from  counterfeiters.  </P> <P> Late last week the company reported the bust of a major counterfeiting ring in  London. It said Al Vetter, its director of security, coordinated the  two-year-long investigation that resulted in the arrest of the gang's four key  leaders.  </P> <P> Vetter, who was assisted by Jean Louis Faure, director of security for  Paris-based clothing and perfume giant YSL, said a total of 27 arrests was  made. Four fragrance-filling factories, four storage buildings and 20  residences were raided, and more than 220,000 pieces of perfume-dispensing  gadgetry were confiscated. The counterfeit items -- Giorgio, Opium, Chanel and  Obsession -- were targeted for shipment to the United States, Australia, and  Nigeria.  </P> <P> In the past seven months, Giorgio said, it and YSL have played key roles in a  worldwide crackdown on perfume counterfeiting. In November, they cracked what  is believed to be the final Singapore link in a global fake-fragrance  syndicate. In September, they stopped the largest Singapore counterfeiter,  seizing an estimated $1.8 million worth of bogus perfume. And in June, they  raided three counterfeit perfume operations in Taiwan and Singapore.  </P> <P> Giorgio said the two companies' security departments have also been the  industry leaders in uncovering bogus scents in California and New York.  </P></p>

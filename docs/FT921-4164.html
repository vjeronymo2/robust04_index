			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Muddy Fox goes into administration MUDDY FOX, the Wembley-based company whose fox's pawprint has become one of the best-known trademarks in the world bicycle industry, has been placed in administrative receivership because of a downturn in sales and financial difficulties. Mr Nick Lyle and Mr Nigel Atkinson, partners in Touche Ross, have been appointed as joint administrative receivers for the privately-held company, which was formed in 1983. Turnover increased from Pounds 2m in 1987 to Pounds 8.5m last year, building on the reputation of its bikes, which in the UK cost between Pounds 98 and Pounds 1,350, for ruggedness and reliability. But competition has intensified at both the premium end of the market through the entrance of Cannondale and Trek, two strong US producers, and in the cheaper ranges. Mr Lyle said yesterday that the company had 'a prestige range of mountain bikes of appeal to both rural or urban users. We hope to sell the business as a going concern together with its valuable registered trademark. The level of interest in the company so far is very encouraging.' Muddy Fox bicycles are manufactured mainly in the Far East from UK designs. There are distribution centres in London and Germany supplying a European dealership network.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum up in New York and London Having moved up strongly in the New York market overnight, the platinum price opened sharply higher in London yesterday. It edged up further during the day to reach Dollars 360.90 a troy ounce at the afternoon fixing, up Dollars 7.15 from Tuesday. The rise was encouraged by the continued recovery in the gold price, which closed at Dollars 352.25 an ounce, up Dollars 4.65 on the day. Gold's rise was attributed to investment fund buying and short-covering following the recent sharp fall, which dealers said had left the market heavily oversold. They also noted that the rally was encouraged by the return of physical demand form south-east Asia. The dealers said that the platinum price had been overdue for a correction relative to the gold price as its premium over the yellow metal had narrowed sharply in the course of the recent general decline in precious metals markets. Immediately before gold retreated below the Dollars 400-an-ounce mark on August 6 platinum's premium had stood at Dollars 17.50, but that had shrunk to Dollars 6.50 earlier this week.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Philippe Rose: "Outsourcing: Bull Subcontracts </F> its Information Processing"]    [Text] Bull is taking the offensive on the FM market. With  the division headed by Thierry Breton, the French computer  manufacturer sets up a European structure dedicated to  multiplatform outsourcing. Named Athesa International, it will  become operational on 1 January 1993. It is a holding company in  which Bull owns 51 percent of the capital, the amount of which  was not made public. The remaining shares will be held by  industrial or bank partners; their names will be known "by the  end of the year," according to Jacques Tordjman, the former CEO  of EDS France who is now president of Athesa International. The  holding company will own a 50-percent interest in Athesa France  (the other half being owned by CISI); Athesa France will bring  together Bull's FM activities (its Methods and Information  Processing subsidiary as well as the Groupama backup center  running on GCos8 and managed by Bull) and part of Cisi  Telematics. The SSII [data-processing services and engineering  company] will also contribute its FM contract with the CEA on  IBM and Cray platforms, i.e. the equivalent of Fr70 million per  year.    Athesa France will have 650 employees (two thirds from CISI,  one third from Bull) and is already worth about Fr400 million.  At international level, Athesa will control 100 percent of  Athesa TSP (Technical Support and Partners), which will manage  Bull's data-processing centers (and those of the holding  company's future partners) at European level, i.e. the  equivalent of a contract worth at least Fr500 million. According  to Jacques Tordjman, sales should reach Fr1.2 billion next year  and Fr3 billion by 1995, with a 10 percent pre-tax margin.</p>

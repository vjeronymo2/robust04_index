The electoral commission said seven political parties, including the ruling Malawi Congress party, had registered to contest 177 parliamentary seats and elect an executive president for a five-year term. The votes are due to take place 11 months after Malawi's 9.7m people voted by an over- whelming majority in a ref-erendum to end one-party rule.</p>

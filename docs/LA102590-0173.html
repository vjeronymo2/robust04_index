			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> CHARITY MUSCLE;  </P> <P> BEEFCAKE GOES ON THE BLOCK FOR A GOOD CAUSE AND PREMIUM PRICE  </P> <P> By day they were loan officers, city planners, law students. But for this one  night they were screamers, hundreds of women yelling for Orange County firemen  who peeled off their yellow slickers like strippers and bumped, thrust and  pranced their way down a runway.  </P> <P> The shouts created a wall of sound that crested at the sight of bare, oiled,  muscular chests and faded when the bodies were garbed in tuxedoes. Women rushed  to the raised platform and thrust roses into the hands of the men who strutted  before them.  </P> <P> Some women took it farther. They held roses in their mouths like flamenco  dancers and had the prancing hunks pluck them away with their own mouths. Other  women stuffed dollar bills down the front of the uniform trousers, thrust their  hands over their heads in uninhibited victory cheers and boogied back to their  seats.  </P> <P> It wasn't Chippendales. It was charity.  </P> <P> Last Friday night in an Anaheim hotel, 20 firemen competed for 12 spots on next  year's "Firefox" calendar. Tickets cost $20, calendars featuring last year's  winning firemen cost $10, and dances with the firemen went for $1. The  proceeds, $17,000, went to the Orange County Burn Assn., the UCI Burn Center  and the Burn Survivors organization.  </P> <P> This past Tuesday night, the stakes were higher, the flesh was older, the  screams were as loud. Again, for charity.  </P> <P> Women who paid anywhere from $25 to $100 per ticket crowded a Newport Beach  hotel ballroom to bid for bachelors, shelling out thousands of dollars in some  cases to head off to London, Madrid or Jamaica with the man of their choice.  The beneficiary was the March of Dimes, which assists children with birth  defects.  </P> <P> Were the events tacky? Tawdry? Sexual come-ons of a sort that would bring  screams of outrage if it were men bidding on women? Hey, this is charity.  </P> <P> "The whole purpose (of the "Firefox" event) is to help the burn victims," said  Msgr. John Sammon, chaplain for county firefighters. He and the chiefs of the  Anaheim and Fountain Valley fire departments were on hand "to help make sure  the whole procedure is under control," Sammon said.  </P> <P> "It's not Chippendales," where men strip way, way down to entertain women. "If  it was, then we wouldn't be here and (the firemen) wouldn't be, either," Sammon  said.  </P> <P> And although the disc jockey introducing the contestants did stoop to the  occasional sexual innuendo, he also asked that the women "please don't touch  the firemen." The plea went unheeded.  </P> <P> Once upon a time, charities raised money with black-tie dinners and telephone  and mail solicitations. Then came running, bicycling and walking events. And  then came the calendars and bachelor auctions, with the auctions becoming  popular enough to warrant their own episodes on television shows like "L.A.  Law," "Cheers" and last Monday night's "Designing Women."  </P> <P> Michael Wagschal, an official of the American Cancer Society's Orange County  branch, said his organization hasn't produced bachelor auctions, but his former  employer, the American Heart Assn. chapter in Montgomery County, Md., did two  of them while he was there last year.  </P> <P> "One was a little meat marketish, a little degrading, and the other one was  classy," Wagschal said. At a classy event, typically held in a hotel ballroom  with bachelors in formal wear, the man "gets up and talks about his business,  hobbies, goals, what he reads." At the other, typically held in a bar with the  men less well-dressed, the men "get up there, talk about a sexual fantasy and  take their shirts off in a second," Wagschal said.  </P> <P> Wagschal said that at the cheaper event his group ran, they came up short on  bachelors "so they threw me up on the stage. I got picked by a female postal  worker, and I went on the date. I know this firsthand; she was expecting a lot  for her money. . . . I wasn't willing" to do anything but have dinner.  </P> <P> An official of one Orange County charity, who declined to be identified by name  because she didn't want to offend colleagues in the nonprofit field, said that  some bachelor auctions "let the women drink and drink and drink so they'll bid  higher. And they just make fools of themselves.  </P> <P> "At one, a woman in the parking lot was crying out loud and couldn't believe  she made such a spectacle of herself," she said, adding that often "bachelors  expect to get someone young and beautiful" and are disappointed.  </P> <P> But Richard Kavadas, owner of a Santa Ana business form company, said he wasn't  disappointed when he went on the block last year at the March of Dimes event.  </P> <P> He worried that it would be "like a meat-market type of a thing and all these  screaming women in the audience would like more than just company," Kavadas  said. "I just thought you'd run into all these crazy drunk women wanting more  than they should."  </P> <P> The event turned out to be "far superior and classier than I ever imagined it  would be," he said. He was auctioned off to "one of the neatest of the girls  who bid," but because of schedule problems they never did go on the date to  Palm Springs, for which Cheryl Bouview had paid $900.  </P> <P> Kavadas said that so far as he knew all the other men were as happy with the  event as he, except for one who "was pretty unhappy with the girl who picked  him because she was pretty drunk and staggering around the party afterward. I  think that woman had other things in mind."  </P> <P> Last year's March of Dimes event raised $150,000, the organization said. The  take for Tuesday night's show was $121,500, and produced a record bid, $15,000  for Mark C. Johnson, who promised the winner that "you will be picked up in my  Ferrari Testarossa and taken to John Wayne Airport, where we will fly in my jet  helicopter to LAX."  </P> <P> Then it's on to London on Friday, a performance of "Miss Saigon," followed by a  $1,000 shopping spree. Sunday brings a Concorde flight to New York and tickets  to the play "Aspects of Love." Johnson and date will stay at the Helmsley  Palace, the tower of glitz where Leona Helmsley presides.  </P> <P> A teddy bearish 44-year-old with red hair, beard and mustache, Johnson said he  was "exhilarated" by the size of the winning bid and "really happy for the  kids" helped by the March of Dimes. Karen Elliott, owner of interior design and  public relations firms in Tustin, wrote out the $15,000 check but declined to  say who provided the money. (Only the difference between the bid and the cost  of the trip is tax deductible.)  </P> <P> Elliott said the event was "a good cause" and she hadn't met Johnson  beforehand, though for an hour before the auction the more than two dozen  tuxedoed bachelors gathered in another ballroom to meet bidders, most of them  decked out in their finest cocktail dresses.  </P> <P> The written instructions to the bachelors warned: "Do not give out your  business card! Do not take anyone's business card! Do not drink alcohol! Do be  pleasant and try to talk to as many women as you can about your package. This  will increase your bidding!"  </P> <P> The men were also warned they would be disqualified for drinking alcohol or  "removing an article of clothing on stage."  </P> <P> Robin Huffman did meet the man she bid on at the mingling session beforehand.  She said Paul Driskell, 47-year-old chief executive officer of a leasing  corporation and the only bachelor sporting an earring, was "extremely  personable" and was dubbed "a nice man" by the spotters in the audience helping  the auctioneer determine who was bidding.  </P> <P> Huffman said she had attended the auction before, but didn't bid then because  "I thought there were a lot of wealthy women" waving for the auctioneer's  attention. Then she learned that many women solicit donations. She said she had  80 checks from friends and clients of her interior design firm to help pay the  $1,500 bid for a trip to San Francisco and environs.  </P> <P> A lot of the folks inside clearly were moneyed. Outside, at the entrance to the  hotel, the Mercedes lined up snout to snout looked like a Frankfurt car lot.  Women bidders received $300 Gucci watches over and above the excursions  promised by the bachelors.  </P> <P> Bill Johnson, co-chairman of the March of Dimes event, said a major advantage  that a function such as a bachelor auction has over a formal dinner is the  lesser cost to the nonprofit group to stage the affair.  </P> <P> With so much competition among charities for donors' dollars in Orange County,  people who "spend $50, $100, $150 on events want to know they're done nicely,"  Johnson said. They read the labels of the wines that are served. They remember  the souvenirs the charity provides.  </P> <P> What do they remember about the bachelor auctions, though? Do the organizers  get questions about the sexual overtones of the evening?  </P> <P> "We get it constantly," Johnson said. "We can't ignore it, because of the fact  that it's exactly the image or the ambience that's in the air." Johnson said  the bachelors are warned not to shed any clothing or dance erotically, and to  "try to keep this above board."  </P> <P> "We know it's there, it has to be there, otherwise some of the jazz isn't in  the event. . . . (But) if there are any sexual overtones, it's in the mind of  whomever is looking onto the stage," he said.  </P> <P> Ruth Ko, publisher of Orange Coast magazine, was one of the judges at Friday's  "Firefox" event and was co-chairwoman of Tuesday's bachelors' bid.  </P> <P> "We as fund-raisers have to look for creative fund-raising, and we have to go  for what the public wants," Ko said in explaining why charities sponsor events  that some people criticize for being tacky.  </P> <P> "You'll always have critics," Ko said. "If we sold pencils, they'd say we were  taking money from the blind." She did say that after attending her first  Firefox event, "I was a little shocked at some of what went on" and "a little  embarrassed" by the firemen stripping. "But apparently the firemen think it's  fine."  </P> <P> Gloria Allred, an attorney who has filed numerous lawsuits on behalf of women's  rights and is an outspoken and prominent feminist, said that she sees nothing  wrong with bachelor auctions, so long as it's men who are on the block.  </P> <P> "I don't feel it forces (men) into any kind of a subordinated role," Allred  said. "I don't think it affects their image as a group. I do think it has an  impact on women and their image and their status if they're portrayed as slaves  or objects of property, because historically we were considered to be the  property of men. Men were never considered as a matter of law to be the  property of women."  </P> <P> "I also know as a practical point of view that it's difficult for charities to  raise funds and this is a possible way to do it," Allred said. "I also know  it's difficult for single women to meet men, and I'm loathe to deprive them of  any chances."  </P> <P> Allred said a friend dragged her to a bachelor auction one time and she won a  date with a football player, whose name she couldn't remember. "It was kind of  a joke. We never connected to go out. The point was to make the donation" to  charity, she said.  </P> <P> As with the auction in Newport Beach on Tuesday night, the one Allred attended  had a crowd made up largely of "working women, businesswomen," she said, all of  whom "looked like they were having a wonderful time."  </P> <P> Also having a wonderful time last Friday were the firemen competing to get on  the calendar. The dressing room had the ambience of a high-school football  team's locker room, with hootin' and hollerin' and quick shuffle steps by  contestants trying to remember what the choreographer had taught them during  the all-day preparations for the event.  </P> <P> Outside, 21-year-old Vicki Lesch of Anaheim Hills said she was at the event "to  have fun, check it out." Inside, as the parade up and down the runway hit full  stride, Lesch was one of the women growing more enthusiastic. By the event's  end, she had stuffed six one-dollar bills into the trousers of her favorite  firemen.  </P> <P> "It's totally fun, totally awesome," Lesch said. Would it be as much fun if the  firemen stayed fully clothed? "Oh yeah," she said at first. But egged on by her  friends, she laughingly admitted, "taking it off is better. Less is better.  It's about time we have men doing it."  </P> <P> The most jarring event of the evening came after three and a half hours of  firemen prancing and dancing, when two burn victims were introduced.  </P> <P> One was Vinnie Tanis, dressed in a tuxedo, who was one year old in 1979 when he  was badly burned in a house fire. The other was Krystin Olson, 22, who in June  of 1989 was in a car struck by a man fleeing police. The car exploded and she  spent two months in the hospital, receiving treatment and skin grafts. She  still faces three to five years of plastic surgery, she said, "but I'm just  happy to be alive."  </P> <P> The crowd, reminded by the master of ceremonies that helping burn victims was  "the one reason that we're here tonight," applauded loudly for both survivors.  </P> <P> After that 10-minute interlude, it was back to the firemen, stripped and  dancing. "Come on guys, I want to hear the ladies scream," the MC urged.  "Wiggle it, wiggle it."  </P> <P> As the firemen went down the runway yet again, two women shoved dollar bills  between their breasts, approached the platform and let firemen lean down and  pluck the bills with their teeth.  </P> <P> All for charity.  </P></p>

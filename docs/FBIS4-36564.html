			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, June 5, INA--Arab and International  Relations Committee of the National Assembly is currently  working out a plan for the coming period on the political moves  to illustrate Iraq's viewpoint vis-a-vis UN Security Council  resolutions and expose attempts by some parties to prolong the  imposition of the anti-Iraq sanctions for realizing political  purposes unrelated to the original texts of the UN resolutions.    Vice-chairman of the committee Taha Ahmad al-Dawud was  quoted  by a local daily as saying that the plan aims at urging the  world politicians and parliamentarians, and those of Britain and  the U.S. in particular to work for lifting the anti-Iraq  sanctions and holding the U.S. and Britain responsible for the  death of tens of thousands of Iraqis and the destruction of  Iraq's infrastructure.    The plan, moreover, will make it clear that the continuation  of the economic blockade runs counter to human rights and  Washington's and London's claims and boasts of being the ardent  advocates of human rights, said Mr. al-Dawud.    He went on to say that invitation will be sent to a number  of  world MPs to visit Iraq for dialoge and to get acquainted with  the negative consequences of the U.S.-allied aggression and the  continuation of the UN-imposed economic sanctions.    The committee's plan also aims at urging the world MPs to  exercise pressure on their governments towards lifting the  embargo.    Moreover, the National Assembly, through its Arab and  International Relations Committee will work for holding talks  with MPs of the Security Council member-states in addition to  exchanging letters with heads of the world parliaments on their  stands and Iraq's stand vis-a-vis UN Security Council  resolutions and allegations and claims aired by iraq's enemies  to divert the world's attention from the recent positive  development in the stands of a number of the UN Security Council  member-states and in a bid to manipulate the world public  opinion, Mr. al-Dawud concluded.</p>

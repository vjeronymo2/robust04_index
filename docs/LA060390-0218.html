			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HOT RODDER IS ORDERED TO LEAVE THE COUNTY  </P> <P> A hot rodder who previously had agreed to stay out of a Torrance neighborhood  where he allegedly terrorized residents with his driving has been ordered to  leave Los Angeles County for more than a year after violating his probation in  another case.  </P> <P> Jonathan Shane Allabaugh, 21, has until June 15 to get out of the county, under  a sentence imposed Friday by Torrance Superior Court Judge Cecil J. Mills.  </P> <P> The Torrance man agreed to the unusual penalty to avoid a prison sentence for  violating his probation on a 1988 conviction for breaking into a car.  </P> <P> He must stay out of Los Angeles County until the end of his probation in  September, 1991, according to a court official.  </P> <P> Allabaugh was found in violation of his probation for burglary in April, when  he pleaded no contest to 730 charges of disturbing the peace and driving on a  suspended license in his souped up Volkswagen Beetle. He was placed on  probation for 275 years on those charges and agreed to be banned for life from  the Torrance neighborhood, known as the Hollywood Riviera, where the violations  occurred.  </P></p>

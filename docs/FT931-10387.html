			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Germans play down effects of rate cuts BUNDESBANK president Helmut Schlesinger said yesterday that he did not expect money market rates to react significantly to key interest rate cuts made by the German central bank last week, AP-DJ reports from Basle. 'The interest rate cuts themselves were part of a process in which we have been for a long time,' he said. 'The current interest rates in the money markets will probably, in the short term, be little affected' by the reductions in the official rates. Speaking after a meeting of the Bank for International Settlements, Mr Schlesinger also denied that the Bundesbank acted under domestic or foreign pressure when it announced its rate cuts.</p>

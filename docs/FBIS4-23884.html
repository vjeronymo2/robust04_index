			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>   [Excerpts] Kigali, 20 June (AFP) -- Fierce battles raged on  in the Rwandan capital Monday [20 June] as France stepped up  diplomatic efforts to persuade rebels not to oppose planned  French-led military intervention to end the carnage. "There is  a lot of fighting, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) is putting  the Army under heavy pressure but it is defending itself very  well," UN military spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante said.    In France, military sources said that the Central African  Republic, located to the northwest of Rwanda across Zaire, would  serve as an operational platform for the operation France hopes  rapidly to mount. The RPF strongly opposes French intervention  in Rwanda, arguing that Paris armed the government army and  helped train extremist militias from the Hutu majority accused  of slaughtering hundreds of thousands of minority Tutus.    The mainly Tutsi rebels are laying siege to Army positions  in  Kigali, but Plante said the United Nations Assistance Mission in  Rwanda (UNAMIR) had "not noted a significant change in the  positions of one side or the other." The fighting was  particularly intense in Kigali city centre, in the southwest of  the city and around two military camps in the north and east.  On Sunday night, the sky over the city was streaked with flares  and tracer bullets, while the sound of rocket launchers  thundered from the surrounding hills.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Sunday that French  officials would begin contacts this week with Rwandan Government  officials and with Rwandan guerrilla representatives in New  York. He told French television station TF1 on Sunday that "we  are making a great efforts to convince the Rwandan Patriotic  Front that this operation is not aimed against them." Juppe has  also stressed that his plan was humanitarian and ruled out going  alone or without backing from the UN Security Council, but so  far only Senegal has made a concrete pledge of sending troops to  join the French.    Italian Defence Minister Desare Previti headed for Paris on  Monday, as the daily REPUBBLICA published an interview in which  he said Rome would join in a military operation in Rwanda, but  only if the deployment was based on an international accord.    Military sources in France said French troops, numbering  from  1,000 to 2,000 men, would be stationed in countries bordering on  Rwanda, probably Zaire and Tanzania, but would not fly into  Kigali for security reasons. The sources said the operation  would be "strictly neutral" and also ruled out neighbouring  Burundi for the deployment of troops, since it too has a Hutu  majority and Tutsi minority, with a history of ethnic strife.  [passage omitted]    An informed source in Paris said the planned French  operation  would begin in an area where Tutsis are under threat. Tutsis  were said to make up about 15 percent of the population of some  7.5 million before the latest bloodletting claimed up to 500,000  lives. The United Nations said Monday it was hoping that  fighters would observe a truce so that civilians sandwiched  between the front lines could be evacuated. Such operations  were interrupted Sunday because of ferocious fighting.    A UN plan to reopen Kigali Airport, closed for the past two  weeks, on Sunday came to nothing after officials failed to  obtain written security guarantees from the government forces,  Plante said. Last month, the RPF seized the airport which is  also the base for the Ghanaian contingent of the UN mission,  which is currently using Uganda's Entebbe Airport to receive its  supplies and humanitarian aid which is then trucked into Rwanda.  [passage omitted]    Juppe and other French officials have indicated that any  French- led operation would be a limited one preceding the UN  redeployment. Military sources said troops would come from  France and from French bases in the Central African Republic,  Gabon, Cote d'Ivoire or Djibouti.</p>

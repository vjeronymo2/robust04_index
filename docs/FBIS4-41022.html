			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been a year since Ukraine and Russian signed  an agreement on free trade, but in reality there is no free  trade. This was stated at a briefing at the Ukrainian Ministry  of Foreign Affairs by Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr  Makarenko. He explained that the reason for this was that  Russia had 48 exemptions from a list of goods that Ukraine  imported. These were goods that were of vital importance to  Ukraine such as energy sources and timber. In the view of the  deputy minister, the creation of the CIS economic community and  Ukraine's associate membership of this union should remove these  discriminatory restrictions.    Oleksandr Makarenko acquainted journalists with the results  of President Leonid Kravchuk's visit to Luxembourg and the  signing of an agreement on partnership and cooperation between  Ukraine and the European Union. The deputy minister assessed  the signing of this agreement as the beginning of Ukraine's  entry into a united Europe. He in particular stressed that the  political part of this document which acknowledges the European  Union's interest in seeing Ukraine as a sovereign, independent  and territorially integrated state, was of great importance to  Ukraine.    Regarding essential economic issues, Oleksandr Makarenko  said  the agreement envisaged the removal of any restrictions on trade  between Ukraine and European Union member states. At the same  time he noted that although Europe had opened the door with this  agreement, the speed with which Ukraine would join it depended  on the speed of reforms in Ukraine.</p>

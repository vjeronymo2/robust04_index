			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> J. ``Make-up Water'' means that volume of water needed to replace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  process water lost due to evaporation and seepage in order to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  the quantity necessary for the operation of the beneficiation process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> K. ``New Water'' means water from any discrete source such as a river,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  creek, lake or well which is deliberately allowed or brought into the plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> L. ``Plant Site'' means the area occupied by the mine, necessary haulage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  ways from the mine to the beneficiation process, the beneficiation area,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  the area occupied by the wastewater treatment storage facilities and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  storage areas for waste materials and solids removed from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  wastewaters during treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> M. ``Receiving Water'' means waters such as lakes, rivers, streams, creeks, or any other surface waters which receive wastewater discharges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> N. ``Severe property damage'' means substantial physical damage to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  caused by delays in production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> O. ``Short circuiting'' means ineffective settling ponds due to inadequate or insufficient retention characteristics, excessive sediment deposition, embankment infiltration/percolation, lack of maintenance, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> P. ``Upset'' means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with technology-based permit effluent limitations because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  permittee. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  careless or improper operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. ``Wastewater'' means all water used in and resulting from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  beneficiation process (including but not limited to the water used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  move the ore to and through the beneficiation process, the water used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  to aid in classification, and the water used in gravity separation), mine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  drainage, and infiltration and drainage waters which commingle with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  mine drainage or waters resulting from the beneficiation process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Special Conditions_Effluent Limits Below Detection Levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Reporting Levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. For purpose of reporting, the permittee shall use the reporting threshold equivalent to the minimum level (ML). The ML is defined as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  concentration in a sample equivalent to the concentration of the lowest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  calibration standard analyzed in a specific analytical procedure,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  assuming that all the method-specified sample weights, volumes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  processing steps have been followed. As such, the permittee must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  utilize a standards equivalent to the concentration of the ML for arsenic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  which is 4 &mu;g/L.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. For the purpose of reporting on the DMR, actual analytical results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  should be reported whenever possible. All analytical values at or above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  the ML shall be reported as the measured value. When the results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  cannot be quantified, values below the method detection limit (1 &mu;g/L)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  shall be reported as zero (0 &mu;g/L) and values above the method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  detection level and below the ML shall be reported as 1/2 the ML or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  2 &mu;g/L.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Reporting Details <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the ``Comment'' section of the DMR, the permittee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  shall report the lowest calibration standard used and the ML achieved. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The same source gave details of the March 8 tragedy when  Beltsov and Agdashev, young servicemen, entered the dormitory of  the first border picket of the Pacific Border District  (Tanfilyev island, South Kurils) at seven in the morning on  Tuesday and opened fire with automatic weapons on  fellow-servicemen -- the old rankers. According to a  preliminary lead during the investigation, they wanted to avenge  an earlier insult resultant of brutal bullying.    The border picket personnel for several hours had been  unable  to pacify "mutinous" soldiers who, upon taking an advantageous  position, beat off by automatic fire all attempts to seize them.  Then the border picket commander called in a Mi-8 helicopter  from Kunashir island for help but Beltsov and Agdashev managed  to shoot down the helicopter which caught fire in midair and  fell onto the island. According to preliminary data, the crew  were not hurt while the helicopter burned up.    Only at 16.00 on Tuesday, a seizure group managed to  neutralise and apprehend the culprits of the tragedy. Six  servicemen were killed and several wounded in the fierce daylong  gunbattle on Tanfilyev island. Beltsov and Agdashev were seized  alive.    The same source dismissed rumours that Beltsov and Agdashev  intended to flee to Japan. He said Colonel-General Andrey  Nikolayev, commander of the Russian Federation border forces,  the commander of the Pacific Border District and the military  prosecutor of the district had been unable to get to the  Tanfilyev island for the second day due to the typhoon-caused  heavy storm.    Criminal proceedings have been instituted on the strength of  the incident facts, and an investigation is under way.</p>

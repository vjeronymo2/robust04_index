			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] By a large majority, the Knesset today approved  the joint decision by most factions which condemns the massacre  in Hebron: 93 Knesset members supported the joint statement,  one opposed, and seven abstained. Joining in the statement were  Labor, the Likud, Meretz, SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim], the  National Religious Party, Tzomet, YI'UD [Independent and  Democratic Israel], Moledet, and United Torah Jewry. The HADASH  [Democratic Front for Peace and Equality] and the Arab  Democratic Party submitted a different draft proposal which was  rejected by a vast majority. [passage omitted]    Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that several of the  Meretz faction members did not participate in the vote while  other Meretz members abstained due to their opposition to the  clause in the announcement which takes exception to any  generalizations or sweeping blame against certain sectors,  including the settlers.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (28): A brick-shaped future AT THE Jaworzno colliery, in Upper Silesia, the director placed a small cardboard box on the table. 'This,' said Mr Szczepan Perek, with pride, 'is the future of our coal mine.' Inside was a neat package of briquets of coal. 'Ecological fuel,' said Mr Perek triumphantly. Smokeless fuel has been known for many years in the west, but in Poland it is a new concept. In the case of the Jaworzno colliery, 20km west of Katowice, it is hailed as a saviour, and proof that the future is not bleak for all Polish mines. Jaworzno, like the Polish constitution, celebrates its 200th anniversary this year. But in February last year, after the colliery had been told that the sulphur content of its coal was too high, it seemed that 4,000 of its 7,500 workers would have to be laid off. Half a million tonnes of coal remained in store, deemed unfit for use under Poland's stiff new laws. Now the jobs have, apparently, been saved. The mine has exercised its right to operate independently, and has become one of the first in Poland to co-operate with western companies in safeguarding its future. The mine is investing in desulphurising and enriching equipment, as well as briquetting machinery, from Charbonnages de France, the German Helter company, and Andritz of Austria. Along with credit from these companies, it has received financial support from the State Coal Agency, and from the national fund for environmental protection. The new briquets are smokeless, low in sulphur, and, claims Mr Perek, burn for five hours. The product is aimed primarily at domestic consumers, and Mr Perek sees a huge potential market, particularly in cities like Krakow, which has 240,000 individual chimneys from coal stoves. Atmospheric pollution there is causing severe erosion of the historic buildings. Since the final quarter of last year, when the colliery announced that it could in future supply desulphurised coal, Mr Perek says the Jaworzno colliery has been inundated with orders. When he speaks, Mr Perek already sounds like a manager in the west. 'We've got the product, now we've got to find the market,' he says. 'We've wised up to the market.' Earlier, he had betrayed more than a trace of the old thinking. Unlike most capitalists, who would be happy to talk about the signing of their latest deal, Mr Perek and his colleagues had been most reluctant to talk. Only after half an hour of small-talk over one or two bottles of Czech beer did Mr Perek let out his secret. Now he was warming to his subject. 'We are deeply convinced that we are moving in the right direction. We are introducing new technology and helping the environment, and we feel good about that.' Despite the uncertainties facing the industry as a whole, Mr Perek displays every confidence in the future of his own mine. 'We are a mine that has many years ahead. Our coal is good, and we have 270m tonnes of reserves - that's enough for 200 years at current production levels.' Although the mine took its own initiative in buying new technology, Mr Perek supports the controversial plans of the State Coal Agency to create a national holding company. 'We are happy about it. We've seen it happen in other countries. 'Looking realistically, one mine cannot function on its own in the market. We can do it in the Polish market, but in the EC pack we would be eaten alive.'</p>

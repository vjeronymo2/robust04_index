			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Man In The News: Ultimate apparatchik - Erich Honecker When Erich Honecker raised a feeble clenched-fist salute as he left the Chilean embassy in Moscow this week, he showed the same sort of tottering truculence with which his own regime in East Germany had collapsed two years ago. Yet even in the moment of his humiliation, the man who ruled the German Democratic Republic for more than 18 years seems incapable of arousing strong emotions among his people. 'So Erich's back?' came the typical response from a Leipzig worker. 'So what? I don't need Honecker. I simply need a job again.' Mr Honecker was not just the leader of the country and its dogmatic Communist party, he was the very embodiment of the state: grey and grim, unimaginative and fundamentally indecisive. He was the ultimate apparatchik, who failed to turn his country into anything better than a pale, if more efficient, imitation of its Soviet master. There is no burning desire for revenge on the streets of Berlin as the once almighty party secretary returns, but rather an exhausted bitterness at the unholy mess he left behind. There is a very angry and articulate minority of people who suffered deeply from his regime - thousands who lost family members shot dead at the Berlin Wall or the inner-German border (for which he is now being charged with manslaughter), or years of their lives in political detention and powerless dissidence. Most, however, would be happy to see him humiliated, without massive retribution. A not inconsiderable minority who served in the party and the rest of the state apparatus feel bitter and bewildered that it is happening at all. If he is found guilty, and no doubt weeks of embarrassing and complex legal argument will come before that, the irony is that he would suffer far more severely under his own East German law than under that of the West: 10 years' sentence for manslaughter, instead of five if the western rule is followed. Mr Honecker's rule was certainly harsh, and he was quite prepared to go along with his colleagues in issuing a shoot-to-kill instruction to border guards trying to catch would-be refugees to the west. At the same time he was always ready to bend his own rules in exchange for profitable deals with Bonn: accepting a DM1bn loan, for example, in exchange for removing thousands of automatic shrapnel weapons mounted along the border. Doggedness, and a slavish adherence to the party line from Moscow, made him a perfect satrap for a Soviet-controlled state. He began life as a poor miner's son from Neunkirchen in the Saarland, and never allowed his audiences to forget it. Whenever he was shown round the standard shoddy East German apartment, he would compare it favourably with Saarland living conditions in the 1920s. As a staunch Communist party member in the 1930s, he went to help build the Soviet steel town of Magnetogorsk, in the Urals. When questioned about the food shortages there, he said they 'made no impression' on him: when he was a boy in the Saarland, the shops were full, but he had no money. He returned to join the Communist underground in Nazi Germany, was transferred to Berlin, and there was arrested and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for 'preparing high treason'. He was held for 18 months in the very Moabit prison where he is currently in detention. After the war, he rapidly proved himself a staunch loyalist to Mr Walter Ulbricht, the first East German Communist leader, first by setting up his Communist youth organisation, and then, as the politburo member responsible for the military and state security, by building the Berlin Wall. He also met his second wife, Margot, in the youth movement, where she was a pure version of the East German pin-up girl - always smiling at the forefront of the international solidarity photographs. Even though the early Honecker years after he succeeded Ulbricht in 1971 were probably East Germany's most prosperous, the population never really forgave him for the Wall. They also never accepted his wife. She was known as 'the witch', and generally regarded as the steel in the soul of the grey party bureaucrat she married. 'There are probably more people who would like to see her behind bars than him,' according to one observer. The fact that she has now fled to Chile, leaving her husband alone to face the German courts, simply confirms her reputation. As for Mr Honecker's trial, it is likely to prove embarrassing for all concerned, which is why the German government has always seemed half-hearted about wanting him back. It will be hard to make the manslaughter charges stick, at least under the East German law of the time, for Mr Honecker undoubtedly had huge powers of administrative fiat. He is also charged with abuse of trust, in relation to some DM15m in missing East German Treasury funds. But his real corruption was abuse of power. The political embarrassment for Bonn is that everyone will be forcibly reminded how Mr Honecker was once quite blatantly courted by the politicians of the west. His state visit to Bonn in 1987, to be entertained with full honours by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, was seen as a triumph for his twin-track policy: to deprive his own people of all contact with the west, while courting the West German political and financial elite. Politicians of all persuasions, including Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of the Social Democrats, and Mr Franz-Josef Strauss, the arch-conservative Bavarian leader, flocked to see him in Berlin. Quite cynically, he earned billions of deutschmarks each year from western payments for services to isolated Berlin, the release of prisoners to the west, and for reuniting families. Ironically the latest revelations suggest that his own more dogmatic colleagues, like Mr Erich Mielke, the now former minister of state security, tried to get rid of him in the 1980s for excessive fraternising with the capitalist west. All of that is likely to come out in court, to nobody's credit at all. Perhaps that will be the revenge of the grey man.</p>

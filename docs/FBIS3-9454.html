			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Open letter" from Jozef Prokes, deputy to the National </F> Council of the Slovak Republic for the Slovak National Party and  deputy prime minister in Vladimir Meciar's outgoing government,  to President Michal Kovac; place and date not given: "Weapon  Against Democracy"]    [Text] Your Excellency, allow me, first of all, to  congratulate you on the attainment of the presidential system  and on the manner in which Your Excellency brought it about.    I found the permanent accusations of Meciar wanting to  install a presidential system suspicious from the very start, as  he was not the president. Logic clearly tells one that he would  be against himself. But who is asking for logic! Anyone  assaults logic nowadays. Am I not right, Your Excellency?    Or do you think that the ruling by the Constitutional Court  of the Slovak Republic concerning interpretation of Article 111  of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic--I quote: "The  president of the Slovak Republic appoints and recalls other  members of the government at the proposal of the prime  minister...."--that the president need not accept the prime  minister's proposal, and interpretation of Article 87, section  2--I quote: "Laws passed by the National Council of the Slovak  Republic [NRSR] are signed by the NRSR chairman, the president  of the Slovak Republic, and the prime minister of the Slovak  Republic"--that the prime minister is obliged to sign a law  after its second approval in the NRSR, is in conformity with  logic? The diction in both instances is the same. Or is this  contradictory interpretation by the Constitutional Court due  only to ignorance of the Slovak language?    Let us return, however, Your Excellency, to the  Constitutional Court's ruling on Article 111 of the Constitution  of the Slovak Republic that Your Excellency need not accept the  prime minister's proposals for the appointment of other  government members. This is fabulous! Now and in the future,  Your Excellency can completely ignore election results. Your  Excellency will simply refuse to appoint a minister as long as  the new prime minister will not propose to you the "right" one,  selected by Your Excellency.    Incidentally, why should you not also choose a prime  minister  who is to your liking? Nowhere in the Constitution of the  Slovak Republic is it written that anyone has the right to  propose to Your Excellency a prime minister, let alone that Your  Excellency would have to accept such a proposal. It is only a  good custom in democracies that candidates for government  members are nominated by the political entity that had won the  elections and that the president accepts these candidates. But  why should you let yourself be guided by this? After all, it is  only a custom from something called democracy. Who cares about  citizens' will? One need not worry one's head about that.    As a matter of fact, even though, according to Article 102,  letter (f) of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, you  appoint and recall the prime minister and other members of the  government, it is not written there that you must appoint a  prime minister. Why not try it out? Following the ruling by  the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic on Article 111  of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, I would not be  surprised at all if the Constitutional Court of the Slovak  Republic arrived at the conclusion that you need not appoint a  prime minister.    Let us return, however, to the gratifying possibility of  ignoring election results, which the Constitutional Court of the  Slovak Republic placed in your hands. Should the election  winner disagree with the government selected by Your Excellency  and NRSR deputies refuse to approve its policy statement, you  will simply send them home, under Article 102, letter (d) of the  Constitution of the Slovak Republic, and will dissolve  parliament. Even though the Constitution states that the NRSR  chairman will call new elections within 30 days, it is not  written there that he must do so. The devil knows how the  Constitutional Court would decide. Does he have to? Does he not  have to? Must he not?    Does Your Excellency realize those amazing possibilities? A  single ruling by the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic  managed to turn the entire system of power upside down. A  parliamentary system has been transformed into a presidential  one! Article 102, letter (d), whose original aim was to compel  the election winner to responsibly approach the government  formation, has been turned into a dangerous weapon against  democracy in the hands of Your Excellency.    Your Excellency has really pulled it off. Let me  congratulate you once again. I always knew that one should not  forget popular wisdom. The one, for example, about the thief  shouting catch the thief.    [Signed] Jozef Prokes, NRSR deputy    P.S. Does Your Excellency think that the ruling by the  Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic on Article 111 of  the Constitution of the Slovak Republic is a consequence of the  insufficient ability to think logically and to work out in one's  mind the consequences of one's decisions or that it is the  result of ignorance of the Slovak language? Or is something  completely, but completely, different involved?    P.P.S. I dared express my opinion. Is that still allowed?</p>

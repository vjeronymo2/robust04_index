			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edgar Barberena S.] </F>   [Text] Approximately 90 percent of the Sandinist National  Liberation Front [FSLN] members active in Managua prior to the  1990 elections no longer participate in the party's activities.  This fact, which means only 10 percent of the members are  active, shows the party is in crisis at all levels.    These results are part of a survey conducted by the  Institute  of Nicaraguan Studies [IEN]. The survey results are based on  statistical information from the FSLN's Departmental Directorate  Committees. Of 17 cities polled, Leon leads with 6,050 active  members.    Although Leon has the most active members, this city also  shares Sandinists' disappointment over their party. Although  the membership reportedly had been 10,091, only 59 percent of  members participated in the pre-Congress discussions.    There is a similar case in Chinandega, where only 3,250  active members, roughly 25 percent, remain from the party's  former 13,000 members. We wonder what happened to the other 75  percent of the original membership. Have they defected to other  parties? Are they disappointed over the current Sandinist  leaders? Have they joined the ranks of Nicaraguans who no longer  want to hear anything about political parties?  <H5>  Congressmen Must Consider </H5>   These questions should be thoroughly considered by the  nearly  600 FSLN delegates who on 20, 21, and 22 May will decide the  Sandinist Party's future. If we keep making calculations in  other cities -- like Masaya, where only 42.85 percent of the  members are active -- we will find that nowhere in Nicaragua is  100 percent of the membership active.    The Sandinists polled by INE say these results are due to  the  FSLN rank and file's low morale because of lack of attention and  the party's internal problems. Those polled pointed out,  however, that many Sandinists joined the party purely for  personal reasons.    Although some members of the Sandinist directorate have  denied it, the people polled say this low morale has been proven  by the the rank and file's low participation in the pre-congress  assemblies, also called ad hoc meetings.    The polled Sandinists said the Sandinists will not win the  1996 elections if "the FSLN does not succeed in overcoming its  internal crisis, if democratization is not achieved in the  party, if the image of marred ethics, morals, and dominance is  not recovered, and if the party identity and programs are not  adapted to current circumstances."  <H5>  Trends in Sandinism </H5>   The emergence of various trends (orthodox, verticalist  [verticalista] or Pekin School, or the one that advocates a  Sandinists' return to the majorities) of necessity was the  subject of one of the questions addressed in the poll.  Fifty-four percent think the emergence of these trends is an  obstacle for the party. The majority, however, think the  diversity of opinions within Sandinism is positive.    Thirty-five percent of those polled believe that trends are  a  reality within the FSLN and that these trends help the party.  Nevertheless, they warned: "The media unsettle the people with  the reports of those confrontations, by siding with one or the  other. This creates mistrust, insecurity, and apprehension in  the rank and file."    One of the questions those polled were asked was: Why do you  think of the struggle of socialists versus and social democrats,  as well as that of conservatives versus renovators; the struggle  for power, the competition for leadership, and the normal  process of diversity in the FSLN?    The results were the following: 44 percent think it is a  mere  fight for power; 22 percent think it is a normal process of  diversity in the FSLN; 20 percent think it is a healthy  competition for leadership; 1 percent think it is a struggle  between liberals and conservatives; 1 percent said it is a  struggle between socialists and social democrats; another 1  percent does not identify with either Daniel Ortega's left or  Sergio Ramirez' renovating trend.  <H5>  Other Aspects </H5>   The survey also includes information on the FSLN's program  and strategic objectives, which point to the need for reaching  the rank and file with a permanent work, and streamlining some  concepts. There is no room for verticalist concepts. It is  necessary to stimulate the rank and file's active participation  in the decisionmaking as well as the formulation and  implementation of party strategy.    Although the statistics for Sandinism's renovating trend are  scant, those polled favored replacing the Sandinist leaders from  the rank and file up to the chief FSLN leaders.   <H5>    National Agreement </H5>   The mentality of the "overwhelming majority" apparently has  been blotted out of the minds of the Sandinist rank and file  polled. Approximately 53 percent referred to the need for a  national agreement in Nicaragua but they ruled out the  probability of President Violeta Chamorro's government backing  this idea because, they said, the government must obey the  international financial organizations.  <H5>  The Elections' Subject </H5>   Asked about the 1995 presidential elections, 76 percent say  the FSLN will be the winner and that, for this reason, a policy  providing an economic alternative for the people should be  developed. Nevertheless, they said the methods must be peaceful  so the workers will not be harmed.    Fourteen percent voiced doubts the FSLN will win the  elections without an internal revision. They think this depends  on decisions made during the Special Congress, which called for  the party to do away with its militarist, socialist, and radical  image, and for the Constitution to be amended.    Ten percent think the FSLN will not win the 1996 elections  if  the party does not form alliances. This will require work by  active members. This work must be initiated after the Special  Congress. In addition, it is necessary to work within the  framework of an electoral strategy "without burning out  candidates ahead of time." Those polled added that "it is not a  matter of buying votes but of gaining the people's confidence in  the daily struggle."  <H5>  And the Alliances, With Whom? </H5>   The intensive political indoctrination the Sandinists were  subjected to during the past decade became evident in a study  because one sector said no other party exists with a political  viewpoint similar to the Sandinist Party's. Those polled  recalled the poor precedents set by other alliances throughout  history.    Others suggested the possibility of the Sandinist Party  establishing electoral alliances with the Christian Democratic  Union [UDC], the Party of the Nicaraguan Resistance [PRN], and  moderate parties, such as PUCA [Central American Unionist Party]  and other centralist organizations.    The opinion poll included questions regarding the amendments  the Constitution will undergo at the National Assembly.  Fifty-eight percent think no one should be banned from running  for president in 1996; 38 percent favor leaving open the option  for re-election, and 4 percent think this reelection should be  staggered, as outlined in the reform proposal drafted by seven  Assembly factions.</p>

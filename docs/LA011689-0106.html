			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> THREE GUERRILLAS GIVEN LONG SENTENCES FOR '86 SOUTH AFRICAN TREASON, TERRORISM  </P> <P> Three African National Congress guerrillas, among them one of the most senior  ANC leaders tried in 25 years, were sentenced to lengthy prison terms today for  treason and terrorism.  </P> <P> A 20-year sentence for treason was issued to the most prominent defendant,  Ebrahim Ismail Ebrahim, 51, who was abducted from Swaziland in 1986 by men he  said were South African agents. He has been widely described as the  highest-ranking ANC official to go on trial since Nelson Mandela and several  colleagues were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964.  </P> <P> Another defendant, Mandla Maseko, received a 23-year sentence for treason. The  other, Simon Dladla, received 12 years for terrorism. They were found guilty of  laying land mines that injured eight people in Transvaal Province in 1986.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gave Salutes  </P> <P> Ebrahim, who is of Indian descent, and his co-defendants, who are black, turned  toward supporters in the gallery at the Pretoria Supreme Court and gave  clenched-fist salutes before they were led away. All three could have been  sentenced to death.  </P> <P> Local newspapers reported that after supporters sang an anti-apartheid anthem,  a government prosecutor was heard saying, "Long live the AWB" -- the Afrikaans  initials of the white-supremacist Afrikaner Resistance Movement.  </P> <P> The men were convicted in November after a 16-month trial. At one stage last  year, three members of the ANC's executive committee -- who faced arrest in  South Africa -- gave evidence for the defense at a court session held in  London.  </P> <P> Ebrahim, along with his co-defendants, did not testify during the trial, but he  submitted a 17-page written statement to the court in which he alleged that all  three men were tortured by police.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called 'Reprehensible'  </P> <P> "Finding us guilty is merely a statement that the state considers the struggle  for democracy, equality, justice, peace and a non-racial society to be morally  and politically reprehensible," he said.  </P> <P> "We wish to say to our people, we tried to carry out your behests," Ebrahim  wrote. "We did our best to live up to what you expected of us as members of the  African National Congress."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert, 19 May (SNARK)--"I am sure that the  final document on realization of Moscow protocol dated 18  February 1994 -- which was signed last Tuesday by the heads of  defense departments of Russia, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh --  is capable to end bloodshed and open way to a long-term peace in  Karabakh region," told in his interview to SNARK today the head  of International Organizations Department in Karabakh Foreign  Office, Massis Mailyan.    "Regretfully, he observed, Azerbaijan has not yet joined  this  agreement. However we hope that the official Baku will finally  accept the realities and sign the Moscow document, which  provides a mechanism of cease-fire control."</p>

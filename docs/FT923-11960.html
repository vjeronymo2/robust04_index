			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Letter: Shrinking savings 'cake' behind weak consumer spending Sir, The claim that building societies are losing deposits to National Savings is only part of the truth ('Building society lifts home loan rate', July 18). Taking the sum of inflows into building societies and National Savings together, the total in the first half of this year was Pounds 3.2bn, compared to Pounds 5.5bn in the same period last year. Therefore, the problem is not that National Savings are taking a bigger share of the savings 'cake', but that the cake has shrunk. This is not due to people choosing instead to repay debt. Building society figures show that mortgage repayments in the first five months of this year were actually lower than last year. Instead, the problem is that total individual savings (be they acquisitions of financial assets or repayments of debt) are extremely low. This does not show in personal savings data because these include the dividend income of life assurance and pension funds and employers contributions to such funds; such incomes are, in effect, 'forced savings'. This low level of individuals' savings implies that the weakness of consumer spending is not due mainly to people being 'scared to spend', but simply to the fact that real incomes (excluding pension funds' dividend incomes) have been falling as employment has fallen. It follows that lower interest rates are not the only means of stimulating spending. Any policy which boosts real income - such as increased public spending - will also do so.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Phnom Penh, March 3 KYODO -- Cambodia's First  Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh said Thursday he has  given up trying to achieve an accommodation with the Khmer Rouge  faction through dialogue. Ranariddh, speaking to Japanese  reporters ahead of a visit to Tokyo next week to attend an  international meeting on aid to Cambodia, said he undertook two  secret missions to Bangkok "to try to have a dialogue. But now  finish," the Royalist Party leader said.    Saying economic reconstruction is now Cambodia's top  priority, Ranariddh downplayed the threat posed by the Khmer  Rouge group. He said the government's offer to allow the Khmer  Rouge to take part in the government will be withdrawn if the  faction continues its resistance. "If they continue to be  unreasonable, my people will continue the way they continue  today," he said.    Ranariddh spoke as Cambodian Army commanders reportedly  announced plans to recapture the northern Khmer Rouge base of  Anlong Veng within 10 days. Khmer Rouge guerrillas took it back  at the end of last month. [passage omitted]    Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen will be  attending  the second meeting of the International Committee on  Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC) set for March 10 to 11 in  Tokyo. He said Cambodia needs additional aid to help clear  unexploded mines, estimated to number as many as 10 million  throughout the country.</p>

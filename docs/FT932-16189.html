			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Walker rapped for 'lack of candour' MR George Walker, the former Brent Walker chief executive, had shown a 'lack of candour' in dealings with creditors seeking repayment of Pounds 180m, his High Court bankruptcy hearing was told yesterday. Lawyers for creditors seeking his bankruptcy said Mr Walker had failed to produce basic accounts of his personal income and expenditure since last September when, to avoid being declared bankrupt, he reached a voluntary agreement with them to repay debt. Mr Walker had said he was unable to perform these calculations and could not afford an accountant to work out the figures for him, said Mr Roger Kaye QC, for Stoy Hayward, the accountants supervising the agreement. This was a man was now involved in substantial business enterprises in Greece and Russia, he said. The supervisors, backed by creditor banks led by the TSB and the Inland Revenue, are claiming Mr Walker has breached his obligations under the voluntary agreement. They are seeking a High Court order to have it revoked and Mr Walker declared bankrupt. Mr Kaye said that since September, Mr Walker had not repaid a penny of his debts, despite agreeing to pay the supervisors 50 per cent of his income. However, his bank account showed big sums had apparently been spent. Mr Robin Hollington, for Mr Walker, said it was too early to establish what his client's earnings for this year would be. It was premature to say creditors were being let down. The hearing continues today.</p>

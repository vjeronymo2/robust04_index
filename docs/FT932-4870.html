			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / UK Gilts: Market unmoved during Clarke's first week MR KENNETH Clarke's first week as chancellor of the exchequer contained little to move the UK government bond market. But expectations for an eventual - if not early - cut in interest rates continued to underpin prices at the short end of the yield curve. A strong view in the market is that there will be no easing of monetary policy until Mr Clarke has mastered his brief and won the respect of the foreign exchange markets. He is also likely to wait for more bad news on the economy before acting. While it is apparent that the pace of economic recovery has slackened since the beginning of the year, evidence that the recovery is faltering is not yet overwhelming. Possibly because of this sentiment, last week's release of poor narrow money supply figures for May caused only a frisson in the market. Narrow money - mainly notes and coins in circulation - rose by a seasonally adjusted 3.3 per cent in the year to May, compared with growth of 4.8 per cent in the year to April. Such a sharp drop in the year-on-year rate, even allowing for special factors, pointed to a slowdown in consumer spending and prompted speculation of another rate cut. But while the foreign exchanges took fright and the pound fell to below DM2.47, yields at the short end of the curve fell only 4 basis points. Although the narrow money figure was bad, it was not enough to convince some analysts. Many said it was too early to judge the full extent of the slowdown in the rate of growth of M0. The figure was probably distorted downwards by the timing of the Whitsun bank holiday. In addition, the latest figure for notes in circulation - which forms 95 per cent of M0 - painted a more buoyant picture of monetary growth in the first week of June. The figures, published on Thursday, showed that the increase in notes in circulation in the year to last Wednesday had rebounded to 6.8 per cent. This figure was not seasonally adjusted, and was inflated by the bank holiday two days earlier. However, Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, argues that allowance for the distortion can be made by looking at the year-on-year growth in the latest four week moving average. 'This calculation shows the growth rate moving up to 4.5 per cent from 3.3 per cent the previous week, suggesting that the May M0 figure will prove to be an anomaly,' he says. The long end of the yield curve continued to prevaricate over inflation last week. There has been little movement recently, with the market stuck between two opposing camps on the future path of UK inflation. A number of analysts are optimistic about inflation, and believe it is unlikely to take off again, mainly because labour market reform and competition from the rest of the world will hold down wage infla-tion. Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets - which has an optimistic view on inflation - believes it will take a few more good earnings figures to convince the market that inflation is no longer a problem. 'When that happens there will be a bull-run on long-dated gilts,' he says. 'There will come a point where, with both the RPI and the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments well under control, long yields of 8.6 per cent will look crazy and will have to come down.' Opposing this view are those who think a sharp pick-up in inflation is likely in the autumn. Mr Chris Dillow at Nomura Research believes the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments will have breached the government's 4 per cent target ceiling by the end of the year. Inflation will be driven upwards as price falls of last year start to drop out of the annual comparison, he says. This will be most evident in three areas; seasonal food, clothing and footwear, and cars, says Mr Dillow. 'From a starting point of 3 per cent this means that inflation will reach the top of its target range even before we consider actual price increases,' he adds. Both camps have their advocates, but with few economic statistics due over the next few days, this week is unlikely to provide extra clues to tip the balance either one way or the other.</p>

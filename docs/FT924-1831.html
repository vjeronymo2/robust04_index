			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Debate of schools measure criticised THE GOVERNMENT is so desperate to reserve Commons debating time for the Maastricht bill that it is prepared to sacrifice scrutiny of other measures such as the one it has described as the most important education bill since 1944, Labour claimed yesterday. Ms Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, was opposing the imposition of a guillotine on the Education Bill, which would establish a new funding agency to authorise the capital and recurrent expenditure of self-governing grant-maintained schools in England and Wales, among other reforms. Debate was being truncated because the government could not 'manage its business properly', Ms Taylor said. Branding the proposed timetable 'a most unsatisfactory state of affairs,' she did not understand how the government could make great claims about the importance of a bill and then complain when it was scrutinised in committee. It was 'interesting' that the guillotine had been introduced as the clauses on grant-maintained status had been reached in standing committee, she added. Claiming that an increasing proportion of ballots being held in schools were 'going against' the government, she said Labour was 'very keen to highlight this failure of government policy'. She brushed off an attempted intervention by Mr John Patten, education secretary, with the admonition that he should have contributed to the debate in committee. But she allowed Mr Eric Forth, a junior education minister, to observe that about 80 per cent of ballots were resulting in votes for grant-maintained status. For the government, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said if progress on the bill continued at a constant pace, the 255-clause measure would not reach the statute book until the year 2001. The government was proceeding in an 'entirely sensible and responsible way', he said. 'I have no doubt that . . . any government . . . would be inviting the House to consider the position in a similar way.' The proposed timetable provided for a further month for the committee stage, and two full days for the report stage and the third reading. The government's timetabling motion was carried by 298-258, a majority of 40.</p>

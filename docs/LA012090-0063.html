			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DROWN STARTS CAMPAIGN BY BACKING AWAY FROM DUFFY  </P> <P> Jack Drown, an assistant sheriff in the San Diego County Sheriff's Department  and the chosen candidate of Sheriff John Duffy, opened his campaign for sheriff  Friday by distancing himself from what he called Duffy's "unique" style of  leadership, especially Duffy's constant sparring with the County Board of  Supervisors.  </P> <P> "When John Duffy leaves office at the end of this year, his own unique and  individual style of leadership will also leave," Drown said at a news  conference at the County Courthouse.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's any big secret," he said. "The relationship between the  Board of Supervisors, the CAO's (Chief Administrative Officer's) office and  John Duffy has been strained. I would prefer that we not work under strained  relationships. My style is not necessarily one of confrontation but rather one  of being communicative and cooperative."  </P> <P> Drown, whose intention to run for sheriff was announced by Duffy last month,  joins three other candidates -- Escondido Police Chief Vince Jimno, former San  Diego Police Chief Ray Hoobler and Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache.  </P> <P> "Every one of them is a formidable opponent," said Drown, a 20-year veteran of  the San Diego Sheriff's Department. But, he added, "I know this organization. I  know the people. I think that's a significant advantage."  </P> <P> Drown introduced a brief, four-part platform "for the 1990s" that focused on  reducing drug-related crimes, easing crowding in the county's jails, addressing  the needs of crime victims and improving communication with the public.  </P> <P> Asked to respond to the idea, espoused by two county supervisors, of creating a  separate Department of Corrections to run the jails, Drown indicated that he  wants that responsibility to remain with the Sheriff's Department. But he said  he supports using correctional deputies instead of deputy sheriffs to staff the  jails.  </P> <P> "I don't believe we should be splitting our energies . . . (with) the sheriff  entrenched in one camp and the Board of Supervisors in the other camp and the  jail in the middle," he said. All but "a very small handful" of California's 58  counties let their sheriffs run the jails, he said. "It's not so much a matter  of who's operating the jail, but are the jails receiving the proper amount of  attention they need to operate in a professional manner?"  </P> <P> Asked whether he feels Duffy's endorsement will help or hurt him, Drown said:  "I've certainly talked to an awful lot of people who have said, 'I like John  Duffy. I think John Duffy was a good sheriff.' For those people, I think his  endorsement will certainly help me. I've talked to some people who have not  said those types of things about him. But I would hope that everybody would  judge me on who I am and what I'm saying, rather than who John Duffy is."  </P></p>

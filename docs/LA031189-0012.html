			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATCHING A CURE  </P> <P> Every few years, some backyard inventor triumphantly reveals that he has built  a perpetual motion machine, and every few years someone claims to have found a  cure for the common cold. Serious people long ago learned to respond to such  announcements with a certain degree of caution, most appropriately expressed in  the form of utter disbelief. The perpetual motion machine, a hypothetical  device that would run on forever and defy the known laws of physics by creating  more energy than it dissipates, still awaits its discoverer. Now, though,  medical science seems to have been brought a significant step closer to finding  a way to prevent, if not cure, a lot of common colds.  </P> <P> Two groups of researchers, working independently, have identified a molecule in  nasal cells through which some cold-causing viruses enter the body. That  breakthrough expands understanding of how viruses are able to evade or overcome  the body's formidable defense mechanisms so that they can set about producing  misery. The molecules on the surface of nasal cells, called receptors, are now  seen as providing a specific entryway. Researchers think that by cloning these  receptors and administering them through nasal spray or nose drops to people at  the risk of catching cold, it may be possible to confuse or tie up invading  viruses and so prevent infection.  </P> <P> Scientists caution that a practical anti-cold medicine is at best years away  even from being tested in humans, and major questions remain about the costs  and general effectiveness of such an approach. Still, there is understandable  excitement among researchers. The common cold represents an enormous health and  economic drain. Nearly 100 million disabling colds occur each year, producing  more than 295 million days of restricted activity, more than 35 million days  absent from work and about 45 million days of lost schooling. The cost in lost  wages and productivity runs into the billions. About $2 billion more is spent  each year on cough and cold medicines. Cold researchers aren't promising fast,  fast, fast relief, but they are holding out the hope that misery can eventually  be reduced. A world waiting for the chance to be grateful wishes them well.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTAINMENT: 'LES MANLEY': ELVIS IT'S NOT  </P> <P> Poor guy. He's such a loser. His job is boring. His boss is nasty. His love  life is non-existent.  </P> <P> But opportunity knocks. Fame and fortune are just a contest away. Prove the  King is still alive, and collect the $1-million prize. Can the lovely Stella be  far behind?  </P> <P> Welcome to "Les Manley in Search for the King." Tacky but timely.  </P> <P> Les works for a television station WILL in the ghetto of New York. In an effort  to boost sagging revenues, Les' sleazoid boss decides to cash in on a national  pastime. Is the King alive or dead? Of course there is no question -- the  superstar can't possibly be found, and nobody could ever claim the money.  </P> <P> But no one let's our hound dog Les in on the scheme, so he collects a few  necessities and heads off on his quest. He goes to Las Vegas and a place that  bears a striking resemblance to Graceland.  </P> <P> (Those with suspicious minds should note that the striking but unlicensed  similarities between the King and Elvis are obligingly disclaimed in the  manual: " 'Les Manley in Search for the King' is a work of fiction. Any  similarities of characters in the game to persons living or dead is either  coincidental, or unintended." Return to sender.)  </P> <P> The setup for this game is very easy. And, for newcomers to adventure-style  computer games, the manual provides an especially clear explanation of how to  play. It also sets up a good walk-through to get you started. Included are  several nice features in the command word processor providing some handy  communication shortcuts. But even experienced players are likely to run into  problems moving Les across the screen.  </P> <P> Anyway, so Les is now on the road. What's he doing out there? Since it is  buried in a trivial piece of advertising included in the game package, it's  probably OK to mention an essential secret: Les must "do a stint as a King  impersonator."  </P> <P> The difficulty in digging out that vital bit of information shows how the  designers of the game have confused obscurity with intricacy. A good adventure  game, like a good mystery, should lead its player/reader on a merry chase. Key  word: lead. Even if clues lead to the wrong conclusions or destinations, throw  up smoke screens or implicate the wrong person, they should at least be there.  The "King" tends to leave out lots of clues, leaving you irritated and  frustrated rather than intrigued.  </P> <P> The "King's" publisher (Accolade), however, doesn't just leave you all shook  up. The company provides at least three different sources for hints to help you  help Les accomplish his goal. A clue book is available from software dealers,  and Accolade has both a 900 number (users are charged by the minute) and an  electronic bulletin board for players with a modem. We'd love to hear from  someone who got Les and his diminutive good luck charm Helmut to Las Vegas  without using one of the hint sources.  </P> <P> "Les Manley in Search for the King" is published by Accolade of San Jose.

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENTAGON BACKS OFF ON PREDICTION FOR GENERAL DYNAMICS  </P> <P> A Pentagon audit that found General Dynamics has a "possible chance for  bankruptcy" was revised by Pentagon auditors in recent weeks, some three months  after they originally made the prediction, it was learned Wednesday.  </P> <P> It remains unclear what motivated auditors to change their findings, although  congressional sources allege that there was pressure brought to bear on the  Pentagon accountants.  </P> <P> On Dec. 7, the auditors issued an unusual revision to their original report,  solely to "delete" the analytical measure that made the bankruptcy prediction  in the original report, which was issued Sept. 7.  </P> <P> The Times reported the findings of the original audit Tuesday; the revision was  not made available until Wednesday. The deletion was made for technical  accounting reasons, according to the supplemental audit report.  </P> <P> A companion audit of McDonnell Douglas, which used the same techniques and  contained similar predictions about bankruptcy, was apparently not revised by  the agency. "I am not aware of any revision," a McDonnell spokeswoman said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The audits, performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, involved an  examination of the troubled Navy A-12 attack jet program. The audit of General  Dynamics found that the St. Louis-based firm, the nation's second-biggest  defense contractor, had fallen into a "weak" financial condition and that its  "ability to perform this contract may be in jeopardy."  </P> <P> Those conclusions were not deleted from the revised report.  </P> <P> Congressional sources questioned whether auditors caved in to political  pressure resulting from the original audit in deleting the bankruptcy  prediction. Auditors involved in issuing the reports declined to comment  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The original audit had begun circulating in the Pentagon by late November. At  that time, a number of congressional investigators were attempting to obtain  it, because word had spread that the audit contained a prediction of  bankruptcy, according to staff members on the House Energy and Commerce  Committee. The committee has been active in probing the A-12 controversy.  </P> <P> The supplemental audit report said the deletion of the bankruptcy prediction  was made because the analytical measure, called a z-score, "can only be  computed using annual data." The original audit used data for the first six  months of 1990 in rating General Dynamics a "possible chance for bankruptcy."  </P> <P> A Pentagon auditor who declined to be identified said Wednesday that he has  often used other than annual data in computing z-scores. But an audit manual  used by the agency recommends that annual data be used.  </P></p>

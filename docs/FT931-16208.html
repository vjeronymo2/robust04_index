			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / AT&amp;T Istel to freeze pay and cut workforce SALARIES have been frozen for this year and some 375 jobs are likely to go over the next six months at AT&amp;T Istel. The company, a subsidiary of American Telephone and Telegraph of the US, used to be the computing arm of British Leyland and is now one of the largest UK-based computing services companies. The measures indicate the impact of the recession on such companies, which depend heavily on large-scale project work from big corporate clients. Mr Peter Teague, the new chief executive of AT&amp;T Istel, said it was being forced to rein back ambitious growth plans. 'We decided we had no alternative but to take this painful action,' he said. AT&amp;T Istel said the measures continued policies initiated by Mr Chris Chiles, the previous chief executive. The company, based in Redditch, Hereford and Worcester, employs 2,200 people in the UK and a further 1,800 in continental Europe. It last made staff redundant two years ago when 150 jobs were lost. A voluntary redundancy scheme is now planned. Last year Istel turned over Pounds 200m but is not thought to have made a profit. It specialises in systems integration and communication services including electronic data interchange for a variety of industries including manufacturing, finance and travel. Computing services companies are a sensitive indicator of the health of industry because new business initiatives have to be underpinned by computer systems. Dr Douglas Eyeions, director-general of the Computing Services Association, a trade organisation, said there was little new work in the computer industry. Many were pinning their hopes on work from the health service and the government's market-testing programme, which could result in some Pounds 750m of computing contracts being offered to the private sector over the next few years.

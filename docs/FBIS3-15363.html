The statement said that "considering the fact of the arrival  in Baku of the personal envoy of the Russian president,  (Vladimir) Kazimirov, and Deputy Defence Minister (Georgiy)  Kondratyev, as well as taking into account the ceasefire  agreement in effect since March 1, the leadership of the  Azerbaijani Armed Forces has issued an order to all units on the  front line to cease fire and ignore provocations."    However, in the first few hours of ceasefire Azerbaijani  positions came under intensive artillery shelling which also  continued on March 2. "Today large forces of the Armenian Army  launched a large-scale offensive supported by armoured vehicles  in the southwest of the republic. This jeopardises Russia's  mediating efforts," the statement said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today, on the eve of the opening of the Russian  parliament, we have more than once turned to the vital issue of  tactics to be pursued by various factions in their work. You  will now learn what tactics the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia [LDPR] faction is going to pursue in the State Duma.  Their tactics are described for Mayak by Stanislav Zhebrovskiy,  a member of the LDPR Supreme Council, the party's deputy  chairman and a deputy in the State Duma. The recording was made  on the telephone.    [Begin Zhebrovskiy recording] The Liberal Democratic Party  will operate as a separate faction in the State Duma. This is  because entering into blocs with someone always means colluding  against someone else. The Liberal Democratic Party is going to  the Duma not to wage war against someone, but to work in the  interests of the state. That is, we stand for doing something  in the interests of the state every day, and for agreeing to  compromises.    We shall always be a constructive political force. We are in  opposition to the present government, but, I repeat, it is  constructive opposition. Our stand is: Whoever proposes a  sensible law directed at safeguarding Russia's interests, we  shall always back this law. This is what we mean when we say we  are constructive. [end recording]</p>

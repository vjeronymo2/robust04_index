			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Treuhand warns Elf over oil refinery The Treuhand privatisation agency reserves its legal right to impose penalties for breach of contract if Elf Aquitaine, the oil group and France's largest industrial company, fails to find a partner for the east German Leuna refinery complex, Treuhand officials confirmed yesterday. Elf wants to reduce to 35 per cent its current 65 per cent stake in Leuna, a refinery being rebuilt in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The remaining stake is held by Thyssen Handelsunion. Together, they agreed with the Treuhand to invest DM4.8bn (Pounds 1.85bn) and secure 1,000 jobs in the refinery's construction. When completed, Leuna will have an annual capacity of 10m tonnes. Elf's decision to reduce its stake in Leuna is a part of the group's strategy of cutting costs and improving profits, which last year fell from FFr6.2bn (Pounds 700m) to FFr1.1bn. Mr Philippe Jaffre, who took over as chairman of Elf in August last year, said last week that discussions were being conducted with potential partners in the project, but that no agreements had been reached. He also held talks with Thyssen, in Paris in early January, about the prospects for the project. 'Mr Jaffre is attaching great importance to a reduction of the investment in Leuna,' said one oil industry analyst in Paris. 'It is necessary to cut costs, but also to show he is serious about improved returns during the process of privatisation.' Elf has assured the Treuhand it will try to find partners to make up any shortfall following Elf's decision to reduce its stake, but so far it has found no candidates. Thyssen Handelsunion is not interested in increasing its own shareholding. Elf had originally agreed to rebuild the Leuna refinery as part of an agreement to acquire the east German Minol state service station network.</p>

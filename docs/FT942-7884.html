			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Zhu eases credit restrictions on state enterprises Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice premier in charge of the economy, has signalled an easing of tight credit restrictions on lending to ailing state enterprises and has also appealed for greater efforts to increase grain and cotton production. Mr Zhu's remarks, published on the front pages yesterday of main Chinese newspapers, indicate growing official anxiety over labour unrest in cash-starved state factories and also worries about a serious shortfall in cotton production accompanied by signs of growing agitation among peasants. Addressing two separate economic forums in the past two weeks attended by provincial leaders from China's central and southern provinces, Mr Zhu called on economic departments and banks to 'help' failing enterprises. He was quoted as saying that government bodies including financial institutions should 'make surveys and help enterprises to resume production and get out of these predicaments'. The State Statistical Bureau reported that in the first quarter nearly half the state enterprises were lossmaking. Some estimates put 'triangular debt'  -enterprises owing money to each other for raw materials and finished products - at Yn300bn (Pounds 23bn). Mr Zhu, who is also governor of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, has been under considerable pressure from the powerful state enterprise lobby to ease credit to save state-run factories from bankruptcy and avoid the spectre of thousands of workers losing their jobs. His appeal to officials to 'fully arouse' farmers' enthusiasm for cotton production reflects deepening government concern over sharp rises in the cotton price. Textile factories throughout China - the industry is one of the country's biggest employers - are facing difficulties securing supplies and some have been obliged to stop production. Mr Zhu, who has made curtailing inflation a main priority, has been insisting on continued tight credit policies, but banking statistics for April showing an increase in the funds of state enterprises indicates an easing of restrictions is already taking place. Western economists in Beijing say it is likely the government will continue to be selective in providing credit. They contrast the latest cautious easing with the panicky steps taken last September and October to provide additional funding to loss-making enterprises. A slight lessening of inflationary pressures - the April and March figures were down on the rate of growth registered in the first two months of the year - suggests the government may have some scope for a limited relaxation of credit. Mr Zhu's call for an improvement in handling what he called 'relations between reform, development and stability' coincides with official alarm about growing unrest among peasants whose returns from their tiny plots are being squeezed by higher production costs. Farmers are also angry about a widening gap between country and city, inland and coastal regions. Inflation has also been rising faster in rural areas than in the city, according to the latest State Statistical Bureau review, adding to peasant unhappiness. Mr Ren Jianxin, a senior party official, was quoted at the weekend in the People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, as saying at a meeting on rural instability that the 'security management situation remains extremely grim nationwide this year'. Mr Ren called on the security apparatus to 'strengthen the force of their blows and mercilessly attack serious criminal activities and serious economic crimes'. He was referring to widespread rural lawlessness, including banditry, clan feuds, and violent protests against local officials. People's Daily also reflected official concerns about stability in a commentary published yesterday which called for sensitive handling of the present difficult reform phase, especially rationalisation of state enterprises and threats to employment. 'When an old balance is broken,' the paper said, 'conflict is unavoidable, such as the conflict between the centre and the localities, between local governments and enterprises and between enterprises and their employees.' China's leaders have, since an important meeting of the Communist party central committee last November approved a new package of reforms, been putting heavy emphasis on stability. This has coincided with a crackdown on any sign of political opposition.</p>

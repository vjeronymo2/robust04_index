			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (25): Integration remains the goal - Foreign Policy Twice in 200 years, Poland has disappeared from the map of modern Europe. The first time followed its partition between Russia, Prussia and Austria at the end of the 18th century. The second calamity occurred in 1939 when Poland was carved up between Nazi Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union. Such a history inevitably leaves traumatic memories, and conditions the basic aims of Polish foreign policy. These are the prevention of any future risk of isolation, by integrating Poland into European economic and security structures to the west, and the cultivation of close economic as well as political links with its neighbours to the east. Until two years ago Poland's eastern neighbour was a monolithic Soviet Union. Now, apart from a short common border with the Russian enclave of Kalingrad, it is separated from Russia by the Baltic states, Belarus and Ukraine. Poland's foreign minister, Mr Andrzej Olechowski, is ideally placed to operate on both the western and eastern fronts of diplomacy. A former central banker, who worked for years at the World Bank in Washington, he was in charge of negotiations with the European Community which led to Poland's association agreement with the EU. He knows the nit-picking reality behind the EU's fine words about need for greater European integration. He also knows that the main obstacle to the entry of Poland and other central European states into an enlarged EU is the Common Agricultural Policy. At the same time, his experience at the centre of economic and financial decision-making during Poland's economic transformation equips him with an understanding of the problems facing Russia, and even more so Ukraine. Poland's worries about the east are not military. The Russian army is demoralised and pre-occupied. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the chauvinist victor of December's Russian elections, is a worrying symbol of hurt pride and the darker side of the Russian psyche, but not a new Stalin. Poland's worry, shared by its central European partners, is of de-stabilising flows of refugees and criminals rom the east. A still distant nightmare is the danger of conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Ideally, Poland would like to be under the security umbrella of full Nato membership, but has accepted for the time being the half-way house of the partnership for peace. But when Mr Andrei Kozyrev visited Warsaw as part of his European tour last month security matters took up only a tiny portion of their talks. Instead, the Poles put forward a 26-point proposal for closer economic and financial co-operation, not on the old state to state basis, but mainly between private business people on both sides.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Lloyd's U-turn on running of market THE governing Council of Lloyd's yesterday backed down from its rejection of a proposed reform in the way the insurance market is run, in the face of widespread opposition. The council last week accepted most of the 65 recommended reforms put forward in a detailed report on Lloyd's future but rejected the proposed separation of its regulatory and business development functions. Yesterday, however, Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, said the council would now review the recommendations on governance in the task force report 'in the same manner as the report's other recommendations'. The council is to create a 'working group' headed by Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank, to 'examine further' the governance proposals. Mr David Rowland, the insurance broker who chaired the task force, will also be a member of the team and regards the proposals on governance as among the most important put forward by the task force. The working group will consider in detail the task force's proposed creation of a board to run the market mainly made up of representatives of Lloyd's underwriting businesses - a framework which would leave the council free to focus on its regulatory role. Mr Alan Lord, chief executive of Lloyd's, is understood to back the change of stance despite the fact that on Monday he said that he might have had to quit if the governance proposal had been accepted by the council. He had said the model proposed by the task force was unworkable and would have delayed the implementation of other changes suggested by the report. Mr Lord's position, however, appears to have been opposed by the majority of the agencies which manage Lloyd's syndicates and by the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents the interests of more than 9,000 Names - the individuals whose capital supports underwriting in the market. Mr Val Powell, ALM chief executive, said: 'It's a sensible way to go. The working group will give these recommendations the serious consideration that they deserve.' Pounds 100m cash call, Page 7</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Italian unions to protest at cuts plan ITALIANS have reacted with a mixture of shock and resignation to the swingeing public spending cuts in next year's budget, unveiled by Prof Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, on Thursday. The L93,000bn (Pounds 42bn) package of revenue increases and savings is the biggest attack on health and social security spending since Italy's welfare state was set up after the war. In a first reaction to the cuts, which also involve a wage freeze for about 3.5m public-sector workers, the country's three union federations yesterday announced a series of demonstrations, culminating in a one-day stoppage for public sector workers on October 2. However, the unions stopped short of calling a general strike, as demanded by some more militant members who took to the streets of big cities yesterday in protest. The wage freeze should save L9,900bn next year. Around 20m Italians will lose their entitlement to free outpatient health care under the decision to make all families with incomes over L40m a year pay for prescriptions and general practitioners' and specialists' services in a move expected to save L5,000bn. A further L13,750bn will come from by cutting the costs of the state pension system, threatened with bankruptcy. The measures triggered a recovery in the financial markets, with government bond prices making up ground after Thursday's panic selling and share prices rising by around 2 per cent. The value of the lira remained broadly stable in relatively quiet trading in Milan. Stockbrokers welcomed the measures, in spite of the introduction of a new tax on companies' net worth. Rates for securities repurchase agreements between the Bank of Italy and commercial banks declined slightly to 21.01 per cent yesterday, after hitting an all-time record of 22.22 per cent on Thursday. Mr Luigi Abete, chairman of the Confindustria employers' federation, expressed satisfaction with the government's measures, but warned that the proposals would have to be translated into fact if recent sacrifices were to have any effect. Representatives of small businesses and shopkeepers' federations, the two groups most often accused of tax evasion, said the moves were 'inevitable', and rejected claims their members were persistent tax-dodgers. Denying reports of unjustified price rises for foodstuffs following the lira's devaluation, the shopkeepers expressed concern about the possible effects on employment of the latest measures, which could cut consumption. In a step overshadowed by the budget, the Senate, the upper house of parliament, approved the Maastricht treaty on European union.</p>

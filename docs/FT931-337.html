			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (4): Small beginnings - The Stock Exchange THE Borza, Ljubljana's stock exchange, has steadily expanded since it was founded three years ago this week. It is still small. But Mr Boris Snuderl, 33, vice president and chief operating officer, believes the law on privatisation, passed last November, should pave the way for future growth. At present only eight of the 28 securities listed are stocks. The rest are bonds. Mr Snuderl expects another 200 companies to be listed when privatisation gets under way later this year. Market capitalisation in 1992 amounted to DM547m. Annual turnover totalled DM435. Four listed securites matured in 1992, causing a drop in turnover in relation to the previous year. Mr Snuderl says daily turnover in recent weeks has been DM4m to DM5m. To date, the highest one-day trading record was DM14m. Daily turnover has increased since January but this is largely because of a decree which included trades between the 57 members of the stock exchange as part of turnover. Mr Snuderl explains that plans to install an electronic trading system will help to expand the market and raise its efficiency. 'All of our traders have to travel to Ljubljana twice a week. A screen-based system would make it easier,' he says. 'There's no way you can cheat the electronic system. Once the trade has been entered you cannot pretend you bought it later in the day at a higher price,' he adds. Mr Snuderl says the Borza's young founders want to build up a fair market. 'We started from nothing. We spent time at the major European and North American stock exchanges and tried to pick out the best elements.' As a result, the Borza is a mini-amalgam of the Zurich, Paris and London stock markets. 'We are close to Zurich because we have direct trading between the banks. But we are a three-level market like the Paris Bourse. On the other hand, like the London stock exchange, the Borza is not a state but a private entity.' Open for trading on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the Borza, on the sixth floor of the city centre, is crowded. But it will start to recognise its full potential only when - and only when - real momentum builds up behind the privatisation process.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and 'Amira Segev] </F>   [Excerpts] Over the last few days, Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin decided on a series of measures to curtail Palestinian  national activities in Jerusalem, thus heeding the  recommendations of senior security elements to set "red lines"  for the activities of the Palestinians in the eastern part of  the city.    Rabin decided that Israel would henceforth bar the  establishment and operation of political Palestinian bodies in  Jerusalem. He ruled that only the Israeli Police is authorized  to maintain security and enforce the law and that consequently  the activities of Palestinian security bodies in the city should  be prevented.    The prime minister instructed Israel Police and security  elements to meticulously monitor what goes on at Orient House  (seat of the Palestinian delegation in East Jerusalem) and  immediately terminate any illegal activities detected in the  place.    After being briefed about the activities of the Palestinian  rejectionist organizations in East Jerusalem, Rabin instructed  security elements and Israel Police to conduct a thorough  investigation into their activities and to close down any  institution or body affiliated with them. [passage omitted]    At yesterday's meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and  Defense Committee, Likud Knesset Member Beni Begin quoted Faysal  al-Husayni as stating in a news conference at Orient House on  Sunday that "Jerusalem will be the capital of Palestine."  According to Begin, "the Arabs claim they were given a  commitment to discuss the future of Jerusalem. Knowing Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres, I suggest that we believe them."    Reacting to this allegation, Rabin said that "to the best of  my knowledge, 'Arafat was given an excerpt of Peres' speech in  the Knesset about freedom of worship and free access to the  Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. Even today, the Arabs are in  charge of administering their holy shrines."    A senior PLO official stated yesterday that Israel and the  PLO had exchanged official messages about the status of the  Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem. The exchange took  place in February, in the final days of the deliberations about  the first Cairo agreement.    "We are not talking about a section of the Cairo agreement,  but about an exchange of messages signed by the most senior  officials on both sides in the final days of the negotiations  about the first Cairo agreement," the senior PLO official  asserted.    The messages deal with the status quo in Jerusalem in  general, and that of the Palestinian institutions in particular.  They include a general commitment on the part of Israel to  honor the existence of these institutions and to abstain from  taking any measures that might adversely affect them. The names  of the institutions in question are not cited in the messages.    An urgent debate on the issue was held yesterday in  al-Husayni's office at Orient House, with the participation of  the directors of Palestinian institutions in and outside  Jerusalem and other figures. The participants would not divulge  the content of the deliberations or the resolutions adopted.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Li toasts long-lasting love in Romanian vineyard China's hardline Premier Li Peng celebrated his 36th wedding anniversary in a Romanian vineyard yesterday and let slip rare remarks on his personal life as he tasted wines with his wife. Reuter reports from Murfatlar, Romania. 'My wife and I are very happy, just like the day we married 36 years ago, maybe happier,' Mr Li said. 'A family is happy when both husband and wife help each other. But a husband especially must obey his wife's orders.' Mr Li made the remarks as he sampled wine at the renowned Murfatlar vineyards, where he dropped in for a tasting session during a weekend rest on Romania's Black Sea coast. He arrived on Saturday for a four-day trip, the highest-level visit to Romania by a Chinese leader in 10 years. Mr Li and his wife Zhu Lin took their hosts in Murfatlar by surprise when they said Sunday was their anniversary. 'My wife agrees we are a happy family,' Li said, gently pressing his hand on Zhu's arm as she sat next to him at a long wooden tasting table in the Murfatlar cellars. To mark the anniversary, the two sipped wine from each other's glass, to the applause of 100 accompanying Chinese and Romanian officials and businessmen. Mr Li's affable banter contrasted with the image he earned over the bloody crushing of demonstrations in Beijing in 1989, for which he is widely blamed. Earlier legs of his European tour, in Austria and Germany, were dogged by human rights protests. Today, Mr Li flies to the capital Bucharest to meet President Ion Iliescu, once his classmate at a communist cadre school in Moscow. The two leaders are to sign a joint political declaration and a set of economic and cultural agreements.</p>

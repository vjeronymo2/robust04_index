			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CUNLIFFE WHISTLE-BLOWER SUIT SETTLED BY CITY FOR $800,000  </P> <P> A tentative $800,000 settlement has been reached in a lawsuit by a  "whistle-blower" against the city and Sylvia Cunliffe, the fiery department  head forced from office in a wave of scandal, authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> The lawsuit by Robert O'Neill accused Cunliffe of defamation, invasion of  privacy and infliction of intentional and negligent emotional distress because  of Cunliffe's distribution of a letter in June, 1987, detailing his criminal  record as a juvenile.  </P> <P> Cunliffe, the former head of the Department of General Services, obtained the  information about O'Neill's past through department security officers and  circulated the letter to council members and Mayor Tom Bradley, allegedly in  retaliation for O'Neill's having blown the whistle on certain of her  activities.  </P> <P> O'Neill's attorney, Jay Plotkin, and Deputy City Atty. Art Walsh said the  settlement was approved Monday in Superior Court and must still be endorsed by  the City Council.  </P> <P> "This has been a very debilitating and emotionally draining experience for my  client," Plotkin said.  </P> <P> Because the letter was circulated by a top-level city official, the city itself  was named as a defendant in the lawsuit. The city agreed to pay both Cunliffe's  share of damages and legal fees in a negotiated agreement under which Cunliffe  retired in December, 1987, forestalling plans to fire her amid allegations of  mismanagement, nepotism and favoritism.  </P></p>

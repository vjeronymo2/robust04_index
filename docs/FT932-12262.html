			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mr Portillo sets the agenda - Political Notebook THIS is the time of year when cabinet ministers write begging letters to the chief secretary to the Treasury. The ones landing on Mr Michael Portillo's desk at the end of this week will be more than usually anguished. It is the start of the public spending round: that annual, peculiarly British, ritual during which Whitehall departments battle between themselves and against the Treasury over the size and share-out of the government's budget. By November, when the chancellor unveils his first unified Budget, everyone will have been declared a winner. The chief secretary will insist he has maintained a tight grip on spending and borrowing. His cabinet colleagues will claim they have got the cash they need to build new hospitals, roads, prisons and the like. This year, though, it will not be easy. For the first time since the early 1980s, squaring the circle between fiscal virtue and public-sector largesse will require more than sleight of hand and clever Whitehall presentation. With public borrowing running at Pounds 1bn a week, there are no extra billions on offer to massage the egos of the spending ministers or to put out political fires on the backbenches. The tax increases announced last month and the introduction of the unified Budget have made more explicit than ever the direct trade-off between spending and taxation. To meet its self-imposed spending targets, the government will have to start making visible inroads into the welfare state. Mr Major, elected on a platform promising to restore the social conscience of conservatism, will be confronted with decisions even his predecessor ducked. Mr Portillo is determined he should take them. One of the small minority in the cabinet whose ideological purpose has survived the crises of the past year, the chief secretary has his sights on the long term. He believed in shrinking the state long before the present crisis in public finances. He is playing a skilful political game. His overhaul last year of the framework for the spending negotiations - leaving the toughest decisions to be thrashed out in a high-level ministerial committee and ultimately the cabinet - have strengthened the Treasury's hand. There is a now collective commitment to meeting the overall expenditure ceilings set for 1994-95 and 1995-96. The credibility of the government as well as what remains of that of the Treasury is at stake. Mr Portillo misses no opportunity publicly to remind his colleagues of the point. He has reinforced it privately by insisting their annual begging letters are no longer framed in terms of bids for additional resources. Before they can plead for more money, cabinet ministers must first submit details of how they would implement notional cuts of 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent respectively in their departmental budgets. The ceilings are tougher than is generally realised. The new cash control totals - Pounds 253.6bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 263.3bn in 1995-96 - were originally designed to allow real increases in Whitehall spending of just under 1 per cent a year. But sterling's devaluation has obliged the Treasury to raise its forecast of the medium-term inflation rate. The cash targets now imply small real cuts in spending in each of the next two years. No new hospitals or police stations there. It is here we come to Mr Portillo's review of long-term expenditure - the separate Whitehall studies of spending on the social security, the health, the home office, the education and, less for-mally, the housing, budgets. This exercise in thinking the unthinkable - lowering the social security safety net, eroding the universality of the state pension and other contributory benefits, expanding the revenue and contracting the service base of the health service - has been carefully structured by the chief secretary. Each of the departments under review has been obliged to set up its own team to produce options. The Treasury is represented on each of the teams. But the onus is on the spending ministers to suggest, say, the introduction of hospital hotel charges or the abolition of NHS dental care. Everyone around the cabinet table is to be implicated. The most radical options, of course, are for the next parliament. Even this government will not trample on all its manifesto commitments. But by bringing the issues out into the open Mr Portillo is nurturing carefully a climate in which a significant start can be made next year. Cutbacks in invalidity benefit and statutory sick pay or in the eligibility for free NHS prescriptions are obvious examples. State-funding of university fees is another target. The chief secretary believes he has the mood of the party behind him. Conservatives do not like runaway borrowing. They hate tax increases. If they hold on to Newbury in next week's by-election they may judge that the voters will accept anything. Mr Portillo will have the opportunity to write Mr Major's agenda.</p>

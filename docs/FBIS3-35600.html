			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report: "A Tidbit of Russian Politics"] </F>   [Text] The committee on CIS affairs, created in the Duma,  has become a new phenomenon in Russian politics. Talk to the  effect that Russia's foreign policy should be divided into  "distant" and "close" has been going on for quite some time now.  The absence of a corresponding committee in the Supreme Soviet  brought about a situation where the leaders of the National  Salvation Front were dealing directly (and in a rather peculiar  way) with CIS and Baltic matters in parliament.    In the Duma this mistake was happily avoided and the new  committee has been "assigned" to the PRES [Party of Russian  Unity and Accord] faction. Apart from the CIS, PRES also was  placed in charge of committees on regional policy and local  self-government. According to faction leader Sergey Shakhray,  PRES intends to occupy all the leading positions in these  directions, "traditional" for it, both in parliament and in the  government. But as one can easily see, the promised  "committee-ministry" linkage in the case of CIS affairs is not  working out. PRES' wish to monopolize this area of foreign  policy is hampered by the fact that in the government CIS  affairs are administered by the Foreign Affairs Ministry. The  new economy minister and PRES member Aleksandr Shokhin, however,  is working in the government to have himself placed in charge of  economic relations with the former USSR republics. But this is  clearly not enough to coordinate the policy of the government  and the parliamentary committee.    More complications can be expected also from what can mildly  be described as the painful relation of the Duma  communo-nationalist majority to CIS problems, the "situation of  the Russian population," and Russian foreign policy in general.  A feeler put out by PRES leaders between parliament sessions  was devoted to what is probably the most acute issue of policy  with respect to the neighboring countries -- the situation in  Crimea. Consultations by Konstantin Zatulin, PRES faction  secretary and chairman of the committee on CIS affairs, with  Ukrainian officials were held behind the Duma's back, and the  committee was not called for that purpose because "the majority  of deputies are currently away in their constituencies." The  "placating statements" made after that apparently did not  satisfy the nationalists, who are anxious to seize the peninsula  from Ukraine. Before the Duma session resumes, hot debates on  this issue are most likely. Should Yuriy Meshkov be elected  Crimea's president, the nationalists supporting the leader of  the Russian opposition during the election campaign will  inevitably get an advantage.    In any event, PRES leaders are to face a conflict with the  Foreign Affairs Ministry which, as is apparent from Minister  Andrey Kozyrev's latest statements, does not wish to give up the  initiative to other Russian politicians in the neighboring  countries. The ambitions by Vladimir Lukin, chairman of another  parliamentary committee -- on foreign affairs -- are also aimed  at curtailing the Foreign Affairs Ministry's powers. Therefore  the erstwhile allies of Russia's Choice will apparently be  seeking to take the bloc's existing levers of influencing the  government course away from it.    The experience of the Supreme Soviet shows that the size of  democratic factions falls in proportion to the growing ambitions  of their leaders. Foreign policy appears to be an ideal field  for a clash of these ambitions. Which opportunity the  communists and nationalists will seize with great pleasure.</p>

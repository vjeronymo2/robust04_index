			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special report": "Guangdong Provincial Public Security </F> Chief Refutes Rumor About Thieves Ransacking His House"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 5 Apr (TA KUNG PAO)--During an interview  with a TA KUNG PAO reporter today, Guangdong Provincial Public  Security Chief Chen Shaoji and Deputy Chief Wu Zeyao denied a  recent report in Hong Kong's CHENG MING magazine entitled:  "Guangdong Provincial Public Security Chief's House Ransacked  By Thieves."    The "Reference News" column report in the April issue of  CHENG MING said: "The house of Chen Shaoji, chief of the  Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department, was ransacked  by 'thieves' believed to have come from within." The report  continued: "One day in early March, Chen Shaoji attended a  provincial party committee meeting, all his family members went  to visit friends in Foshan City, and his domestic helper  returned to Xinhui on vacation. It was reported that this  happened at about 1800 and involved two or more suspects. All  of the electrical appliances in the house were damaged, clothes  were smeared with paint, and a message was left, which read: We  visited your excellency's house to check your property; we will  announce the results soon. Reports said that bank books showing  deposits of 35,000 yuan and gold ornaments were stolen."    Chen Shaoji pointed out: The report described the date,  people's whereabouts, and the way the ransacking was performed  in such a detailed manner that "they seemed to be true" but, as  a matter of fact, my house and the houses of other leaders of  the provincial Public Security Department have remained safe so  far and no burglary has ever occurred. Since the report was  published, my family members and I have received many telephone  inquiries every day which have been quite disruptive.    Deputy Public Security Chief Wu Zeyao said: The provincial  Public Security Department feels it necessary to clarify some  Hong Kong press reports which have distorted facts concerning  Guangdong's public security. The "thieves from within"  mentioned by the report refer to public security personnel.  This is groundless and means to say that "internal conflicts"  have occurred in public security departments. The report on a  burglary in the Guangdong Provincial Public Security  "commander's" house located in the Public Security Department's  compound tried to indicate that Guangdong's social order had  deteriorated to an unredeemable degree. In addition, the report  also used some words which caused much food for thought, such as  "announcing the results soon" and so on, to make a false  impression that there was uncleanliness within the leadership.  Wu Zeyao said that the report was short and comprised only a  little over 100 characters. However, it was meticulously  composed and targeted at the public security chief and has  ruined the image of Guangdong Public Security Departments. Wu  Zeyao said that a lawsuit would be filed against the report if  necessary.    To further clarify this case, a reporter went to Chen  Shaoji's house accompanied by Chen Shaoji's wife and others.  Chen Shaoji lives on the top floor of an old seven-story  building within the Public Security Department's compound. The  building is not equipped with an elevator. The interior of the  room is simply decorated. There were no indications that the  electrical appliances and furniture had been damaged and the  domestic helper was a girl from Guangxi (not from Xinhui, as the  report mentioned) who has been in Guangzhou for not more than  six months.</p>

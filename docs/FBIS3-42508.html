The Antonov KB, as is well known, is  the leading scientific-production base in Ukraine engaged in  projects in the sphere of aircraft construction. The AN-124  Ruslan and An-225 Mriya aircraft are well known around the world  today.    But economic difficulties have not bypassed the  "Antonovites"  either. There are not enough funds, and the disruption of  economic ties is having a negative effect. The task for the  future, however, remains the same for the Antonov KB: Work for  the benefit of Ukraine, and for the benefit of its armed forces.  The discussion concerned just that, among other things, during a  meeting of Minister of Defense General of the Army of Ukraine  Vitaliy Radetskyy with Antonov KB General Director Petro  Balabuyev.    An account will appear in an upcoming issue.</p>

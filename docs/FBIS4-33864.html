			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Marlise Ilhesca] </F>   [Text] Caracas -- "It is the duty of the international  community to resolve the problem in Haiti. OAS member countries  that signed human rights declarations cannot allow a gang of  military men to brazenly continue to violate these principles in  the name of an orthodox sovereignty concept of the past  century." Marco Tullio Celli, the UN Human Rights Committee  observer specially appointed to follow the tragedy of thousands  of people persecuted by the coupist Haitian regime, thus  preaches intervention in Haiti. During an interview with JORNAL  DO BRASIL, Celli said he is sure the OAS meeting in Belem do  Para will offer the appropriate framework to allow OAS members  to face this problem once and for all and apply the Chilean  Resolution. This resolution favors democracy. It was approved  three months before the coup that overthrew Jean-Bertrand  Aristide and establishes procedures for collective decisions  whenever the institutional order is interrupted in any country  on the American continent.    Celli said OAS country members cannot forget that the coup  in  Haiti represents disrespect for a decision made a few months  earlier by Latin American countries, and represents the  beginning of a process that could jeopardize democracy in the  region. During their latest visit to Haiti, Human Rights  Committee representatives verified 133 cases of illegal  executions last February and March alone. During a two-month  period, 55 people were kidnapped (11 were killed and 24 are  missing). International observers also verified the existence  of mutilated bodies in Port-au-Prince as well as the rape of  women and children by members of the civilian militias who were  armed by the military men.    Celli said: "What is the cost of the policy so far conducted  by the OAS and the UN in Haiti? At least 4,000 murders!" He  demands from the international community more than political and  economic sanctions against the Haitian regime. Celli believes  the plan to shelter Haitian refugees is also doomed to fail.  "If everyone there is persecuted and the government maintains a  regime of terror, what are we doing receiving 1,000 or 2,000  refugees? The repression will continue. The solution to the  Haitian problem is to rebuild a government that can offer the  people security." He believes there are conditions for  intervention in the island. "The military threat to call the  people to stage a national rebellion against an eventual  occupation is not true. The Haitian Army is very small -- it  has 7,000 men, of which 5,000 are in Port-au-Prince. If the  capital is occupied, the whole country is occupied. The idea is  to maintain in Haiti some advisers to modernize the Haitian  Armed Forces and to help lead the country through a democratic  process."    Finally, Marco Tullio Celli has a message for those who  still  believe in a policy of half measures. "Above everything,  everybody must understand that Haitian sovereignty is not at  stake. Those who resort to this argument merely favor a group  of military men who mercilessly massacre people. Intervening in  Haiti does not represent an invasion. It is liberation," Celli  said.</p>

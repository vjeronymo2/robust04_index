			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Microsoft Microsoft has escaped the nightmare of being broken up. But its weekend deal with the US Justice Department and the European Commission is more than a slap on the wrist. To avoid a lengthy court battle over claims that it behaved anti-competitively, the software giant has had to accept restrictions on the way it conducts its business. While the detailed terms certainly do not spell an immediate end to its near-monopoly in supplying personal computer operating systems, rivals should find it easier to penetrate the market. Even more serious is the risk that close monitoring by the competition authorities for the next six and a half years will cramp Microsoft's style. One of the secrets of the group's success has been an aggressive no-hostages-taken approach to competitors. It may now feel it has to tone down this aggression. Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft's founder, was playing down such risks yesterday. According to him, the deal eliminates the possible distraction of a court case and allows the company to focus on devising new products. Certainly, Microsoft's main challenge will be in the marketplace. Computer technology is advancing at such a pace that the group will need to innovate to retain its dominance in desktop operating systems. As Microsoft seeks to establish itself in other segments of the software market such as networking and multimedia, the need for innovation will be even greater.</p>

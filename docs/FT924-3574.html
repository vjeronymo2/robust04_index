			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Observer: Holding on News that a replacement is being sought for James D Robinson III - chairman, chief executive and chief quality officer of American Express  - raises the question of whether he would have been allowed to cling on for so long if he had not combined the role of chairman and CEO. American Express's spectacular growth in the 1960s and 1970s owes much to Robinson's predecessor, Howard Clark, who dominated the company for 17 years as both chairman and chief executive. However, one of the perks - and dangers - of a powerful chairman is that he gets to choose his replacement. Hence Robinson's appointment in 1977, followed fairly soon by the departure of his main rival for the top job, Roger Morley. Since then Robinson has held sway in Amex's well-connected boardroom, as witness his seemingly influential role in the search for his successor. Until very recently, combining the role of chairman and chief executive has been the norm in most US boardrooms. According to headhunter Korn/Ferry International only 20 per cent of major US companies split the job of chairman and chief executive, and no more than 5 per cent of large businesses appoint an independent director rather than a retiring insider as chairman. Nevertheless the recent reshuffle at General Motors, where retired Procter &amp; Gamble chairman John Smale has taken on the GM chairmanship, suggests that fashions are changing. If a blue chip like American Express were to follow suit by importing an independent as chairman - instead of just passing the job on to faithful Harvey Golub - it might even be worth calling a trend.</p>

May Sell Canadian Unit: The Seattle-based firm, which has never been  content with its de Havilland commuter aircraft division, said it is discussing  selling Boeing Canada's de Havilland division to Aeritalia of Italy and  Aerospatiale of France.  </P> <P> The division, based in Downsview, Ontario, builds the Dash 8-series turboprop  commuter plane. Boeing bought de Havilland from the Canadian government in  1986, and company executives have since made no secret of their disappointment  in the subsidiary's performance. The unit employs 5,400. Representatives of  Aerospatiale and Aeritalia could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

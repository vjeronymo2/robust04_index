			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] Today [1 June] marks the beginning of some price and  fee increases agreed on by the Council of Ministers Executive  Committee to cleanse the nation's domestic finances, which are  being burdened by the circulation of a large amount of currency.    Surplus liquidity increased as the country found itself  forced to reduce production and imports because of the  termination of the fair and fruitful ties that had existed with  the now dissolved socialist bloc.    The country's purchasing power was further reduced as a  result of the tightening of the U.S. economic blockade.  Eventually, supplies dwindled, and this led to Cuban workers  who found that they held large amounts of money they could not  spend.    Excess currency in circulation undermines the motivation to  work and to produce, and it fuels the black market which  benefits a group of citizens who dedicate themselves to  profiting from the needs of the majority.    One way of collecting this excess money is by increasing  prices on nonessential products and service fees, while making  adjustments designed to protect certain sectors of the  population.    In addition, the government will introduce these reforms  gradually and will continuing subsidizing staples to the tune of  365 million pesos a year. This helps the family economy a great  deal.    Today's cigarette price hike affects 3 million smokers, but  addicts as well as those who do not have this harmful habit will  continue receiving a monthly quota at prices below the new  price, but always higher than the current price.    Another reform that went into effect today has to do with  new  prices on liquor -- a category that rightly is considered  nonessential. The impact of this price hike will not affect the  entire population.    Today, 1 June, the fees for air and sea transportation to  and  from the Isle of Youth will also be increased, but the increases  will be relatively modest.    With the implementation today of the new prices on  cigarettes, liquor, and transportation to the Isle of Youth  begins the first phase of a plan that will cover other  nonessential products and services, although there will be some  exceptions based on specific situations. These new prices and  fees represent an increase in family expenditures, but everybody  knows that the funds collected will be used to benefit society.</p>

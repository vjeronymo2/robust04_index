			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhang Xia: "Successes Mixed With </F> Anxiety"]    [Text] The distinctive cultures of the 55 minority  nationalities in China are preserved on paper, stones, wood or  just plain passed on orally from generation to generation.    "This is an indispensable part of the treasure-house of  China's history, and it is urgent to rescue and protect this  precious heritage," said Li Dongsheng of the State Nationalities  Affairs Commission (SNAC).    China has always attached great importance to protecting  minority culture.    As far back as 1952, Premier Zhou Enlai suggested collecting  and publishing ancient books of ethnic minorities. But due to  the ensuing political chaos, the work did not start until the  1980s.    In August 1984, upon State Council approval, the  Nationalities Affairs Commission started to prepare for the  collection and research of ancient books of minorities published  before the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).    Offices, research centres and publishing houses were set up  in 24 provinces and autonomous regions, with money coming from  regional revenue.    Generally, ancient books refer to those written before the  Qing. Since some minorities have a short history, books written  in their language before 1949 are also included, according to Li.    These books cover a wide range of fields: philosophy,  literature, history, astronomy, medicine, architecture, music  and painting.    Research found that the Yi nationality boasts 10,000 volumes  of ancient publications. A book on medicine, included more than  370 prescriptions. Investigations show it was finished 17 years  earlier than the Compendium of Materia Medica, a world-famous  book on medicine written by Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty  (1368-1644).    Mongolia and Man nationalities, founders of the Yuan  11271-1368) and Qing dynasties, left large numbers of official  documents in addition to folk tales. These documents have  far-reaching significance in historical studies of the two  dynasties.    The collection and publication of these books help minority  nationalities better know their own history.    It also signifies the equality of all nationalities.    "The work, however, is tough and urgent," said Li Dongsheng.    Few people are expert at all minority languages.    Naxi nationality, scattered in the Lijiang area of South  China's Yunnan Province, created a hieroglyph called the Dongba  character. It got its name from its use to record religious  rites by Naxi celebrants, called Dongba in the local language.    Only a few old Dongba can read these pictographic  characters.    In 1981, an institute was established in Lijiang to rescue  the precious cultural relics of Naxi nationality. The institute  invited several old Dongba as instructors and provided 10  university graduates for them.    With it the pronunciation and content of more than 1,000  Dongba books have been recovered and more than 300 books have  been translated into Mandarin Chinese. The books also disclosed  eight Dongba rituals.    Some minority nationalities, on the other hand, do not have  written languages. Their history is passed down orally.    In the past decade or so, the Snac has invested money and  manpower to recover their history, legend and folk tales.    From 1986 to 1990, more than 1,000 books about 30  nationalities were published, their academic value attracting  world attention.    Research institutes of Chinese minorities have also been  established in Japan, the United States, India, Canada and  Germany.    During the past 10 years, more than 1,000 foreigners have  visited the Dongba culture research institute in Lijiang. Two  foreign students are studying in the institute for their  doctor's degree.    A national conference on the collation of ancient  nationality  books will be held this year, according to Li. At the  conference, relevant rules and regulations will be worked out to  provide long-term guidelines for the work.    Li said the collection and collation work needs to be  further  improved.    In the past decade, both the central and local governments  have provided financial help to the collection and collation of  these books, Li said. In the future, more money is expected to  be allocated to meet the increasing need.    On the other hand, local research institutes should actively  tap resources on their own to collect funds, Li suggested.    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region set a prime example in this  regard. In recent years, it has cooperated with the People's  Republic of Mongolia and Australia on minority nationality  cultural studies. Many books in the Mongolian language were  jointly published by them.    There is a lack of professional personnel in the collection  and collation work. Until now, no university has set up this  major. Only short-term training classes have been opened at the  Central University for Nationalities, according to Li.</p>

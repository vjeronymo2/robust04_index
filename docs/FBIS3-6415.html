			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 16 March Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] As tension is increasing in the confrontation  between the United States and China on the human rights issue,  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is uncertain of how far he  should go into this issue during his visit to China starting on  19 March. He is in anguish over how to handle this problem.    Hosokawa made a commitment during his recent talks with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher to urge the PRC to make  improvements on the human rights issue. However, there is the  danger that President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders  might toughen their attitude depending on how Hosokawa talks  about this problem. On the other hand, if the prime minister  limits himself to roundabout expressions, he may be criticized  by the Western nations. The Foreign Ministry is rushing its  preparations to have the prime minister ask China to respect  human rights in accordance with the universal sense of values  existing in the international community.    At the meeting of leaders of the government and the ruling  parties on 14 March, Hosokawa explained his upcoming China visit  in the following terms, "We do not really have any major pending  issues." However, after the U.S.-Chinese foreign ministerial  meeting in Beijing ended in discord, things have become  precarious. While it is not unusual for the United States, which  has to decide on renewing most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment  for the PRC in June, to push strongly for improvements in  China's treatment of human rights, China this time took an  unprecedentedly tough position using its "huge market" as a  trump card.    As for the stand that the prime minister should take during  his visit to the PRC, the Foreign Ministry's policy is: While  the prime minister will touch on the human rights issue, he will  limit himself to circumspect expressions and will not go into  concrete issues, such as the detention of prodemocracy  activists, nor link this topic with the fourth yen loan.  However, it is also reported that "the prime minister seems to  be also considering making straightforward demands for  improvements on human rights, which were avoided during past  Liberal Democratic Party administrations, and making an explicit  apology for the past war" (according to the prime minister's  close aides). It will take some time for the final position to  take shape.</p>

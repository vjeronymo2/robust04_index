			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'YUKON EXPRESS' BRINGS SPRINKLES, CHILLS TO COUNTY  </P> <P> A fast-moving Arctic cold front delivered a grazing blow to Southern California  on Saturday before preparing to take a final punch at the Southland tonight.  </P> <P> As it hung around for a second day, the frigid air mass dubbed the "Yukon  Express" hammered farmers and ranchers already staggering from last weekend's  record-breaking cold snap.  </P> <P> It was chilly and cloudy in Orange County, with temperatures in the low 50s and  dropping to the high 40s along the coastal cities, and a few sprinkles of rain  in some areas. Weekend lows in the county were expected to drop to the high  30s. Newport Harbor and Huntington State Beach officials said there was no sign  of the record high tides that are expected to peak on Monday.  </P> <P> The cold weather drew the homeless to Orange County's National Guard armories  for the night. Both the Santa Ana and Fullerton armories expected to fill their  125 beds by the end of Saturday night.  </P> <P> Pre-dawn temperatures dipped into the 20s from Bakersfield to Redding, where  thermometers hit 22 degrees early Saturday, tying the city's record low reading  for the date. Growers were anxiously inspecting fruit trees and vineyards to  determine whether the freeze had killed plants.  </P> <P> Although lows were recorded early Saturday of 50 in Los Angeles, 37 in  Lancaster and 27 at Mt. Wilson, ranchers and residents of inland areas were  warned to expect colder temperatures tonight.  </P> <P> "Sunday night will be colder than Saturday night," said Steve Burback, a  meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times.  "There will be a light freeze in the inland areas. The coldest areas will  probably be around the upper 20s."  </P> <P> But warm winds gusting up to 25 m.p.h. will push daytime temperatures into the  60s today, Burback said. The warming trend will continue Monday and New Year's  Day, when a postcard-perfect day is predicted for Pasadena's Tournament of  Roses parade and Rose Bowl football game.  </P> <P> The picture that residents of California's central San Joaquin Valley awakened  to on Saturday was one of ice, however.  </P> <P> "There was ice everywhere, on cars, lawns, trees, streets," said Lori Segrue,  who works at a 900-acre vineyard in Kingsburg. "It's all people are talking  about. It's affecting everyone.  </P> <P> "People are losing their jobs over it. My husband is a supervisor at an  orange-packing house and he's gone down to forklift driver because the hourly  employees are all gone."  </P> <P> In Clovis, workers at the Loring Citrus Farm toiled all night to keep heaters  and wind machines whirring. They flooded their 40-acre orange orchard with  72-degree water pumped "from deep, deep in the ground" and managed once again  to save their orange crop, a spokeswoman said Saturday.  </P> <P> But Robert Krauter, a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau, said other  growers lost virtually their entire crop to last weekend's Arctic blast, the  worst freeze to hit the state since the 1936-37 growing season.  </P> <P> Only 2% of California's citrus growers -- 146 of 7,000 -- are insured against  frost.  </P> <P> There is no estimate yet on total freeze losses to the state's  $8-billion-per-year agriculture crop, although some experts feel damage could  total $1 billion. As a result, shoppers will soon see shortages and higher food  prices, the experts said.  </P> <P> In Santa Cruz County, Gov. George Deukmejian declared a state of emergency  because of freeze damage to public water systems, which local officials were  struggling to repair.  </P> <P> Weather forecasters said there were some bright spots on the horizon, however.  </P> <P> For example, today's wind gusts are expected to disappear by Monday, when an  unusually high tide is expected along the Southland coast about 8 a.m.  </P></p>

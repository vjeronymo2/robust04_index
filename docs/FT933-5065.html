			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Major faces test over tax policy: FT writers report on the controversy over the November Budget and gauge the views of voters and industry PRIME MINISTER John Major was last night facing a new test of his leadership as the Tory right stepped up its efforts to head off possible tax increases in the November Budget. As Mr Major prepared to return to Downing Street tomorrow after his Portuguese holiday, rightwing ministers were insisting that tax and spending should be discussed on Thursday at the first Cabinet meeting since the summer break. Downing Street yesterday described the meeting as 'very much a reporting Cabinet', with ministers outlining summer developments in their departments in general terms. But rightwing ministers were adamant that the debate over the best way of narrowing the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement should not be kept off the agenda, arguing that the general political situation could not be discussed without talking about spending. Cabinet's spending committee, EDX, is not scheduled to reconvene until next week. An acrimonious debate about whether further tax rises should play a part in the government's drive to reduce the budget deficit has rumbled on in Tory ranks all summer. Already some are warning that the differences which have come to light could prove as damaging as the rift on Europe which dominated the last parliamentary session. Yesterday brought a string of contributions to the argument, with Mr David Mellor, a former Treasury minister, saying the option of tax increases had 'got to be kept up'. Mr John Townend, rightwing chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, said supporters in his Bridlington constituency were telling him they did not elect him to put taxes up. He was 'heartened by the fact that the battle for spending cuts is making progress'. Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, said Mr Major should tell Cabinet colleagues that if they did not go along with government policy they should 'quietly resign or retire'.</p>

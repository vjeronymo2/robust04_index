			<p>BFN     [Text] Urumqi, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang  Uygur Autonomous Region has built 14 quality cotton production  bases in a bid to boost its cotton industry.    According to local officials, the bases, which are scattered  across both sides of the Tianshan Mountains, have a total cotton  growing area of 200,000 ha, accounting for one third of the  autonomous region's total cotton growing acreage.    The production capacity of the bases has been greatly  enhanced thanks to the establishment of comprehensive services  concerning operation and management, technology application, the  breeding of good strains, purchase and processing, coupled with  increased investment from the central government.    Last year Xinjiang earned 7.2 billion yuan from sales of  commodity cotton, accounting for more than half of the earnings  from the marketing of produce from the region's farming sector.    Local farmers also netted an increase of 80 yuan in their  per  capita income from the growing of cotton alone.    The officials said that this year the growing area of cotton  in Xinjiang is expected to surpass 733,333 ha, compared to  644,666 ha in 1993.    They pledged to redouble their efforts to boost cotton  production and make the region's total output of cotton reach  one million tons by 1996.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: PepsiCo holds its own in brands battle PepsiCo, the US soft drinks and fast-food company, brought cheer to its shareholders yesterday with quarterly figures suggesting it was fighting off the threat to its core Pepsi-Cola brand from own-label cola drinks. The news from its fast-food restaurant businesses, however, was less encouraging. Overall, net income for the third quarter to September 3 was Dollars 541.4m. This was 18 per cent higher than the comparable quarter's Dollars 458.2m - although excluding a tax adjustment in the prior year, growth would have been a less impressive 11 per cent. Sales rose by 12 per cent to Dollars 7.1bn and earnings per share, boosted by company share repurchases, rose to 68 cents from 56 cents. For the nine months, underlying profits (excluding unusual charges) were 7 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.3bn.</p>

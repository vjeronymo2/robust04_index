			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: Markets watch for dollar moves - Currencies Possible interest rate rises and trade negotiations will be the key factors motivating the markets this week as the dollar comes under scrutiny. Currency traders will focus on tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Open Markets Committee, the policy-making arm of the US Federal Reserve Board, as speculation mounts that growing fears of inflation could prompt further monetary tightening. Although some analysts believe the Fed may hold its fire at tomorrow's meeting, an earlier rather than later rate rise seems on the cards. Such a move might lend some support to the dollar, though the US currency could also follow bond markets, which would not respond well to a rate increase. The markets will also be increasingly vexed by the trade negotiations between the US and Japan as the September 30 deadline for sanctions looms close on the horizon. If the governments can avoid sanctions, it should be positive for the dollar. Analysts are sceptical, however, that a full settlement will be reached. Inflation, unemployment, retail sales and industrial production figures from Japan could also prejudice market views on the strength of the yen against the dollar, but traders should focus primarily on trade rather than domestic issues. In Germany, the markets will turn their attention to the Bundesbank meeting on Thursday, although expectations of interest rate movements are subdued in advance of the October 16 general elections. Following yesterday's state poll in Bavaria, the markets will be concerned about the performance of the liberal Free Democratic party, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's junior alliance partner. The markets will want to gauge the possibility of a coalition between Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats and the Social Democratic party. Following last week's relatively strong performance by sterling after a raft of positive statistics, the markets may lend a softer tone to the pound in the absence of any notable data releases. The markets will also be watching Monday's meeting between the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, for signs of policy changes. Investors may also watch for comments from world officials in the run-up to Saturday's Group of Seven meeting and next week's annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p>

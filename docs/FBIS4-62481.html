			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report from </F> Chelyabinsk-65 by Sergey Sergeyev and Viktor Sosunov, identified  by caption]    [Text] A train carrying spent nuclear fuel from the  Finnish nuclear power station in Lovisa originally built with  Soviet assistance arrived in the notorious city of  Chelyabinsk-65 at the beginning of May. This happened despite  the efforts to stop the train by activists of the international  Greenpeace organization. The local Greens are also vigorously  protesting against the importation of foreign nuclear waste to  the southern Urals. Activists of the Movement for Nuclear  Safety have mounted a picket at the oblast administration  headquarters and are collecting signatures to prevent  Chelyabinsk Oblast from being turned into a world nuclear waste  ground.    Meanwhile the train carrying spent nuclear fuel from Finland  has been unloaded and the said material is now in one of the  Mayak Chemical Combine's plants. Uranium will be extracted from  this material and returned to the nuclear power industry; the  Ministry of Atomic Energy will receive a substantial sum of  money in dollars; and by all accounts the waste will remain, as  ever, in Chelyabinsk Oblast, whose territory has long since been  declared an ecological disaster zone.</p>

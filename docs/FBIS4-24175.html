			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The French operation in Rwanda, Operation  Turquoise, continues. This morning, 15 French military vehicles  entered Rwanda through Cyangugu, in the southwest of the  country. [passage omitted]    The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], one of the sides involved  in the Rwandan civil war, has reconsidered its position on the  French intervention, which was initially seen as a declaration  of war. The RPF has made it known that it will henceforth  renounce its intention of fighting against French troops if they  limit their operation to a humanitarian one. The RPF can,  therefore, be assured of the French military authorities' good  faith. The military authorities have already met RPF leaders.  (Jean-Baptiste Ndaumba), the RPF spokesman whom we interviewed  this morning, explains the situation.    [Begin recording] [(Ndaumba)] Following several contacts  with  French diplomats, France has reassured us that its presence in  Rwanda is purely for humanitarian reasons. We would like to  accept that view, but we would like to countercheck matters on  the ground. In order to accept France's show of good faith, we  are demanding that it admits to its mistakes.    Second, we are demanding that the criminals who are in  France  be prevented from carrying out their activities. Third, we  would like France to arrest the assassins in the areas that it  is controlling. On the international level, we would like  France to call for the establishment of an ad hoc tribunal to  judge the perpetrators of the genocide.    [Unidentified correspondent] When France says that it is  intervening to save Rwandans whose lives are endangered by the  war, it is alluding to Tutsis who seem to be the target of  government forces. Does this not imply that France is siding  with the RPF?    [(Ndaumba)] The French policy in Rwanda to date has been a  disaster. It is about time France realized this without  contesting we will be pleased about that. Our point is that it  is not a matter of going to Rwanda to assist the Tutsis as has  been said: Our movement is made up of Both Tutsis and Hutus.  There are moderate Hutus, as well as Hutus in the opposition  who were massacred just like the Tutsis. This dual view is,  therefore, [words indistinct].    [Correspondent] You are holding government forces  responsible  for the massacres in the country, but it seems the RPF is not  beyond reproach either.    [(Ndaumba]) Mistakes may have been made, and there may have  been blunders. However, we have admitted to them and we have  pledged to penalize those responsible. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Aberdeen Steak chief says no to minority purchase AFTER NEARLY two years of reflection, Mr Ali Salih, chairman of Aberdeen Steak Houses, the loss-making restaurant chain, has decided he will not offer to buy out the company's minority shareholders. Mr Salih, who owns 78 per cent of the company, said in August 1990 he was talking to his bankers about buying out minorities at a price 'unlikely to be materially different' from the 67p flotation price when the shares were listed on the USM in 1985. Yesterday he said he would no longer proceed with the plan, prompting another fall in the share price, which dropped 2p to 18p. The market was always sceptical about Mr Salih's plans and has marked the shares down as losses mounted since 1989. Last year losses were contained to Pounds 422,000 compared to Pounds 3.27m in 1990.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Letter: Taurus role in cutting cost of share registration Sir, In his letter (April 16), Mr Nunnenely, the chairman of the Institutional Fund Managers' Association, makes the point that to designate individual investors' holdings within a fund manager's nominee would add to the cost and complication of administration. He is, of course, correct and I would suggest that he is somewhat understating the case. The introduction next year of Taurus, the Stock Exchange's new system for transferring and registering shares, will significantly simplify and automate the registration process. It will be perfectly possible and preferable for fund managers to maintain separate accounts for each investor so that individual holdings are recorded and visible on the company register. The Stock Exchange has already indicated that it may wish to go further once the Taurus system is in place and make statutory enquiries on any remaining nominee holdings easier and replies faster. In the meantime, while we grapple with the existing paper-based system, I wonder if fund managers could go some way towards relieving the fears of investors whose holdings are maintained in nominee accounts. Company registrars must, by law, make the register of shareholders available to the public for inspection. Fund managers could, voluntarily, make the underlying investor detail of a nominee company available on request to clients or their auditors. Such an offer would allay many fears and would make it clear that nominees are currently used to ease the administrative burden and are not there to hide impropriety. The nominee system is a well-established means of reducing the already vast amount of paper involved in transferring and registering shares; until Taurus removes all the paper from the system, it is unreasonable to expect a big change. A voluntary disclosure of underlying shareholders would enable a swift transition to Taurus without having to multiply the paper handling costs in the interim.

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE . . .: ADDING PEP TO FRESH GREEN PEAS  </P> <P> The best green peas you'll ever eat are those from your local farmer's market  or, better yet, your own garden, picked and shelled minutes before microwaving.  </P> <P> The great advantage of the microwave is that you needn't drown the peas in  water as you must if you cook them on top of the stove.  </P> <P> If you add a nugget of butter to the casserole in which you'll microwave them,  you needn't add any water at all (let your calorie-consciousness be your  guide). In a closed container, the peas will steam in their own fragrant vapor  so that their original goodness is not only preserved but heightened.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Something Special  </P> <P> Here's a recipe for turning snow pea pods into something special.  </P> <P> You'll get about one cup shelled peas from each pound unshelled peas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> INDONESIAN SNOW PEAS IN PEANUT SAUCE  </P> <P> 1 large sweet red pepper, cored, seeded and cut in 2x1/8-inch strips  </P> <P> 4 green onions, cut diagonally into 1/2-inch pieces  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons dark sesame oil  </P> <P> 1/2 pound snow peas  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon minced ginger root  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons chunky peanut butter  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons soy sauce  </P> <P> Combine red pepper, green onions, garlic and oil in 2-quart casserole at least  9-inches across. Cover with wax paper and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 3  minutes.  </P> <P> Stir, add snow peas and ginger, cover with lid or vented plastic wrap and  microwave on HIGH 3 to 4 minutes, stirring at half time, until snow peas are  barely tender. Let stand, covered, 2 minutes.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, spoon peanut butter into 1-cup measure, add soy sauce, cover with  wax paper and microwave on HIGH 1 minute.  </P> <P> Drain vegetable liquid into sauce, whisk until smooth, pour over vegetables and  toss lightly. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Variation: For Warm Snow Pea, Mushroom and Red Pepper Salad With Ginger-Honey  Dressing, cook red pepper, green onions and garlic in oil as directed, then  toss with 1 cup halved raw button mushrooms. Set aside.  </P> <P> Microwave 1/2 pound snow peas as directed, but without seasoning. Drain and set  aside.  </P> <P> Beat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil with 1 tablespoon white vinegar, 2 teaspoons  honey, 1/2 teaspoon crushed ginger root, 1/2 teaspoon crushed garlic, 1/4  teaspoon salt and dash red pepper flakes in small bowl. Spoon 1/2 dressing over  pepper mixture and toss. Pour remaining dressing over peas.  </P> <P> Mound red pepper mixture in center of round platter and arrange peas around  pepper mixture. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.  </P></p>

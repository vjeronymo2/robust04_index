			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Arts: Ballet music reborn - Clement Crisp recommends some new recordings of old favourites 'Whatever the excellence of his other works, Tchaikovsky never surpassed The Sleeping Beauty.' So writes Roland John Wiley in his magisterial study of the composer's three ballet-scores. It is a statement calculated to give pause to devotees of the operas and symphonies, but a study of Beauty's music will show with what theatrical power and melodic prodigality Tchaikovsky transformed a genre that had previously been un-considered and unimportant. With him, and with Delibes and Lalo and Glazunov, music for dancing became glorious in the 19th century. Beauty's score, indeed, transcends the theatre, presenting us with a metaphor as potent as classical dancing itself for a formal elegance that is an ideal of noble behaviour. Listening to the music, and watching Petipa's choreography - in a responsible production - we see the apotheosis of 19th century ballet. The fruit of a courtly society attendant upon the absolute monarchy of Tsar Alexander III, paying homage to the earlier absolutism of Louis XIV, Beauty is a supreme example of the aristocratic principle in art. A new issue of the complete Beauty comes from the orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre where the ballet had its first performance in 1890. ('Very nice' was the Tsar's depressing comment to Tchaikovsky at the repetition generale, and the composer noted this with five exclamation marks in his diary). The performance is issued by Philips on 3 CDs: 434 923/4/5 - 2, with the curiously named Kirov Orchestra, St. Petersburg conducted by Valery Gergiev. It is an interpretation which must claim our attention: it has a stylistic authority given by players who understand the music's traditions in the theatre of its birth. The text is complete. Small cuts are fascinatingly opened in Aurora's last act variation, in the entree of the grand pas de deux, and a significant passage is restored at the end of Act 2, when the spell of sleep has been lifted and the court awakens. This should be imposed upon every production: the usual helter-skelter closing of the scene - 'He's kissed her; she's awake; let's get on to the last act, pronto, then we shan't have to pay the orchestra over-time' - is an insult to Tchaikovsky, to Petipa, to the dancers, and the audience. Any truncating of this score, any jiggery-pokery by producers - and there have been truly despicable stagings in recent times- destroy the grace of Tchaikovsky's structure, which is clear to perceive as you listen to the ballet in its entirety, or watch it in the Mariinsky Theatre. With the Mariinsky orchestra much of the playing is beautiful - the symphonic interlude when the prince journeys to the castle is fine indeed - and there is implicit in every number an understanding of the music's life on stage, in tempo and dramatic feeling. Only the Prince's last act solo is taken at an unsuitable speed. I found Gergiev's handling of the score sympathetic. A few passages are somewhat deliberate - the Vision scene dances short on fantasy - but this is in the main a valuable issue. I do not understand, though, why Philips should produce so unworthy a booklet to accompany it. John Warrack's English-language commentary is excellent, but the French note has its curious moments, and the illustrations are provocatively bad. The cover photograph is a fuzzy shot of two dancers rehearsing, wearing practice dress and ectoplasm, while the CD cover boasts a dull snap of an awkwardly posed danseuse, a negation of everything Beauty means in the theatre. Tchaikovsky is shown to us as he was in 1868 (so helpful), and there is an unidentified picture of the Mariinsky Theatre. Nothing relates with any sense to Beauty, nor to its traditions in Petersburg. Another important but too-often ignored dance score of the period is Edouard Lalo's Namouna. It is irresistible music, first heard at the Paris Opera in 1882, when it was staged by Marius Petipa's elder brother, Lucien, a notable dancer but less known as a choreographer. Namouna's plot was a thin incident about a young lord who gambles away his favourite slave to another nobleman, and its interest lay in the potential for local colour of its setting on Corfu. Given the enfeebled state of French ballet by the 1880s, it is small wonder that the ballet did not survive, but the score has always had its aficionados. That it is still known is partly due to Serge Lifar, who made his Suite en blanc for the Paris Opera dancers during the dark days of the German Occupation. He used Lalo's own two orchestral suites from the ballet, and we can still see Suite en blanc today, an exhilarating blaze of plotless virtuosity, buoyed up on the score's driving rhythms and piquant, witty melodies. A new recording of Namouna (Valois: V 4677) comes from Valois/Musique Francaise/ Biennale de Lyon, a collection dedicated to the promotion of French music from 1790-1950. The performance is by the Orchestra Philharmonique de Monte Carlo under David Robertson, and the disc comprises Lalo's two orchestral suites (the numbers positioned in their proper order in the full score) and four additional items, with the opening of a large cut in the delicious 'Valse de la cigarette'. (Namouna rolled and smoked a cigarette on stage at this moment. Gasps from the stalls.) It is music I adore, for its vivid sonorities, its charm, and its adventurousness, and it is very respectably performed. A comparison with Jean Martinon's 1971 recording of the suites with the Orchestre National de l'ORTF, shows him marginally lighter in touch, but this is an interpretation that everywhere respects Lalo's music. I cannot admire the turgid programme notes provided: why cannot record companies give us well-written - and well-illustrated - booklets? As a look back to an earlier manner of ballet music, Richard Bonynge and the English Chamber Orchestra offer a two CD recording (Decca: 439.286-2) of Le Corsaire as it was given at the Paris Opera in 1867. Forget almost everything you might have heard in the Kirov Ballet's version of this merry old romp: that score is a ratatouille owed to at least five composers. This issue offers an editing of the ballet's original (1856) text by Adolphe Adam, with the addition of Delibes' mellifluous Pas des fleurs. Adam's writing is eloquent, speaking the theatrical language of his time with a lot of charm. Delibes' contribution is pretty as can be: we can already hear the genius that was to give us the miracles of Coppelia and Sylvia. The whole thing is something of a curiosity, but Bonynge loves such music, and it is fetchingly done. There are excellent programme notes from Ivor Guest. But why does Decca not provide illustrations of Corsaire, and let the listener see something of the theatrical marvels that made, and continue to make, this dear old ballet so popular?</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: JP Morgan invests in China capital fund JP MORGAN, the US investment bank, plans to set up a China fund to invest in Chinese enterprises with emphasis on the energy, telecommunications and food processing sectors. Mr Weijian Shan, vice-president of corporate finance, said JP Morgan aimed to mobilise funds to 'help China's economic development, and help our foreign clients seek new investment opportunities at the same time'. Mr Shan said the bank would establish representative offices in Beijing and Shanghai within the next few months to help spearhead its drive into China which is 'gripped by a capital shortage'. JP Morgan's decision to focus on China investments is part of an accelerating trend among US institutions, which are beginning to take developments in the Chinese economy more seriously. Mr Shan predicted that Chinese organisations would raise up to Dollars 1.2bn in the US capital markets over the next 18 months and that at least half would be in Yankee bonds. BankAmerica has reached agreement to sell troubled commercial property loans with a face value of Dollars 340m in a further sign that demand for distressed property assets is picking up, writes Richard Waters in New York. The sale, to an investor group formed by Goldman Sachs, will take the bank's disposal of troubled assets to nearly Dollars 3bn over the past year. BankAmerica would not reveal the terms of the latest deal but said it expected to sell the loans at above their written-down value. Most were classed as 'assets pending disposition', a category with a written-down value of Dollars 668m at the end of September, down from Dollars 3.35bn the year before.</p>

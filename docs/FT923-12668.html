			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (25): Three trusts fail to reach their targets - A guide to the information about trusts that is published each day in the FT / Investment Trusts INVESTMENT TRUSTS have shown unexpected signs of life over the past three months. Analysts had expected a slowdown in launches, while the big management companies digested the money they had taken in at the end of the last tax year, but it has not happened like that. Four companies went to the market to raise funds via investment trusts. The most ambitious offering was Thornton's, which in June raised Pounds 35.5m for its European Smaller Companies investment trust. The country-specific fund management and stock-picking will be shared by Thornton in London, BNP in France, and Dresdner in Germany, while asset allocation will be determined using a newly constructed index. Thornton chose a simple capital structure - just ordinary shares, with warrants attached on a one-for-five basis. Henderson's European investment trust offered 25 per cent of its share capital in zero-dividend preference shares. Henderson's offer raised Pounds 17.3m, and chose blue-chip stocks rather than smaller companies. Edinburgh Fund Managers decided that the heavy falls on the Tokyo stock exchange earlier this year meant the time was now right to launch a Japanese general investment trust. EFM Japan raised Pounds 10m, with warrants attached on a one-for-five basis. None of these trusts raised its target. All were hit by gloom surrounding the new issues market. Kleinwort Benson offered a rather complicated trust to invest in the newly developing market in secondhand endowment policies. It has a fixed life of 11 years, and the underlying investments are generally regarded as secure enough for the trust's shares to be regarded as 'quasi-zeros'. See also What's New? - Page 12</p>

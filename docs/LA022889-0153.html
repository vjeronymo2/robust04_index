			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GOP SENATOR URGES TOWER TO EXIT; BUSH MINING VOTES;  </P> <P> PRESSLER EXPRESSES CONCERNS  </P> <P> The Administration's efforts to salvage John Tower's nomination as defense  secretary suffered a setback today when Republican Sen. Larry Pressler of South  Dakota announced that he was "very much leaning against" confirmation and urged  Tower to withdraw before a vote.  </P> <P> The President, meanwhile, launched a full-court press, meeting privately with a  dozen swing Democrats and wavering Republicans in hopes of persuading them to  back Tower.  </P> <P> Pressler said he was fearful that Tower would not be capable of cleaning up the  Pentagon procurement system if confirmed and said he should withdraw.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Do Bush a 'Favor'  </P> <P> "I think that (by withdrawing) he may very well be doing him (Bush) a favor in  this case," Pressler said.  </P> <P> White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that there was "no chance  whatsoever" of the President withdrawing the nomination.  </P> <P> "We're going to fight it out as far as we can. We've convinced a lot of  senators, and we hope to convince a lot more," said Fitzwater, who refused to  specify what senators had been won over.  </P> <P> With Democrats holding a 55-45 majority in the Senate, Republicans can  ill-afford any defections from their own ranks if Bush is to prevail in the  first high-stakes political showdown of his 5-week-old presidency.  </P> <P> Formal debate on the nomination is scheduled to open Wednesday, and senators  are reading a confidential FBI report on the former Texas senator's drinking  habits, charges of womanizing and lucrative consulting contracts with military  companies.  </P> <P> Bush invited several Democrats and Republicans to the White House for a series  of one-on-one meetings to discuss the nomination.  </P> <P> Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who has not announced his  position, did not talk with reporters as he left the White House. Sen. J. James  Exon (D-Neb.) has said he expected Mitchell will oppose the nomination, which  has failed thus far to attract the public support of any Democratic senator.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Early Morning Meetings  </P> <P> The President held early morning meetings with Sens. John B. Breaux (D-La.), J.  Bennett Johnston (D-La.) and Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.).  </P> <P> Bush also scheduled individual meetings with Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), the  ranking GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Sens. Charles S.  Robb (D-Va.), Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) and Bill Bradley (D-N.J.).  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle told a hastily called news conference that he  believes that all 45 Republican senators, including Pressler, will vote for  Tower. If five Democrats can be persuaded to vote for Tower, that would allow  Quayle to cast the decisive, tie-breaking vote for the nominee.  </P> <P> Later today, Bush said he did not know whether he could win over senators who  have indicated opposition to Tower, saying only that "I hope so."  </P> <P> But with Tower sitting on his left in the Cabinet Room, the President said he  had not heard anyone "challenge this man's knowledge and his ability."  </P> <P> "He's the best to do the job that needs to be done," Bush said.  </P></p>

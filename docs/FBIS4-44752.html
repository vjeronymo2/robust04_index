			<p>CSO     [Text] Experts credit to microsystem technology no  less of a key position than to microelectronics. Germany is  taking a lead with its research facilities, and great  possibilities are also opening up for industry. Small and  medium-sized companies, however, are still experiencing serious  problems in developing marketable products.    "Microsystem technology constitutes an expansion of  microelectronics," Prof. Dr. Anton Heuberger emphasized at the  presentation of the BMFT's [Federal Ministry of Research and  Technology] promotional program "Microsystem Technology" on  February 18th in Sankt Augustin, "which will achieve a key  importance still in this century similar to that of  microelectronics today." The director of the Berlin Fraunhofer  Institute for Silicon Technology (ISiT) is confident that this  key technology which has the goal of "integrating  microelectronic and other functions such as optical,  electromagnetic, mechanical, chemical and even biological into  one miniaturized solid state system" holds great importance for  German industry. "Germany's prospects and qualifications in  microsystem technology are incomparably better than in  microelectronics."    The initiative in microsystem technology "has led to an  extremely substantial and broad research infrastructure in  Germany," which for Heuberger is "a very good fundamental basis  for industrial development." Now care must be taken that  national support does not get pushed toward basic research but  instead fully demands the relevance [of such research] to  industry. Production technology and system reliability also  continue to be decisive factors and "not only [whether] new  systems are feasible in principle." Also required are a  consolidation of themes and leadership in industry. However,  "the early support of industry also produced a significant level  [of work] here, in comparison with other countries, which after  the initial difficulties culminated in a fruitful coexistence of  large and small industry." And industrial sectors such as  automotive technology, telecommunications, medical technology or  metrology and control engineering, "which are particularly  dependent on microsystem technology," are well represented in  Germany as well as in Europe.    The victory is far from won, however. The Fraunhofer  director  referred to the example of Japan with its "micromachining"  successor program, where the greatest potential danger lurks.  "The entire program is carried out there in large industry as a  supplement to microelectronics, which is already strong there as  it is." Heuberger's fear is that the Japanese could begin  product development earlier and more consistently. Nothing is  yet decided, but the problems which are still to be solved by  the German initiative in microsystem technology "are  incomparably more difficult than those in microelectronics,  where we have already not solved the problems." Also the  European JESSI [Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative]  program "does not cover important methods and technologies of  system integration and system technology because of its  concentrated focus, desired by industry, on memory or storage  technology." The weakest aspect is the software: without  elaborate software simulation systems and design tools, which  are not on the market yet, there can be no industrial production  of microsystems. "If we do not succeed at least in building up  and sustaining an industrial software supplier and in not having  to buy system software from the USA as we have done, it is all  pointless," Heuberger warns.    However, microsystem technology still offers great  opportunities, also and specifically for small and medium-sized  industry in Germany. As Helmut Hund, director of the sensor  production company of the same name in Wetzlar, emphasizes:  "Usually, the manufacturing processes of semiconductor  technology are not accessible to companies of this size." For  companies of between 20 and 1,000 employees doing business of  between a few and several hundred million German marks, it has  been nearly impossible up to now to get into technologies like  design and simulation, lithography, wet and plasma etching  technology, or coating and testing technology.    The situation is completely different in microsystem  technology, with small volumes of a few thousand units. No  longer do smaller structural dimensions or larger and more  complicated memory determine the level of innovation in  microsystem technology, as is the case in semiconductor  technology; [innovation] is instead determined by the  intelligent combination of various technologies in the areas of  micromechanics, application specific IC design and sensor  construction. "Small-scale manufacture combined with relatively  economical manufacturing processes offer small and medium-sized  businesses an ideal opportunity against the large companies. It  offers an opportunity because the price pressure is no where  near as great as with the semiconductor standard components."    There are also hidden risks in microsystem technology,  however. "The wildest chip ideas come to nothing if the  corresponding products are not [as written] lacking which can be  used in industrial and everyday life." The practical Hund sees  Germany's biggest current problem here. "In every possible  presentation and in the technical journals there is talk of  insulin pumps, of miniature robots and of micromechanical drive  systems," Helmut Hund says mockingly, "but sales are not yet  being made with products containing these components." Small and  medium-sized businesses are demanding support not only for  technologies but also for the development and marking of new  products.    As a man of experience, Helmut Hund knows first-hand the  problems of small and medium-sized businesses. "No small or  medium-sized business has the financial resources to reserve all  the hardware for microsystem technology alone." His credo is,  therefore, not to make everything alone but rather for small and  medium-sized businesses to work together from cooperative  research to realization of the product, a concept for which Hund  has coined the term cooperative technology. Hund the business  man grew up in the country and knows what he is talking about:  "Many farmers could only buy a harvester together which they  would have been unable to afford individually." However, large  companies, too, should make use of joint solutions with small  and medium-sized businesses. Hund: "Then the call for a German  MITI [(Japanese) Ministry of International Trade and Industry]  or similar institution would no longer be necessary."    Big business, meanwhile, emphasizes its leadership role.  "For  rapid industrial development and the use of microsystem  technology in new products, some mass markets will probably be  essential at first in which unit price is low and high unit  numbers of elements, sensors, actuators and components are used,  such as in automobile technology or domestic and home appliance  technology"--of this Dr. Horst Schmidt-Bischoffshausen from  research and technology at Daimler-Benz AG in Munich is certain.  Accelerator sensors for airbags or rpm and torque sensors for  controlling ABS and powertrains are examples of current mass  production of microsystems at the element level.

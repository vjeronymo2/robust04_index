			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET REFUGEES EXPECTED TO BYPASS ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> Representatives of agencies that help Soviet refugees learn English and find  jobs said Friday that they are bracing for a dramatic increase in the number of  new immigrants moving to the Southland in the next year as a result of the  Soviet Union's perestroika policy.  </P> <P> The projected increase in Soviet immigrants to the United States, mostly Jewish  and Armenian -- from fewer than 800 in 1986 to as many as 150,000 from now to  the end of 1990 -- comes as Congress considers cuts in refugee assistance  programs in its 1989-90 fiscal budget, according to testimony Friday before a  state legislative committee on refugee resettlement.  </P> <P> "The strain of additional refugees is one that we welcome, something that we  have been working toward for years," said Wayne Feinstein, vice president of  the Jewish Federation Council in Los Angeles. "But we've had a steady flow in  the past and we are not prepared for the gates of the Soviet Union to open as  wide as they have."  </P> <P> Of the surge of Soviet emigres, Orange County is expecting only about 100 Jews  from the Soviet Union, said Chelle Friedman, a spokeswoman for the Jewish  Federation of Orange County.  </P> <P> "There's no real center of Jewish population in Orange County, so many don't  even think about coming here," Friedman said. Most new immigrants head for Los  Angeles, she said. Still, about 100,000 Jews live in Orange County, Friedman  said.  </P> <P> Armenians leaving the Soviet Union face the same in Orange County: There is no  central community, said John Kossakian, general manager of The Armenian  Reporter in Glendale, where many newly arrived Armenians find a home upon  arriving in Southern California.  </P> <P> "Most of the immigrants have friends and relatives in Hollywood or Glendale,"  Kossakian said. He said he expects only a small number to move to Orange  County, where there are only about 20,000 Armenians, he said.  </P> <P> Feinstein said the Jewish Federation Council and its affiliates will spend  about $20 million next year in public and private funds to assist Soviet  refugees with counseling, medical care, education and job training.  </P> <P> The council expects to help about 5,000 Soviet refugees next year, compared to  1,800 this year, said Sandra King, executive director of the Los Angeles Jewish  Family Services.  </P> <P> More than 100,000 Soviet immigrants could arrive in the United States in 1990,  said Gregory Makaron, president of the Los Angeles Assn. of Soviet Jewish  Emigres and himself a former refusenik.  </P> <P> Since 1987, most Soviet Armenians and about 10% of the Soviet Jews coming to  the United States have settled in Los Angeles County, county officials said.  Under its reform program, Moscow has taken away many restrictions against  moving to the United States.  </P></p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (11): Civil work increases thrust - Aerospace: mixed forecasts for 1991 MORE than 50 of the world's leading aerospace groups can be found in Singapore. Companies such as France's Aerospatiale are competing alongside GE Aviation Services, Sunstrand, and United Technologies for a piece of the Asia-Pacific action, a market expected to provide the most business in the next 20 years. The industry in Singapore is projected to hit the SDollars 2bn mark by 1995 after expanding20 per cent to SDollars 1.2bn last year. However, there are mixed forecasts for 1991. The Economic Development Board, which garners investments for Singapore, attributed the 1990 performance (which does not include military production) of the aerospace industry to the continued strong performance in commercial and civilian production, and to support services. However, it added that competition from aerospace industries in the region, such as Aerospatiale's planned regionalaircraft-servicing centre in Thailand, is expected to slow growth this year. Aerospatiale's policy to increase co-operation wherever local authorities agree has led to, or the consideration of, ventures in Singapore, Malaysia, and north-east Asia. The European consortium sees opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region from the expected continuation of the strong Asean economic growth, and the smaller decreases in Asian military spending in contrast to the West. Its focus, following industry trends, will be more towards civilian work. The French-based Airbus Industrie forecasts that in the next 20 years, there will be ademand for more than 10,000 aircraft. It says it will get a minimum 30 per centmarket share; and that Asia-Pacific airlines will become the main customers, placing orders for 6 out of every 10 planes as greater traffic flows into the region help it to register the high growth rates. Airbus should know - its new orders are entirely from Asia from clients such as Cathay Pacific and Malaysian Airlines. It adds that, for the first time in history, Asia-Pacific airlines,not European or US carriers, will have enough clout to become the main thrust for a completely new commercial aircraft type, more likely to be wide-bodied and capable of carrying 600-800 passengers for long hauls. Such forecasts could not have come at a better time for Singapore, which aspires to become a leading component centre for multinationals, a service support centre for American and European aerospace and aircraft-related companies and a leading manufacturing and business centre for aviation-related activities. Less than 15 companies are certified by the Federal Aviation Authority to carry out third party Section 41 modifications. Two are from Singapore Airlines and Singapore Aerospace (SAe). Such work, one of the fastest-growing activities as more stringent safety requirements are set, is on the area from a jet's nose to the edge of the tubularsection. SAe has a competitive advantage over most rivals with its quality work (90 per cent of its 2,000 staff are skilled) and fast turnaround time of31 days to carry out Section 41 repairs against Hong Kong-based Haeco's 36 days. The lack of hangars large enough to accommodate 747s prevents SAe accepting more orders. This is a problem that will be resolved by next year when a double bay hangar is completed. Turnover has risen 17 per cent above its projected SDollars 200mfor last year, lifting operating profit 33 per cent higher than 1989 to SDollars 18.6m. SAe agrees with an ICAO forecast that passenger traffic and cargo will rise in the Asia-Pacific region to outstrip Europe. Singapore is too small a country to design, manufacture and sell its own aircraft but it does development work on prototypes. Using its skills honed over the past 15 years, it has a 16 per cent stake in a SDollars 305m tripartite venture to build and market a light five-seater helicopter for the Asia-Pacific region called the P120L. Its partners are Aerospatiale (54 per cent) and the China National Aero-Technology Import &amp; Export Corporation (Catic), with 30 per cent. New composite materials will be used for the body of the plane, seen as a successor to the Gazelleand Lama and complementing the Ecureuil. The P120L prototype will be ready in 1996, with 1,500 to 1,800 units being produced over 10 years. SAe is involved in the conceptual phase, the making of the prototype, producing certain parts, and marketing, while production will be carried out in China, which is expected to be one of the biggest markets with a shopping list for 200 helicopters. SAe has long had a joint venture with Aerospatiale in Samaero, which is responsible for its helicopters flying in Asia. The company will continue its thrust into the commercial wide-bodied aircraft maintenance market with its new facility in Alabama, US, and joint ventures in the UK and Ireland. Defence-related work, mostly from its mainstay, the republic's air force, will stillbe important, but SAe's increasing commercial activities (comprising 30 per cent of the business) is expected to fuel growth. Its customers include the US forces, Kuwait Airways and the Nigerian Air Force. Sembawang, another state-controlled company, is looking at aviation as the next core business to diversify from its main shipbuilding and repairing business so as not to have its earningscycle dictated by the fortunes of primarily one industry. Sembawang is in a joint venture with Catic, using its marketing and sales capability to sell Chinese aircraft in the Asia-Pacific. Catic produces a competitive aircraft - the Y12, which was certified by the British Civil Aviation Authority. Sembawang's other aviation joint ventures are in Sembawang Hainan Airline Tour and Aviation Services, and Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing.</p>

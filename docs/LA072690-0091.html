			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: DUARTE;  </P> <P> FEE FOR PROCESSING PETITIONS  </P> <P> Processing initiative petitions will cost $50 under a resolution adopted by the  City Council to discourage frivolous petitions.  </P> <P> The resolution, approved Tuesday night, says the fee will be refunded if the  city clerk certifies within a year that the petition has been filed.  </P> <P> Council members John Hitt and James Kirchner, who voted against the measure,  said the fee would infringe on the democratic process by putting a heavier  burden on the poor.  </P> <P> The majority of the council, however, said a fee would deter those who, for  example, process several petitions and file none, causing city staff wasted  time and effort.  </P></p>

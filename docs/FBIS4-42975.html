			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has declared that nothing  has been achieved yet with regard to the confidence-building  measures [CBM] package because the United Nations is  continuously making new demands on the Turkish Cypriot side.  Denktas said that from the beginning, UN officials, who are  preoccupied with petty issues, have been trying to deny the  Turkish Cypriots their interests, as well as some of their  requests, based on psychological reasons.    Denktas received Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's  assistant special envoy in Cyprus, this afternoon and discussed  the latest developments concerning the CBM package. In a  statement after the meeting, which lasted approximately one and  one-half hours, Denktas said that he conveyed to Feissel  information concerning the text of the Vienna agreements, which  the Turkish Cypriot side sent to the UN Secretariat General with  a view to incorporating it into the 21 March document.    The president explained that the Turkish Cypriot side went a  long way and made significant concessions in order to reach an  agreement and showed great flexibility with the aim of  concretizing the rights and freedoms promised to the Turkish  Cypriots. Despite this, Denktas remarked, nothing has been  achieved, and the Turkish Cypriot side is continuously being  presented with new demands.    Pointing out that Greek Cypriot Administration leader  Kliridhis' real concern is to avoid any additions to the 21  March document, Denktas noted that the UN officials are acting  in line with the wishes of the Greek Cypriot leader. The  president stressed that the Turkish Cypriot side does not intend  to succumb to all the demands of the United Nations, reiterating  that all the negative developments stem from the fact that the  United Nations recognizes the Greek Cypriot side as the  legitimate government of Cyprus. Denktas added that not only is  the United Nations making continuous demands on the Turkish  Cypriot side, it is also unjustly holding the Turkish Cypriot  side responsible for any problems.    In reply to a question, Denktas explained that Feissel will  relay the information he received from the Turkish Cypriot side  to New York and that a report may be submitted to the UN  Security Council.    Feissel, in turn, refrained from answering any questions  after the meeting, merely saying that he will convey the  requests of the Turkish Cypriot side to the UN secretary  general. Feissel remarked that the issue of access to Maras  [Varosha] was also discussed during the meeting, which he  described as a continuation of yesterday's talks.</p>

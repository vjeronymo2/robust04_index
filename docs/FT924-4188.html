			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Japanese brokers in plea over status JAPAN'S much-mocked securities analysts have pleaded to be taken as seriously as their counterparts in Europe and the US, and asked that employers no longer force them to change unwelcome 'sell' recommendations. The plea from the Conference for Securities Associations follows a survey of 2,024 Japanese analysts at brokerages and other financial institutions, 79.8 per cent of whom felt that they have a lower status in society than European and US analysts have in their home countries. 'We want to establish an environment in which analysts are more highly respected,' the securities body said, suggesting the speculative excess of the 1980s has caused investors to doubt brokers' integrity. Japanese analysts' reputations have suffered because of the reluctance to issue a 'sell' recommendation. Analysts are also under pressure not to deviate from a company's forecast profits, the securities body said, as 'they would be criticised by officials in the underwriting department'. The survey, conducted by the Security Analysts' Association of Japan, discovered analysts are often torn between pride in their profession and loyalty to their company. About 63 per cent of surveyed analysts 'compromise' with their employer in preparing a recommendation. A mere 14 per cent said they had 'no friction' within their institution in preparing reports, while only 21.3 per cent said they had 'no friction' with outside companies, presumably those about which reports are being prepared. Mr Yoshikatsu Sato, director of the Security Analysts' Association, said the credibility of the profession was harmed by the common Japanese corporate practice of staff rotation. 'We would like analysts to be to be regarded as professionals, and it does not help if they are transferred after a short period,' he said. Nomura to shed jobs, Page 28</p>

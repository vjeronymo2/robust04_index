			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Joker in central Europe's pack: But a change of image could spring from Slovakia's election Privatisation and the personality of Mr Vladimir Meciar, the first prime minister of independent Slovakia, are emerging as the key issues in the Slovak general election campaign which began this week. For the next three weeks voters face a highly personalised campaign in which Mr Meciar will use all his populist charisma to wrest back the power which he lost six months ago after steering an increasingly erratic path through the first 15 months of Slovak independence. While the neighbouring Czech Republic forged ahead with mass privatisation in 1993, Mr Meciar delayed privatisation for months only to push through hurriedly a series of controversial deals in his last days in office which opponents claim benefited close political supporters. Mr Eduard Kukan, foreign minister in the outgoing coalition government headed by Mr Jozef Moravcik, says that at least 45 such deals were secretly agreed 'literally in the last hours' of Mr Meciar's administration. Several were subsequently revoked by Mr Moravcik's government. As the election campaign officially got under way this week the government was embarrassed by failure to finalise the details of its privatisation programme. But ministers and supporters continue to argue strongly that without successful mass privatisation Slovakia will never throw off its image as the joker in the central European pack. 'People want voucher privatisation, they like it,' says Ms Brigitta Schmognerova, a deputy prime minister in the outgoing government. As evidence she points across the border to the Czech Republic, where close identification with voucher privatisation helped secure the re-election of Mr Vaclav Klaus in June 1992 and helped create one of the strongest emerging European economies. Mr Meciar does not agree. He said last week that if he was returned to power at the head of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) he would scrap the government's voucher privatisation programme and 'start all over again'. The outgoing government - a delicately balanced coalition of five parties, ranging from the former communists of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) to the veteran centrists of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) - wants to prevent him from doing so. But Mr Meciar's threat is serious, and his words are carefully aimed at his large constituency of mainly rural and small-town voters who believe that privatisation is merely a way for politicians to enrich themselves. With considerable skill Mr Meciar, who likes to portray himself as the battling underdog, pours scorn on opponents who claim that this is precisely what happened with his own last-minute and secretive privatisation deals. The HZDS has clearly entered the campaign as the best-funded as well as the biggest of the 18 parties and coalition groups contesting and Mr Meciar's image as the architect of independence is still a vote-winner. The party leads in the opinion polls, and could win up to 32 per cent of parliament's 150 seats. But the prospect of another Meciar government is unsettling many investors, both local and foreign, who have declared an investment interest but are keeping their money in the bank until after the election. 'Interesting things are happening here but everything hangs on the election results,' the chairman of Robert Fleming's Czech and Slovak investment fund said last week. Even if the HZDS does re-emerge as the largest single party, however, Mr Meciar, who finds it hard to share or delegate power and has a record of personal and political clashes with former supporters and allies, could face considerable difficulty in finding coalition partners. Apart from various fringe nationalist groups his most obvious allies are in the former communist SDL. But the SDL is split internally between its social democratic wing associated with Mr Peter Weiss, the youthful SDL leader who is no friend of Mr Meciar, and the old corporatist wing. The latter works closely with the HZDS in rural areas and may steer the party towards the HZDS to retain its hold on power. Mr Weiss steered his party into the coalition which deposed Mr Meciar but diplomats in Bratislava believe that 'the SDL is willing to jump either way'. If this prediction proves accurate months of negotiations could take place before a government is formed.</p>

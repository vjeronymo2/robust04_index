			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TARNISHED' LAPD SEEKS OUTSIDE CHECK OF CRIME LABORATORY  </P> <P> Saying the Los Angeles Police Department's reputation "has to be tarnished," a  highly placed department source said Tuesday that police officials have decided  to seek an outside review of its crime laboratory to determine how it  apparently bungled the ballistics tests that led to the arrest of a Los Angeles  County sheriff's deputy.  </P> <P> The review will be proposed today to Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who was out  of town Tuesday, the source said. Gates' top lieutenants are prepared to ask  him to approve bringing in outside experts, possibly from the FBI and Caltech's  Jet Propulsion Laboratory, "to see if the lab is functioning 100%," the source  said.  </P> <P> Included in the review will be the expertise of the personnel who conduct  ballistics tests, the source said.  </P> <P> "The reputation (of the LAPD) has to be tarnished" after the stunning dismissal  Monday of murder charges against Rickey Ross, said the source, who spoke on the  condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Above Reproach'  </P> <P> "I am willing to do anything to re-establish its reputation," the source said.  "If (the LAPD) is going to be a professional police department, it has to be  above reproach."  </P> <P> Ross, 40, an 18-year Sheriff's Department veteran investigator, was accused  earlier this year of slaying three South-Central prostitutes with his service  handgun. Based on findings by LAPD crime lab forensic experts, Chief Gates and  Sheriff Sherman Block told a press conference last February that Ross had been  arrested for the murders.  </P> <P> But two subsequent tests on Ross' 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol by  independent ballistics experts from Northern California concluded that it did  not fire the fatal bullets.  </P> <P> Neither Gates nor Block commented publicly on the Ross case Tuesday.  </P> <P> After his arrest, Ross was dismissed and sheriff's officials have not commented  when asked if he is to be reinstated. Prosecutors continue to describe him as a  "suspect."  </P> <P> Ranking Los Angeles County sheriff's officials said Tuesday that, as upset as  they and many of their colleagues are over the LAPD's handling of the Ross  case, they do not believe that it will lead to any enduring animosity between  the region's two biggest law enforcement agencies.  </P> <P> "I don't expect open hostility between officers," said one sheriff's official,  who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But caution will be exhibited in our  dealings with them, at least for a while."  </P> <P> But it was obvious that some sheriff's officials were attempting to restrain  themselves.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Tough to Believe'  </P> <P> "It's tough to believe that this happened," said a sheriff's source, who asked  that he not be named. "It may have been a good-faith, honest error. Any rush to  judgment is wrong. We're brothers in uniform."  </P> <P> Another sheriff's official raised questions about the ballistics testing  itself.  </P> <P> "There are major questions about their handling of the ballistics test," said  the official in reference to the examination of the alleged murder weapon by  LAPD Officer James M. Fountain and Detective Jimmy L. Trahin.  </P> <P> "Can we see the photos of the testing when the gun was originally tested?" the  official asked. "Did they have somebody incompetent doing the test or was there  tampering? Do the recent (ballistics) photos look the same as the originals? If  they do, why would they say now that it doesn't match?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Case 'Still Unfolding'  </P> <P> An LAPD spokesman, Lt. Fred Nixon, said he could not answer these questions  because the Ross case is "still unfolding."  </P> <P> But Nixon said he had "no concerns" about the future relationship between the  Sheriff's Department and the LAPD. "We're talking about a couple of great  organizations and the relationship is in no jeopardy," he said.  </P> <P> Although not as sensational as the Ross case, tempers did flare between the two  law enforcement agencies less than two years ago over the mistaken arrest of  two sheriff's deputies by two LAPD patrolmen.  </P> <P> The two sheriff's deputies, in full uniform in an unmarked car, were hunting a  cat burglar in Carson in September, 1987 -- inside the sheriff's jurisdiction  -- when they were ordered out of their car at gunpoint at 1 a.m. by the two  LAPD officers. The deputies were then forced to lie face-down in the street  until backup help arrived.  </P> <P> The two LAPD officers said their actions were triggered by reports of police  impersonators robbing illegal aliens in the area. Both officers were suspended  without pay by Gates, one for 10 days, the other for five days, after a Board  of Rights hearing.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies expressed outrage at the embarrassment of two of their own  -- and retaliation was immediate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Women Prisoners  </P> <P> For about a week after the incident, the Carson sheriff's station would not  accept women prisoners brought in by Los Angeles police officers -- forcing  LAPD personnel to drive 15 miles away, to the Sybil Brand Institute, to drop  off prisoners.  </P> <P> And a cartoon lampooning the LAPD appeared in the sheriff's monthly in-house  newsletter, the Star News, depicting a sheriff's sergeant speaking at roll  call. "One last briefing item," the sergeant says. "Some LAPD units have been  seen in our area, so let's all be careful out there."  </P></p>

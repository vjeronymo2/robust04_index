			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Economy crucial to Bush hopes PRESIDENT George Bush's chances of re-election in November would be significantly improved only by an economic turnround, according to a national opinion poll published yesterday, Reuter reports from Boston. The poll, conducted for the Boston Globe newspaper, found that if the US presidential election were held today, Democratic nominee Bill Clinton and his running-mate, Senator Al Gore, would beat Mr Bush and Vice-President Dan Quayle by 56 to 32 per cent of the vote. But almost a third of those polled said they would be more likely to vote for Mr Bush if the economy improved. The survey found that one in five Republican voters would like Mr Bush to step down. His overall job-approval rating was 31 per cent; at the Gulf war's end last year this soared to 90 per cent. But even ousting Iraq's President Saddam Hussein would now have no effect on 76 per cent of respondents. A second opinion poll, conducted by the University of Houston Centre for Public Policy, also found that Mr Clinton had a 43-29 per cent lead over the president in Mr Bush's adopted home state of Texas.

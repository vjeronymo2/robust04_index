			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 11 TASS -- "The Azeri side is fully  responsible for the non-fulfilment of the protocol on  termination of combat operations and troops withdrawal signed on  February 18 in Moscow by the Armenian and Azeri defence  ministers and the Karabakh military representative with  participation of the Russian defence minister," Armenian  permanent representative to Russia Felix Mamikonyan told a news  conference here today.    Despite the fact the document was signed by all the sides,  the Azeri side considered its fulfilment impossible and is  making new terms.    In the opinion of Mamikonyan, Azerbaijan keeps to the force  solution of the Karabakh conflict, which will claim more human  lives. The representative linked recent foreign visits of  Heydar Aliyev after signing of the Moscow protocol with an  attempt to "distance from Russia". He refuted Azeri mass media  reports claiming the protocol was signed under the pressure of  Pavel Grachev and described the Russian stand in the Karabakh  conflict as "restraint and well-balanced".    Asked by ITAR-TASS whether the Armenian side agrees to all  items of the protocol, Mamikonyan said it is a compromise  document but one shall fulfill it. He did not specify what  items are meant referring to the confidential character of the  protocol.    A day before Azeri Ambassador Plenipotentiary and  Extraordinary to Russia Ramiz Rizayev told a news conference in  Moscow about the Azeri stand on troops pullback at 15  kilometers. In the opinion of the Azeri side, the initial  pullback line should be the Karabakh administrative border  instead of the line of the sides' contact.    Mamikonyan said in this case Azerbaijan will bring its  troops  to the Karabakh border and Karabakh populated localities will be  in danger again due to the absence of the "security and  confidence mechanism".    Speaking of the Armenian troops withdrawal from seized  lands,  whose temporary control was explained by the representative with  military-strategic goals, Mamikonyan said this is impossible to  be done without political settlement. "If it is so easy to do  the Jews would have left the Golan Heights within a day", he  said.    Armenia stands for the introduction of peace-makers into the  conflict zone, however, it is more psychologically ready for the  introduction of Russian peace-makers, said the representative.    Speaking of the upcoming meeting of the Armenian and Azeri  presidents with the mediation of Boris Yeltsin, he said the  meeting should be well-prepared, but its date has not been  specified.    He confirmed that delegations of the Armenian and Azeri  parliaments will meet on the border on Saturday.</p>

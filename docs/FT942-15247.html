			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Inflation rate falls to 2.3%: Shares rally as sharp fall in underlying figure raises hopes for easier borrowing A sharp fall last month in Britain's annual rate of underlying inflation raised hopes yesterday that Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, might soon be able to cut interest rates. Speculation about a cut helped shares to rally, with the FT-SE 100 index rising 36.6 points to close at 3,168.3. The June long gilt future was up nearly a point. The underlying inflation rate, which excludes mortgage interest payments, fell to an annual 2.4 per cent in March from 2.8 per cent in February, according to the Central Statistical Office. The annual rate of increase is at its lowest level since the present reporting series began in 1975 and is thought by CSO statisticians to be lower than at any time since November 1967. Furthermore, underlying inflation is in the lower half of the government's target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent for the first time since that goal was set in October 1992. Analysts believe that the news on inflation, which followed disappointing numbers in February, is a necessary  - but not a sufficient  - condition for a rate cut. Bank base rates were cut in February by  1/4 point to 5.25 per cent. Minutes of monthly meetings between Mr Clarke and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, published this week, show that the two men agreed in early March that rates might be cut if inflation was under control and economic activity showed signs of weakness. Although the former has been achieved, recent economic statistics, such as manufacturing output figures, have been relatively buoyant. Next week's publication of retail sales and unemployment figures will therefore be scrutinised for signs of slowing activity. Speculation of a near-term cut in rates was increased yesterday when the Bank of England announced that its next auction of gilt-edged stock would have a short maturity. Short-dated gilts would be made more attractive by a rate cut. The headline rate of annual inflation fell only slightly to 2.3 per cent in March, from 2.4 per cent in February. The retail prices index rose 0.3 per cent between February and March, with rises in the prices of food, household goods and clothing being offset by declines in telephone charges and spectacle prices. April is likely to see a rise in the headline rate, as value added tax on fuel and the reduction in mortgage interest tax relief push up the index and last year's fall in local-government tax bills drops out of the comparison. The Bank said it would auction gilts with a maturity of between 1997 and 2001 on April 27. Details of the issue will be announced next Tuesday. The Bank is also adding Pounds 150m at 164 1/2 to an issue of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked bonds due 2011, and Pounds 100m at 116 5/16 to an issue of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked bonds due 2024.

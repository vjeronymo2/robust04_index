			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Sport: Two hard Tests - Rugby Union For England there is no respite. On Wednesday they were run close by Western Transvaal, a provincial union so isolated and backward in the larger scheme of things that its supporters proudly display giant flags of the old South Africa. England's tour of South Africa has so far proved a nasty shock to European sensibilities. Which flag is which? And what to make of the 11 official languages and the smell of cordite that follows them on to the rugby field. England are supposedly testing the water ahead of next year's World Cup in South Africa but they have hardly performed like potential world champions. Thrown off balance by the aggression of their South African opponents, they look vulnerable on the bone-hard playing surfaces of the high veld. Nor do the rarefied air and the awkward bounce of the ball make survival any easier. They lost their first two games, to Free State and Natal. On Wednesday, England looked no less tentative in their 26-24 victory over Western Transvaal. The one disruptive factor to which the English seem oblivious is the South African ploy of speaking Afrikaans, to obscure lineout and other signals. The language barrier may benefit Will Carling's charges. At least Victor Ubogu, having not yet mastered Afrikaans swear words, has been unfazed when singled out for verbal abuse. Physical abuse is another matter. England's expanding casualty list, caused chiefly by the hard ground, as much as their indifferent form, has convinced aficionados that their two-Test challenge has already collapsed. If Free State and Natal can dethorn the rose which such ease, surely South Africa will atomise them in the internationals. Two factors militate against this. Since its return to the world stage in 1992, South African rugby has been undermined by the very devices which ensured survival through two decades of isolation. The domestic Currie Cup competition has entrenched regional divisions to such an extent that forging a new national entity may take years. Hard evidence of the strength of provincial unions was provided by Transvaal's win in the inaugural southern hemisphere Super 10 title last year, crushing Auckland, from New Zealand, hitherto considered the best provincial team. Two weeks ago Natal contested the second Super 10 final (albeit unsuccessfully) against Queensland. The South African captain, Francois Pienaar, was quoted in Australia as saying that his provincial side, Transvaal, was a stronger unit than the Springboks. This triggered a public outcry. Pienaar claimed he had been misquoted, but whoever laid the words in his mouth was not far off the mark. Had Pienaar not hurt his ankle the quote would almost certainly have contributed to his losing the captaincy against England to fellow back row forward, Tiaan Strauss. The worst effect of the isolation era on the South African game has been an erosion of refereeing standards. The comfy cocoon of so-called South African invincibility was kept intact by officials badly out of step with world standards. This anomaly was exposed during the French tour to South Africa last season. Like England, the Tricolores were no great shakes in the build-up to the Tests, yet won the series 1-0, with a win and a draw. South Africa could not adapt to the sudden return to an international standard, applied by overseas referees in the Tests. I suspect England are awaiting the arrival of the New Zealand referee Colin Hawke with anticipation. But poor refereeing does not explain why England have been so lacklustre. Without the silky Jeremy Guscott, the backline appears wooden. Free State played an attacking game to good effect by running first phase ball wide. South Africa will also probe on the periphery, in part because they lack the lineout forwards to match England. South Africa's coach Ian Mclntosh, preoccupied with ball retention drills, has been criticised for neglecting running rugby and the natural flair of the South African three-quarters. England might be looking increasingly dilapidated but South Africa's final training session, with a bloated squad of 57 players, many of them injured, sought refuge at a 'secret' venue; a sure sign of panic. The Tests may turn on whether England can summon a heroic display from their overworked pack. If England win another tryless victory, their fans can find solace in the words of the late Boy Louw. Louw, one of South Africa's most versatile forwards in the 1920s and 30s, was a national team manager with a gift for the gab, if not for the English language. Berated by the media after his team won by kicking all its points, Louw shot back: 'Never mind. Just you looks at the scoreboard]'</p>

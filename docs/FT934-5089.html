			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Companies want action not words - Construction Construction companies faced with government spending cuts on roads and housing will need a lot of convincing that private investment in public infrastructure will come anywhere to making up the difference. The more cynical regarded the chancellor's support for private finance projects as little more than window dressing. Almost all of the schemes he announced in his Budget speech were already well known by the industry. The extension to Lewisham of the Docklands Light Railway, has been unveiled as part of 'new initiatives' three times in nine months by three separate government ministers. Mr Patrick De Pelet, head of project finance at Kleinwort Benson, yesterday welcomed the chancellor's encour-agement but said: 'What is needed at this stage is some action rather than words of reassurance.' The one piece of good news was that the government was now prepared to consider contracts which would enable investors in roads to be repaid by the Exchequer according to the level of traffic using the road. Ministers previously have rejected the use of so-called 'shadow tolls' in this way. The industry, however, will need to see details of how this might work before acclaiming it as a breakthrough. The Federation of Civil Engineers said last night that it was encouraged by the move. The experience of construction companies and bankers has been that there is a big difference between the government approving projects and actually agreeing terms acceptable to private sector investors. Of the 90-odd schemes, identified by ministerial departments as candidates for private investment, work has started on about only a dozen. These include projects such as the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee Line underground extension and the Pounds 135m Manchester Metrolink light rail system, both of which have been almost entirely funded by the public sector. The total invested in public infrastructure by the private sector is little more than Pounds 1bn - more than a decade after Tarmac proposed the first privately financed toll motorway in the West Midlands, a scheme which was eventually built by the public sector. The Treasury, following the scrapping of the restrictive Ryrie investment rules, has become much more receptive to private sector plans to invest in road, rail and other projects previously built by the public sector. The problem has been that many of the projects planned are not capable of being financed entirely by the private sector. Construction of the Channel tunnel rail link is likely to require a subsidy of Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.5bn according to potential bidders. A decision to grant the concession to the consortium demanding the lowest subsidy could rebound badly on the project if this subsequently ran out of money and had to be refinanced. Ministers for their part say that they must get the best value for money and that means allowing companies to bid in open competition. Measures are being considered, however, to protect companies which invest money and time in generating novel ideas for investment only to face the prospect of losing the work when it is put out to open tender. One leading contractor summed it up last night: 'I am convinced that ministers and the Treasury want to see private schemes proceed but they still have to come to terms that companies will expect to make a bigger return from risk investment than they have traditionally made from normal contracting.'</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Glasnost, Saudi style POLITICAL reform and Saudi Arabia are not words which normally trip off the tongue together. Oil revenues may have transformed the kingdom's economy over the past few decades with astonishing speed. But in political terms it surely remains one of the most conservative nations on earth, with a system of power that has scarcely changed since the state was established 60 years ago and a populace that seems disinclined to rock the boat. Now at long last change of a modest and tentative variety is in the air. On Sunday, King Fahd, fifth ruler of the state founded by his father, Abdul-Aziz, issued three pieces of legislation that promise the first steps towards broadening participation in government, and codifying the kingdom's system of law. In particular, he promised the establishment of a Consultative Council, whose 60 members he will appoint within the next six months and which will be able to question government ministers. The result will certainly not be democracy; nor is any real diminution likely in the absolute power exercised by the House of Saud. But the reforms, if implemented in the spirit which King Fahd appears to intend, may help make the exercise of that power seem less arbitrary, provide a platform for serious debate on the kingdom's future, and - perhaps - make the state's affairs seem a shade more transparent to outsiders. Evolution in any of these directions would be welcome - not least to foreign investors and traders, for whom the kingdom is among the most opaque and unpredictable places to do business. Smooth succession Just as important to Saudis and outsiders who prize stability in a country that contains a quarter of the world's known oil reserves, the king has probably helped to smooth the succession within the royal family by setting up what amounts to an electoral college of 500 younger princes. Sunday's move was not exactly precipitate. Fahd has been promising to set up an advisory council since well before he became king in 1982; indeed, he has raised and then apparently shelved the idea so often that the more modern-minded of his subjects could be forgiven a certain scepticism about his current intentions. Nevertheless, there are reasons to believe that the king is now in earnest. For one thing, he is not acting in isolation: among other Gulf states, Oman has established its own consultative assembly in the past year and Kuwait - which had a relatively well-established parliamentary tradition until its National Assembly was suspended in 1986 - plans to hold elections this autumn. Greater openness Demands for reform within the kingdom have been unmistakeable ever since the Saudis invited the US-led military coalition to defend their territory after Iraq invaded Kuwait. The presence of US troops emboldened the western-educated bourgeoisie of civil servants and businessmen to demand greater openness on the part of the government. The ruling family, as ever, is engaged in a balancing act: its sensitivity to criticism from the religious right means it will only go so far to accommodate the modernisers. But in speaking out on Sunday in favour of citizens' personal freedoms, King Fahd showed a heartening willingness to take on the Islamic extremists who late last year were again causing disruption in Saudi streets and homes. The test now, assuming the Consultative Council goes ahead, will be the list of members. They will have to represent the broadest range of opinions in the kingdom, from reactionary religious fundamentalist to western-educated technocrat, if the Council is to command credibility. Ideally, the Shia Moslem minority in the kingdom's eastern province would also have a voice. What is clear is that a system which relies on individual petition as the basic means of communication between ruler and ruled is no longer adequate for Saudi Arabia's needs, and that Saudis will welcome the establishment of a more representative body. The king, for his part, will find that freer expression bolsters rather than threatens his throne.</p>

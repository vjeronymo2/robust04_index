			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: Energy-efficient and allergy-free - Computers meet medieval building design in the green 21st century home A centrally heated, four-bedroom house with a fuel bill of less than Pounds 50 a year, household systems controlled by the breath of disabled people and a low-allergen house designed for asthma sufferers can be seen at an exhibition just opened in the English town of Milton Keynes*. FutureWorld, sponsored by Britain's National Housebuilding Council, invited architects, builders and producers of building products and materials to provide a glimpse of the way homes may operate in the 21st century. All of the 36 dwellings have had to comply with UK building and health and safety regulations and are to be sold when the exhibition ends on July 10. A buyer has already been found for one Pounds 40,000 property. Common themes are energy efficiency and conservation of the environment. Builders have opted for materials from renewable or recycled resources as much as possible. Specially treated softwoods have been used rather than slow-growing hardwoods from diminishing tropical forests. Some properties incorporate Warmcell insulation, produced from recycled newsprint treated with gypsum. Paints and glues use plant extracts and natural pigments in many developments. Several homes incorporate sophisticated electronic controls. This includes an apartment for a disabled person - developed by the Electricity Association, Admiral Homes and the Charter Partnership - which uses an automated system allowing touch or breath control of doors, entertainment systems, telephone, electrical appliances, computer, lights and curtains. The low-allergen house, sponsored by the National Asthma Campaign, filters and warms air entering the house. By changing the air every hour, humidity is reduced to the point at which the house dust mite is destroyed. Water-based and solvent-free paint is used to prevent an allergic reaction. One of the most exciting developments is by two former Brighton University architectural students, Duncan Baker-Brown and Ian McKay, whose energy-efficient FutureHouse design won the Royal Institute of British Architects House of the Future competition. It combines traditional construction techniques and a custom-built computer system with of basic physics and medieval building design. At its heart is a simple convection system incorporating a two-storey glass conservatory covering the south wall of the house. Air is heated inside the conservatory and rises to be either drawn into the house using a low-power fan or allowed to escape through windows in the conservatory. Cooler air is drawn in through air bricks in the northern wall and passed under the house by convection. It is either cooled further or heated depending on the soil temperature under the building. Deciduous vines planted inside and outside the conservatory provide shade in summer and inhibit over-heating. Solar panels in the roof heat water for washing and the underfloor heating system. Supplementary heat is provided by an oil-fired boiler. The house has been built using concrete block, brick and a timber cladding. The 150mm blocks assist insulation. 'Medieval builders knew that thick walls helped keep heat in during winter and warm air out of the building during summer,' says Baker-Brown. Sensors embedded in the walls allow a Pounds 4,000 computer system developed from an industrial computer system by Satchwell Control Systems to control the blend of natural and man-made heating. Annual heating bills are estimated by the architects at Pounds 40 to Pounds 50 a year. The thick walls, combined with the natural convection flow of the building, help to prevent condensation and damp. The building has a large electronic office for working from home - 'potentially the greatest energy-saving feature of them all,' says McKay. FutureHouse cost about Pounds 130,000 to build or Pounds 650 a square metre, excluding land. Offers are expected to start at Pounds 185,000. *FutureWorld exhibition at Kents Hill, Milton Keynes, runs until July 10.</p>

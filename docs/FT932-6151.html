			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Changing views on the dollar THE DOLLAR weakened sharply against the D-Mark yesterday, falling through the DM1.59 level, after a huge downward revision of first quarter US growth raised serious concerns about the scale of the economic recovery in the US, writes James Blitz. A downward revision of the GDP figures for the first three months of 1993 had been expected after a spate of poor indicators in recent weeks. But the scale of the revision, down to 0.9 per cent from a provisional 1.8 per cent, was far larger than anticipated. This alone would have suppressed the dollar against a D-Mark and yen that have been resurgent this week. But the weakness was compounded by a succession of comments from Bundesbank council members, underlining that monetary growth in Germany may put the country's rate-cutting on hold for several weeks. The comments, from regional central bank governors, underlined that April monetary growth had been very worrying and that next month's figures were expected to be no better. The combination of these factors had three effects on the market yesterday. First, they pushed the dollar down 2 1/2 pfennigs on the day to a close of DM1.5870, as dealers took the view that the short term interest rate differential between both currencies might not narrow soon. Second, the dollar's weakness put more pressure on its exchange rate against the yen, triggering two more rounds of central bank intervention from the Federal Reserve. The dollar still closed weaker in Europe, at Y107.20 from a previous Y107.80. Third, the comments from the regional governors triggered more flows of funds into the D-Mark in the ERM, pushing the peseta below its central rate against the German currency for the second day running: the Spanish currency closed at Pta79.10 from a previous Pta78.83. The French franc also weakened again, to close at FFr3.377 from a previous FFr3.371. The German currency closed 3 pfennigs stronger, at DM2.4775, against a pound that looked rudderless in the wake of the UK's cabinet reshuffle. Mr Jim O'Neill of Swiss Banking Corporation has long believed the dollar could soon revisit its historic low against the German currency of DM1.3860 set last year. Yesterday, Mr Neil MacKinnon, head of research at Citibank, took the same view. 'We should expect the dollar to outperform the D-Mark in the longer term because of German weakness,' he said. 'But if DM1.55 breaks, there is effectively a black hole on the other side and there is a risk of significant weakness.'</p>

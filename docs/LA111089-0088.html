			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW REVIEWER  </P> <P> Former Herald Examiner film critic Peter Rainer joins The Times today, writing  film criticism and commentary. Today, he reviews "Staying Together." If you  think you've seen this film before, you have, says Rainer. The movie is  englobed in the sentimentality of a hundred coming of age dramas, and the  familiarity breeds not contempt but boredom. F1  </P></p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Profit taking and long liquidation pushed New York's PLATINUM futures down sharply by midday, knocking the London bullion market price lower. New York analysts predicted a further fall as prices had slipped through an uptrend line. Chartists predicted a further fall to Dollars 365 a troy ounce for October delivery. A drop in Japan's Nikkei stock index sparked speculation that demand will lessen in the world's biggest importer. A belief that South Africa's government will resume constitutional talks with the ANC prompted expectations that tension would ease in the world's biggest producer. Considering platinum's fall, GOLD had held up well, a London trader said. But Comex gold futures were easier at midday and analysts were predicting a further fall because of a sharp drop in the CRB index, a widely watched inflation indicator. New York's arabica COFFEE futures had hit lifetime lows twice by midday. A report in a Bogota newspaper that Colombia would increase its coffee exports undermined prices. The fall pushed the London robusta market lower, although traders said there was no physical reason for the retreat. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A) A principal purpose of the issuance, transfer, or structuring of the option (alone or in combination with other arrangements) is to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change of the loss corporation, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The holder of the option and any persons related to the option holder have, in the aggregate, a direct and indirect ownership interest in the loss corporation of more than 50 percent (determined as if the increase in such persons' percentage ownership interest that would result from the exercise of the option in question and any other options to acquire stock held by such persons, and any other intended increases in such persons' percentage ownership interest, actually occurred on the date the option is issued or transferred).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Operating rules <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Person and related persons.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4)_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) The term  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> person  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> includes an individual or entity, but not a public group, as defined in &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(f)(13), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Persons are related if they bear a relationship specified in section 267(b) or 707(b) or if they have a formal or informal understanding among themselves to make a coordinated acquisition of stock, within the meaning of &sect;1.382&hyph;3(a)(1)(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Indirect ownership interest.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The indirect ownership interest that the holder of the option and any persons related to the holder have in the loss corporation is determined by applying the constructive ownership rules of &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(h), other than &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(h)(2)(i)(A) (which treats stock attributed pursuant to section 318(a)(2) as no longer being owned by the entity from which it is attributed) and &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(h)(4) (which treats options as exercised in certain circumstances). If, however, the application of such constructive ownership rules without regard to &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(h)(2)(i)(A) would result in the same stock of the loss corporation being owned by two or more such persons, appropriate adjustments must be made so that such stock is not counted more than once in computing the aggregate ownership interests of such persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The income test.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An option satisfies the income test if a principal purpose of the issuance, transfer, or structuring of the option (alone or in combination with other arrangements) is to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change of the loss corporation by facilitating the creation of income (including accelerating income or deferring deductions) or value (including unrealized built-in gains) prior to the exercise or transfer of the option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application of the ownership, control, and income tests <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Whether an option satisfies the ownership, control, or income test depends on all the relevant facts and circumstances. Among the factors that are relevant in applying all three tests are any business purposes for the issuance, transfer, or structure of the option, the likelihood of exercise of the option (taking into account, for example, any contingencies to its exercise), transactions related to the issuance or transfer of the option, and the consequences of treating the option as exercised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An option is not treated as exercised under any of the three tests, however, if a principal purpose of its issuance, transfer, or structuring is to avoid an ownership change by having it treated as exercised. Paragraphs (d)(6) (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section describe additional examples of factors that are relevant in applying each test. The weight given to any factor depends on all the facts and circumstances. The presence or absence of any factor described in this paragraph (d)(6) does not create a presumption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application of ownership test.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Among the additional factors that are taken into account in applying the ownership test are the relationship, at the time of issuance or transfer of the option, between the exercise price of the option and the value of the underlying stock, whether the option provides its holder or a related person with the right to participate in the management of the loss corporation or with other rights that ordinarily would be afforded to owners of the underlying stock, and the existence of reciprocal options (e.g., a call option held by the prospective purchaser and a corresponding put option held by the prospective seller). The ability of the holder of an option with a fixed exercise price to share in future appreciation of the underlying stock is also a relevant factor, but is not sufficient, by itself, for the option to satisfy the ownership test. Conversely, the fact that the holder of such an option does not bear the risk of loss due to declines in value of the underlying stock does not preclude the option from satisfying the ownership test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Xiamen, May 11 (CNS) -- Mayor of Xiamen, Mr. Hong  Yongshi, speaking yesterday at a meeting on the mobilization of  efforts to speed the development of the export-oriented economy  in the special economic zone city in Fujian Province, stressed  that Xiamen must further improve its environment for investment,  grasp the city's advantages and rebuild its image in order to  develop its export-oriented economy to a new stage.    According to the mayor, economic operations in the city had  been on the whole good in the first four months of this year  with its industrial output value increased by 35.4 percent over  the same period of last year, fixed assets investment by 89  percent and export value by 20 percent.    For various reasons, the special economic zone had suffered  a  decline in the introduction of foreign capital in the first four  months with only 163 contracts on the use of foreign funds being  signed in this period, a drop of 15.5 percent over the same  period last year and a total of foreign investment of U.S.$415  million, down by 29.4 percent, but its actual utilization of  foreign capital increased by 7.2 percent, reflecting that most  of the indicators for the introduction of foreign capital in the  city were lower than those in other special economic zones in  the country.    Mr. Hong attributed the decline in the introduction of  foreign capital in the city to the unstable environment for  investment there besides objective factors including a  large-scale decline of investment in the real estate industry,  the shifting of foreign investment from coastal areas to inland  areas in the country and various limits imposed by the Taiwan  authorities on its investment in the mainland.    The mayor called for a solution to problems in the  environment for investment through means of reform in order to  curb the declining trend in foreign capital introduction in the  city. He also said that the city must make itself trusted by  foreign businessmen and all contracts, once signed, must be  implemented even if in the circumstances there was a loss for  the Chinese side.</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Analysts attack US mining law plans Proposed changes to US mining laws are likely 'to lead to more litigation, more delays, fewer jobs and less wealth-creation' if they are not rewritten 'in a more workable and co-operative problem-solving manner,' according to Goldman Sachs, the US financial services group. 'We share the concern of the industry about the growing potential power of citizen suits and the increasing legal fuzziness of issues like land 'suitability' and 'acceptable' environmental compliance', say analysts Amy Gassman and Alexandra Zawadiwsky. They suggest a 'compromise' version of the mining law reform is likely to be passed during 1994 and this could affect the earnings of several gold mining companies from 1995 onwards. The analysts say it is likely that gross royalties between 3 per cent and 5 per cent could be levied on federal unpatented lands and add 'we believe the industry can live with a moderate new royalty structure.' They point out that only a very small number of exploration prospects eventually become mines. 'Thus, to introduce greater uncertainty into the exploration process (will the project receive permits, will it be located on suitable lands?) further reduces the already-slim probabilities associated with the search for new mines. In order to increase the probabilities, miners are looking (outside the US) where there has not been as much activity.' However, this move to offshore exploration also 'reflects the intersection of several positive trends - the move toward a market economy and democratic government in several Latin American countries, the availability of large areas of unexplored prospective acreage offshore, the passage of new mining legislation to protect ownership rights and the ability to remit profits - at the very time that the process for exploring and developing properties in the US is becoming more uncertain and time-consuming.' The existing Mining Act of 1872 has been under attack by some US politicians for years because it enables mining companies to apply for a patent on federal land on which they are mining or plan to mine for a one-time fee of Dollars 5 an acre. Also, once patented, the land and the minerals contained in it are transferred from the public to the private sector and are exempt from any further rental or royalty payments to the Federal Treasury. Critics say the present system does not provide a financial return to the American people for the use of public domain lands.</p>

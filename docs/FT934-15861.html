			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / London night flights to be cut THE NUMBER of night flights at London's three main airports is is to be cut to reduce noise, Lord Caithness, the aviation minister, announced yesterday, Daniel Green writes. The move was in response to a High Court judgment last month against a plan that could have allowed more night flights using quieter aircraft. The Department of Transport expects to be able to enact the proposals by Tuesday so airlines can change their timetables for the winter season which starts on October 24. BAA, which operates Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports, said that the airlines faced 'a challenge to change their schedules in time'. British Airways said that the move would also mean more last-minute work at next month's airline scheduling conferences which will prepare the ground for the crowded summer season. The new rules would mean an average of about 2.5 fewer flights a day arriving at Heathrow in the early morning. This affects principally aircraft coming in from the Far East and the west coast of North America.</p>

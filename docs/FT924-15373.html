			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Borrowers putting their faith in the US dollar THE US dollar surged back to centre stage in the international bond market in the third quarter of this year as Europe's currency markets wavered, then cracked under the pressure of the ERM. Figures for the three months to the end of September show the huge reliance now being placed by borrowers on the US currency. Some Dollars 31.3bn of Eurodollar bonds were issued, 56 per cent of the total amount raised on the international markets. After the steady decline of the Eurodollar bond - it accounted for more than half of all borrowing in 1989, but had shrunk to only 31 per cent by last year - the renaissance has been startling. Against the background of low US interest rates, the use of the currency has been all the more notable. Hence the renewed interest in 'collared' floating-rate notes, typically offering a minimum coupon of 5 per cent, of which more than Dollars 6bn have been issued in recent weeks. However, interest in these bonds in the secondary market will evaporate quickly should US rates climb back above 5 per cent. All the signs now point to further use of the dollar, along with the other traditional currencies for international borrowing - the D-Mark and the yen. The Ecu, a putative international reserve currency earlier this year, has been stopped dead in its tracks. Nearly 15 per cent of all international bond issuance last year was undertaken in the Ecu. Over the last three months, due to the the Danish vote on the Maastricht treaty in June, that proportion has fallen to less than 1 per cent. Other 'fringe' European currencies, which had become popular as investors looked for ways to trade on the convergence of European bond yields, have also lost their appeal. And the Canadian dollar - another popular currency, accounting for nearly 10 per cent of bonds issued last year - is unlikely to be taken up again until there is a clear end to Canada's constitutional uncertainties. Ironically, it is the European countries which have suffered most in the upheaval of the ERM that are likely to be the biggest borrowers in the dollar, D-Mark and yen in the months ahead, for three reasons. First, they have yawning fiscal deficits to finance. Continuing recession in several European countries has depressed tax revenues and pushed up social security payments. Investors are only half persuaded by the recent efforts of countries like Spain and Italy to hold down their deficits, a fact which has helped to fracture ERM. Second, the interest of international investors in the domestic bond markets of these countries has shrunk. That leaves countries with the prospect of borrowing more from domestic savers, thereby pushing up long-term interest rates, or borrowing in foreign currencies. Doing the latter could also help to persuade international investors of their will not to devalue, something from which Italy benefited as it announced new foreign currency borrowing plans last Thursday. Third, a range of countries, from Scandinavia to Italy, Spain, the UK and Ireland, have either seen their foreign currency reserves fall sharply as a result of intervention in the exchange markets, or face the prospect of repaying the Bundesbank in D-Marks for its own support of their currencies. Either way, the need to borrow in D-Marks has risen sharply. The trouble is, the credit standing of several of these countries has been declining sharply. Last week, Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, said it was considering downgrading both Spain and Sweden. Sweden, a top-rated name until the beginning of 1991, is currently classed AA1, while Spain is AA2. They could be set to follow Italy, which fell to AA3 this summer, perilously close to the single-A status which would push it outside the ranks of general acceptability in the investment world. Demand for European currencies, including the D-Mark, accounts for Deutsche Bank's position as the most active bookrunner in the Euromarket in the first nine months of this year. It took the lead in 8.2 per cent of the Dollars 204bn raised. Mr Roger Bates, of Deutsche Bank in London, says that demand for Eurobonds could be weak in the near future as investors concentrate on reducing their currency risks. That could raise the cost of borrowing in the international bond market still further, after a rise in yields which has already been noticeable in the past fortnight. However, Mr Bates adds: 'When things stabilise, they (investors) will start to think of performance again' - leading to renewed interest in Eurobonds.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         TOP EUROBOND BOOK RUNNERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     First nine months 1992     First nine months 1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Dollars      per-          Dollars       per- Manager              bn    Rank cent Issues     bn   Rank  cent  Issues  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Deutsche Bank      16.61     1  8.18   67      9.74    5   5.14     61 Nomura Int.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Management Measures for Checking the Weight of Import and </F> Export Commodities, Promulgated by the State Administration for  the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities on 16 December  1993"]    [Text] Article 1. In order to strengthen the work of  checking the weight of import and export commodities and  safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of parties  concerned in foreign trade, these Measures are drawn up  according to the stipulations of the "PRC Law on Inspection of  Import and Export Commodities" (hereinafter referred to as the  "Commodity Inspection Law") and the "Regulations on Implementing  the PRC Law on Inspection of Import and Export Commodities"  (hereinafter referred to as the "Regulations").    Article 2. Parties in foreign trade must submit to commodity  inspection organs their applications for handling the work of  checking the weight of import and export commodities, which  refers to import and export commodities quoted and packed  according to weight requirements listed in the "List of Import  and Export Commodity Categories Examined by Commodity Inspection  Organs" (hereinafter referred to as the "Category List") or  refers to import and export commodities to be issued with weight  certificates by commodity inspection organs in line with the  requirements of foreign trade contracts.    Article 3. For import and export commodities not in the  "Category List" or those not issued with weight certificates by  commodity inspection organs because they were not prescribed by  foreign trade contracts, commodity inspection organs and the  State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export  Commodities, inspection organs appointed by commodity inspection  organs, and other inspection organs authorized by the State  Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export  Commodities to handle the work of weight checking can accept  applications submitted by parties in foreign trade or can be  entrusted by organs concerned to handle the business of checking  the weight of import and export commodities and to issue weight  certificates in line with the provisions of these measures.    Article 4. The State Administration for the Inspection of  Import and Export Commodities and commodity inspection organs  supervise the work of weight checking carried out by inspection  organs which are authorized or appointed by them.    Article 5. Commodity inspection organs handle the work of  checking the weight of import and export commodities according  to the means of measurement prescribed by foreign trade  contracts. If no means of measurement are prescribed by foreign  trade contracts, commodity inspection organs can adopt various  means of weight measurement such as weighing apparatus, water  gauges, vessels, and flow meters according to applicants'  applications and specific conditions of commodities, including  their characteristics, package categories, transportation  conditions, and means of delivery.    Article 6. Personnel of commodity inspection organs who are  responsible for weight checking must receive specialized  training and pass examinations before they are qualified to take  up their posts and check the weight of import and export  commodities according to the provisions of the "Regulations for  Checking the Weight of Import and Export Commodities."    Article 7. All sorts of weighing apparatus, vessels, flow  meters and complete sets of weight-measuring implements as well  as inspection installations can only be used after state  departments responsible for measurement have issued certificates  of qualified checking marked with validity dates and confirmed  by commodity inspection organs. Units using weighing apparatus,  vessels, and flow meters should have a concrete inspection  system and be equipped with corresponding means of inspection  for regular maintenance and inspection.    As far as large specialized weighing apparatus, vessels, and  flow meters are concerned, commodity inspection organs must set  up technology files for stronger supervision.    Article 8. Personnel responsible for measuring weight by  weighing apparatus, vessels, and flow meters must receive  specialized technological training and pass examinations and  their qualifications must be confirmed by commodity inspection  organs, while personnel of commodity inspection organs supervise  the operation of weight measurement conducted by qualified  personnel.    Article 9. Certificates of water gauge measurement can be  treated as the basis for transactions and settlement between  parties in foreign trade. If this is stated in weight  provisions in foreign trade contracts, transporting ships should  have the conditions for water gauging. If commodity inspection  personnel examine and verify that particular transporting ships  do not have the conditions, they will not handle the work of  water gauging.    Article 10. When parties in foreign trade apply for weight  checking, they must go through the procedure of reporting import  and export commodities for checking according to the  "Regulations on Reporting and Checking Import and Export  Commodities." Moreover, they must make arrangements for  checking the weight and provide essential working conditions  according to dates of loading and transport, dates of  consignment and settlement, or validity dates for claiming  damages.    Article 11. For import and export commodities transported in  bulk which have to be measured by weighing apparatus, commodity  inspection organs should check the weight of all commodities at  ports of loading and unloading as stated in foreign trade  contracts or contracts of transportation. Meanwhile, consignees  (consigners) must apply for supervision of the loading and  unloading work.    Packaged or unpackaged commodities which are transported in  clear batches without changes in weight can be checked by  commodity inspection organs at consigners' (consignees')  premises, by commodity inspection organs at ports, or by  commodity inspection organs in other places. Regarding import  and export commodities which must be checked at ports, parties  in foreign trade should guarantee that commodities are  transported in clear batches and that goods match what is  described in certificates.    Article 12. Regarding commodities marked with their weight,  including net weight and package weight, commodity inspection  organs will implement spot checks on their weight according to  the "Regulations for Checking the Weight of Import and Export  Commodities--Checking Weight by Weighing Apparatus."    Article 13. Regarding commodities priced according to their  conditioned weight or dry weight, persons who apply for weight  checks by weighing apparatus and water gauges should ask  commodity inspection organs to select representative samples for  moisture content tests.    Article 14. Apart from applying for measurement of the  capacity of holds carrying imported liquid commodities,  applicants must also apply for checking of empty holds and holds  for unloading. Dry hold certificates will be issued after  commodity inspection organs have finished all these checks.    Article 15. Units involved in the work of checking the  weight of import and export commodities must use our country's  official units of measurement. In case of special requirements,  measurements are still converted on the basis of our country's  official units of measurement.    Article 16. Commodity inspection organs which handle the  work of weight checking will collect fees according to relevant  state regulations.    Article 17. Anyone violating the provisions of these  Measures will be punished according to the relevant provisions  of the "Commodity Inspection Law" and the "Regulations."    Article 18. These Measures are effective 1 March 1994, and  the "Interim Measures for Checking the Weight of Import and  Export Commodities by Weighing Apparatus" will be simultaneously  abolished.    Article 19. The State Administration for the Inspection of  Import and Export Commodities is responsible for the  interpretation of these Measures.</p>

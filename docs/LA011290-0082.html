Baker III to keep  trying to arrange Israeli-Palestinian talks. But the Israeli daily newspaper  Haaretz reported that Shamir and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens are studying  alternatives to the U.S.-supported plan for talks in Egypt. Haaretz said they  are considering plans for a direct dialogue with Palestinians from the occupied  West Bank and Gaza Strip without help from Egypt.  </P></p>

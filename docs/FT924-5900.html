			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: NZ reforms help PDL triple profits PDL Industries, the New Zealand electrical goods maker, more than tripled net profits to NZDollars 6.42m (USDollars 3.37m) in the six months to September 30, from NZDollars 1.99m a year earlier. Sir Robertson Stewart, chairman, said the recovery in the company's fortunes was due to New Zealand's economic reforms which he had staunchly opposed. PDL has become one of the New Zealand stock market's best performers. Its shares began the year at NZDollars 2. On Friday they rose 70 cents to NZDollars 11.20 on expectations of a good result, and closed at NZDollars 11 yesterday. Sir Robertson said the company was benefiting from a changed economic environment. He praised the government for removing import protection and implementing tough new anti-labour laws. He said PDL would concentrate its expansion programme on a plant in Malaysia which should be operating next year. The plant's production would be sold to the south-east Asian market. The remainder of capital spending would go on upgrading New Zealand factories, he said. Sales fell to NZDollars 116m from NZDollars 127m following the sale of subsidiaries related to its associate company Lasercorp. Export sales rose 52 per cent to NZDollars 15.6m. Lasercorp had turned the profits corner, Sir Robertson said. It returned to the black with net profits of NZDollars 1.05m for the six months to September, against losses of NZDollars 4.9m.</p>

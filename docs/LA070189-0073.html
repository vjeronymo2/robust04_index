			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN CO-PARENT WINS CUSTODY FIGHT  </P> <P> A judge on Friday gave custody of an orphaned toddler to his mother's longtime  female companion, rather than the boy's blood relatives.  </P> <P> "I have been co-parenting Collin," Susan Bellemare, 33, told a Vermont probate  judge as she fought to win custody of the 15-month-old. "I would parent the  child; I would love him, nurture him."  </P> <P> Bellemare was named guardian of Collin Hamilton in the will of Susan Hamilton,  who died in a car accident in May. Hamilton's parents are challenging the will,  contending that they or Hamilton's sister, Kathleen, would be a better  guardian.  </P> <P> No one involved in the case would characterize the relationship of the two  women, who owned a home together and reportedly exchanged wedding rings. They  were companions for a dozen years and lived together while rearing the baby,  who was conceived by artificial insemination.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to cast aspersions on anybody," said Patrick Monaghan Jr.,  the lawyer for the grandparents, Philip and Elsa Hamilton of Montvale, N.J.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Simferopol, 31 Jan -- The more than substantial  number of votes cast for the Russia bloc, which I represent, is  confirmation that our policies are the correct ones, Yuriy  Meshkov, who was elected the first president of the Republic of  Crimea in Sunday's elections, has told journalists in  Simferopol. These are the policies of revival, unification,  adherence to normal economic laws, and removal of tension  between Russia and the Ukraine, he said. These policies are in  the best interests of our citizens, citizens of the Republic of  Crimea, including their right to mix freely with Russian  citizens, the right to dual citizenship and the right to a  normal life, of which we have been deprived. The results of the  voting provide hope that change will come. This is a vote of  confidence for the Russia bloc, a belief that our objectives  will be realized.    As has already been reported, Meshkov guaranteed in his  election program that the moratorium on a referendum on Crimea's  status would be lifted. He promised to return the republic to  the ruble zone, to grant Crimeans the right to dual citizenship,  and to guarantee peace and national accord in Crimea.</p>

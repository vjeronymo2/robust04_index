			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ECONOMISTS DEBATE EFFECT OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUT;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: MANY BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD SPUR INVESTMENT BUT AREN'T SURE HOW STRONG  THE OVERALL IMPACT WOULD BE.  </P> <P> Underlying the current debate in Washington over a capital gains tax is a  fundamental question: How much would a cut in the levies on stocks, real estate  and other investments really stimulate investment and help the economy?  </P> <P> Many economists believe such a cut would spur spending on business expansion,  new plants and equipment, just as advocates maintain. But many aren't sure how  powerful that stimulus would be, how much would go to the most desirable  investments and whether the cut would be worth the distortions of the tax  system that it would also cause.  </P> <P> And few experts now dispute that a cut in the rate would disproportionately  benefit the wealthiest Americans at the expense of others.  </P> <P> "I think there would be added risk taking and more entrepreneurial activity,"  said Edward Guay, chief economist at Cigna Corp., the big insurance, health  care and investment firm in Hartford, Conn. "The question is, 'Is this the best  way to reach that goal?' "  </P> <P> The issue is a highly charged one, as has been apparent all week in Washington  in the continuing debates over the unfinished budget plan.  </P> <P> The capital gains tax is levied when individuals sell stocks, real estate,  timberland and certain other investments for a profit. Until 1986, the  effective capital gains tax rate was 20%. But when the maximum individual tax  rate was dropped in the 1986 tax reform bill, the special treatment for capital  gains was eliminated, raising the effective maximum rate to 33%.  </P> <P> To President Bush, long the chief proponent of a cut, a preferential rate would  bring enough growth to offset the loss in tax revenue. Individuals would  suddenly have a far greater incentive to buy stock, and as they did so,  businesses would find their cost of capital reduced, and could make the  productive investments that would enable them to remain competitive.  </P> <P> Capital gains taxes aren't now imposed until the assets are sold. If the law  were changed, many individuals might choose to sell their stocks and reinvest  in new companies, providing a further economic spur, advocates say.  </P> <P> A cut would mean "more productive business investment and, over time, more  jobs, growth and international competitiveness," argues Charls Walker, chairman  of the American Council for Capital Formation, a principal advocate for a  capital gains cut.  </P> <P> But only a fraction of the capital raised by a tax cut would go to the kind of  productive investments that advocates hail.  </P> <P> Economists note that institutional owners of stock -- insurance companies, for  example, or pension funds and other non-taxable institutions, or foreigners --  receive no benefit from the cut and therefore don't make any added investment.  More than half of the stocks on U.S. exchanges are owned by such institutions.  </P> <P> One intended beneficiary of the tax break is small and new businesses, which  represent a particularly vibrant part of the U.S. economy. But less than 1% of  stock is issued by small businesses, notes Alan Auerbach, a professor of  economics at the University of Pennsylvania.  </P> <P> "The amount of money is trivial, so it's really crazy to have an  across-the-board tax cut if helping small business is your goal," he said.  </P> <P> Another goal of the tax cut advocates is to increase the pool of venture  capital that nourishes promising new companies. But again, more than half of  venture capital doesn't come from individuals but from institutional sources --  pension funds and foreigners, for example -- that are unaffected by the break.  </P> <P> Individual investors tend to be less sophisticated, and more likely to put  their money in the tiny, riskier "penny stock" companies that they believe will  quickly increase their capital, some analysts assert.  </P> <P> "This tax break has a tendency to lead greedy or inexperienced investors into  risky, small-capitalization companies," said Guay. "The capital gains tax is a  great marketing tool for the penny stock brokers."  </P> <P> Also, the economy benefits from the tax only when individuals purchase newly  issued shares of stock, rather than those that have already been traded. Newly  issued shares represent only about 2% of transactions, said Bob S. McIntyre, of  Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed group that opposes a capital gains  cut.  </P> <P> The U.S. Treasury Department has argued that a cut in the effective rate to 23%  would stimulate the economy enough to increase tax revenue by $12 billion over  next five years.  </P> <P> But other studies have found that while a cut would initially raise revenues --  as investors sold off assets to take profits -- tax revenues would eventually  flatten out or decline. A staff study by the nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee of  Congress found that lowering the effective rate to 23% would raise revenue in  the first two years, but by the fifth would bring losses of $11 billion.  </P> <P> Some economists also worry about the distortions of the tax system that such a  cut would cause.  </P> <P> It would prompt many Americans to look for ways to lower their taxes by  converting earned income to investment income. The cut would also complicate  the tax code, reversing the simplifications that Congress took in 1986 and  probably making it necessary to write hundreds of pages of new tax rules,  analysts noted.  </P> <P> "It creates a lot of work for tax lawyers, accountants and investment advisers  that doesn't necessarily help the economy at all," Auerbach said. "There's a  compliance cost."  </P> <P> Guay worries, too, about a cut's tendency to increase indebtedness. The tax  benefit would prompt many individuals to borrow money to speculate in  investments, "and more debt is something this economy doesn't need at the  moment," he said.  </P> <P> Few now dispute that most of the benefits of a cut would go to the wealthiest  Americans. According to Administration figures, $27 billion of the $49 billion  in capital gains in 1990 will go to families whose incomes have averaged  $200,000 or more for the past five years.  </P> <P> Families with incomes of $50,000 or less will claim an estimated $4.8 billion  in capital gains, or less than 10% of the total.  </P> <P> However, advocates of a capital gains tax sometimes argue that even if the  preferential treatment initially benefits the wealthy, by expanding the economy  it indirectly benefits -- "trickles down" -- to others.  </P> <P> Barry Bosworth, senior fellow at Brookings Institution, said the experience of  other countries doesn't offer much guidance on how the United States should  handle the issue of capital gains.  </P> <P> Germany, for example, has a low capital gains tax. But the country has much  higher corporate profit taxes, which raises its cost of capital and makes it  difficult to compare the systems, he said.  </P> <P> Economist Guay says he believes that a capital gains tax cut can be beneficial.  </P> <P> "It's easy for people to sit at home and not take any risk," he said. "I think  the country needs something to encourage people to invest their money for a  possible higher return," he said.  </P> <P> But he added that any evaluation of the benefits of the tax needs to consider  its secondary effects on the economy.  </P></p>

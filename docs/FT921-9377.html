			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / DTI attempt to wind up insurer rejected by judge THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry yesterday failed in a petition to wind up Secure &amp; Provide, a Hull-based insurance company, on 'public interest' grounds. Secure &amp; Provide traded briefly in early 1991, promoting an unorthodox 'pyramid selling' scheme for personal insurance packages. Its activities were halted when the DTI appointed inspectors. A provisional liquidator was appointed by the court last March. Mr Justice Hoffmann said yesterday he was not satisfied that the public interest required the company to be wound up. It would be 'unjust' and 'grossly disproportionate' to do so in response to the errors that Mr John Tyzack, who headed the business, had admittedly made in launching his scheme. The judge dismissed the petition and ordered the DTI to pay costs. He directed that Pounds 40,000 raised from subscribers and held by the liquidator should be returned to the company. Mr Tyzack said the money would be released back to subscribers who paid a Pounds 75-a-month premium for a personal insurance package with an inducement to earn commission by recruiting others to buy.</p>

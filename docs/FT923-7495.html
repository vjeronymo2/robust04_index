			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Protest at lack of green measures for trade body THE proposed Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO) that would implement the results of the current round of global trade talks should be renegotiated to take account of environmental concerns and if not should be jettisoned, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)*. Environmental groups, especially in the US, are angry that the MTO, which would be a far more powerful institution than the present General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), makes virtually no reference to the environment and its relationship with trade. This is likely to be one of the most hotly debated issues if and when the Uruguay Round package, still stalled over farm trade reform, goes to the US Congress for ratification. A report on the proposed MTO by WWF International points out the contrast with the Maastricht treaty, which states that one of the objectives of the European Community is to promote 'sustainable and non-inflationary growth respecting the environment'. The recently completed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) also refers to sustainable development as a principal goal. Mr Charles Arden-Clarke of WWF International said that the draft MTO would perpetuate the pre-eminence now given by Gatt to free trade over the environment, and failed to honour commitments made at the Earth Summit in June to make trade and environment policies 'mutually supportive'. The WWF is calling for MTO objectives to include a commitment to sustainable development, recognition and assessment of the environmental impact of trade measures, creation of a standing committee on trade and the environment similar to the Gatt committee on trade and development, and consultation rights for environmental groups in trade negotiations. Mr Arden-Clarke said WWF would favour an MTO to replace Gatt, 'so long as the new organisation is equitable, transparent, democratically accountable, and if it recognises the limits imposed on free trade by the need for environmental protection and sustainable development'. Otherwise the proposal should be removed from the Uruguay Round package. *The Multilateral Trade Organisation: A legal and environmental assessment; WWF International, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland.</p>

'Abu-Hamdan said: With the full support of the Army, and  using automatic weapons, six Zionist criminals attacked the  fasting worshipers in prostration from six vantage points,  martyring and wounding more than 400 of them. But to make the  world public opinion believe that this was an individual event  and to bury the details for ever, the Zionist military then  killed one of the elements who was involved in the attack on the  Muslims, and who was the main contact with the Israeli Army in  the execution of this ominous plan. But how could an individual  person commit such a crime on his own and kill and injure  hundreds of people?    'Abu-Hamdan stressed that despite efforts by the 'Arafat  gang  to use the killing to speed up the PLO-Israel deal, HAMAS and  other militant organizations opposed to concession plans, will  avenge the martyrs of the Hebron bloody Friday by increasing  their martyrdom seeking operation.    The head of the HAMAS office in Tehran, while criticizing  the  weak stance of Arab countries regarding the massacre, said that  unfortunately, some of them have moved in line with the Zionists  wishes.</p>

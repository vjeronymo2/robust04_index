			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Managers' pay 'accelerating' MANAGERS' pay is accel-erating, a survey published today shows. The survey by P-E International, the management consultants, shows the median annual increase is 3.5 per cent. This compares with a 25-year low of 3 per cent at the beginning of the year. The survey, which covers nearly 700 companies across 18 sectors, shows that managers have fared better than the workforce in general, where basic salary increases have levelled off at about 2.6 per cent. Mr Simon McBride, P-E consultant, said there were a number of factors, including inflation, which would influence salaries in 1994. He said companies would need to consider the effect of a further year of low pay increases on their ability to retain highly regarded managers. Also important was the uncertainty of recovery in continental Europe and the continued fears over job security. The number of managers receiving no pay increase over the 12 months to July was still one-in-10. However, the number of directors whose wages were frozen had increased - 21 per cent of managing directors and 13 per cent of other directors received no increase compared with 14 per cent and 11 per cent respectively over the 12 months to July 1992. Average base salary increases for managing directors were highest in sectors such as textiles, and food, drink and tobacco.

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Delors unlikely to have the last word on EU jobs: Influences shaping the Commission president's prescriptions for a post-industrial Europe When Mr Jacques Delors presents his White Paper on employment, growth and competitiveness to this week's EU summit in Brussels, many will view the occasion as the last hurrah for the president of the European Commission. That the 12 heads of government are ready to put their faith in Mr Delors is a testimony to his reputation as the man with the long-term vision; but it also reflects a certain desperation in the face of mass unemployment. Next year, the number of people out of work in the European Union is forecast to rise to more than 18m, the equivalent of the combined populations of Belgium, Denmark and Ireland. No one expects Mr Delors to produce a miracle cure; but some wonder whether his White Paper will produce the prescriptions to tackle Europe's low growth, rising unemployment and failure to create jobs. The answer goes to the heart of what might be called the debate over the future economic philosophy of the European Union. This debate pits the Anglo-Saxon model of labour market deregulation, wage restraint, and curbs on trade union power, against the more consensual model of social partnership which has underpinned the post-second world war economic order on the continent in Europe, but which is now under strain. Early drafts of the White Paper have sent ambiguous signals about how far Mr Delors is prepared to compromise on the social policies he has championed, which were embodied in the Maastricht treaty. Broadly speaking, it is possible however to pick out a few trends, starting within the Commission which endorsed the final version in a special session yesterday. The first school of thought is grouped inside Directorate General Two, headed by Mr Henning Christophersen, the Danish commissioner responsible for economics. A former finance minister, Mr Christophersen is Mr Orthodoxy. He stands for price stability; strict control on public finances; and an average increase in real wages of one percentage point a year less than the rise in productivity. This is about as near as DG-2 felt it could go in supporting the notion of pricing people into work. The second, activist, school is located inside Directorate General Five, headed by Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish commissioner responsible for social affairs and employment. Though Mr Flynn arrived in Brussels a year ago with something of a conservative reputation, he has quickly absorbed DG-5's social democratic agenda. This stresses the preservation of labour market regulation and minimum wages, as well as the recent endorsement of work-sharing as a source of new jobs, possibly supported by fiscal incentives. Mr Delors' own views are an intriguing cocktail. In one breath, he will speak of 40m people in poverty in Europe and rail against the 'politics of exclusion'. Minutes later, he will remind visitors that, as a former French finance minister, he remains more popular among Christian Democrats than among members of his own Socialist party. Mr Delors retains an almost blind faith in new technology as a means of restoring Europe's competitiveness. The White Book will therefore contain images of a New Europe linked together through US-style 'information highways', massive investment in roads, rail and telecommunications, and a shift of funds away from consumption into research and development. Mr Delors' message is that a new post-industrial age has arrived in Europe. Thus, in 15 years, the number of non-active people will be high relative to the number in work; much more flexible working patterns will be commonplace; the right to permanent retraining should be universal. But he remains an optimist. As he told members of the European parliament last week, the essential element in tackling the competitiveness crisis is not the cost of labour but the capacity to master technical change. Senior Commission officials agree, but some fret that Mr Delors risks blurring the question of labour market flexibility as the prerequisite for job creation. This is not just a result of his own political leanings, but arises also from the political constraints in the member states such as Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, all of which face serious trade union unrest this winter. 'The single biggest weakness in the White Book will be the lack of a coherent message,' predicts one official. In fairness, Mr Delors will reply that the political weakness of the Commission means it has no option but to offer a menu of prescriptions. It has no intention of putting forward Brussels-led legislation; member states must pick what is best suited to national needs. As such the White Paper is a work of transition; it is the first rather than the last word in the debate.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: True contentment, but only for the lucky few - How one miner found his 'dream' job STRIDING OVER the limestone grassland of Durham's coastline, Denis Rooney, a former colliery fitter, cannot believe his luck. After 18 years working underground he is now paid to roam the cliffs near his home, protecting the scenery he loves. As National Trust warden for this curious north-east coast, where dramatic cliffs and meadows studded with orchids lead down to beaches black with coal waste, he has found job satisfaction. When his wife spotted the job advertisement in the Sunderland Echo Mr Rooney, then 45 and unemployed, doubted his chances. 'I said 'everybody has degrees who get those jobs'.' Two years later the keen conservationist still cannot believe his good fortune. 'I still haven't come off cloud nine, it's just a dream come true,' he says. Mr Rooney, last of a family of miners, decided in 1987 to take his redundancy from Dawdon colliery - since closed and now the northern boundary of his four-mile warden's beat. In the late 1980s it was easier for former Durham miners to find work. But since mid 1991 Dawdon and Murton collieries have closed, costing East Durham 2,000 jobs and creating a large pool of job-hunting miners. Today, Mr Rooney says, the prospects are 'dire' for those facing redundancy from East Durham's last pits, Vane Tempest and Easington. The two pits employed 2,300 men when they were earmarked for closure last October. 'There are no jobs around. It will create a lot of problems with a lot of miners unemployed. And for the young ones coming up now there's nothing.' Mr Rooney did not find the job he wanted easily. He tried to get work on the Channel tunnel project, but failed. He endured repetitive engineering jobs and was made redundant a second time by a Sunderland cranemaker. He had been on the dole for 10 months before his wife, a school cook, spotted the crucial advertisement. His warden's job may be a 'dream' but it is no idyll. To protect his coastline he has had to confront youths with airguns, and flytippers. For Pounds 10,000 a year he works far beyond his official 39 hours a week. When he is not out with his mongrel Sabre and lurcher Bracken patrolling, or supervising volunteers, he lectures to schools and clubs and studies for a conservation qualification. Yet it has worked out well. Mr Rooney used part of his Pounds 18,000 pit redundancy to buy his terraced ex-colliery house in Seaham, a Durham coastal town which until recently had three pits. That way, he figured, his family would have a home whatever happened. Coalmining was never an option for his sons. One is a care worker in a home for young delinquents and the other a council gardener. Mr Rooney loves his job's combination of freedom and responsibility, and the chance it gives him to enhance the very coastline his former industry has desecrated for the past century with colliery waste. In recent years 1.5m tonnes of waste annually has been tipped on to the beaches from British Coal's coastal Durham pits, turning once-golden sand into a black quagmire so vile it featured in the film Alien Three. British Coal argued that the costs of other disposal methods would have to be borne by the collieries, rendering them uneconomic. 'From a conservation point of view it doesn't upset me the collieries are closing, but from the jobs point of view it does,' says Mr Rooney. 'It's a pity they have to close because there's nothing to replace them.'</p>

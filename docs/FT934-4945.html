			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Citibank study points to lack of German ADRs A study sponsored by Citibank has highlighted a series of obstacles which inhibit the development of a significant US shareholder base for German companies. According to the study*, the lack of sponsored or listed American depositary receipts (ADRs) by German companies is the main hindrance because a large percentage of US institutions cannot hold ordinary shares of non-US equities. So far, Daimler-Benz is the only German industrial company to have obtained a full listing for its ADRs, though Volkswagen has a sponsored ADR programme. Kaufhof, one of Germany's biggest retailing groups, also plans a sponsored ADR programme. Other obstacles to investing in German equities range from a lack of adequate information on German companies, German accounting practices, a lack of liquidity in the German equity market and insider trading, the study found. *Current attitudes of United States institutional investors towards German equities and the German market; Citibank NA, Depositary Receipts Services, 111 Wall Street, 5th floor, New York, NY 10043.

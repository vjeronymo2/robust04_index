			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / World Trade News: China buys Rolls-Royce engines in Dollars 300m deal CHINA yesterday announced a Dollars 300m (Pounds 156m) order for Rolls-Royce engines and said it was negotiating to buy eight British Aerospace 146 aircraft, writes Alexander Nicoll. Zhang Yanning, vice minister of the State Council Economic and Trade Office, said a buying mission which he heads has made Dollars 364m of purchases in the UK, and that the BAe order would add a further Dollars 184m. Mr Richard Needham, minister of trade, is to visit China this month and Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, will head a large British trade mission to China in October. A DM600m (Pounds 208m) order for three container ships placed with German yards by Cosco, the Chinese shipping line, will go ahead after the Bonn parliament's decision last month to lift restrictions on development aid for trade with China, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. Bremer Vulkan, the west German yard, will build one vessel, with the other two to be built under contract by a yard in Wismar, east Germany.</p>

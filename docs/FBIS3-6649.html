			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Malacanang [Presidential Office] has allowed three  new domestic service airlines to operate this year as part of  its move to liberalize the aviation industry in the country.    President Ramos directed yesterday the Civil Aeronautics  Board to formulate its recommendations to open up the aviation  industry, removing policies protecting the monopoly held by  Philippine Airlines [PAL] for domestic airline services.    Two of the airlines are expected to compete with PAL,  servicing the Cebu-Davao route, while a third is working for a  congressional franchise to operate an international and domestic  passenger and cargo services.    One of the new domestic service airlines, the Araneta-led  Silangan Airways Inc., is planning to lease at least six  120-seat passenger jets to service the Cebu-Davao routes.    Its owners are reportedly looking at Russian-made aircraft  to  serve as its fleet.    The other airline, Star Asia Airways Corp. will field at  least two Boeing 737-200s to service other Visayas and Mindanao  routes from Manila.    The third airline, the All-Asia Airlines Corp., led by  businessman Eduardo Cojuangco, has still to obtain its franchise  from Congress to operate an international and domestic service  airline.    The move to open the local aviation industry to more  airlines  is consistent with the Ramos administration's policy of  providing equal opportunity to other Filipino-operated airlines  to cater to increasing demands in domestic flight services.</p>

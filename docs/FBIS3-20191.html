			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Kurt Stenger commentary: "Hypocritical"] </F>   [Text] The hysteria in Bonn because of the "abuse of  hospitality" by Kurds, who blocked the highways, is  hypocritical. Has anyone ever been that angry about the war of  the Turkish Army -- and here one must really speak of a war --  against the Kurdish people, which also affects relatives of our  "guests"?    Of course not, because today Bonn is the most important ally  of Ankara, where one likes to speak of the (not only) historic  "German-Turkish comradeship-in-arms." Without the gifts of  weapons from the West, the war would long have become too  expensive for Turkey.    Even more important is the political support, which Bonn  gives the NATO state. The banning of Kurdish associations in  1993 was seen in Ankara as the "go-ahead" for a new military  offensive. And not only that: Democratic rules are not even  observed for the sake of appearances anymore. Bothersome  newspapers are banned, elected deputies of the "Democracy party"  -- the only force that could mediate between Ankara and the  Kurds -- are arrested straight out of parliament.    Turkey is a military dictatorship, which keeps a civilian  government for representation toward the outside world. The  human rights violations -- 900 devastated villages, hundreds of  thousands of refugees, murders by death squadrons -- are  documented. Even though Bonn broaches the subjects during  official visits to keep the public in Germany quiet, that is  all. However, only pressure from abroad could bring about a  political solution to the conflict.    In particular, Germany, with its considerable possibilities  for exerting influence on the government in Ankara, would be  predestined for that. However, Kohl, Kanther, and Kinkel are  obviously not even remotely thinking of that. They continue to  rely on confrontation with the Kurds in Germany.</p>

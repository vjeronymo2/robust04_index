			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Russian investment surge boosts industrial shake-up A surge of domestic and foreign investment in Russia is boosting the shares of privatised companies and giving much-needed momentum to the process of industrial restructuring, according to financiers. The flow of foreign funds into the country reached Dollars 400m (Pounds 273m) in the first quarter this year, raising hopes of a long-awaited breakthrough in investor interest in Russia, although some experts are less optimistic. Foreign investment totalled Dollars 2.9bn last year. The prices of vouchers which Russians use to buy shares in privatised companies have been rising steadily and trading in some of the 'plum' enterprises has been frenetic, say financiers. The two-year privatisation programme, due to end in June, is now releasing shares of companies in the utility, communication and energy sectors, at knock-down prices. They include the Unified Energy System, the world's largest integrated power generation company; the Lukoil holding company, Russia's largest oil producer and refiner; the Rostelkom telephone corporation; and the Primorsk and Novorossisk Shipping companies, which dominate the Russian Far East and Black Sea maritime routes. Shares in Unified Energy System have risen from an original nominal price of Rbs1,000 (70 US cents) when they were sold to workers to Dollars 2.30 when workers sold their shares in over-the-counter trading and to about Dollars 8 in the national voucher auction, when members of the public bid their vouchers for a 13 per cent stake in the company. Even so, the valuation of the company was extremely low by international standards, according to Mr Boris Jordan, head of the Credit Suisse First Boston branch in Moscow - the largest foreign bank engaged in trading shares in Russia and the only one with a broker's licence from the Ministry of Finance. 'A similar company, producing that number of kilowatts, would be worth about Dollars 49bn in the US (and) over Dollars 30bn in Europe. Here it was worth Dollars 200m. The world has not yet woken up to the fact that Russian assets are so extremely cheap,' said Mr Jordan. In this climate, Russian investment funds, many of them cash-rich from arbitrage activities, are buying enough shares in some companies to control the management board. These funds, say CSFB executives, are now sophisticated, knowledgeable and eager to restructure the companies under their control. Mr Stephen Jennings, CSFB's investment banking director, believes the next three to five years will see widespread change in Russia's industrial sector. Set against the new-found enthusiasm of Russian and foreign investors for privatised companies are the growing number of complaints from foreign business people that rapidly changing laws and tax regimes make large deals unattractive, that organised crime is penetrating business practices, and that the country remains politically and macro-economically unstable.

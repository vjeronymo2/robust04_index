			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Foreign investors stay away from Italian 10-year auction ITALIAN government bonds plunged yesterday after international investors shunned the government's L2,000bn 10-year bond auction, leaving domestic buyers to take up the issue. The futures contract fell from its opening of 95.80 to a low of 94.95, before edging up to 95.00 by late afternoon. The Italian government bond market has been particularly vulnerable since the Danish referendum on Maastricht dealt a severe blow to hopes of convergence and forced investors to focus more closely on Italy's economic problems. At yesterday's auction of 10-year fixed rate bonds, the bids amounted to L2,390bn. The Bank of Italy said the paper was assigned at a price of 95.50 per cent, down from 99.30 per cent at the last sale of the paper on May 29. Elsewhere in continental Europe, German government bonds ended the day unchanged or slightly higher, lifted by the US Treasury bond market. Dealers said the market was lacklustre as participants were awaiting the outcome of talks on the 25 per cent withholding tax on investment income. The French government bond market ended slightly firmer, but dealers said the market was held in check by the prospect of an auction of FFr9bn to FFr11bn of bonds. The French government's announcement yesterday that the referendum on European monetary and political union would be held on September 20 had little effect on the market. However, dealers expect the French bond market to be vulnerable to opinion polls in the intervening period. UK government bonds rallied by up to three-quarters of a point, helped by good demand for long-dated gilt issues and sterling's stability in the foreign exchange markets. The gilt market started on a strong note, following an announcement that Electricite de France plans to buy back Pounds 250m of its sterling bonds, removing some supply from the market. In addition, rumours circulated that an institution had switched a significant portion of its equity portfolio into gilts. Dealers reported lengthening trades and outright buying of long-dated issues. The Liffe futures contract opened at 98.06 and traded up to 98.24 by late afternoon on above-average volumes of about 39,000 contracts. In the cash market, the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 climbed from 116 11/32 to 116 15/16 to yield 9.20 per cent. US Treasury prices bounced back strongly from early losses yesterday after a weaker-than-expected national purchasing managers' report buoyed interest rate cut hopes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  9/32 at 102 25/32 , yielding 7.752 per cent. The two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 11/32 , yielding 4.800 per cent. Prices had opened weaker on a Market News Service report that members of the Federal Reserve's board had told a group of banking economists last week that an interest rate cut was unlikely so long as the economy maintained a steady, if modest, growth path. The market rebounded, however, after the National Association of Purchasing Management announced that its index fell from 56.3 in May to 52.8 in June, and indication of slowing business activity nationwide. The figures came while the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee was meeting in Washington, and bond investors hope the NAPM numbers, plus today's June employment data, will persuade the Fed that the economy needs fresh monetary stimulus. JAPANESE government bond prices climbed on hopes of an easing in interest rates, with cash and futures prices reaching their highest levels since February. Dealers said speculation about a cut in interest rates has arisen mainly because of the fragile state of the Tokyo stock market and the Bank of Japan's recent tolerance of lower money market rates. The unsecured overnight call rate slipped  1/32 to 4 23/32 per cent yesterday. The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue opened at 5.28 per cent and closed at 5.23 per cent, the high of the day. The September futures contract ended at 103.15, just off the high of 103.17 and up 0.20 on the previous day. The Ministry of Finance plans to auction about Y300bn of 20-year government bonds today. Dealers expect a coupon of 5.9 per cent or 6 per cent.</p>

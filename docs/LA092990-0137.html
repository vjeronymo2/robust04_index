			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : TROUBADOUR J.D. SOUTHER FOUND ACTING AN OFFER HE COULDN'T REFUSE  </P> <P> It all fits the pattern, says J.D. Souther about his resurging career.  </P> <P> "It's a cliche to say life moves in cycles, but for me, it does -- in huge,  obvious cycles,"explains the musician recently turned actor. "In the '50s, my  life was full of awesome experiences. In the '60s, it was mostly goofing off,  motorcycle riding, chasing women. The '70s were really productive, and then in  the '80s -- about '82 -- I just went back to partyin' and gettin' high."  </P> <P> Souther's recent upswing might then be predictable, but he appreciates it  anyway. His first actual acting job is featured in the motion picture  "Postcards From the Edge.' He also guest-starred in "thirtysomething" last  season as the rumpled activist with whom Hope was most likely to have an  affair.  </P> <P> But acting marks a major career shift for Souther, who's perhaps best known for  helping define the so-called Southern California sound of the 1970s. Then a  songwriter who collaborated with the likes of the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt and  Bonnie Raitt, Souther wrote or co-wrote hits like "Prisoner in Disguise" and  "Best of My Love." As a solo artist, Souther made the top 10 with a 1979  single, "You're Only Lonely." But his last solo album, in 1985, "was that  unfortunate curiosity that's later called a 'critical success' -- meaning  nobody bought it. After that I just sort of dried up for a while."  </P> <P> Souther got into acting, he says, "because I actually couldn't resist it any  longer. I think it was probably just peer pressure -- my friends kept telling  me I should act." But Since he's gotten his new career off the ground, Souther  adds, his old one is picking up as well.  </P> <P> "It's kind of schizophrenic right now," he says. "Today, I met with people  about two different movie projects, and I spent a couple of hours on the piano.  I am going to make a record this winter.  </P> <P> "Either I'm going 160 m.p.h. or I'm parked," he continues. "I guess I'm going  160 again." LAUREN LIPTON  </P></p>

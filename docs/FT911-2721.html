			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow eases on rekindled inflationary fears Wall Street DATA INCLUDED in first quarter gross national product statistics rekindled infla-tionary fears and left share prices weaker yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 8.66 at 2,912.38. The broader-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also marginally lower, down 0.23 at 379.02. The Nasdaq composite index of over the counter stocks fell 1.39 to 494.69. New York SE turnover was light at 154m shares, and declining stocks outdistanced advancing stocks by 866 to 657. Shares opened lower after the government reported a 2.8 per cent decline in first quarter GNP. The figure was lower than average expectations, and the accompanying release of a rise in the first quarter GNP implicit deflator - an alternative measure of inflation which tracks domestically-generated price rises - to 5.5 per cent surprised analysts. The figure suggests inflation remains a problem in the US, even though economic activity has slowed significantly over the past year. Any sign of inflationary pressures in the economy strengthens the case against further interest rate cuts. General Cinema rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 23 and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (HBJ) fell Dollars  1/16 to Dollars after General Cinema announced it was terminating its tender offer for HBJ bonds in the wake of the failure to agree terms with HBJ bondholders. The termination of the tender offer threatens the completion of the Dollars 1.4bn merger between the two groups. Aetna, the big life insurance company, dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 44 after reporting a fall in first quarter earnings to Dollars 1.25 a share, against Dollars 1.61 a share a year earlier. Mobil, which earlier this week unveiled a big rise in three month profits, announced it was increasing its quarterly dividend by 7 1/2 cents to 80 cents a share. The news eventually lifted the shares Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 68 5/8 . Disney eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 114 7/8 in brisk trading on news of a fall in fiscal second quarter profits to 95 cents a share. The fig-ure was at the low end of estimates, and compared with the Dollars 1.29 a share a year ago. On the over the counter market Pacific Healthcare jumped Dollars 5 1/2 to Dollars 32 1/2 after the company said it expected second quarter profits of between 50 cents and 60 cents a share, a forecast well above expectations. Recognition Equipment fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 7 3/4 after cancelling its proposed debt exchange offer because it could not agree terms with the company's bondholders. Canada SHARE PRICES in Toronto bounced back from a small loss at the opening to end flat for the second straight session. The composite index finished up 4.78 points to close at 3,497.22 and take a slim 1-point rise on the week. Advancers beat losers 261 to 252, and volume of 23.7m shares was below yesterday's 25.3m. Mining and consumer products were slightly lower, while consumer products, energy, financial services and in-dustrial products all ended steady. Noranda reported a slide in first-quarter net to CDollars 15m from CDollars 59m.</p>

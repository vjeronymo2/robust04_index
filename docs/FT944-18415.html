			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Police chief fears Pounds 6m cut would be 'criminal's charter' A Home Office plan to cut Pounds 6m from Lincolnshire's police budget would be a 'criminal's charter', Mr Peter Bensley, the county's chief constable, said yesterday. If the cuts were implemented in April, the consequences would be catastrophic. Leaked government documents suggest that Pounds 11m will be axed from forces throughout England and Wales. Lincolnshire would bear the heaviest blow with 'upwards of Pounds 6m' cut from its spending. Mr Barry Fippard, chairman of the Lincolnshire police committee, said the force appeared to be paying for success. 'If you are good you are penalised,' he added. 'Lincolnshire is a very lean, slim force, and the Home Office is trying to put us on a diet.' Mr Bensley said the proposals were equivalent to closing police stations in seven towns. Lincolnshire police were being punished because of significant efficiency improvements. He was supported by an all-party group of councillors and magistrates from the police committee. The chief constable pointed out that his force had an excellent record of value-for-money policing and had one officer for every 500 people compared with the national average of one to 400.</p>

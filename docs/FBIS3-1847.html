			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Cover Story" by Chen Chia-yao (7115 0857 5069): </F> "Supergroup Produces Pirated Laser Discs"-- first five  paragraphs are YI CHOU KAN introduction]    [Text] The famous Xianke [0341 4430] Group in Shenzhen has  very powerful backing and was once given a lot of support by Li  Peng. It is the only manufacturer of laser discs in the whole  country.    Ye Huaming [0673 5478 2494], chairman of the board of the  company, is the son of Ye Ting [0673 2185], an early-day CPC  leader. He worked in the national defense sector for many years.    According to the findings of YI CHOU KAN, Xianke uses its  sophisticated equipment to produce laser discs without copyright  for Hong Kong manufacturers, provided that the Hong Kong  manufacturer produces a document claiming that it holds the  copyright. Xianke can also undertake commissioned sales through  its massive distribution network.    A staff member of the factory said: Because Xianke "has a  backer in the central government," it is not afraid to do this!    However, at a formal interview with this reporter, Xianke's  general manager denied it.    The car comes to a crossroads and the buildings of Xianke  Laser Group can be seen from a distance. Making the company  worthy of its reputation, the building is tall and imposing,  with a chic exterior design. A huge triangular logo on the wall  gives the air of a large sophisticated factory.    This factory has very powerful backing. Ye Huaming, chairman  of the board, is the son of Ye Ting, one of the early-day CPC  leaders, and a foster son of CPC Marshal Nie Rongzhen. He has  been like a "brother" with Li Peng and the two of them played  together until they grew up. His real brother, Ye Zhengda [0673  2973 1129], holds a high position in the Commission of Science,  Technology, and Industry for National Defense, an organization  with a mysterious background.    At the moment, there is only one company in the whole of  China capable of producing laser discs and that is Xianke. This  is why Deng Xiaoping also inspected this factory during his tour  of southern China in 1992.    But recently there has been some information claiming that  Xianke is producing laser discs that have no official copyright  for foreign firms and is also distributing them on a commission  basis.  <H5>  We Cannot Make Pirated Copies </H5>   To verify this matter this reporter, in the name of a  company, went to Xianke's operation department and, without  beating about the bush, told them that he wanted to have a batch  of laser discs "without copyright" produced.    "We are a newly founded company in Hong Kong. We want to  have some laser discs made for sale in Southeast Asia but we do  not have the copyright for these laser discs. We want to have  them pirated. Is it possible?"    "This is impossible. We cannot do this!" he shook his head  and said. Then quickly he added: "We have a big name (company  reputation). We cannot do these things. We cannot take the  responsibility!" The person who received this reporter was a  Mr. Zhu [2612], manager of the operations department of Xianke  Company.    He sat down and took a good puff at his cigarette. He slowly  blew the smoke out and his tone changed. "But, as long as you  have a proof of copyright, we do not care (about the rest of the  matter)."    "We want to copy laser discs but we just do not have any  copyright proof."  <H3>  There Are Over-the-Table and Under-the-Table Copyright  Proofs </H3>   "This can be done either on the table or under the table. On  the table, our company cannot do this kind of business. But  under the table, we can pretend we know nothing about it and  process products with imported materials to order," he  whispered, his hand covering half of his mouth.    "What I am saying is, though we know it is pirating, we will  not take the responsibility. Do you get the point?"    He then added: "We know nothing about your company and  probably cannot find out where you are at all. We also do not  know if your company exists or not. But we do not care about  this. As long as you give us a written claim to copyright,  stamped with your company seal, it is okay."    "Is it really okay, even if we do not hold the copyright of  the laser discs?" this reporter asked again.    "Of course it is okay. Our company does not care whether or  not you really hold the copyright of the programs on the master  discs. We are only responsible for processing imported materials  and do not worry about anything else," he emphasized.    "If you write a proof of copyright, stamped with your seal,  sign a contract with us, and pay a 50 percent down payment, we  will deliver the goods at the agreed time."  <H5>  Taking Care of Everything Concerning the Job </H5>   It takes only around two weeks from placing an order to the  delivery of goods, he said. As business is good at the moment,  the order books are full till March. For this reason, an order  must be placed as quickly as possible.    He patiently explained to this reporter the calculations for  every section. An order for at least 3,000 copies should be  placed each time because the production cost for each piece is  128 yuan. The price is negotiable for mass production and could  be 120 yuan for an order of 5,000 copies.    "Can a disc purchased from a shop be reproduced?"    "Sure, so long as the laser disc is original, of good  quality, and not a reproduction. We can find someone to make a  master copy."    "Where can it be made?"    "You don't have to bother about that. We can find some  friends locally or figures from high-tech companies in other  provinces. A master tape can be made in a week or so at the  price of HK$40,000 to HK$50,000 (Hong Kong dollars)."    "What about the cover and package?"    "We can make the covers for five yuan each. The  reproduction, which includes the trade mark such as Polygram,  Fitto, and patterns, will be exactly the same as the original."  He explained with a smile: "If the reproduced copies are sold  with the original ones, no one will be able to distinguish the  original from the reproduced ones."    He also proposed reproducing from Fitto rather than Polygram  because management of the latter was stricter than the former.  Our request to reproduce songs from different discs could also  be met.  <H5>  Willing to Sell 1,000 Copies for Us </H5>   "An order for Karaoke discs is generally 3,000 copies. We  can sell 1,000 for you in the domestic market."    "Where would you sell them."    "You do not have to worry about that. We have connections  with a number of provinces, including Karaoke boxes, commercial  arcades, and shops."    He said that production of a film disc is the same as that  of  a Karaoke disc. As the market for film discs is limited, they  usually receive orders for 1,000 each.  <H5>  Delivery of Goods is Safer in Macao </H5>   "When the discs are reproduced, where will they be  delivered?"    "The goods are delivered in Shenzhen. You have to go through  the customs and that is not our responsibility." He said, after  some hesitation: "It will probably be rather difficult to go  through the Hong Kong customs. The companies which have placed  orders in the past have usually left from Macao because the  customs there can be easily passed without trouble. When the  goods arrive in Macao, they can be shipped directly to Southeast  Asia, bypassing Hong Kong customs."    "Upon your request, we can deliver the goods to Zhuhai but  you will still have to go through customs in Macao."  <H5>  More Pirated Laser Discs Are Finding Their Way into Hong Kong </H5>   The number of pirated karaoke laser discs impounded by  Hong Kong Customs has been rising. Early this month 6,000 laser  discs worth $3 million were seized; 10,000 were seized late last  year.    Pun Yeung-kong, Custom's Bureau of Copyright and Trademark  Investigation chief, said these laser discs came from Southeast  Asia, Taiwan, and South Korea. There were no indications of  massive inflows of pirated mainland discs into Hong Kong,  although he could not rule out the possibility that crafty  merchants sold pirated discs overseas via Macao before they were  imported into Hong Kong, trying to divert attention through this  tortuous route.    He said Hong Kong Customs has obtained some information on  illegal laser and compact disc copying by mainland factories and  has provided such information to mainland customs. But it is  not for the Hong Kong Customs to decide how this matter should  be handled.  <H3>  Matters Are Made Easier with Connections Within Beijing's  Officialdom </H3>   By this time the manager was obviously in high spirits. This  reporter asked him: "You must have invested quite a lot for  such an operation?"    "We sank about 7 to 8 billion yuan into it!" said the  manager, taking a company manual from a cabinet. "We are the  only one capable of making laser discs and laser disc players in  the mainland. Look! Deng Xiaoping visited us on his southern  inspection tour... Li Peng, Jiang Zemin, Zhu Rongji, Zou  Jiahua -- all of them have visited us."    He said with glee: "Our president is Mr Ye Huaming, Ye  Ting's son."    "Has being in this business ever worried you?"    "No, we have connections in Beijing. Matters are made easier  with connections within Beijing officialdom!" Then he lowered  his voice whispered: "Hurry up if you want to place an order.  We've heard that the central authorities are going to hit hard  on copyright piracy. Things might not be as good then and we  may have to stand watching the money flow passing us by."    He said Xianke has high productive forces, annually  churning out 5 million compact discs and possibly 1.5 million  laser discs. The output is quite astounding.    During this reporter's "business conversation" with the  manager, he screened a Hong Kong production "Moonlight in Tsim  Sa Tsui East" for the reporter, saying his company owned the  copyright of this movie. But according to the producer of this  movie, Cheung Kuen, the movie had never been distributed in the  mainland, much less selling the copyright to Xianke.    Investigations show that Ye Huaming is closely connected  with  the National Defense Ministry. He himself worked in its Fifth  Research Department for many years. The research department was  founded by his foster father, Nie Rongzhen.  <H5>  Hailed By the National Defense Sector </H5>   Ye Huaming's brother, Ye Zhengda, has also worked in the  national defense sector for many years. He is now deputy  director of the Science and Technology Committee of the  Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National  Defense.    Ye Huaming and Li Peng are both descendants of revolutionary  martyrs but were adopted by "heavyweights" of different ranks  (Li Peng's foster father is Zhou Enlai). They knew each other  as boys, grew up together, and are very nice to each other.  These "sons of Heaven" who emerged powerful at about the same  time have formed a tight relationship network.  <H5>  Vigorous Support From the Leadership </H5>   For this reason, Ye Huaming has had vigorous support in the  few years during which he has tried to make Xianke Corporation a  success. For instance, when the corporation found the  expenditure of importing a Phillips production line exceeded the  budget, Ye went to Beijing to talk with Li Peng. As a result  Xianke obtained appropriations from Beijing for its production  line purchase.    Li Peng also personally attended the ribbon-cutting and  inscription opening ceremony for Xianke.    There have been visits in the past few years from high level  leaders such as Jiang Zemin, Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua, and Liu  Huaqing, greatly enhancing its goodwill.  <H5>  "We Will Never Be Involved in Copyright Piracy!" </H5>   In an interview with this reporter, Tang Shaokai, Xianke  Corporation general manager, firmly maintained that they would  never be involved in copyright piracy and hoped to join hands  with Hong Kong in cracking down on it.    "Is there truth in references overseas that your company  accepts orders for making pirated laser discs?"    "We offer processing and assembly services. But we always  demand proof of copyright, that is effective certification,  before we accept orders. We will not accept any without such  proof."    "What is effective certification?"    "That is the copyright has been purchased; or you have  signed  a copyright contract. That is, for example, this movie is a  production of a certain film distributor. We cannot take  manufacturing orders without such proof."    "If we produce a sheet of paper stating, say, we own the  copyright of this laser disc. Will that do?"    "In principle, no," Tang Shaokai replied swiftly. "Why?  Because a statement written by you cannot prove that you have  the copyright."    "Does your company closely monitor processing and  copyright?"    "It should be so. In general it is pretty tight," he replied  quickly.    "What are your feelings and response to claims by some Hong  Kong and overseas companies in the same industry that your  company is taking orders to make pirated copies?    "Well, right now I don't quite know how to make a response.  Under individual circumstances, it is possible that such a thing  has happened. It is possible that the copyright proof was fake  and we did not discover it. We only have a few people who are  knowledgeable in this area so such a thing may have happened.  But we will never deliberately involve ourselves in copyright  piracy," Tang Shaokai replied.    He also said agitatedly: "As an entertainment company, we  hope that the publishing firms in Hong Kong and the mainland can  join forces. Because copyright piracy has also given us great  pressure and made an impact. We hope that the two sides can  come together and talk about this problem."  <H3>  Ye Huaming Has Worked For the Ministry of National Defense  for 20 Years </H3>   As a child of a revolutionary martyr, Ye Huaming has  always enjoyed special considerations ever since his early  childhood. He was sent to study in a military aeronautical  institute in the Soviet Union in 1953 and has worked in  scientific research organs under the Ministry of National  Defense for over 20 years. He came south to Shenzhen and worked  as director of the city's Scientific Committee as early as 1983  when Shenzhen began practicing the open-door policy.    Not long after he came to Shenzhen, however, Ye Huaming gave  up his official career with the government and engaged himself  in the enterprise sector by setting up Xianke Laser Limited.    An open-minded man as he is, Ye Huaming used to fiercely  criticize the bureaucratic structure of the Shenzhen Government;  he also believes that Shenzhen can "change" politically by  further carrying out the political reform.  <H5>  Hong Kong's Film Producers Suffer Heavy Losses </H5>   A great many small-scale video-producing factories on the  mainland are engaged in illegally reprinting large numbers of  films produced in Hong Kong. Hong Kong's film industry is been  very concerned about the current situation and has estimated the  losses already incurred through piracy at hundreds of millions  of Hong Kong dollars. Ma Feng-kuo, deputy director of the Hong  Kong Film Industry Association, recently revealeed the  seriousness of the matter to the Chinese authorities during his  trip to Beijing with a delegation.    He said: "We have disclosed our opinions to the Ministry of  Culture and the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, telling  them that many small factories on the mainland have been  involved in the illegal production of video tapes and laser  discs of Hong Kong- produced films. However, since most of  these factories are shielded by local governments, the central  authorities have not, till this day, been able to find effective  measures to check such a situation."  <H5>  Films With False Copyrights Run Rampant in Mainland China </H5>   Holding a pile of video tape covers of pirated films, Ma  Feng-kuo shook his head: "We have in our hands reprinted video  tapes of at least several dozen Hong Kong-produced films, yet  all of them have obtained both licenses and projection permits  issued by the Ministry of Culture or by the Ministry of Radio,  Film, and Television. However, since none of the the copyrights  of any of these films has ever been sold to the mainland, we can  say for sure that the copyright certificates held by the  manufacturers of such video tapes are all false."    He indicated that illegally reprinted video tapes and laser  discs of Hong Kong-produced films are circulating on the  mainland through two channels. One is to apply for licenses  with the Ministry of Culture or other organs by using  counterfeit certificates of copyright so that the issuance and  projection of pirated video tapes and discs can be "legalized,"  while the other is to illegally reproduce films in large numbers  and then circulate them through underground channels.  <H3>  Hong Kong Film Producers Are Faced With Losses of Hundreds  of Millions of Hong Kong Dollars </H3>   This huge illegal market has caused heavy losses to Hong  Kong  film producers. "There are tens of thousands of small-scale  cinemas in China with moviegoers totaling hundreds of millions.  The total sum would be enormous if one paid only 50 fen a time.  Judging by the total number of moviegoers on the mainland, Hong  Kong film producers are faced with losses of hundreds of  millions of Hong Kong dollars incurred by illegal reproduction."    He said that, because the legal system on the mainland is  not  perfect and piracy is not considered a crime but a civil  disobedience, it is very difficult to strike really severe blows  at illegal reproduction. "It is of no use to only impose  disciplinary sanctions. The leadership has still failed to give  sufficient support to struggles against illegally reproduced  films.    "Reproduction of films is something similar to the illegal  reprint of banknotes. It is a pity, however, that many  mainlanders nowadays do not consider it as being a crime."  <H5>  Large-Scale Piracy of Karaoke Discs </H5>   Mr. Yang, who is in charge of Polygram Records Limited  Karaoke Discs Department, indicated that illegally reproduced  Karaoke discs have indeed been found on the mainland. With all  the audio and visual effects of the original versions, pirated  discs are either intact copies or selections of original discs.  One can find pirated discs on the mainland only three to four  weeks after the original discs are put on sale in Hong Kong and  the former are usually over 100 yuan cheaper than the latter.  Things are similarly alarming on Hong Kong streets.    A sales department spokesman for Fitto Entertainment Company  Limited noted that no pirated versions of discs produced by his  company are found on the mainland and Fitto has not yet begun  formal issuing of its discs on the mainland.</p>

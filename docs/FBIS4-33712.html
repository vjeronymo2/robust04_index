			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tania Monteiro] </F>   [Text] Brasilia, 7 Jun (AE) -- Admiral Arnaldo Leite, chief  of the Armed Forces General Staff (EMFA), today branded "greedy"  the bankers and entrepreneurs who are speculating on prices.  Like President Itamar Franco and Navy Minister Admiral Ivan  Serpa, Leite advocated punishment for the "greedy" who are  attempting to harm the economic plan. Minister Serpa believes it  is also necessary to restructure the administration of justice  in Brazil in order to make it more expedient.    The two ministers made their statements today after a  ceremony at the Navy Ministry marking the 500th anniversary of  the Treaty of Todersilhas' signing. Franco promised to issue a  provisional measure punishing oligopolies if Congress has not  approved a bill by 8 June punishing cartels, sponsored by PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] Sao Paulo Deputy Fabio  Feldmann.    "In a democracy, it is not enough to just be willing to  punish. There must be laws, and in the case of Brazil, the laws  must be quickly enforced after a crime has been committed,"  Serpa said. He wondered: "Is it right to delay trying someone  who has committed a crime until the statute of limitation makes  the law unenforceable?" Asked about the type of crime he was  referring to, Serpa replied: "I am referring to all crimes  because to me thieves, even if they steal a chicken, are all the  same, despite the fact that here in Brazil there are some  differences in this regard."    Minister Serpa added that he is concerned about oligopolies  in Brazil. He said entrepreneurs must be careful because if they  increase their prices they may be mortgaging their own future,  because with high prices the number of clients drops  dramatically. He believes that "profits, as such, are not a  crime but a sin." "Profits become a crime when entrepreneurs  violate the law," the minister noted, adding that those who  break the law must go to jail. "Criminals should go to jail," he  stated, adding that "unfortunately, few people go to jail in  Brazil."    About the military salary problem, Leite said military  salaries did not deteriorate after implementation of the URV  [Real Value Unit], but food prices are undergoing "tremendous"  growth. Leite blamed the exaggerated price increases on  entrepreneurs' greed.</p>

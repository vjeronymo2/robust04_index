			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Justinian: Jersey's judicial lesson The removal of the deputy bailiff of Jersey from judicial office and consequently from his position as deputy speaker of the island's legislature may have repercussions for the future of this self-governing dependency of the Crown. Whatever the political outcome of public support for Mr Vernon Tomes, his departure provides a rare opportunity to examine the British constitutional position of an independent judiciary, an opportunity missed a year ago when 140 MPs were calling for an Address to be presented to the Crown petitioning for the removal of Lord Lane, the Lord Chief Justice until a few weeks ago. The issue is neatly dealt with in Ferdinand Mount's The British Constitution Now, published last week. Mr Mount faithfully recites the long-standing adherence of this country to the principle of the separation of powers and the constitutional invulnerability of the judiciary. The independence of the judiciary carries two distinct meanings: the independence of individual judges in the exercise of their judicial functions and, second, the independence of the judiciary as a body of judges. The latter concept is concerned with the freedom of the judiciary from interference by executive government or the legislature in the exercise of judicial functions. In modern times the independence implies not only that judges should feel unrestrained by political pressures but also, with the growth of corporate giants, be removed from business entanglements likely to affect them in the exercise of justice. But that was not the issue over Lord Lane's handling of the Birmingham Six appeal in 1989 or the deputy bailiff's dismissal last week. Apart from securing adequately their terms of office and tenure, judges, in judicial decision-making and in other official duties are subject to no authority but the law. It is an axiom of the rule of law that interference with the independence of judges to give their decisions according to the law is detrimental. As Mr Mount puts it: 'No other organ of government is to judge their performances as judges'. What was hopelessly overlooked by politicians and commentators last year in clamouring for Lord Lane's removal was that he was being assailed for having made a mistake - shared by two other appellate judges - in dismissing the Birmingham Six's appeal. The call for Lord Lane's removal was unconstitutional. The fact that no judge has been removed in this way since the Act of Settlement of 1701 escaped the notice of his denigrators. The 1701 Act was the genesis of the irremovability of judges for incompetence on the bench. That act provided that the judges' commissions from the Crown should be made 'quamdieu se bene gesserint' (as long as they are of good behaviour). On that ground, judges are removable only on an Address by both Houses of Parliament. This measure did not of itself create an independent judiciary. Other steps needed to be taken to secure their salaries and pensions. But the 1701 Act was the bedrock of independence, now re-enacted in the Supreme Court Act 1981. For nearly 300 years no judge has been removed by that process. This, as Mr Mount observes, is no trivial custom. It is fundamental to constitutional protection of judges. How then does the case of the deputy bailiff fit into this constitutional picture? His offence was inordinate delay in handing down decisions. No one has doubted the quality of his judgments. They were of a high order, meticulously constructed. What was intolerable was the delay in administering justice. It was his conduct, not in his judging of cases, but in the administrative process that constituted his offence. One of the besetting problems for litigants all over the world is the time they have to wait for a decison to be handed down. There is no means within a legal system of literally forcing a judge to give his decision. Various devices have been sought, such as applying to the judge in open court for him to give his decision so that his failure up till then may be publicly noted. Alternatively it may be that help could be sought from the head of the judiciary, the Lord Chancellor, or from the head of the division in which the judge sits. One ruse comes to mind with the listing last week in a legal magazine of Mr Justice Harman at the bottom of the league of judges favoured by the legal profession. In a copyright case some years ago he reserved judgment for many months. Both parties became agitated at the long silence. They complained to the judge, through his clerk. In desperation the clerk, late one Friday, arranged to have the case put into the Daily Cause List (which lists cases due for hearing), for judgment to be delivered first thing on the Monday morning. Faced with the announcement of the pending judgment, the judge hurriedly concocted it over the weekend. Judgment was duly delivered, to everyone's astonishment. The deputy bailiff of Jersey was given a number of warnings to speed up his delivery of judgments, failing which he would have to be dismissed. The Home Secretary, on behalf of the Crown, had ultimately no alternative. Constitutional propriety was fully observed.</p>

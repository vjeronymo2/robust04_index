			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Revenue is told to improve tax check The Inland Revenue needs to do more to discover whether it is identifying most effectively the companies to investigate for underpayment of tax, the National Audit Office said yesterday, Andrew Jack writes. Its report is generally complimentary towards the Revenue's approach, but says it needs more information about the extent of non-compliance in accounts which are not examined to establish whether its activity serves as an effective deterrent. The report says that in 1992-93 local tax offices screened the returns and accounts of 3m self-employed taxpayers and 780,000 companies to identify additional tax owed of Pounds 2.5bn. The Revenue gathered a further Pounds 1.6bn in that year from the examination of cases by head office and from its specialist branches.</p>

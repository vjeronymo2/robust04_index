			<p>BFN     [Text] The process of demobilizing government forces and  Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] troops in Mozambique has  slowed down in the past couple of weeks almost to a standstill.  It seems there are rows between the two sides over how many  troops are actually turning up, disarming and demobilizing.  There have even been reports that President Chissano has  suspended the government's demobilization. Well, they have all  been meeting about it today, and the United Nations is putting  as brave a face as possible on it, as Barnaby Philips reports  from Maputo:    The UN special representative to Mozambique, Aldo Ajello,  admitted at the end of tonight's meeting that there are serious  problems between the government and Renamo, and nothing  substantial had been resolved, but Mr. Ajello denied reports  that the government had suspended the demobilization of its  troops, and government ministers also said that these reports  were not true. Ministers said the government did stop  demobilizing for a period last week, but restarted again this  Tuesday [3 May]. Nevertheless, Mr. Ajello failed tonight in his  intended aims: Neither the government nor Renamo were prepared  to commit themselves to a final date to end demobilization.  Diplomatic sources say the government, in particular, is  deliberately keeping back many of its best troops from the  disarmament process. A further snag is the case of what has  become known of the missing 12,000 Frelimo [Mozambique  Liberation Front] troops. The government is now claiming its  army is in fact some 12,000 soldiers smaller than was previously  believed. Renamo has been far from happy with this, believing  the government may be massaging the figures in order to hide  soldiers. Mr. Ajello flies to South Africa tomorrow to brief the  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on the situation. When  asked if he would be taking an optimistic message to his boss,  Mr. Ajello replied, it is obvious that a lot more needs to be  done.</p>

This was decided during a working meeting between Ukrainian  Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetsky and Belarusian Defense  Minister Pavel Kozlovskiy in Lvov yesterday.    The ministers said at a press conference on the results of  the negotiations that after the Soviet single armed forces had  collapsed, their equipment and property had been divided.  According to the ministers, there were not enough funds to  acquire new equipment, which makes the two states seek closer  cooperation in all military areas. For instance, the agreement  provides for exchange of military equipment between the two  states. However, the defense ministers stressed that this did  not mean unification of the Ukrainian and Belarusian armies.  Neither did it provide for restoration of a single command.    Radetskiy pointed out that Ukraine had declared its  sovereignty and non-participation in military blocks and that it  regarded the military cooperation only as a bilateral one.  Ukraine will take part in military cooperation within the CIS  only as an observer.    Commenting on the issue concerning nuclear weapons in  Ukraine, Radetskiy emphasized that Ukraine would carry out the  January 14 trilateral agreement between the U.S.A., Russia and  Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian defense minister, the terms  for withdrawal and dismantling of the nuclear weapons have  already been set.</p>

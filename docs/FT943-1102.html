			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Lufthansa to cut debt by DM3bn Lufthansa, the German national airline, plans to reduce the group's long-term net debt by nearly DM3bn (Pounds 1.2bn) by 1997 as part of its overall restructuring and financial recovery. The reduction in net debt will lead to annual interest payment savings of around DM200m a year by 1997 in addition to the DM500m-DM700m in annual savings the company is seeking to achieve from its restructuring and cost-cutting strategy, according to Mr Klaus Schlede, Lufthansa's deputy chairman and chief financial officer. Mr Schlede said Lufthansa would use all the proceeds of the DM1.2bn it is raising from its current rights issue to repay ahead of schedule a DM1.2bn Euroloan maturing in 2000. During a road-show to promote the issue, which is an integral part of the airline's privatisation programme, Mr Schlede also disclosed the airline would retire ahead of schedule another DM500m floating rate bond in the current quarter. The airline has already repaid DM250m of the floating rate bond in July and intends to retire the rest next month. 'By the end of this year we will have reduced our net debt from DM5.9bn to DM4.2bn,' Mr Schlede said. This DM1.7bn reduction would lead to annual interest payment savings of DM100m by next year. In the next two years, two further bond issues will come to maturity including DM300m next year and DM750m in 1996. 'We will repay these loans out of cashflow as we see no need for new indebtedness,' he said. With the repayment of these further Eurobond issues, the group's long-term debt will be cut to DM3.15bn by the end of 1996, close to its three-year target of DM3bn. This will lead to the annual DM200m interest payment savings the group is seeking.</p>

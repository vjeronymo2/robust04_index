LA JORNADA newspaper reported today that it had received an  anonymous telephone call, informing it of the existence of a  message concerning the armed conflict in the southeastern state  of Chiapas. The newspaper added that the message was later found  on a utility pole on a Mexico City street.    The five threatened leaders belong to nongovernmental  organizations and, according to the communique, are accused of  "not supporting the armed struggle movement in Chiapas, and, in  turn, they have betrayed the ideals of many struggling groups."    The threatened leaders are: Sergio Aguayo, president of the  Mexican Human Rights Academy; Juan Carlos Martinez, coordinator  of the Fray Francisco de Victoria Human Rights Center; Alejandro  Camarillo, president of the Mexican Human Rights Commission;  Fernando Ruiz Canales, president of the Law and Human Rights  Council; and Victor Clark Alfaro, director of the Binational  Human Rights Center.</p>

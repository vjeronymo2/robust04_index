			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Detroit television reporter Virg Jacques filed an assault and battery complaint  against Isiah Thomas of the Detroit Pistons, saying the NBA All-Star choked him  and threw him against a car.  </P> <P> There were differing versions of the incident that left Jacques cut on the  neck. Jacques said, "If he says I confronted him or provoked him in any way,  he's lying." Thomas could not be reached for comment, but Piston spokesman Matt  Dobek said that Thomas and center James Edwards, who witnessed the  confrontation, said that Jacques followed Thomas out of the gym, and refused to  let Thomas into Thomas' car. After Thomas gained entry, Jacques stood in front  of the car as Thomas tried to drive away, Dobek said.  </P></p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Irish coalition policies agreed A NEW Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government in Ireland is expected to be in place early next week, following the publication yesterday of a joint programme. The central focus of the programme is on the worsening unemployment situation, and proposes to create 30,000 jobs a year, initially with a fund of IPounds 270m (Pounds 293m) rising later to IPounds 750m, which will be financed out of EC structural and cohesion funds. The two parties have been negotiating the programme since the general election in November, in which no party emerged with an absolute majority. The two parties say they intend to stick to targets on government spending and borrowing set down in the Maastricht Treaty as conditions for economic and monetary union. Party leaders yesterday emphasised their commitment to maintain the outgoing government's policy of defending the punt's existing parity within the ERM. There are growing market expectations however that the past week's pressure on the punt, which has pushed up interest rates to record levels, may force the new government to consider an early realignment. The coalition programme must still be approved by a special delegate conference of the Labour party tomorrow. The parliament reconvenes on Tuesday, when the new government will be inaugurated.</p>

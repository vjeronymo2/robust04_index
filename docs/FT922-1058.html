			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Whitecroft falls 27% to Pounds 4.49m WHITECROFT, the Cheshire-based group which last week announced a sharp cut in dividend to dampen expectations ahead of its results, yesterday reported a 27 per cent drop in pre-tax profits before exceptional items to Pounds 4.49m for the year to end-March, with operating profits halved. The group is undergoing a painful reconstruction. It is still disengaging from property but has largely completed reorganisation of its lighting, building products, medical cotton fibre and textiles businesses, with cost savings now likely. The final dividend wascut to 0.7p, making 4p for the year compared with 10p in 1990-91. Earnings were 5.65p (4.26p) Turnover was down 10 per cent at Pounds 129.19m (Pounds 143.13m). Operating profit was Pounds 4.72m. After interest of Pounds 228,000, pre-tax profits were Pounds 4.49m. Accounts for the previous year were restated to reflect different treatment of reorganisation costs. Operating profits in fiscal 1991 were Pounds 9.45m, the exceptional charge Pounds 3.3m and interest Pounds 3.33m giving pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.81m. Whitecroft took an extraordinary charge of Pounds 6.27m (Pounds 5.05m) in the latest period, relating mainly to its withdrawal from property development. The retained loss for the year was Pounds 5.69m (loss of Pounds 6.98m a year earlier). The group sold its housebuilding division in January, reducing borrowings by Pounds 6m but year-end gearing was still 78 per cent on shareholders' funds of Pounds 45m. Ongoing sales of houses it retained is expected to bring in Pounds 4m, with another Pounds 800,000 of deferred consideration to come. Mr Peter Goold chairman, said all construction was completed and several lettings had now been achieved. The biggest single development is a complex of shops and offices in Sheffield.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / The Property Market: Nimble-footed likely to remain a step ahead - Property shares have lost their lustre in a market beset by uncertainties Property shares have come back to earth with a bump. In the past two months, they have lost more than a sixth of their value, outstripping the 10 per cent fall in the stock market as a whole. In 1993 the mood of optimism buoyed by hopes of a sustained recovery prompted property shares to trade at a premium to assets. But the premiums have proved short-lived. After starting the year on a premium to assets of more than 25 per cent, property shares are now trading at a discount to assets of about 3 per cent. The turnround is not surprising: property shares have only traded at a premium to assets once before in the past 20 years, in the run-up to the 1987 stock market crash. Historically property shares have traded at a discount to assets in excess of 20 per cent. This sharp re-rating of property shares marks a change of attitude towards the sector. A new mood of caution hangs over property shares and - to a much lesser extent - the property market itself. Three main factors lie behind this development: the fall in the bond market this year; the large number of new property issues and rights issues; and a rash of disappointing results from quoted property companies. The most significant of these factors is the performance of the bond market; the fall in bond yields was the main factor driving last year's strong recovery in property values. With the fall in the bond market this year, the property market risks losing some of the momentum behind its recovery. Views differ on the likely impact of the fall in bond values on property. BZW, the securities house, says the decline in the bond market is likely to result in a marked slowdown in the property investment market. It could even lead to falls in the value of properties with high incomes but poor prospect of rental growth; such properties are most sensitive to movements in bond yields. BZW has scaled back its forecast of property asset growth this year from 16 per cent to 10 per cent. In contrast, some analysts believe that the impact of the bond market on property has been exaggerated. Other factors, they say, will sustain a property recovery. First, the volume of money which institutions, foreign investors and property companies are putting into the sector will sustain rising property values. Second, the promise of a resurgence in rental values will encourage the market. 'We are getting close to rental growth for the first time in four years,' said Mr Selwyn Jones of Credit Lyonnais Laing, a broker. Regardless of such market sentiments, there is little doubt that the stock market is now more discriminating in its appetite for property shares. This loss of enthusiasm is largely attributable to the glut of shares being issued by property companies. About Pounds 780m of new property issues, rights issues and convertible bonds have been issued in the past two months. With many more such issues in the pipeline, property companies will have to price their shares more competitively to ensure success. This necessity has been underlined by the failure of last month's public offer for Capital Shopping Centres, a new property company specialising in out-of-town shopping centres, which was only 14.4 per cent subscribed. Yet another factor blunting the stock market's enthusiasm for property shares is the batch of disappointing results recently produced by quoted property companies. With the exception of Slough Estates, most of the results have been below expectations. The shares of the biggest companies have suffered particularly hard in the market fall-out. The value of Land Securities, for instance, has fallen by a fifth this year. The only large property company whose shares continue to trade at a premium to assets is British Land, a reflection of the company's high borrowing to assets ratio and strong management record. But the star share performers have been those of smaller companies. Topping the list is troubled Stanhope Properties, whose shares have risen by 39 per cent in value this year on the back of the acquisition of a 29.9 per cent stake in the company by British land. Stanhope aside, there is a raft of second-tier companies that have either improved their market value or suffered marginal falls in value this year. Helical Bar, Burford Holdings and Capital &amp; Regional Properties, for example, have largely withstood the downturn because some investors believe they have scope to increase asset values through acquisitions, active management or developments. The relatively strong performance recorded by some of these smaller property companies suggests that property companies' fortunes do not simply depend on the movements of the market as a whole. By operating in specific niches these more nimble companies should be able to outperform their larger, slower-footed rivals.</p>

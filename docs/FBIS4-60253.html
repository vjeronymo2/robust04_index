			<p>CSO     [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The  Majles met yesterday in open session, chaired by Dr. Rowhani,  and the deputies from the cities of Dezful, Qazvin, and Bonab  gave speeches. Then Dr. Rowhani discussed the recent crimes and  aggression by the Serbs in Gorazde and the silence of the  international organizations. These remarks were discussed in  yesterday's issue. Continuing, the Majles then went into  consultation. We direct the attention of our dear readers to the  detailed proceedings.  <H5>  'Ali Reza Sadra, Deputy From Dezful </H5>   Despite the imperialist plots, the next century is the  century of Islamic revolution.    The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Sadra, deputy from Dezful. During his speech he  commemorated the anniversary last week of the severing of  relations with America. He said: The world's hidden circles of  power, consisting of the secret Zionist societies and the secret  circles of international Freemasonry, have dreamed a very  dangerous dream in the course of their imperialism and  domination, the dream of the new world order and international  order for the nations of the world in the 21st century.    Continuing, he added: The new plot is the world in the power  vacuum since the Cold War, under the pretext of avoiding  divergence and conflict and apparently with the strategy of  world alliance and unity, instead of international solidarity,  following the realization of world economic, political and  cultural dependence and military security.    The speaker said the new world order is to be achieved  through the establishment of a world empire and a racist,  centralized secular dictatorship with world-devouring America as  leader and center. He said: If it (the new world order) is  achieved, not only will the oppressed nations, and especially  the Islamic nations, not achieve their minimum legitimate  rights, but the international gap between wealth and poverty  among the nations will grow and become much deeper.    He also said: The most important of these preliminaries are  the changes and various international and regional measures such  as NAFTA, GATT, Middle East compromise, the Unied Nations and  changes in the structure of the Security Council and human  rights aimed at achieving world interests and domination.    Sadra also added: The major factor disturbing the dreams of  the leaders of world imperialism, creating difficulties for the  realization of the plot of world dictatorship and threatening it  more every day, is the ever-expanding Islamic movement, and its  pillar of inspiration and motivation is Islamic, revolution Iran.    The deputy from Dezful discussed the fact that even now the  world of Islam must be planned as a center of power in the new  world order, for it is a unified, multi-polar, stable system. He  said: However, the fierce approach world imperialism is taking  towards the prominent manifestations of the Islamic movement is  an illustration of its weakness and impotence, and it unmasks  the evil plots and the savage face of the Satanic powers led by  America.    He discussed the fact that despite these plots, the coming  century is the century of the Islamic revolution. Continuing, he  said: As the center of the Islamic revolution, the Islamic  Republic of Iran is the center of power and guidance for the  roaring waves of Islamic movements and it is reviving Islam in  midst of the ignorance of the 20th and 21st centuries.    He then said: Preserving and reinforcing this authority and  refuge, which is one of the most important necessities of the  age and for the current generation, depends more than anything  else on preserving awareness and unity and absolute obedience to  the exalted leader.    Continuing, the speaker added: Now that the Majles has the  study of the Second Five-Year Plan on its agenda, it is  necessary that more attention than ever be given to the  following, so that with the completion of the First Five-Year  Plan's infrastructure projects and putting them into operation,  we will see the emergence of a prosperous and constructive  economy: we must adopt a policy of economizing, production and  effort, removing oil from the commercial balance, putting the  economic levers into the hands of native, sacrificing forces who  lack the necessary resources, emphasis on agricultural  conversion industries and agriculture, and avoiding excess and  assembly industries.    Continuing, the deputy from Dezful said: It is appropriate  that attention be given to Khuzestan, with its unique regional  position in the country, the Persian Gulf and among the oil-rich  nations of the region, which has seen the greatest damage from  imperialism and the imposed war. In addition to the oil and gas  reserves, it has potential and abundant actual talents in  agriculture, date orchards, medicinal herbs, animal husbandry,  fisheries and other areas. Finally there are great water  resources, of which more than three billion cubic meters leaves  the country annually, and with the water crisis in the region,  each water source is great wealth, sometimes at the level of oil  revenues.    At the end of his speech, Sadra asked the president of the  republic to support the Khuzestan Development and Investment  Company. He praised Martyr Delvari, the commander from  Tangestan, and he praised the leader of this movement, Ayatollah  Dezfuli, whose role has gone unrecognized.  <H5>  Seyyed Fatah Mortezavi, Deputy From Qazvin </H5>   The great nation of Iran expects the Mr. Hashemi's  government  to put the market in order and to deal decisively with violators.    The second preagenda speaker was Mortezavi, deputy from  Qazvin. During his speech he commemorated Army Day and discussed  society's economic problems. He said: The problem of high prices  will be solved either when for some reason demand is reduced or  a balance develops between supply and demand. This will not be  possible without increasing the supply of goods to the level of  demand through increased production.    He added: Praise God the government of Mr. Hashemi has had  great success moving in this direction. It has smoothed the path  and overcome the basic difficulties.    He then discussed the chaos reigning in the market. He said:  The great nation of Iran recognizes Mr. Hashemi as the  number-two figure in the revolution, the powerful hand of  leadership and the management authority. For this reason they  expect his government to put the market in order and to deal  decisively with violators. Unfortunately, this will not be  possible until this chaos no longer exists and each person stops  doing whatever he wants to do, as long as they do not arrest the  public bloodsuckers and leeches, and until they stop making  oppressed people pessimistic about the revolution.    Mortezavi then discussed the Council of Ministers' approval  of province status for Qazvin and the sending of that measure to  the Majles. He said: The Qazvin area has been carefully studied  several times by the Ministry of Agriculture's Office of  Divisions, and its conversion to a new province is recognized as  one of the prominent outcomes of the Agricultural Divisions Law  Enacted in the year 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984]. This is  a law on the basis of which more than 43 municipalities, 145  districts, and about 2,000 villages were formed.    He added: The establishment of the new province was desired  for many years by the people of Qazvin, and they conveyed this  wish in various ways to the officials of the Islamic republic.  An example was the welcoming ceremonies for the president of the  republic in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] and his  very positive and appropriate response to the request from the  people. Another example was the unprecedented welcome for the  speaker of the Majles last year in the month of Mehr [23  September-22 October].    As they welcomed him as the chief of the legislative power  and one of the chiefs of the three powers in government work, he  gave a positive response to their request. They thanked and  praised him, and their thanks to him was thanks to all those  working in the government and working to approve the bill.  Concerning the bill's financial burden, my esteemed colleagues  know that the government's budget is either for current expenses  or development, and each of these cases it is either national or  provincial. Whether the new province is established or not, the  national and province development budgets are each spent based  on the relevant law and regulations, and they have nothing to do  with whether a place becomes a province or not. The same is true  of the current expense budget.    Most of the current expense budget is spent on education and  training, health care and treatment and defense matters, and  whether or not Qazvin becomes a province will not change this.  Yes, if Qazvin becomes a province center, only a few ministries  and organizations, which do not have separate organizations in  Qazvin will need a little budget and some changes, because a  significant number of the offices are now managed as independent  general offices from the province center, or they are managed in  such a way that they are higher than an ordinary office and  their officials are deputy general managers.    He added: It is the opinion of the experts that making  Qazvin  a province center will effectively promote the growth and  development of Qazvin and consequently the growth and  development of the nation. It is a region where significant  investment has been done in industry and where more than 1,000  industrial units are active, ranking it third among the nation's  provinces.    Agriculturally it has more than 240,000 hectares of prime  and  second degree land in the Qazvin Plain alone. The establishment  of the Qazvin Plain Development Organization in the years before  the Islamic revolution is an indication of the extraordinary  potential of this region, which can provide consumer goods for  millions of people. Therefore, establishing the province of  Qazvin means having appropriate and skilled management able to  take effective steps for the growth and development of the  nation and the region. Currently the management in the region  lacks what is needed to solve the region's problems and  difficulties and the existing installations are not suitable for  the volume of work.    The deputy from Qazvin noted: After approval by the Council  of Ministers, the people of the region held numerous gatherings  to offer thanks and praise, and even now their eyes are fixed on  the votes of the Majles deputies, who are the pick of the  nation, and they are counting the moments until voting time.  With the wisdom and insight that we know the deputies have, we  hope they will make more than one million people happy with  their votes and solve this problem of several years standing.    He asked the minister of petroleum for help providing gas  service to the cities of Eqbaliyeh and Zibashahr, he asked the  minister of roads and transportation for help with the creation  of suitable rural roads in the deprived districts of al-Mowt,  Rudbar-e Shahrestan, and Tarom-e Safali, and he issued a memo to  the minister of health care, treatment and medical education  asking for the establishment of hospitals in the cities of  Elvand and Abik.  <H5>  Rasul Sadiqi, Deputy From Bonab </H5>   Imperialism, in clinging to humanitarian issues such as  human  rights, constantly seeks to weaken independent and Islamic  nations.    The final preagenda speaker was Sadiqi, deputy from Bonab.  In  his talk he discussed the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan  and the 8-percent growth under the First Five-Year Plan. He  said: It is the nature of such growth, despite significant  organization, that it is expensive in some areas in order to  achieve the desired production, in such a way that society's  vulnerable classes have faced many problems.    He added: To stop the pressures on the vulnerable classes  caused by growth under the plan through inflation without  adjusting the plan's 8-percent growth rate, which is a basic  rate, special attention must be given to establishing more  effective parameters to control the problems in society.    On the one hand we must make efforts to build national  resolve, using the abilities of all the sincere, believing and  specialist forces and emphasizing the valuable guidance of the  exalted leader in his New Year's message concerning the work  ethic and social order in the building of our Islamic nation.    Continuing, the speaker said: The current issues in the  Muslim world illustrate the truth that world imperialism, in  clinging to humanitarian issues such as human rights, constantly  seeks to weaken independent and Islamic nations, and it will  give up dominating these nations only if they assert their own  authority.    Sadiqi then discussed the crimes of the Serbs in Gorazde. He  said: This damaged city is falling before the eyes of the people  of the world under the harshest methods such as attacks on the  lives and property of the people, and this illustrates the claim  that there seems to be no longer any sign of human beings and  humanity in the heart of so-called civilization, and that the  human rights of the international organizations is merely a  weapon to silence the cries of the freedom-seeking nations.    He issued a memo to the newspapers, especially some local  newspapers. He said: In view of the emergence of nationalist  issues in the world and the processes arising from it,  especially in the nations neighboring us, they must exercise  special awareness. Instead of dealing with spiritual and  cultural issues, they are sowing discord among Muslims by  reinforcing personal ethnic prejudice and indirectly promoting  the ideas of undesirable elements, the supporters of the  Hojjatiyehs and the Khalq-e Mosalman, and spreading lies.  Sometimes this causes problems in the districts and  municipalities. This trend is very dangerous, and I call upon  the Ministry of Guidance to deal seriously with such cases.    The deputy from Bonab thanked the government and the Majles  for compiling and implementing the First Five-Year Plan. He  said: A comparison of the parameters, problems, and approaches  taken in various affairs at the beginning and at the end of the  Five-Year Plan shows the nation's success and progress in  various areas, so that the people of Bonab and Malekan are  waiting for a visit from the president of the republic to open  and put into operation several important and vital projects.  <H5>  Legislation </H5> <H5>  International Air Agreement on Goods Traveling Between Iran </H5> and Greece    The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the report from the Housing and Urban Construction  Commission concerning the Bill on the International Air  Transportation and Shipping Agreement on Goods and Passengers  Traveling Between the Governments of the Islamic Republic of  Iran and Greece (returned from the Council of Guardians), and  this amendment was passed for the purpose of gaining the  approval of the Guardian Council.    Amendment: If the two parties to the agreement are unable to  resolve differences under paragraphs 1 and 2 above, they may  refer the dispute to a three-person arbitration court, adhering  to the relevant laws and regulations.  <H5>  Forests and Pastures Preservation and Utilization Law </H5>   The second item on the agenda was the report from the  Agriculture Commission concerning the Motion To Amend Article 34  of the Forests and Pastures Preservation and Utilization Law,  enacted 3/14/1354 [4 June 1975] and append several notes to it  (returned from the Guardian Council), for which the above  amendment was approved by the Majles.    Amendment to Article 34: As of the date of this law's  enactment, the Ministry of the Reconstruction Crusade is  required within three years to [text missing] the northern  forests and plains and treeless nationalized pastures, which  were converted to orchards or irrigated farms or put to use for  projects to produce livestock and aquatic animals and other  nonagricultural projects by the end of the year 1365 [20 March  1987] after the approval of the Proposed Law on Procedures for  Transferring and Revitalizing Lands in the Government of the  Islamic Republic of Iran and without obtaining legal and  religious authorization to take possession...  <H5>  Law on Teachers, Physicians, and Paramedicals Performing </H5> Compulsory Service    The third item on the agenda was the report on the first  consultation of the Defense Affairs Commission concerning the  Bill To Amend the Law on Teachers, Physicians, and Paramedicals  Performing Compulsory Service, the general form of which was  approved by the deputies.    It is worth mentioning that in the amendment to this law the  phrase "National Technical and Professional Education  Organization" was added to the aforementioned law approved  7/25/1369 [17 October 1990].  <H5>  Authorization Ministry of Defense to Form Development and </H5> Service Companies    The next item on the agenda was the report from the first  consultation of the Defense Commission concerning the Bill  Authorizing the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics  To Form Development and Service Companies, which was approved.    Article 1 states: The Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces  Logistics is authorized, provided it retains its combat  capability and defense readiness, to form development and  service companies after approval from the Armed Forces General  Staff.  <H5>  Urgent Motion Prohibiting Use of Western Names </H5>   The next item on the agenda was the Prohibition on Employing  Western Names, Titles and Expressions, presented as an urgent  motion.    Discussing the motion's urgent status, 'Ali Yusefpur said:  This motion was presented following the emphasis from the  exalted leader on using Persian words and also following the  publication of the thoughts of His Holiness the Imam (peace be  upon him) in this regard. Unfortunately in the last few years on  the streets of Tehran foreign names have been appearing in  abundance on public streets, in newspapers, and in stores. Even  on signs, the Western words are big but the Persian words are  small. Should an Islamic nation, which is the center of the  Islamic revolution and should be setting an example, really be  intoxicating its students with words in the Latin alphabet?  Already the words blouse, shirt, and others are being printed in  the stores as foreign words. Isn't this selling oneself? Why  should some parks be named with foreign names? Unfortunately one  of the officials sent a New Year's card to the deputies offering  the greetings in Latin characters. The greeting is so alienated  that the official uses the foreign term for Majles deputy.  Therefore, to prevent the use of these terms, we presented this  bill to the Majles as an urgent motion.    After talks by opponents and supporters, the bill's urgent  status was put to a vote, was not approved, and was rejected.  <H5>  Motion on Regulations for Foreign Vehicles </H5>   Likewise, the proposed Law on Regulations for Foreign  Vehicles was presented by the deputies as an urgent motion, and  its urgent status was approved by the deputies.    One of the signatories to this motion said in a speech:  Since  the nations who have signed the treaty on trucks have set  special regulations, we must also set regulations in this  regard. The regulations must not be onesided. In those countries  trucks operate in limited numbers, but the trucks native to the  country operate with cheap fuel, without difficulty and without  limitations.    He also noted: We are wasting 50 million tumans per day in  this regard.  <H5>  Weekly Agenda of Majles Commissions </H5>   What follows below is the agenda for the weekly meetings of  the commissions from Sunday to Wednesday this week:  <H5>  Islamic Art and Guidance and Mass Media Commission </H5>   Urgent Motion on Supervision of Foreign Trips by Government  Employees  <H5>  Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission </H5>   Bill on Uniform Salaries for Retirement and Compulsory  Service  <H5>  Economic, Financial, and Cooperative Affairs Commission </H5>   Study of the questions from Mr. Astaneh and Mr. Nabovati to  the minister of finance  <H5>  Plan and Budget Commission </H5>   Study of the Second Five-Year Economic, Social and Cultural  Development Plan of the Islamic Republic of Iran  <H5>  Industries and Mines Commission </H5>   Mr. Habibian's question to the minister of mines concerning  the production and export of the units of the National Steel  Company, especially those of the Mobarakeh Steel Complex and the  Iron Foundry.  <H5>  Judicial and Legislative Affairs Commission </H5>   Continued Consideration of the Islamic Punishments Bill  <H5>  Foreign Policy Commission </H5>   Joint meeting with the minister of foreign affairs, the  minister of intelligence and the minister of Islamic guidance  concerning the future of tourism in Iran.  <H5>  Health Care and Welfare Commission </H5>   Discussion of the Motion on Supervision of Foreign Trips by  Government Employees  <H5>  Post, Telegraph and Power Commission </H5>   Invitation to the minister of power to answer the question  from Mr. Musavi  <H5>  Agriculture and Rural Development Commission </H5>   Study of the request from Mr. Mokhtari concerning the  development of Fuladshahr, attended by the minister of  agriculture and the minister of housing and urban construction  <H5>  Islamic Culture and Education Commission </H5>   Motion To Prohibit Having More than One Job  <H5>  Special Commission </H5>   Motion To consolidate the Ministry of the Reconstruction  Crusade and the Ministry of Agriculture</p>

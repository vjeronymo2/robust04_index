			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan pressed on beer monopoly - Regulatory bureau must satisfy Gatt by dismantling its own role Political reform has ended the one-party system in Taiwan, but the island remains a one-beer state, thanks to Taiwan Beer, which contributes much of the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year that goes to the government as a monopoly producer of alcohol and tobacco. However, the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau is now under pressure to satisfy the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by ending its regulatory role and dismantling its monopoly. The one-beer policy is a legacy from the 50-year Japanese colonial administration which began in 1895. Monopolies were established to control trade in opium, camphor, salt, tobacco, spirits, matches and petroleum. When the then Nanjing-based Kuomintang government took control of the island in 1947, it commandeered all breweries, wineries and distilleries and continued the Japanese administration's monopoly. Imports are allowed, and on September 1, some 137 countries will be permitted to sell alcohol in Taiwan, compared with 122 at present. However, with Taiwan Beer made from rice, and thus quite different in flavour to western brews, traditional Asian alcoholic beverages made from sorghum and rice, as well as Japanese alcohol, remain banned. Japanese beer is sold in Taiwan, but only where it has been produced outside Japan. Under this regime, the market penetration of imported beer is little more than 5 per cent, with Taiwan Beer accounting for around 94.5 per cent of sales in 1993 on annual production of 465m litres. However, Taiwan Beer's market share has fallen, from 96 per cent a year earlier, while beer imports rose by 62 per cent in the year to June 30 1994. In fiscal 1994, the Monopoly Bureau's alcohol and cigarette sales raked in NTDollars 91.5bn (Pounds 2.2bn); while net profits have yet to be released, they are expected to amount to some NTDollars 60bn. The bureau's substantial earnings are divided between central and provincial government, with the former receiving 65 per cent and the latter 35 per cent. Taiwan Beer produces four types of beer, in three breweries: bottled lager, keg beer, canned beer and an unsuccessful dark beer marketed under the label Baodao ('treasured island'). A light beer was launched several years ago but discontinued due to poor sales. The company has also revived plans to produce a low-calorie beer to compete with the influx of foreign rivals. Taiwan Beer contains 4.5 per cent alcohol and 2 per cent sugar. The new brew is to have 2-2.5 per cent alcohol and 1.5 per cent sugar. But the promotion and advertising of alcohol is currently highly restricted. Advertising for foreign brands of beer is restricted to 120 magazine insertions per year per label. Importers of spirits are permitted to advertise in magazines for one year after the brand is first brought into Taiwan. Thereafter they may not advertise. Television, radio, billboard or any other type of advertising or promotion is banned. The monopoly bureau does not advertise Taiwan Beer or any other alcohol which it produces. Importers are lobbying to have these rules eased once Taiwan joins Gatt. Foreign beer makers are also hoping they will eventually be permitted to establish bottling factories in Taiwan, which would reduce production and freight costs. Other Taiwanese alcohol, such as the fiery sorghum liquor, Kao Liang, is likely to be less affected by implementation of Gatt, than beer, but there are import tax implications. Taiwan is already the biggest market in the world in sales of XO grade cognac in terms of absolute volume. Brandy imports soared 70 per cent in the year ended June 30 to 406,828 cases of 12, while whisky imports jumped 66 per cent to 542,029 cases. 'All western products are now extremely popular in Taiwan,' explains Mr King Lai, managing director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising's Taiwan office. 'Before martial law was lifted in 1987, people never saw these products because the market was closed. Now many Taiwanese are travelling overseas; they've become more international in outlook and they're wealthy.' But US alcohol is subject to far more lenient tax treatment than European alcoholic beverages, with the tax on cognac and armagnac running at NTDollars 1,000 per litre and on Scotch at NTDollars 440 per litre, compared with NTDollars 198 per litre on US and Canadian whiskies. These discrepancies will need to be eliminated. The government has yet to determine how a post-Gatt tax system will work, or when it will be implemented. New rules are expected to go into effect on January 1 next year. The Europeans are lobbying for a tax based on alcohol content and the US is pushing for an ad valorem system. But the Taiwanese may settle on a combination of both, while devising a system which retains a degree of protection for local products.</p>

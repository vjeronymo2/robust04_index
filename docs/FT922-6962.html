			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: GPG declines to Pounds 2.39m GPG, Sir Ron Brierley's UK investment company yesterday announced a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.46m to Pounds 2.39m in the year to March 31. The company blamed lower interest earnings of Pounds 693,000 (Pounds 2.94m) and a lack of abnormal items, against Pounds 5.8m last time. Profits before interest and abnormals increased from Pounds 728,000 to Pounds 1.69m. The shares have been suspended since December 1990 because the company was thought to be a 'shell'. Attempts to lift the suspension had so far proved unsuccessful. Sir Ron complained of a 'Kafkaesque, impenetrable bureaucratic maze' at the Stock Exchange.</p>

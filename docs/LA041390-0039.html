			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-ABORTIONIST STIRS STRONG REACTIONS  </P> <P> Thanks for your article on Susan McMillan, the outspoken pro-life activist.  </P> <P> Many papers are shrinking from presenting objective coverage on people who are  "on the wrong side" of the abortion issue -- those who believe it takes life.  Susan has generated much controversy because of her stance against abortion and  because she is articulate, wealthy, and visible. I felt your reporter captured  McMillan's warmth and depth of conviction fairly, and let her quotes stand for  themselves.  </P> <P> KRISTY HILLER, Irvine  </P></p>

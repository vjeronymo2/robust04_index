			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Markets: Traps that investors cannot understand - Serious Money Investment is an art masquerading as a science. The City is packed with analysts trying to crunch numbers into smaller pieces than their competitors. But personal investors hoping that a single key statistic can open the door to stock market riches are set for disillusionment. Most investment decisions are complex and still have a strong subjective element to them. What is more, many of the numbers themselves are surprisingly open to question. This week, for example, a new study examined one puzzle: why was the price/earnings ratio on the FT-SE-A All-Share index in August more than 3 percentage points higher than stockbrokers' p/e estimates? Most of the discrepancy was explained by differences in the ways the two groups calculate the figures. Especially interesting, though, was why their chosen methods varied. They were trying to measure slightly different things for very different purposes. The FT indices are intended to measure what actually happened, in the most objective way possible. They look back and aim to provide a yardstick of historical performance. Their p/e ratios are based on the latest 12 months' earnings (that is, the two latest half-years added together). And they make relatively few adjustments to companies' reported figures. Stockbrokers' p/e ratios are based on the forecasts by their analysts of the earnings companies will report in the present year. They relate to a later time period than the FT's. And since this period is in the future, the earnings figures are, necessarily, subjective estimates. What is more, the analysts' main interest is not so much what profits companies will report but their underlying profitability. So, if company accounts contain unusual items depressing or inflating the reported profits and earnings, the analysts tend to remove them. This is because their job is to tell their clients which shares look cheap or expensive - and a company's future earnings potential is one of the major considerations in share assessment. Thus a company which appears as an actual loss-maker to the FT's recording angel can be turned into a magnificent recovery stock at the flick of an analyst's calculator. Which approach is right? Both are - on their own terms. And both can be useful to the intelligent investor if he understands their function. Problems arise when investors expect too much, or misunderstand the raison d'etre, of any statistic (and all professionals agree that even forward-looking p/e ratios are only one factor to consider in valuing a share). Such problems can be expensive, particularly when a historic measurement is deemed to have some predictive power. Consider unit trust performance measurement. Analysts agree that conventional performance tables are no use in predicting which trusts will do well in future. The two main UK fund measurement services, Micropal and HSW, are both now calculating volatility figures as well: these tell you not just where a fund got to over a certain period, but how erratic its progress was. They are designed to measure risk. Both firms also produce figures which combine risk rating with performance measurement to give a risk-adjusted rate of return: a common enough statistic. A fund with an outstanding performance, which is also very volatile, might score the same as a less volatile fund with a worse performance. Micropal goes one step further, though: it ranks funds within a particular sector and awards them star ratings of one to five according to their risk adjusted performance. This is where its service starts to get contentious. Experience suggests that investors presented with five-star funds and one-star funds will tend to buy the former because they expect them to do better in future. Micropal makes no such claims, and is at pains to point out that investors need to look at all the figures rather than home in on the star rating. But at least some professional investors in the UK worry that risk-adjusted figures are positively misleading if used as a guide to future performance - and that making them the basis of a star system is to invite misuse. In the US, the best known fund rating service, Morningstar, has its own system for awarding star ratings. Earlier this year, a study showed that funds rated five-star by Morningstar performed indifferently thereafter. But stars glitter - particularly in the eyes of marketing men . . . Wiseheads will mutter 'caveat emptor'. But how can the ordinary investor be expected to avoid a trap he cannot understand? The call for the final instalment of BT3 (see page V) raises one crucial question: is BT itself worth holding? The outlook for the telecommunications giant should be better than its recent past suggests. The shares have done substantially worse than the stock market as a whole since late 1993. In part, this is because analysts have been impressed too much by its domestic competitors, and too little by BT's existing strength, resilience at home and international potential. BT is a riskier investment than it used to be, but the shares look fair value.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Crisis Over North's Nuclear Issue and the </F> People's Attitude"]    [Text] Public sentiment, which had shown little distress  characteristic of a mature disinterest, has now started to  display a gradual uneasiness. It has been reported grocery  stores are crowded with people stockpiling packed Chinese  noodles, tissue paper, and butane fuel. Anticipating and  preparing for a disaster is a natural act of a head of a family  and this is an act not to be criticized. Our people are  instinctively accustomed to preparing for a disaster with the  irrational unpredictable group ruling in the North.    We need to ponder, however, if our immediate reaction to  overcome the present crisis should be stockpiling daily  necessities. Will stockpiling material goods really help us get  out of the serious crisis we might be facing? Will we be able  to boil the Chinese noodles if the water and electricity supply  is cut off in a high-rise apartment?    Instead, we ought to begin to exercise self-restraint and  pull ourselves together. We should rectify the trend of society  that is moving toward depravity in which imprudent people do not  care about the country or society in their decadent extravagance  and in which people in their selfish indulgence do not know the  virtue of living together. We must turn these social conditions  into a healthy social environment.    To this end, we should refrain from making vain assurances,  political circles should stop the insincere habit of dividing  and feuding, and the leading circles should reflect if they have  given up the habit of hurting the other side even in a crisis.    The North's motive in continuing war threats against us,  while it has no possibility of winning the war, is evident. The  North intends to cause confusion and damage in the South,  thereby securing an advantageous position in negotiations. What  is the way to stop in advance the North's provocation, which the  North can perpetrate foolishly. Our natural resources were not  responsible for the material wealth we were able to attain from  the helpless poverty and scars of war -- it was our spiritual  ability that enabled us to achieve what we have today.  Therefore, what the North's reckless group fears is our  stubborn spiritual ability. If we run about in confusion and  panic, the North will focus on this disaster. We should  maintain a firm stance and arm ourselves with the will to  overcome the national crisis. This could lead the North's  rulers to reconsider their foolish illusion.    The government is setting up a contingency plan to cope with  an emergency. Instead of stockpiling, which is prompted by  selfishness and which causes confusion, we should help the  government carry out its plan to deal with the crisis and  explore ways to survive together. This is a more effective way  to cope with the crisis. Civil defense exercises, training  programs, and air-raid and disaster drills should realistically  educate citizens to overcome the emergency. We are confident we  will win. To win, however, everyone should not neglect his or  her responsibility to overcome the crisis. Now is the time  everyone should be aware of this.</p>

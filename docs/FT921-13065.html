			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Japan and US in public sector computer accord The US and Japan signed an agreement yesterday allowing US computer companies to bid for lucrative Japanese government contracts, AP reports from Washington. With President George Bush looking on, Ms Carla Hills, the US trade representative, and Mr Michio Watanabe, the Japanese foreign minister, signed an accord that allows the US industry to break into the Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5bn) computer market controlled by Japan's government. Unlike voluntary targets the two governments announced on Japanese purchases of US cars and car parts, the computer agreement is binding, Ms Hills said. Still, she said, if US officials found Japan was maintaining trade barriers to either computers or cars, 'there are actions we can take' to restrict Japanese imports. Mr Bush predicted the pact would mean 'dramatic gains in exports and therefore in quality American jobs' in the US electronics industry. Under the deal, the Tokyo government, which now buys Japanese computer products almost exclusively, will open up its bidding process, allowing foreign manufacturers the same data and timetables it provides domestic producers. The US computer industry estimates it can increase exports to Tokyo from Dollars 500m to between Dollars 3.5bn and Dollars 5.5bn. That would be in addition to the Japanese private-sector business conducted by US computer companies. They enjoy a 41 per cent share of Japan's private mainframe computer market, but have only 0.4 per cent of the government's computer purchasing market. Ms Hills said the US and Japanese governments would also be working out similar agreements to open the paper and glass markets. 'These are the sorts of things that came out of the trip that didn't get anywhere near as much coverage as I think they deserved,' Ms Hills said.</p>

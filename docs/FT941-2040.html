			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Smith attacks VAT rise Labour yesterday stepped up its attack on the government's handling of the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel by accusing Mr John Major of creating a tax loophole for the better off, David Owen writes. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said it was 'deeply unfair' for the better off to avoid a tax obligation, which millions of others had to shoulder, by paying for gas and electricity supplies in advance. Mr Smith told MPs that the prime minister had revealed 'the Tory attitude to tax in a nutshell'. This consisted of 'loopholes for the better off and everyone else has to pay in full'. In ill-tempered exchanges Mr Major accused Labour of getting up to its 'old tricks' by telling people how to spend their own money. He said the Labour leader had chosen not to mention the Pounds 2.5bn over three years which the government had earmarked to help compensate the less well-off for higher fuel bills. The Labour leader's attack came just a day after Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, accused gas and electricity companies of depriving the government of millions of pounds in potential revenue by allowing customers to pay for future consumption before the introduction of 8 per cent VAT on fuel on April 1.</p>

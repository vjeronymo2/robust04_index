Abou also noted that such  an agreement would create the correct impetus, as he put it, for  achieving an overall Cyprus solution.    In a statement after his meeting with Foreign Minister  Alekos  Mikhailidhis this morning, Abou described the contacts he had  with President Glavkos Kliridhis and Gustave Feissel [the UN  secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus]  as very important in view of the report on the Cyprus issue,  which he will start preparing for the EU's Council of Ministers.    Asked if the CBM's are compatible with EU norms, Abou said  the United Nations has assured him that there is no problem.  But, he added, there is no easy answer to this issue.  Answering another question on Turkey's stance, he noted that  during his recent visit to Turkey, he received assurances that  Turkey supports the CBM's.    Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said in his statement  that the government will assist the observer in his task in  every way. He added: The government's goal is to explain to the  EU observer the government position on how the various  approaches toward a Cyprus solution are linked with Cyprus'  efforts for accession to the EU.    Abou completed his orientation visit and left Cyprus this  afternoon.</p>

Before leaving for India this morning, Lech  Walesa said that one of the reasons behind the dismissal of  Marek Markiewicz from the post of chairman of the National Radio  and Television Broadcasting Council was the public signing of  the license for PolSat. The president said that he would  appoint a new chairman of the Council after his return from  India next week. Lech Walesa added that, despite the dismissal  of Markiewicz, the Council should carry on working as usual.</p>

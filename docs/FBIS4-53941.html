			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- A majority of South  Koreans believe that democratization has made considerable  progress under the Kim Yong-sam administration compared with  those of his two immediate predecessors. An opinion poll found,  however, that Koreans also think there has been little  meaningful change in "the quality of life."    Compared with President Chon Tu-hwan's government, cleaning  up corruption, fair trials, protection of human rights and  equality for women have made great strides under the Kim  administration, many people said. But the present government has  achieved little in the areas of law and order, medical welfare  and housing, they said.    The opinion poll, conducted by the Social Science Research  Center of Seoul National University, involved 1,198 men and  women above the age of 20 across the nation. Titled  "Democratization and the Quality of Life," the poll was  commissioned by the Education Ministry. Conducted since November  1993 and giving no figures for margin of error, the report was  published Monday.    Asked to rate democratization on a scale of one to 10 with  the lowest score representing "complete dictatorship" and 10  denoting "complete democracy," the Chon Tu-hwan regime earned  3.35 points, the No Tae-u government 4.85 points and the Kim  administration 6.63 points.    With regard to the quality of life, the pollees gave 4.53  points to the Chon government and 5.82 points to President Kim.    Concerning their expectations for an improved quality of  life  in five years, provided that the current democratization efforts  succeed, the respondents gave 7.04 points. If, on the other  hand, democratization fails and the military grabs power again,  the quality of life will plunge, they said, giving only 3.98  points in that event.    Asked about the quality of life for the nation as a whole,  the Chon administration received 4.57 points and the Kim  government 5.88 points. Had Chon Tu-hwan continued to rule the  country, the people thought the quality of national life right  now would rate 4.65 points, the poll found.    Invited to predict the situation five years from now if  democratization succeeds, the quality of life earned 7.5 points.  The figure plunged to 4.01 points when the pollees were asked to  predict life in five years under a military government.    Queried on the impact democratization has had on the quality  of economic life, political activities and individual  lifestyles, 52.6 percent replied that there has been little  effect. Some 40.2 percent felt there has been a "slight"  improvement in their lives because of democratization while 2.4  percent said "very much." Some 3.7 percent said the quality of  life has worsened slightly while 0.7 percent said it has become  "very bad."    Asked to evaluate the Kim administration's reforms and  classify them into three categories -- success, no change or  failure -- the approval rating for cleaning up corruption was  86.5 percent, fair trials (63.9 percent), reflecting the  people's wishes in government policies (57.1 percent),  guarantees on equality for women, (54.4 percent) and protection  of human rights (50.4 percent).    On the whole, 50 percent of the respondents said the Kim  administration has succeeded in its reform efforts.    On the other hand, the approval rating for equal  distribution  of wealth was a mere 32.6 percent, establishment of law and  order (35 percent), housing problems (35.6 percent), medical  welfare system (38.6 percent), rise in educational opportunities  (24.2 percent), press responsibility (49.1) and economic  development (49. 1 percent).    When asked to single out the most important element in  democracy's development, 24.5 percent said a guarantee of  economic well-being: 23.2 percent opted for economic  development: 20.8 percent for fair and just execution of the  law: 15.9 percent for elimination of the gap between the haves  and have-nots: 10.2 percent for political freedom, and 4.7  percent for free competition among political parties.</p>

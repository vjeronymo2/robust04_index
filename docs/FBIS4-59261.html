			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Khartoum, 11 May (KNA/PANA) -- Alarmed over the  fate of tens of thousands of its nationals working in embattled  Yemen, the Sudanese Government has decided to evacuate those of  them who wish to return home.    The Commission for the Affairs of Sudanese Working Abroad,  Wednesday [11 May] urged the Sudanese living in Yemen who might  wish to be evacuated, to proceed to a Sudanese vessel now  anchored at the north Yemeni al-Hudaydah port on the Red Sea.  The commission said in a statement issued in Khartoum that the  national airline, Sudanair, would arrange a flight to the north  Yemeni capital, Sanaa, on 14 May to evacuate Sudanese. It urged  those wishing to take the flight back home to register their  names at the Embassy of Sudan in Sanaa.    No arrangements were announced for the evacuation of  Sudanese  from Aden, capital of south Yemen. The commission said it had  set up a task force comprising concerned government bodies and  opened an operations room to accomplish the job.    Tens of thousands of Sudanese nationals were employed in the  two Yemens as doctors, teachers, workers and journalists, among  other professions. [passage omitted]</p>

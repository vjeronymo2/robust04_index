			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Jan 8 (AFP)--A gas explosion ripped  through a mine in the northeastern Chinese province of  Heilongjiang in October, killing 70 miners, THE WORKERS' DAILY  [GONGREN RIBAO] revealed Saturday.    The blast was sparked by a short circuit in the wiring  system, igniting gas that had been allowed to build up in the  shaft by the failure of the mine's ventilation system, the  newspaper said.    All 70 miners working in the shaft at the time of the  explosion were killed, it added.    The explosion at the Baohe mine followed a similar blast  there in January 1991 that killed 53 workers.    Industrial accidents claimed 11,600 lives in China last  year,  more than double the 1992 figure.</p>

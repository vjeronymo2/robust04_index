			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: IBCA maintains Barclays rating IBCA, the London-based rating agency, is maintaining its AAA rating on Barclays, the largest UK clearer, writes David Lascelles, Banking Editor. Although the bank is suffering a high level of domestic loan losses, IBCA says that a UK economic recovery will cause these to fall sharply. IBCA says certain parts of the group are not earning adequate returns, including BZW, the investment banking arm, and the group's international operations. But Barclays' strong core business should enable it to ride out recession.</p>

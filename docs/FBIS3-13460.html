			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A pro-Vatican magazine has quoted a Vatican diplomat  as saying that there is a possibility that the bombing of the  Sayyidat al-Najat Church [on 27 February] was perpetrated to  protest the establishment of diplomatic relations between the  Vatican and Israel. The Vatican diplomat revealed that the Holy  See received signals in December that an attack against a  Christian target in the Middle East was inevitable. He added:  We feared attacks against Christian targets in the Middle East.  He noted that the earliest signs of such a possibility emerged  around Christmas, when the agreement between the Vatican and the  State of Israel was signed.</p>

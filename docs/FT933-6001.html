			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (12): Remnants of empires - The exotic mixture that is old Malacca 'THAT is Christ. You know who Christ is?' says the Portuguese descendant as he points to an altar clearly lit up inside his home. We are in the Portuguese settlement, a mile outside Malacca on the west coast of Malaysia. It is the night of the cultural show, and Portuguese Square, remnant of a long-gone empire, is strung with lights to attract the tourists. Malacca first grew up as a port in the 15th century. It has always known how to market itself. When traders needed a well run port, where rules were made and kept, Malacca offered it. The town prospered as one of the earliest gateways to the east, home to wave upon wave of settlers and colonial powers. The city is still selling itself today, but its audience now are tourists rather than merchants. Malaysia's only designated 'historical city', its past is now providing for its future. In the central museum an entire hall is filled with colourful tableaux showing the wedding ceremonies of the many ethnic groups that came to the city. In reality, five centuries as a Straits settlement gave birth to a hybrid people. The Malay bride of Malacca wears anything from seven to 13 national costumes on her wedding day, parading in each. In the Portuguese settlement, the speciality, advertised on the Lisbon Restaurant's neon sign, is prawn sambal, a traditional Malay dish; and the dancers in the cultural show are dressed in Malay costumes. In old Malacca, Malaysia's oldest Chinese temple, a mosque and an Indian temple all stand within yards of one another. The Chinese houses have Portuguese tiles on their front walls, Portuguese homes are built on stilts, Malay-style. But the authorities are determined to make things easy for the busy tourist. The answer is the Malacca theme park, where all can be sated. On a bend by the river there is a Malay kampong, or village, housing two further miniaturised villages. In the old quarter, and equally stylised, is the world of the Baba-Nyonya people, the Chinese who settled here and took up local ways. Here, the Straits Chinese present a mix of cultures, replete with Venetian mirrors, Victorian chandeliers, and ornate Chinese furniture. In a warren of nearby antique shops, artifacts are piled high. The charm is real, but the goods look a little short on history. The other side of the river is the Dutch town hall and church, painted deep red. And, in case of doubt, a 15-foot-high model windmill. Beyond these, for those seeking global norms, there is the shopping mall, bowling alley and leisure complex, built on land reclaimed from the sea. In the city centre, modern-day China town, with its stores full of bicycle wheels and jars of pickle, draws the bargain hunter away from the confusion of cultures. But, back at the remnants of the Portuguese fort and the old British planters club - now an independence memorial - huge concrete models of Malay bullock carts quickly restore the feel of fantasy. Here, every night, an hour-long sound and light show puts the whole picture into a new perspective. Suddenly, six cultures are no longer six, but one. Like a litany the narrator returns every few minutes to his driving theme: Malacca is where it all began. And what began in Malacca was not the blend that is Baba Nyonga, which is never mentioned. What began in Malacca was Islam, and Malay nationalism. Now the tourist is made to understand that it is the Malay identity that is, was and always will be at the heart of Malacca. Arab traders brought Islam to Malacca, from where the city's people spread the word of Allah throughout south-east Asia, the 'spectacular' explains. And it was the people of Naning, just inland of Malacca, who most fiercely defended the Malay way, by rising up against the Portuguese, Dutch and British colonialists. Here, too, is where the independence movement began. In the flash of a light, the ancient port's flow of Indian and Chinese traders is negated, as the show explains that the British introduced racial tension to Malaysia by importing workers from the sub-continents. The courting of tourism seems forgotten as the need for political correctness comes to the fore. Ironically, though officialdom may point to the city as a monument to all that is Malay, it is the descendants of the Straits Chinese that come in their droves to rediscover their roots. More than 3m tourists came to Malacca in 1992, of whom nearly two-thirds were daytrippers from Singapore. The opening of a second crossing from Singapore should see their numbers rise still further, as the travel time by road comes down to 2 1/2 hours. Old Singapore may be hard to find, but old Malacca is not. In fact nothing could be easier. The city has recognised a niche market. Its heritage has not just been retained, it has been improved upon. The developers have been held at bay in much of the city's heart, although its fringes have given way to the obligatory high-rise hotels. More than 1m tourists stayed in the city in 1992, spending Dollars 350m, equivalent to more than 15 per cent of the state's gross domestic product. There are hopes for more tourist dollars in 1994. The success of the 'Visit Malaysia Year' in 1990 was too good not to be repeated, and the government is full steam ahead to repeat the exercise next year. In the meantime, one people or six, the Malaccans' cash registers are ringing out.</p>

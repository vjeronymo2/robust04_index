			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Mozambique leaders sign peace treaty PRESIDENT Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique and Mr Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the rebel Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo) movement, yesterday signed a treaty ending the country's 16-year civil war, which has crippled it economically and left over 1m people dead. The treaty, signed at the Italian Foreign Ministry in Rome, marks the end of the last big conflict in southern Africa, which began shortly after Mozambique's independence from Portugal in 1975. The two sides agreed to a ceasefire, which should come into force as soon as the treaty is approved by the Mozambique parliament later this week. Under the terms of the deal, weapons will be handed over to the United Nations and all armed groups are to be disbanded within six months. A restructured armed force is to be created, made up of around 30,000 fighters taken equally from both sides. The Mozambique army and rebel forces must assemble at pre-determined locations around the country within a month of the treaty being ratified. To encourage fighters to participate, UN soldiers supervising the ceasefire will hand out food supplies at the assembly points. Big aid donors to Mozambique will meet for a conference within a month, while Zimbabwean soldiers guarding two strips of territory between their landlocked country and Mozambique's ports will have to leave in the same period. At a formal ceremony at the Rome ministry, Mr Chissano heralded the beginning of a 'new era' for Mozambique. Mr Chissano said general and presidential elections would take place in Mozambique and called on UN representatives to help supervise the peace and electoral process. The deal concludes negotiations which began in July 1990 and reached a first agreement on limited ceasefire in December that year.</p>

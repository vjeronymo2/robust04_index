			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Dianlong (1776 3013 7893) and correspondent </F> Chen Yilin (7115 0076 2651)]    [Text] Fuzhou, 13 Feb (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, member of  the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission,  inspected work in Fujian Province from 8 to 13 February. He  also called on officers and soldiers stationed there.    During the Spring Festival holidays, Liu Huaqing, braving  drizzling rain, extended regards to workers at the Dongdu Dock  worksite and its second-phase project and at the Customs joint  inspection house in Xiamen, conveying to them and the people of  Xiamen the cordial solicitude of the party Central Committee,  the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. On 11  Feburary, after hearing a work report by Jia Qinglin, secretary  of the Fujian provincial party committee and governor of Fujian,  Liu Huaqing said: By implementing in-depth Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, implementing the  guidelines of 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, as well as the  Central Committee's series of major decisions, persisting in  making economic construction the central task, and adopting  effective measures, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee and  the provincial government have brought about a sustained, rapid,  and healthy development of Fujian's economy, quadrupling the  province's gross product seven years ahead of schedule. Liu  Huaqing said: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee has issued the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee  on Some Issues Concerning the Establish of a Socialist Market  Economic Structure." Therefore, leaders at all levels should  become acquainted with new situations, study new issues, learn  new knowledge, persist in simultaneously building material and  spititual civilizations, handle well the relationship between  overall interest and partial interest, and concentrate their  efforts to accelerate economic development. He said: Since  Fujian and Taiwan are separated by only a strip of water, the  two sides should enhance their nongovernmental exchanges and  strengthen their economic and technological cooperation. People  on both sides of the strait will be happy if our economies  become strong and powerful.    During his stay in Fujian, Liu Huaqing, accompanied by  Nanjing Military Region Commander Gu Hui, called on the officers  and soldiers stationed in Xiamen, encouraging them to preserve  and carry forward the traditions of the Red Army in the new  situation and to strengthen army building in accordance with the  general requirments -- all army units must be qualified  politically and competent militarily. They must have a fine  style of work, maintain strict discipline, and be assured of  adequate logistical support -- as put forward by Central  Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin.    Liu Huaqing called on basic-level officers and soldiers of a  group army on 13 February. He said: The People's Liberation  Army bears the historic mission of protecting and building the  country. At no time and under no circumstances should it forget  this sacred duty and function. In the new situation of reform,  opening up, and establishing a socialist market economy,  officers and soldiers of the whole army must work hard, be  selflessly dedicated, and subjugate personal interests to  collective interests. Partial interests must be subjugated to  overall interests and army building must be subjugated to the  overall interests of national economic construction.    He said: China's cause of liberation was achieved with the  blood of tens of thousands of revolutionary martyrs. The  establishment of New China has not been easy. It is because of  the hard work of a few generations of people that it has  developed to this day. Every generation should cherish our  present-day achievements. Every soldier must contribute to the  country's political stability and economic development.    Liu Huaqing stressed: The key to improving army building  lies in cadres. Party committees and leaders at all levels must  keep constant tabs on their work of training cadres, enforce  management and requirements strictly, and strengthen education  and studies; they should bring into full play the subjective  initiative of cadres at all levels as well as the role of  veteran comrades in passing on experiences, giving help, and  setting an example in training new cadres, and follow the method  of letting higher-level units guide and educate lower-level  units. Leaders at all levels must show sincere concern for the  weal and woe of soldiers, solve practical problems of  basic-level officers and soldiers, and guarantee that the  working, living, and recreational conditions for basic-level  cadres and soldiers are good in order to ensure that the masses  of officers and soldiers will be content with their jobs at  basic units in the army and continue to make contributions to  the country.</p>

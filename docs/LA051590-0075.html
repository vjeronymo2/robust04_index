			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREYHOUND HELD UNFAIR TO DRIVERS  </P> <P> The drivers' union striking Greyhound Lines Inc. scored a victory Monday when a  federal investigator said that the company engaged in unfair labor practices in  the walkout.  </P> <P> That finding, if upheld by the National Labor Relations Board, could result in  the company being forced to give the striking drivers their jobs back.  </P> <P> Jerry Hunter, general counsel for the NLRB, on Monday authorized the board's  regional office in Milwaukee to file an unfair labor practice complaint against  Greyhound, sources said.  </P> <P> If the NLRB files the complaint and it is eventually upheld, it could force  Greyhound to give back to union members the 3,000 jobs that the company has  given strikebreakers since the strike began March 2.  </P></p>

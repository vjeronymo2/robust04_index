			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Office Automation (19): Experience is more valuable than documentation - Consultant's Critique The information that people write down tends to be that which is easy to structure. It is often obvious. Anyone who has tried to write a procedures manual for any job soon finds that it is easy to describe which forms are filled in but much harder to describe how to acquire the information to do so. Lawson Mardon's use of Lotus Notes has the ability to capture experience. The conversations that occur on the system provide a knowledge base that would be hard to obtain in any other way. Anyone joining the company can read how other people have handled particular cases. In addition, they can pick the brains of more experienced staff without having to interrupt them. The effect of interruptions on work flow should not be under-estimated. This unstructured collection of experiences can be periodically edited and organised. It is usually essential to do so to save staff the effort of trawling through the originals. In many electronic mail systems, there is a frequently-asked questions file. This encapsulates replies to the most common queries and forms a useful starting point for any newcomer. Another benefit from the system is the audit trail that Lotus Notes provides. It tracks all the transactions including errors and subsequent corrections. This forms an invaluable basis for quality programmes and possible BS5750 certification. I was pleased to see the mix of technologies used. Far too many systems expect clerks to become database programmers. While a database language carries power, it also requires different disciplines from those in common use. The use of forms via Lotus Notes gives users a metaphor they are familiar with. Lessons from this study are: There are enormous benefits in capturing experience and making it available to newcomers. Electronic mail messages become a valuable audit trail. Most people are not programmers.</p>

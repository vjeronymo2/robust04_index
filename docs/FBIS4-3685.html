			<p>BFN     [Text] Bishkek, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese  Premier Li Peng and President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan today  agreed to solve the border issue between the two countries  sometime soon.    In two and half hours of formal talks here this morning, the  two leaders agreed to pace up work to turn previously-reached  agreements into a legal form and, meanwhile, continue friendly  negotiations on the remaining issues, according to a Chinese  spokesman.    With sincerity from both sides, the two leaders are  confident  that the border issue "will be successfully resolved in not too  long a time," the spokesman said.    Li said that an early agreement on the border issue will be  of great significance to the enhancement of Sino-Kyrgyz  relations. He also hoped to see the common border become "a  bond of peace and friendship as well as a bridge towards the  promotion of economic prosperity."    Akayev, voicing agreement with Li's remarks, said Kyrgyzstan  hopes to solve the border problem left over from history at an  early date. China and Kyrgyzstan share more than 1,000  kilometers of common border.    Kyrgyzstan fully understands that an early settlement of the  border issue will be of great importance to the promotion of  mutual trust and friendship between the two countries, the  president said.    He described Li's visit as "of historic significance to the  further promotion of Kyrgyz-Chinese relations."    What's more, China's clear-cut principles for developing  friendly relations with Central Asian nations, which Premier Li  stated in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent, are of great  significance to peace and stability in the whole Central Asian  region, including Kyrgyzstan, he said.    As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China  plays  a special positive role in international affairs, he noted,  adding that Kyrgyzstan will learn from China's experiences,  including those in handling international relations.    He hoped that the two countries would maintain consultations  and cooperation in international organizations.    Li said China is ready to work for the constant growth of  its  traditional friendship with Kyrgyzstan.    Akayev asked Li to convey his invitation for President Jiang  Zemin to visit Kyrgyzstan, saying the augment of his country's  overall cooperation with China is "in the paramount national  interests of Kyrgyzstan" and represents a priority in its  foreign policy.    Akayev agreed with Li's proposal for building up a new silk  road, saying Kyrgyzstan will work towards the establishment of  such a path of cooperation and friendship.    "Kyrgyzstan will always see China as a friendly neighbor and  a reliable partner of Central Asian nations," the spokesman  quoted Akayev as saying.    Akayev, in evaluating the momentum of bilateral trade and  economic cooperation, said China has become an important trade  partner of Kyrgyzstan. He expected to see bilateral trade and  economic cooperation raised to a new high.    He also invited Chinese enterprises to invest in Kyrgyzstan.  A high-level delegation of Chinese entrepreneurs is traveling  with Premier Li throughout the tour of Central Asia.    Kyrgyzstan has set up joint ventures with China's Xinjiang  Autonomous Region with positive results, he said, adding that  vast potentials exist in this regard.    Li agreed that China and Kyrgyzstan should expand  cooperation  in trade, economic, scientific, technological, cultural and  other fields.    While bilateral trade has seen considerable growth in the  past few years, this has been primarily achieved within border  trade, Li said. "I agree that bilateral economic trade  cooperation should be expanded on the basis of equality and  mutual benefit."    He said that the Chinese Government adopts a positive  attitude towards Chinese enterprises' investment in kirghizstan.    On regional issues, Li said China supports the maintenance  of  central Asian nations' friendly relations with each other and  with Russia.    Akayev said that the central Asian nations' relations with  Russia are "historically formed over the years and it is very  important to maintain a good relationship with each other."    During the talks, the two leaders also had an in-depth  exchange of views on other regional issues.</p>

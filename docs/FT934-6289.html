			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: One in four farm animal breeds in danger of extinction, FAO warns Over a quarter of the 4,000 breeds of animals used for food and agriculture are in danger of becoming extinct, warns a report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. If only 5 per cent of the breeds are being lost every year says the FAO, 'the average loss could be about one breed a week'. The most endangered species are in Europe, says the report. Breeds under threat include the Regina cattle, in northern Italy, whose milk produces Parmesan cheese, the North Ronaldsay sheep of the Orkney islands that survive on seaweed, and the Yakut cattle of northern Siberia. 'A large number of European breeds are under threat because of their perceived lack of economic competitiveness,' says the FAO. It classifies breeds as endangered if there are 1,000 or less breeding females or less than 20 breeding males. Natural disasters, wars and indiscriminate cross-breeding are important causes for the extinction of breeds, it says. In Asia and the Pacific, the report details 51 breeds at risk, including the Min Pig, which his highly prolific and disease-resistant and capable of surviving in low temperatures, and Javanese Zebu cattle, a breed described as 'highly fertile, hardy and resistant to tick-infestation'. Breeds at risk in North America include Florida Cracker cattle, one of the first to enter the United States, and the Imperial Sheep, which is capable of breeding almost all the year round. In Latin America, the Canastra pig, of Brazil, is said to be at risk and also the Blanco Orejinegro cattle, of Colombia. 'Much of the genetic base of indigenous breeds is being eroded by 'grading up' with exotics,' says the FAO. Animal production contributes about 30 per cent to the total value of food and agriculture and diversity of farm animals is vital for food production for future generations, the report points out. It suggests that breeds should be regularly monitored and incentives given to encourage their use and maintenance.

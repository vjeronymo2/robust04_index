The bioindustrial science park of Canavese  made its first steps yesterday in Ivrea. The Canavese  Bioindustry Park limited company was established. Its founders  include the RBM biomedical company, Finpiemonte (regional  holding company), Federpiemonte, Assindustria Ivrea, Olivetti,  the Turin provincial authority, and the municipal authorities of  Ivrea and Colloretto Giacosa. The design and construction phase  of the bioindustry park will take place over 1994-95 and in 1996  the park will begin to manage the services that will be made  available to the companies housed there.    The initial cost of the park is estimated to be 30 billion  lire for 8,000 square meters of laboratories that will be made  available to university researchers and private companies  beginning in 1996. In the area located in the municipality of  Colloretto Giacosa, on the outskirts of Ivrea, a staff of up to  400 will be involved in activities related to the  pharmaceutical, chemical, environmental, veterinary, food and  agriculture, and medical sectors. Ivrea ensures that this is  the first initiative of its kind in Europe with an entirely  biotechnological vocation.    Europe is playing a fundamental role in the development of  the park because 21 billion lire come from funds for projects  promoted by the EU [European Union] for areas of industrial  decline (which in Piedmont include the province of Turin and  Verbano-Cusio-Ossola). The Canavese initiative is part of a  second allocation of investments, to be made over 1995-96 and  amounting to more than 583 billion lire to be divided between  public and private projects for the two areas of Piedmont.    "In the first semester of 1994," said Industry Councillor  for  the Piedmont Region Giuseppe Cerchio, "the first phase involving  an investment of 558 billion lire will be completed." The new  projects concern a wide range of sectors, but special emphasis  has been placed on technological innovation and the construction  of science parks. "For this area," explained Cerchio, "the  overall investment amounts to 53 billion lire, 37 of which come  from EU, government, and regional funds while the remaining sum  has been covered by promoting committees that have already been  established and that include the municipal authorities,  organizations, companies and private groups." The completion of  the Lake Maggiore park, which began with the first part of the  program has also been approved.    Funding will also be provided for a feasibility study on the  Caselle aeronautical science park -- which the regional  authorities will support in the future -- and the Canavese  technology district will be approved. However, as far as these  last projects are concerned, these are only the first steps  pending other operational programs.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck cuts 600 retail managerial jobs SEARS, Roebuck, the large US retail and financial services company, has announced a reorganisation of its retail group's field management structure. The move will eliminate 600 jobs and bring cost savings of about Dollars 50m by next year. Sears said it would close 10 regional offices and 26 of its 72 district merchandising units by mid-April. Responsibilities at the remaining districts will be broadened. The move comes just over a month after the company said it would cut 7,000 retail jobs to save it Dollars 50m this year. In addition to reducing the workforce, Sears said yesterday it would lower its compensation rates for sales personnel who sold on commission. This would bring them more in line with the competition and change the company's policies on such costly matters as overtime. Mr Edward Brennan, chairman, said that while cost-saving programmes to date had improved the bottom line by reducing the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues, 'we need to do much more to be successful in this highly competitive environment'. Sears said it was studying its retail headquarters staff and field staff offices to see how to reorganise their structures.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Observer: Foul Japanese carmaker Mitsubishi seems to have scored an own goal by luring German soccer star Franz Beckenbauer away from Mercedes- Benz to be its chief pr 'personality' in Europe. There were loud grumblings among Dutch fans attending this week's opening of Mitsubishi's glitzy new European headquarters in Amsterdam. As Mitsubishi is also making its European manufacturing debut through a joint venture with Nedcar, the Dutch government-backed carmaker, wouldn't it have been better to have given the job to the Netherlands' legendary Johan Cruyff, instead of hiring an expensive German transfer?</p>

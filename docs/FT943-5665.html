			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Linx A 'significant improvement' in the second half enabled Linx Printing Technologies to report a pre-tax profit of Pounds 332,000 for the year to June 30. The outcome amounted to less than a quarter of the Pounds 1.43m achieved last time, but reflected 'an encouraging second six months of trading' following the deficit of Pounds 391,000 incurred in the first half, directors said. Turnover of the group, which manufactures continuous ink-jet printers, fell 9 per cent to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 11.9m). Earnings emerged at 1.7p (7.1p) and a recommended final dividend of 0.75p (1.73p) makes a total of 1p (2.08p) for the year.</p>

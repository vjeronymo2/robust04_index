			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah called the  bombing at Sayyidat al-Najat Church an atrocity and lamented the  death of innocents. The bombing, he said, signals a new pattern  of attacks on places of worship. He added that the crime is  designed to disturb the country's security and political life  and unsettle the public's renewed sense of civic peace.    Israeli hands cannot be absolved of this crime, whose  purpose  was to divert attention from the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque  and trigger a new cycle of violence in the country, Fadlallah  stated. He called on the authorities to uncover the evil hands  that carried out the crime.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Leading Article: Safety first 'I HAVE a great capacity for resisting imperatives,' President Francois Mitterrand quipped at the height of the French political crisis last week. In the event, the imperatives proved too strong even for as inventive a political acrobat as Mr Mitterrand. However much the President may have disliked it, the replacement of the outspoken and unpopular Mrs Edith Cresson could hardly have been avoided after the disastrous performance of the Socialist Party in the regional elections. Mr Mitterrand's hesitations in choosing her successor are more understandable. No doubt, he would have preferred to have nominated Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission President. That would have provided the government with the new blood it desperately needs, while in no way undermining its image of economic rectitude. However, with an eye on his own presidential ambitions in 1995, Mr Delors understandably declined to be associated with a discredited regime. The President's eventual choice as new Prime Minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, has a justified reputation as a successful manager of the French economy. Thanks to rigorous fiscal policies, he has brought down inflation to 3 per cent, lower than that of any of France's European Community partners, while achieving a growth rate still expected to reach about 2 per cent this year. But whereas he is certainly the businessman's and financial markets' choice, it is doubtful whether he can turn himself into a really popular leader, able to reverse the anti-Socialist trend, before next year's parliamentary elections. That task will be made all the more difficult by the fact that he has little room for manoeuvre. Mrs Cresson's controversial personality was not the only reason for her government's unpopularity. Her administration was, above all, identified with high unemployment, well above the European average at nearly 10 per cent, ironically the result of Mr Beregovoy's policies and not her own. To find an effective solution to this and other social problems, while maintaining a tight fiscal and monetary stance aimed at reducing inflation and keeping the franc stable in the European exchange rate mechanism, will tax the new Prime Minister's economic management skills. No radical change of direction can therefore be expected from Mr Beregovoy, who remains in overall charge of economic policy, as underlined by the cosmetic appointment of a much younger, but economically inexperienced, new Finance Minister, Mr Michel Sapin. The attempt to balance the Socialist old guard with less conventional government ministers such as Mr Jack Lang and Mr Bernard Tapie, the flamboyant entrepreneur, is unlikely to do much, if anything, to enhance the government's credibility. The underlying reason for the present regime's lack of support resides in the erosion of confidence in President Mitterrand himself, now in his 11th year of office. Unless Mr Mitterrand goes ahead later this year with planned constitutional reforms which will reduce the presidential term from seven to five years, and apply the new rules to himself, it seems improbable that, even with a reshuffled government, the Socialists can turn the tide.</p>

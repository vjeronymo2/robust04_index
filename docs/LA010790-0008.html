			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> "What Are We Doing to Our Children?," KTLA's program on the foster care and  juvenile justice system, presented an honest, realistic and disturbing  portrayal of what happens when parents fail and children are left at the mercy  of an overwhelmed and ineffective governmental agency. What is more alarming is  that, with the increase in drug use, domestic violence, infant abandonments,  etc., we are seeing more and more children swept into a whirlpool of  instability and danger.  </P> <P> Gary Traxler, North Hollywood  </P></p>

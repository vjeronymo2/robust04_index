			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: Rapid Renault-Volvo merger urged A RAPID merger between Renault and Volvo is 'indispensable' for the development and privatisation of the French car company, Mr Gerd Longuet, France's industry minister, said yesterday. But the two companies, which have had cross shareholdings in each other since 1991, and the French state, which owns 80 per cent of Renault, are still deep in negotiation over the balance of power between French and Swedish interests. A conclusion to these negotiations is unlikely before next month. The key issue for Renault and its state owner is whether and in what proportion French institutional investors might be brought in as a counter-weight to Volvo, before the rest of the state's holding in Renault is sold off to the French public. Last month Renault was put on the Balladur government's list of 21 companies to be privatised over the next few years. Renault and Volvo have had significant industrial success in bringing their management, production planning, design and purchasing together since 1990-1991. The government's general privatisation bill, now before parliament, has advanced the merger discussions, because the bill would also remove the 25 per cent limit on private shareholdings in Renault. At present, AB Volvo, the Swedish car company's holding group, has 20 per cent of Renault, which in turn has 8 per cent of AB Volvo, and both companies hold sizeable stakes in each other's individual car and truck operations. Passage of the privatisation bill, expected in mid-July, would not only allow Volvo to raise its stake in Renault, but also permit some big French investors to enter into its capital. The French privatisation practice has been to arrange noyaux durs, or groups of theoretically long term share holders, before floating the rest of state companies off on the stock market. Volvo said yesterday it had been aware for some time that the French government was considering some kind of golden share or core group of investors in Renault after privatisation. It added: 'We cannot comment on the issue of changes in ownership at Renault.' Mr Longuet also yesterday expressed his impatience with another privatisation candidate, Groupe Bull. He said the state-controlled computer company had still not produced a 'tough enough' business plan to show it could do without recurrent French state aid.</p>

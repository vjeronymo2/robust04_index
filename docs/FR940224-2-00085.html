Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> A. Goals of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) is located within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Although different from the other ACF program administrations in the specific constituency it serves, ADD shares a common set of goals that promote the economic and social well-being of families, children, individuals and communities. Through national leadership we see: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Families and individuals empowered to increase their own economic independence and productivity; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Strong, healthy, supportive communities having a positive impact on the quality of life and the development of children; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Partnerships with individuals, front-line service providers, communities, states and Congress that enable solutions which transcend traditional agency boundaries; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Services planned and integrated to improve client access; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A strong commitment to working with Native Americans, persons with developmental disabilities, refugees and migrants to address their needs, strengths and abilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emphasis on these goals and progress towards them will help more people with developmental disabilities to live productive and independent lives integrated into their communities. The Projects of National Significance program is one means through which ADD promotes the achievement of these goals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two issues are of particular concern with these projects. First, there is a pressing need for networking and cooperation among specialized and categorical programs, particularly at the service delivery level, to ensure continuation of coordinated services to people with developmental disabilities. Second, project findings and successful innovative models of projects need to be made available nationally to policy makers as well as to direct service providers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> B. Purpose of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) is the lead agency within ACF and DHHS responsible for planning and administering programs which promote the self-sufficiency and protect the rights of people with developmental disabilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (42 U.S.C. 6000  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (the Act) supports and provides assistance to States and public and private nonprofit agencies and organizations to assure that all people with developmental disabilities receive the services, assistance and opportunities necessary to enable them to achieve their maximum potential through increased independence, productivity and integration into the community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act stresses that individuals with developmental disabilities typically: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Experience significant functional limitations due to physical or mental, or a combination of physical and mental, impairments; and is manifested before the person attains age 22 (as described in the Act, section 102(5)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Possess significant abilities of which employers are generally unaware; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Have wants and needs; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Remain unserved or underserved; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ABORTION: Pro-choicers demonstrated by the thousands Sunday, and now they're  moving into South County to round up allies from an unlikely but potentially  vote-rich source: Leisure World. . . . A Planned Parenthood auxiliary group has  been established in the Laguna Hills retirement community -- the first such  seniors group in the western United States, the organization says. . . .  Pro-choicers, realizing that seniors are much more likely to vote than others,  note that Leisure World has about 21,500 residents. Steve Emmons and Dana  Parsons  </P></p>

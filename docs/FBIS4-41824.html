			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev believes  inviting neighboring Iran and Turkey to take part in  negotiations on Nagorno-Karabakh would be a positive factor.  Aliyev was speaking on Sunday as he received the special  Russian presidential envoy Vladimir Kazimirov at talks on  Nagorno-Karabakh in Baku.    The Russian diplomat arrived in the Azerbaijani capital from  Iran, where he had had consultations with that country's foreign  ministry officials. He said consultations with the Turkish  Foreign Ministry were due to be held shortly.    President Aliyev would like the current cease-fire to be  used  to speed up the process of negotiations. At the same time  Aliyev said that Azerbaijan's conditions for a final political  agreement remained unchanged -- Armenian armed detachments must  be withdrawn from captured territories and Azerbaijani refugees  returned to their homes.    President Aliyev promised that supply lines would be  restored  and the safety of Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenians as citizens of  Azerbaijan ensured. President Aliyev said that a discussion of  Nagorno-Karabakh's future status would depend on the  comprehensive implementation of all those requirements.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: HK bourse chief to focus on quality of Chinese stock Dr Edgar Cheng Wai-kin, who yesterday was elected chairman of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, said that under his stewardship the exchange would continue reaching out to China, but that he was more interested in strengthening the quality of Chinese companies listed in the territory than increasing their numbers. He said he would strive to ensure that the Chinese companies already listed in Hong Kong would provide benchmark examples of good governance. 'Obviously, I would like to continue to see Hong Kong as a strong capital formation centre as well as a major trading centre for Chinese securities.' Dr Cheng, son-in-law of the late business tycoon Sir Y. K. Pao and chairman of World-Wide Investment, a non-listed part of Sir Y. K's business group, was elected chairman initially for one year, but if re-elected could serve three terms - as did Dr Cheng's predecessor, Dr Charles Lee. He therefore stands to steward the exchange through the colony's return to Beijing rule in June 1997. He has strong connections with Chinese officials, and is a Beijing-appointed Hong Kong affairs adviser. Dr Cheng is active in business circles in Hong Kong and Singapore, and for the past three years has served both the stock exchange and the futures exchange at committee level. Relations between the colony's two exchanges were hurt last week when the futures exchange unveiled plans to launch futures contracts on selected equities, a move for which it secured government blessing but omitted to consult the marketplace in order to ensure confidentiality and a competitive edge. The stock exchange, saying the move posed questions of added risk and volatility, believes the market (including itself) should have been consulted. Dr Cheng's appointment, which takes effect immediately, follows a week of council elections that spurned many of the colony's big broking names. Mr Alan Murray, director of Jardine Fleming, the brokerage jointly owned by Jardine Matheson and Robert Fleming, lost his seat, while Mr Philip Tose, founder and chairman of Peregrine Investments - one of the most successful local securities and merchant banking houses - and Mr John Mulcahy, managing director of UBS Securities in Hong Kong failed to secure representation.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lords back amendment on religion - Education Bill TWO defeats, over opportunities for religious education in sixth form colleges and academic freedom, were inflicted on the government by the House of Lords last night. Dr George Carey, the archbishop of Canterbury, was supported by prominent Conservative backbenchers as well as opposition peers on the religious issue. By 17 votes (106-89) they carried an amendment to the Further and Higher Education Bill designed to ensure that the syllabus of sixth form colleges should provide for religious education and weekly collective worship. The government was defeated by 14 votes (86-72) on an amendment moved by Lord Beloff (C) which curbed the powers conferred on the Education Secretary to intervene over the appointment of higher education staff and on other matters.</p>

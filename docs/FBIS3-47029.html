The five, who were among thousands of Japanese left behind  in  northeastern China in the chaos at the end of the war, were  accommodated at a government facility for war-displaced Japanese  in Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture, following their arrival at  Narita Airport.    The five women from Heilongjiang Province in northeastern  China have nobody to sponsor them in Japan and came to Japan at  their own expense, Health and Welfare Ministry officials said.    The new arrivals, aged between 59 and 78, brought the total  number of war-displaced Japanese women who have sought residency  since September to 39.    A group of 12 Japanese women came to Japan on September 5,  followed by a team of 17 women on November 26 and another group  of five women on December 6.    The Japanese Government said last month it will accept some  1,000 Japanese women left behind in China at the end of World  War II if they express a wish to return to Japan.    Health and Welfare Ministry figures show there were 1,759  war-displaced Japanese women in China as of the end of March  last year, of whom some 1,000 are believed to want to return to  Japan permanently.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- A government advisory panel  issued a report Tuesday [21 June] calling for a net revenue  surplus to fund welfare spending by hiking the consumption tax  to more than offset multiyear tax cuts.    The Tax Commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister,  left out specific figures which politicians will decide on later  but showed implications for continuing the 6.2 trillion yen  income and other tax cuts already implemented this year and  raising the 3 percent consumption tax to above 6 percent in  April 1997.    In the report, the panel strongly recommended the government  to offer concrete promises such as "medium-term numerical  targets and programs" on fiscal and administrative overhauls to  win taxpayers' support.    Commission Chairman Kan Kato handed the report over to Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata, leaving sufficient time for the  government and the ruling coalition parties to detail the tax  reform by the end of this month and enact it into law by the  year-end.    Japan promised the timetable in its March market-opening  package.    But uncertainties are mounting on the political side with  the  largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party preparing to launch  a no-confidence motion against the minority-rule coalition  government.    Apparently to avoid unnecessary political disputes over the  sensitive issue of raising the sales tax, the panel avoided  specific figures, and it also spelled out as "minority opinions"  that the tax hike be limited only to fund the tax cuts while  leaving the issue of securing a revenue surplus for welfare  spending toward the 21st century for further discussion.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead NEWSAGENT and retailer John Menzies comes out with interims on Monday expected to show pre-tax profits of about Pounds 3m. This is good or bad - depending on how you look at it. Last year's Pounds 4.2m profit was depressed by exceptionals of Pounds 4m due to losses at Hammicks. Forecasts for the year ended April 30, bolstered by Christmas turnover, run between Pounds 27.5m and Pounds 29.5m against Pounds 21.5m a year earlier. A modest 15 per cent growth in pre-tax profits to around IPounds 30m is being predicted for Fyffes' year-end results due on Tuesday. Analysts believe that the Dublin-based fruit and vegetable wholesaling group has had a reasonable year, despite the recession in the UK market. Although banana sales may have been down, there has been buoyant growth in other fresh produce sales. The market continues to hold expectations of a link-up with a distributor in continental Europe to expand the group's operations. The share price has risen substantially in recent months.</p>

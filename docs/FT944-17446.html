			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Danish economy grows at 5.7% Denmark's gross domestic product increased by 5.7 per cent in the second quarter against the same period last year, taking the growth rate for the first half year to 5.4 per cent (in constant prices), according to the official Statistical Office. The first half recovery was led by consumer demand, which soared by 8.1 per cent compared with last year. Exports grew by 6.8 per cent, with second-quarter exports up by 9.6 per cent. Gross fixed investment increased by 3.2 per cent. The rapid increase in demand generated strong import growth, with imports up by 13.6 per cent in the first half and by 17 per cent in the second. The Danish recovery is supported by strong demand for exports, but it was also stimulated by a major boost to domestic demand from government fiscal policy last year. Widespread conversion of mortgage loans from high coupon to low coupon bonds last autumn and in the spring also made a significant contribution to consumer spending by reducing the cost of servicing mortgages.</p>

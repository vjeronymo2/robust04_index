			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRITON'S PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS SOLD TO SCHERING  </P> <P> Triton Biosciences Inc. said Friday that its pharmaceuticals business will be  sold to Schering AG, a Berlin-based pharmaceuticals company with worldwide  marketing that is trying to increase its presence in biotechnology.  </P> <P> Alameda-based Triton, a unit of Houston-based Shell Oil Co., is not strictly a  biotechnology company, but much of its research and development is based on  biotechnology.  </P> <P> It does not yet have a product on the market, but Schering cited Triton's  promising drugs under development as a reason it agreed to the acquisition.  </P> <P> Triton will keep its diagnostic testing business.  </P> <P> The terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but analysts said Shell had been  seeking at least $200 million. Schering said it will make payments to Shell  based on the commercial success of two Triton products under development.  </P> <P> Last week, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended approval  of Triton's biotechnology-based cancer chemotherapy drug Fludara IV. The  company is ready to submit for FDA approval its Betaseron drug for the  treatment of multiple sclerosis and various types of cancer, said Janice  Wohltmann, vice president of Triton's pharmaceuticals business.  </P> <P> "That's one of the reasons Schering was interested. This gives them the  opportunity to develop an oncology (cancer treatment) business. It gives us an  opportunity to develop our drugs worldwide. Because we are a small company, we  have focused on the U.S. and Canada," Wohltmann said.  </P> <P> By combining its traditional research and development in Germany with Triton's  biotechnology approaches, Schering said it "expects to make cancer therapeutics  available to patients more rapidly."  </P> <P> The Triton purchase is Schering's second biotechnology purchase in the San  Francisco Bay Area. In May, it bought South San Francisco-based Codon.  </P></p>

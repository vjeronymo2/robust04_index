			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> LEGAL AID MOVE DELAYED  </P> <P> A decision on moving a legal aid office from Pasadena to West Covina has been  delayed at least until Monday while options that could keep the office in  Pasadena are explored.  </P> <P> Lauralea Saddick, executive director of Legal Services Programs for Pasadena  and San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, said the organization has asked the city of  Pasadena to help find space in city facilities or elsewhere in the northern  part of Pasadena. The request was made after City Atty. Victor Kaleta appeared  at the group's board meeting Tuesday to read a letter from Mayor William E.  Thomson urging that the office remain in Pasadena.  </P> <P> Saddick said the lease on the office at 600 S. Lake Ave. expires at the end of  the year and the organization is seeking cheaper quarters because of reduced  funding for legal services. The recommended alternative, she said, is an office  building at Cameron and Orange avenues in West Covina.  </P> <P> The organization's board will meet at 5:30 p.m. Monday at the El Monte  Community Center to consider the matter. The legal aid program provides  attorney services to low-income persons in civil matters. It handles about  5,200 cases a year at its offices in Pasadena and Pomona.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STORM-DRIVEN BARGE SEVERS BRIDGE; THOUSANDS STRANDED  </P> <P> A gale blew a dredge into the only bridge to Hatteras Island today, severing  the span and stranding thousands of people without power.  </P> <P> The island's estimated 5,000 residents and an unknown number of tourists had no  way off the island.  </P> <P> Ferry connections via neighboring Ocracoke Island could not be used because  winds were gusting to 60 m.p.h., creating waves of five to seven feet in  Pamlico Sound.  </P> <P> No injuries were reported in the crash, which collapsed a 250-foot section of  the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge, severed utility lines that run along it and  grounded the dredge Northerly Island. Another 50-foot section of the bridge was  in danger of falling, police said.  </P> <P> The 2 1/2-mile-long bridge connects Hatteras Island with Bodie Island to the  north along North Carolina's Outer Banks.  </P> <P> "There is no way to get across that bridge. It's gone, collapsed," said Gwen  White, Dare County public information officer.  </P> <P> The accident knocked out electrical and telephone service to Hatteras Island  and to most of Ocracoke Island, located to the south and accessible only by  ferry.  </P> <P> Renee Hoffman of the state Emergency Management Division said authorities were  trying to figure out how to get temporary electrical service set up. It was  hoped that ferry service could be re-established within 24 hours, she said this  morning. Repairing the bridge could take months.  </P> <P> Dare County Commissioner Gaskill Austin, who lives on Hatteras Island, said  residents were "literally in the dark out here" but were used to minor power  outages because of the frequent storms.  </P> <P> "A big need will be generators . . . and to save as much foodstuffs as we have  here in the stores," he said via ham radio. "That and the water is my primary  concern."  </P></p>

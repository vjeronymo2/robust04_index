			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / LA contestants down to two LOS ANGELES voters have sent two candidates for mayor to a run-off election in June but have rejected a measure that would have put 1,000 extra police on the city's streets. The city is choosing a successor to Mayor Tom Bradley, its first black mayor, who has held the office for the past 20 years. While Mr Bradley himself is retiring under the cloud of last year's riots, the election has been largely overshadowed by the Rodney King beating trial. Mr Bradley was due yesterday to meet Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, who is spearheading the Clinton administration's efforts to boost California's flagging economy. The latter has suffered from the effects of defence industry cuts and now faces the closure of several military bases. Tuesday's mayoral race in the second-largest US city attracted two dozen candidates, none of whom won a majority. The top two candidates, Mr Richard Riordan, a conservative businessman, and Mr Michael Woo, a Chinese-American known as one of the city's most liberal councillors, will face a run-off on June 8. Mr Riordan, a white multi-millionaire, won 33 per cent of the vote. He campaigned on the slogan 'Tough enough to turn LA around' and attacked Mr Woo as an ineffective politician who could not rehabilitate the seedy Hollywood section of his city council district. Mr Woo, the grandson of Chinese immigrants, won 24 per cent of the votes. He promised to provide Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.2m) in city-backed loans to businesses in impoverished South Central, a mostly black and Hispanic district that suffered badly in last year's riots.</p>

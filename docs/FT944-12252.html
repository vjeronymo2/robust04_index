			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Beverley losses deepen to Pounds 1.73m Beverley, the engineering group which has had its shares suspended since July while it attempts to negotiate a refinancing, announced increased pre-tax losses for the six months to June 30 up from Pounds 929,000 to Pounds 1.73m. Beverley's 1993 accounts were qualified as the auditors were unable to confirm that the group had sufficient working capital. The unaudited interim accounts carry a disclaimer stating that the auditors were unable to form an opinion as to whether the accounts gave a true and fair view. The pre-tax loss included three exceptionals. The first was a Pounds 500,000 charge for estimated costs incurred in connection with the failed acquisition of the Pegasus Boiler Company. The second exceptional was a loss on the disposal of Beverley Avonside of Pounds 25,000. This includes a goodwill write-off of Pounds 110,000. There was also a Pounds 70,000 provision for reorganisation costs. Turnover was down from Pounds 6.46m to Pounds 2.84m. Continuing operations contributed Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 4.35m), but the company warned that the continuing figure included turnover of Pounds 502,000 and Pounds 362,000 attributable to two companies which were disposed of in October, Engineering Surveys Reproduction and Beverley Management Services. This will give rise to a loss on disposal of Pounds 687,000, including an adjustment of Pounds 753,000 for writing off goodwill, for which no provision has been made at the interim stage. Mr Colin Robinson, chairman, said the company was currently 'in negotiation with a number of interested parties' concerning refinancing. 'The future of the group is totally dependent upon the satisfactory outcome of such negotiations and the suspension of dealings in Beverley's shares will continue pending the clarification of its financial position.' Losses per share deepened to 4.96p (2.67p).</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (4): Splashing out is a thing of the past - Activity in Japan GONE ARE the days when Japanese corporations threw money into mergers and acquisitions in the notion that they were an immediate and painless way to expand market share or diversify into a promising new field. In their place, a more temperate era has emerged in which funding is tight and deals are more likely to involve relatively low-risk minority stakes and strategic alliances than splashy multi-billion dollar buyouts. The slowdown in activity is apparent in figures compiled by Yamaichi Securities for the first half of 1992. They show the number of deals involving Japanese firms - outbound, inbound and domestic transactions, including majority and minority stakes - fell 25 per cent from the year-earlier level to 245. Of the total, values were disclosed for 117 deals and fell a more modest 8 per cent to Y358.3bn. That is still well behind last year's pace when Y985bn in M&amp;A activity was made public and a mere fraction of 1989's record Y3.1 trillion. The average value of transactions likewise has tumbled from Y9.1bn in 1989 to Y3.5bn last year and Y3.1bn in the first six months of 1992. A fall in the number of outbound and domestic M&amp;A transactions accounted for the overall declines, retreating 33 per cent and 24 per cent respectively. However, this masks a near-doubling of the value of domestic transactions in the first January-June period. 'Domestic transactions are now increasing more quickly than over the last couple of years due to the financial situation and restructuring as companies go back to their core businesses,' says Mr Masaharu Yonezawa, senior adviser to Recof International, an M&amp;A boutique. 'In our organisation, we're the busiest we've been in our five years of operation because of domestic transactions.' With the domestic market heating up, 18 inbound transactions were announced in the half-year to June, already equalling the 1991 total. However, the value of transactions has fallen off, indicating that it is relatively small firms that are on the block. The overseas M&amp;A market, where 105 deals were reported in the first half, felt the effects of poor results among previous buyouts, financial and economic troubles at home and a continued recession in the US, UK and Europe. The US nevertheless maintained its premier destination status, accounting for over 40 per cent of Japanese outbound transactions, or 46 in total, followed by the EC with 26, according to Yamaichi. The figures were down 29 per cent and 47 per cent respectively. In contrast, activity in neighbouring Asian countries and other areas held steady, accounting for about 20 per cent of the outbound deals. It is not surprising that Japanese firms are showing an extra measure of caution regarding overseas M&amp;A, given their late-1980s blunders and excesses. No deal typifies this better than Bridgestone's takeover in the spring of 1988 of Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber of the US for Dollars 2.6bn. It was the largest Japanese manufacturing buyout to date. Mr Akira Yeiri, president of Bridgestone, agreed to pay Dollars 80 a share for antiquated Firestone without so much as an on-site inspection, just nine days after Italy's Pirelli offered Dollars 58. Since then, Bridgestone has pumped well over Dollars 1bn more into Firestone and seen its own results suffer as a consequence. Nor has Matsushita Electric Industrial's purchase of movie maker MCA for Y780bn proved a smash hit. Sony has fared somewhat better in turning around Sony Pictures Entertainment, formerly Columbia Pictures Entertainment. But even there the synergies between entertainment hardware and software, cited as a cause for the deal, remain elusive. The bottom line is that Japan Inc.'s view of M&amp;A has changed dramatically over the past few years, as has its position in the business world. While strategic deals are continuing, too many acquisitions have gone sour, yielded disappointing profits and involved unexpectedly severe headaches to expect another repeat of the late-1980s anytime soon. 'Cross-border transactions will be revived in about two years, both inbound and outbound,' predicts Recof's Mr Yonezawa. 'Japanese firms are getting more clever and are very cautious. When faced with any opportunity, they conduct due diligence and consider pricing carefully. 'The problem now is a credit squeeze and the fact that executives can't see what's going on in the global economy. When they have a clearer idea in one or two years, I think they will start to take up opportunities, whether they involve closing factories, making greenfield investments or conducting M&amp;A' Among the 122 domestic deals, Yamaichi noted a decline in activity in the materials, processing, commerce and other sectors amid anaemic demand and a general view among corporate strategists that the nation is bloated from excessive capital spending over the past several years. However, the more than doubling in the value of such deals in the first six months of 1992 may reflect the distress of many mid-sized sellers. It comes as no surprise that the number of inbound transactions is growing at a time when many local companies are short of cash and more intent on restructuring and slashing their own capital spending than in taking on someone else's problems. One leading buyout recently was the US firm S C Johnson's multi-billion yen acquisition of 74.5 per cent of Lion Insecticide, formerly a subsidiary of Lion Corp. General Motors' affiliate Electronic Data Services also purchased 19.9 per cent of troubled software developer Japan Systems Corp. for Y3.75bn. In the pharmaceutical industry, Pfizer of the US took over Koshin Medical for Y3bn. One deal that typifies the incentives of many buyers and sellers is American toy maker Hasbro's buyout of Nomura Toys from owner Koichi Nomura. Hasbro, faced with steady inroads into its home market by Japanese competitors, is seeking to gain a foothold and distribution in Japan. Meanwhile, Nomura reportedly has had an increasingly hard time taking on giants like Nintendo and Sega without a heavyweight partner. Indeed, it is family owned businesses, especially those founded in the early post-war years by owners now reaching retirement age, that offer the best pickings for foreigners. In addition to succession problems, such firms often lack necessary product development or marketing muscle to go it alone in increasingly liberalised markets. 'Interest is rising in inward transactions, although the number of deals is still small by international standards,' says Mr Yonezawa. 'The transactions normally take time, so even though there have not been many announcements so far, various negotiations are going on under water. I expect more announcements this year and in 1993. The timing is very good with the Japanese real estate and stock markets not as high as before.' Other foreign firms, particularly in the drug and chemical industries, make attractive suitors because of their worldwide distribution networks and often superior technology. All told, the number and value of inbound M&amp;A deals appear set to increase further as Japanese firms increasingly find themselves facing the same sort of competitive free-for-all at home that foreign rivals have grappled with for years in other leading markets.</p>

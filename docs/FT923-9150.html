			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Currency worries upset share prices A LONDON stock market growing increasingly nervous over the outlook for the UK economy and interest rates took a turn for the worse late yesterday afternoon. The downturn came when sterling extended an earlier loss against the D-Mark follow-ing the announcement of the latest French opinion poll on prospects for the Maastricht referendum. While readings of the French poll by London analysts differed, any threat to support for the Maastricht treaty is regarded as unsettling for UK interest rates. London was already nervous ahead of today's meeting of the Bundesbank's policy council, which has revived concern that interest rates could be forced higher in Europe. UK equities moved erratically on the downside throughout the session as sterling moved lower. Attempts by share prices to rally failed, ultimately as the pound weakened further in late dealings. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at the day's low of 2,392.8, down 14.7, with the 2,400 mark again abandoned. Worries over the collapse of the domestic housing market, seen as a key factor in the lack of consumer confidence behind the woeful state of the UK economy, increased after the Halifax, Britain's largest building society, reported a further fall in house prices last month. Company results, also an important key to stock market confidence at present, continued to discourage investors. Standard Chartered, the UK-based bank with substantial overseas operations, disclosed a sharp fall in first-half profits. GKN, the leading motor industry component supplier, announced higher interim profits but provided little encouragement for the near-term outlook. Equity strategists look to company news as the likely harbinger of a break in the recession in the UK economy. The Footsie 2,400 level was soon lost and the first attempted rally was scotched when London caught the hint that Wall Street, which had eased overnight, would face a brokerage downgrade on IBM when it opened for the new session. In the event, Wall Street's loss was held to a mere 9.72 Dow points in London hours, and UK shares rallied until reports of the French poll crossed the Channel. Once again, the only saving grace of the UK stock market was the low level of turnover. Seaq volume totalled an almost derisory 383m shares yesterday. Tuesday's 466.8m shares was worth Pounds 988.7m in terms of retail, or customer, business in UK equities. The official decision to cut interest rates on a range of UK National Savings products came well after market hours and too late to influence share prices. From the opening of the trading session, property, construction and building shares, which have already suffered severely as bad news has flowed from the property and housing industries, had taken a further and substantial setback. Retail issues, vulnerable to interest rate worries, eased. The stock market is likely to be dominated today by the trading report from British Petroleum, incorporating the decision on the quarterly dividend payout.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc confirms deal RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals group, yesterday confirmed plans to raise its stake in Institut Merieux, a producer of human and animal vaccines, from 51 per cent to 100 per cent, under an agreement with the subsidiary's minority shareholders. The agreement, which requires approval by the two companies' boards and shareholders, will allow Rhone-Poulenc to integrate Institut Merieux more fully into its healthcare division. It could also help create a stable shareholder base for the chemicals group, after the sale of the government's stake in the company. The French government, which currently holds about 43 per cent of Rhone-Poulenc, is due to sell its stake within the next few months as part of its ambitious privatisation programme. Under the terms of the deal announced yesterday, Rhone-Poulenc will exchange 77 group shares for every five shares in Institute Merieux. As a result, the 16 per cent stake in Institut Merieux currently held by the Merieux family, and the 14 per cent stake held by the Dassault family, will be transformed into shares of about 5 per cent and 4 per cent respectively in Rhone-Poulenc. The balance of the shares in Institut Merieux are controlled by the public and the Pasteur Institute. Rhone-Poulenc said the merger should not have a significant dilutative effect on income per share. It said the capital increase would be compensated by the improved income resulting from the elimination of minority interests relating to Institut Merieux. At the end of August, the market capitalisation of Institut Merieux stood at FFr13.2bn (Dollars 2.3bn). In the first half of this year, the company reported net profits of FFr254m, more than double the FFr113m recorded in the first six months of 1992. Sales in the first half of 1993 were FFr3.37bn. Most of the company's sales come from human health products such as vaccines for tuberculosis and influenza. Animal health products account for about 40 per cent of turnover.</p>

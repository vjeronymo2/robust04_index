			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Shanks &amp; McEwan pleases City with 30% rise to Pounds 31.1m SHANKS &amp; MCEWAN, the waste management company, yesterday reported a 30 per cent increase in profits, after a full year's contribution from Rechem, the hazardous waste company it acquired last year. The final months of the year were, however, severely hit by recession with volumes of the highest margin wastes particularly affected. The jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 31.1m on sales 24 per cent higher at Pounds 145.8m nevertheless pleased the market, which had been anticipating a poorer performance, and the shares rose 9p to 207p. Earnings per share fell from 13.2p to 11.9p and the the final dividend is maintained at 3.44p, giving a total of 5.7p, up 3.6 per cent on the year. Mr Peter Runciman, chairman, said that while profit margins had been eroded the longer-term prospects were 'extremely encouraging.' Total tonnage handled in the waste division rose by 2 per cent but margins were eroded and its profits contribution fell from Pounds 12.65m to Pounds 12.55m. The environmental services division, which includes Rechem, increased tonnage handled by 13 per cent but processing cost rises were not fully recovered and profits rose only 10 per cent to Pounds 9.54m. The technical services, or waste treatment division, increased sales by 18 per cent but profits were only marginally up at Pounds 3.59m. The construction division increased its contribution from Pounds 1.72m to Pounds 2.67m. There was also a Pounds 3.8m one off increase in debt from the Inland Revenue's request for corporation tax payments to be accelerated. COMMENT Shanks &amp; McEwan used to be seen as the Rolls-Royce of a racy industry with equally racy ratings. Then last year the sector lost some of its glister, not because its green credentials faded, but because the markets belatedly realised waste volumes and profits were not recession proof. Nevertheless, longer term Shanks is a company that will reap the benefit of increasingly stringent environmental legislation. While the waste treatment division could still do with some bolstering, its landfill sites have relatively exclusive market positions and the Rechem acquisition has brought a vital presence in hazardous waste. But growth will only resume rapidly once the economy begins to move again. Shanks's costs are largely fixed and there is therefore little prospect of further cost cutting to boost earnings dramatically this year. Pre-tax profits are forecast not much higher than this year's Pounds 31.1m, giving about 12p of earnings again, and puts Shanks, in the absence of recovery, on a correctly priced 17.3 multiple.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah believes that  Israel will try to make the self-rule a failure with a view to  turning it into an arena for struggle among the Palestinians.  He stressed that the Syrian-Israeli negotiations are the most  complicated because they represent the center of power in the  Arab-Israeli conflict.    Speaking at a Koranic interpretation lesson yesterday,  Fadlallah said the Israelis demand economic, security, and  political normalization first. Later they can discuss  withdrawal and the possibility of delaying it for 10 years.  During this time, he added, they will wait for any changes that  might prompt them to back down on that to which they had  committed themselves. Fadlallah expects the negotiations  between Syria and Israel to last long, because the enemy does  not want to reach any positive results with any Arab party  before weakening it first. Israel, along with the United  States, wants an Arab or Islamic nation without a will to make  it easier for them to control the region's economy, politics,  and security, he noted.    Concerning the self-rule agreement, Fadlallah stressed that  Israel will do its best to make it fail, to stir differences and  conflicts, and to complicate things for the self-rule  authorities. He said the Palestinians must be cautious about  handling their differences so as not to give Israel the chance  to thwart and undermine self-rule.    On the U.S. State Department's charges of terrorism leveled  against Iran and Syria, Fadlallah said the U.S. Administration  and some Western states accuse countries with policies not in  line with or opposed to their own of being terrorist states.  This accusation applies to any movement that works for  liberation. Thus we have no respect for the U.S. assessment of  terrorist movements or countries that support terrorism. He  added: The United States backs regimes that use terrorism  against their own people. If we look closer at the U.S. world  policy we will conclude that the United States is a first-class  terrorist state.    Turning to the war in Yemen, Fadlallah said it is a U.S.  trap, because Washington's policy is to try to contain any oil  country. In Yemen's case, this can be achieved only by  fragmenting it politically, economically, and socially, he added.</p>

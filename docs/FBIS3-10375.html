[Begin Cristiani recording] Nicaraguan President Violeta  Chamorro, presidents of the state branches, deputies,  magistrates, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, ambassadors and  heads of diplomatic missions accredited in Nicaragua, cabinet  members, members of Nicaraguan private enterprise, special  guests, dear friends: I am very pleased to be here in Nicaragua  honoring my dear friend President Chamorro's cordial invitation.  I have been even more honored tonight because I was awarded the  General Jose Dolores Estrada San Jacinto Battle Order. I  receive this decoration in the name of the Salvadoran people,  the true forgers of peace and democracy in our country. If I am  to be given credit for something, it is to have interpreted the  Salvadoran people's vehement desire to live in peace and freedom.    During recent years, when I shared with Dona Violeta --  beyond protocol, I dare call her by that name out of affection  -- so many Central American experiences, we have observed the  close relationship between our peoples and their problems and  solutions. History has provided deep common roots for the two  peoples. It is from the tree of the present, so to speak, that  we must pick the fruit of common destiny. El Salvador and  Nicaragua are friendly countries for various reasons.  Historical misfortunes have sometimes befallen us. The  traditional lack of deeply rooted freedom has made us suffer  untold trials and tribulations. From a certain date, what  brings us closer together is the common effort to nurture  democratic institutions on the arid land where authoritarianism  and arbitrariness once throve. Our peoples are still suffering  the consequences of many past mistakes, but in our respective  peculiarities and difficulties, each of the two peoples agree on  raising the banner of democracy.

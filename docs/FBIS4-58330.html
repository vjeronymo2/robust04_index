			<p>BFN     [Text] In a banquet given in honor of the Vietnamese  president on Saturday night, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani  delivered a speech in which he described Vietnam as a country  which enjoys a very good position in the minds of the Iranian  people. He added: The period during which you defended your  country and the acts of heroism undertaken by the Vietnamese  people in the face of Western invaders have reached epic status  in Iran. Your successes warmed the hearts of  independence-seeking peoples throughout the world and you gave  valuable historic lessons to humanity.    Our country's president expressed the hope that, during the  period of reconstruction, too, the Vietnamese nation would  continue to pursue the correct and independent path it has  embarked on towards reforming its economic structure and that it  would serve as a good model for the world's other countries with  the cooperation of the Islamic Republic of Iran and through the  exchange of experiences between the two revolutionary nations.    The Vietnamese president, for his part, delivered a speech  in  which he praised the Islamic Republic of Iran and the gains made  by our country.</p>

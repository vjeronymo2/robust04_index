Zia ruled Pakistan for 11 years,  eight of them under martial law. His death in a mysterious plane crash Aug. 17,  1988, paved the way for the country's first free election in more than a  decade, and Bhutto's party won control of the National Assembly. Pakistani  Television estimated the crowd of Zia loyalists at 70,000.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COST OF AVERAGE NEW HOME UP $90,000 IN NORTH COUNTY  </P> <P> Spurred by the rapid increase in the cost of subdivision lots, the average  price of a new single-family house in North County has increased by nearly  $90,000, or 51%, over the past year to $261,000. The study by Market Profiles  of San Diego compared average subdivision sale prices over the first quarter of  1989 with the same three months last year.  </P> <P> Over the same period, the average price of a new house in southern San Diego  County was $234,800, an increase of $54,000, or 30%, over the same quarter the  previous year, according to Market Profiles. The study used California 52 as  the dividing line for the two regions.  </P> <P> Similar price increases were logged by Meyers Group, a La Jolla-based market  research firm that also tracks subdivision sales. Meyers reported that  first-quarter median sales price of new homes, countywide, was $227,990, a 46%  increase over the $154,990 median price during the same three months last year.  </P> <P> Median prices are those at which half of all houses sell for more and half for  less.  </P> <P> Lot prices are being squeezed by the declining supply of developable land in  San Diego County and by the increasingly restrictive zoning policies governing  the land that is available, several industry sources said.  </P> <P> A typical undeveloped, 5,000-square-foot lot in the so-called California 163  corridor from Rancho Bernardo south to Tierrasanta now sells for $100,000 to  $120,000, up from $60,000 to $70,000 a year ago, said Bill Fontana, a partner  in Westana Builders/Developers, a San Diego home builder.  </P> <P> The high prices of new housing reflect the fact that most new units being built  these days are geared to the so-called "move-up" buyer market: that is, buyers  who are selling smaller and cheaper houses and using the equity they have built  up to buy larger and more expensive abodes, Market Profiles president Russell  Valone said.  </P> <P> Because of the high price of new housing, most first-time buyers are buying  resold existing houses, which are showing less-dramatic price increases, Valone  said. The average price of an existing house sold in metropolitan San Diego in  February was $187,636, a 14% increase over the February, 1988, average price,  the San Diego Board of Realtors said.  </P> <P> Reflecting the thinning inventory of available new housing, the actual number  of new houses sold during the first quarter this year declined to 1,643 units,  a 48% drop from the 3,138 units sold in first quarter of 1988. Sales in the  souther part of the county totaled 858 units, down from the 913 sold last year.  </P> <P> Prices of new condominiums and townhouses have remained flat to down, Market  profiles said. A typical North County condo sold for $136,800 over the first  quarter, down from $140,500 last year, Valone said. South County condominiums'  average price increased to $126,000, up from last year's average $117,600.  </P></p>

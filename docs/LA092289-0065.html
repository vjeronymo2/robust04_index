			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Senate voted to ease slightly restrictions for federally financed  abortions, brushing aside outnumbered conservatives and flouting a White House  threat to veto any attempt to liberalize regulations. Lawmakers on a voice vote  agreed to legislation prohibiting federal assistance for abortions except for  pregnancies that threaten the mother's life or those caused by rape or incest  "promptly reported" to authorities. Under current law, the only exception is  for cases in which the woman's life is endangered. Conservatives conceded they  didn't have the votes to block the provision, but said they will try to  eliminate the language when House-Senate negotiators work to shape a compromise  bill. The House version retains the current restriction.  </P></p>

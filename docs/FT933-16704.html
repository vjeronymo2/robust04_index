			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory candidate favours capital punishment THE TORY candidate in the Christchurch by-election has sought to outflank his Liberal Democrat rival by setting crime and capital punishment at the top of his agenda - even though Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, opposes hanging. Mr Robert Hayward yesterday angered Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, by launching a survey of public opinion in Christchurch on capital punishment. Mr Hayward said crime had been raised far more often than the economy by constituents he had met so far. 'It is the largest single issue, no question about it,' he said. The Conservative's campaign team's high-risk strategy could succeed in diverting attention from government policies. But Mr Hayward could embarrass ministers, most of whom are opposed to hanging. During a Commons debate on law and order yesterday Mr Howard, regarded as being on the Tory right wing, said he had previously supported capital punishment but was now opposed because of the initial failure of the appeals procedures in cases such as the 'Birmingham Six'. No date has been set for the Christchurch by-election, caused by the death of Mr Robert Adley who had 23,000 conservative majority at the last election. But later this month is still regarded as the most likely date. Mr Hayward, formerly Conservative MP for Kingswood, said he had voted in favour of hanging for terrorists and for those who murdered policemen, as well as other categories. For the Liberal Democrats Mr Ashdown protested that capital punishment was 'an issue of conscience' on which British political parties did not take a formal position. He described the Conservative's move as 'a clear sign of desperation'. In the Commons last night Mr Howard launched a drive to enlist support from the public in combating the crime wave. He said: 'I want to channel the public's energies in a constructive way to build a new, stronger and more effective alliance against crime.' Tory backbenchers joined with the minister in seeking to counter the impact made recently by Mr Tony Blair, Labour's shadow home secretary, with a call for a crusade against crime. Mr Howard said he wanted to create an atmosphere in which it was the criminals who were 'frightened' and not members of the public. He also wanted to make local communities feel that 'we can act together to do something about crime'.</p>

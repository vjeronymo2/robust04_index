			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Public dressed up as private Sir, Your correspondent John Willman (October 7) effectively summarised the problems now looming for the government in its attempt to implement its Private Sector Initiative. This so-called 'big idea' for the 1990s is intended to allow private finance and private sector expertise to be brought in to build roads, railways, hospital car parks, etc - all previously public sector preserves. However, the government's experience of trying to keep the private sector to a promise to provide 20 per cent of the funding for the Jubilee Line to Canary Wharf and London's Docklands is no advertisement for the Private Sector Initiative. The government claims now to be in a position to give the go-ahead for the Jubilee Line because the Pounds 400m private sector component of the total cost of the Jubilee Line has now been agreed with the administrative receivers of Canary Wharf and the creditor banks. When you look closely at what had been agreed, however, it was clear that no such private finance had been found. The 'front-end' component of the Pounds 400m had been reduced to Pounds 160m, which is fair enough. Nobody is really interested in money that you have to spend after the year 2000. The Pounds 160m, however, has not in the main come from the private sector at all. Some Pounds 96m of it is coming from the European Investment Bank. All of the European Investment Bank's money is government-guaranteed. That is why it is available at a cheaper rate than private risk-bearing finance would be in the international capital markets. The government's Private Sector Initiative, if it follows the Canary Wharf-Jubilee Line precedent, is really a classic piece of window dressing. The public sector is simply renamed as the private sector, when it suits. More power to the Jubilee Line elbow as far as I am concerned, but please let's not pretend that it is being financed by the private sector.

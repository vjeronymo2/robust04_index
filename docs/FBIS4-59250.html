			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 11 (AFP)--PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat has  nominated five leading figures from the occupied territories to  the 25-member Palestinian Authority due to take over in Gaza and  Jericho, the PLO's chief autonomy negotiator said here Wednesday  [11 May].    Nabil Sha'th named the five as:     -  Zakariya al-Agha, a doctor and head of 'Arafat's  mainstream Fatah faction in the occupied Gaza Strip,    -  Furayh Abu-Middayn, president of the Gaza Bar Association  and a  member of the Palestinian delegation to the autonomy talks with  Israel,    -  Riyad al-Za'nun, a doctor and head of the higher health  council  in the Gaza Strip,    -  Ilyas Furayj, mayor of Bethlehem in the West Bank,    -  'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Hajj Ahmad, a Palestinian deportee who  returned to the occupied territories.       Earlier a source at PLO headquarters in Tunis said Zakariya  al-Agha would be put in charge of Gaza and autonomy negotiator  Jamil al-Tarifi would take charge of Jericho.    In Cairo, Palestinian officials said Sha'th had also been  nominated to the authority, but Sha'th refused to comment when  asked to confirm the report.    Yasir 'Amr, a member of the PLO executive committee, said  Tuesday the Palestinian Authority would consist of 15 figures  from the occupied territories and 10 from the Palestinian  diaspora.    'Arafat, who is due to head the authority, will resume  discussions on its composition once he returns from South  Africa, where he attended the swearing-in of President Nelson  Mandela.    The PLO has accused Israel of linking the deployment of  Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho to the formation of  the team.    "I'm awaiting from the other side honest implementation of  what has been agreed upon. It is not the case," 'Arafat told  Israeli television from South Africa.</p>

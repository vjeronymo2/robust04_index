			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ONCE-BANNED BOOKS WILL GET READINGS AT SADDLEBACK  </P> <P> Saddleback College President Constance Carroll will lead off a weeklong campus  defense of free expression Monday as Saddleback students, teachers and  administrators will read aloud passages from books once banned somewhere in the  United States.  </P> <P> "Alice and Wonderland," "The Grapes of Wrath" and "Women in Love" will be among  the first books to be excerpted for Banned Books Week. Each was once considered  dangerous in this country, and each has at times been outlawed from libraries.  </P> <P> "We want to show people that maybe censorship is more dangerous than the ideas  themselves are," said Brenda Lamanuzzi, a member of the Friends of the  Saddleback Library, which is sponsoring the event. "We want people to be aware  of the freedom to read. We're hoping more campuses will follow our lead and  acknowledge Banned Book Day."  </P> <P> Banned Books Week has been observed at schools and libraries nationally for the  last eight years as part of an annual campaign by the American Library Assn. to  remind patrons of their "right to read."  </P> <P> Although Saddleback College's library is the only one in the county holding  such a reading event this year, libraries at UC Irvine and Orange Coast College  in Costa Mesa will display once-prohibited books as part of exhibits marking  Banned Books Week.  </P> <P> Carroll will start the Saddleback event at 11:45 a.m., introducing students,  teachers and community members who will read. Each reader will be given seven  minutes to read a passage the reader picks from a book once considered  "dangerous," Lamanuzzi said.  </P> <P> Other scheduled activities include a speech by Times columnist Jack Smith;  screenings of films such as "Fahrenheit 451," which is about book-burnings and  a closed society, and an exhibit of recently outlawed books such as "The Color  Purple" and "The Catcher in the Rye."  </P> <P> Event organizers are also holding an Author-Title Matchup contest, awarding a  free book to whoever matches the most banned book titles with the names of  their respective authors.  </P> <P> Other books to be included in the read-out are "Of Mice and Men," "Flowers for  Algernon," "Another Country," "Grendel," "To Kill a Mockingbird," "The Great  Gatsby," "The Jungle" and "A Light in the Attic."  </P></p>

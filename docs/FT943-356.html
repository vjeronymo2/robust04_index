			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Lean times spoil a free lunch on Wall St - Securities houses are stepping up cost-cutting programmes On Monday, Lehman Brothers announced it was reviewing its 'meal-compensation programme'. Translated into English, this meant the securities house had decided it would no longer provide free lunches to its 1,500 sales and trading staff. The move, which follows similar cost-cutting measures by other securities houses in recent months, was just the latest indication that Wall Street, after enjoying three years of fat profits, is going through some lean times. The attempt to rein in costs at Lehman go well beyond deciding to stop paying for traders' pastrami-on-rye sandwiches. The firm, headed by Mr Richard Fuld, also announced this week it was sacking 100 of its 300 domestic retail brokers as part of a restructuring of its private-client business. It was just the latest in a round of cuts which has seen the firm shed more than 700 jobs this year alone, out of workforce of more than 8,500. Although the motives behind the redundancies at Lehman are unusual - since it was spun-off from American Express in a public share offering earlier this year, the management has been determined to trim the cost structure, one of the more bloated on Wall Street - the securities industry as a whole is facing up to an unpalatable fact: revenues are falling while expenses are steady or rising. This disturbing trend was most clearly illustrated last month when the New York Stock Exchange released second-quarter results of its member firms. Between them, the firms earned Dollars 16.4bn in revenues during the period, down from Dollars 17.9bn in the same three months of 1993. Expenses, however, rose from Dollars 15.6bn to Dollars 17bn. As a result, NYSE firms - which together earned pre-tax profits of Dollars 2.4bn in the second quarter of last year - lost Dollars 622.8m between April and June this year. It was the industry's worst quarter since 1987, the year of the October stock-market crash. Mindful of criticism that Wall Street has been slow to cut back on costs during previous downturns in the earnings cycle, firms this year have been quick to prune their payrolls. Aside from Lehman, other big houses which have shed jobs recently include Merrill Lynch, CS First Boston, PaineWebber, and Prudential Securities. Many of the cuts have been concentrated in the fixed-income trading and sales side, where the worldwide bear market in government and mortgage-backed securities has left firms with sharply lower revenues - or, in some cases, losses - in their bond businesses. The job reductions announced so far this year are unlikely to be the last, say analysts, some of whom remain critical of firms' slowness in reacting to the drop in revenues. Mr Michael Flanagan, who follows the securities industry for Lipper Analytical in New York, says: 'The industry has been slow in adjusting costs in the hope that conditions would turn upward towards the end of the year. The possibility of that scenario developing now appears remote. So, for the remainder of the year the industry is going to be paying even more attention to cost control.' The impact of some firms' inability to cut costs enough in the face of falling revenues will be evident next month when Wall Street releases its third-quarter results. Last week, Lehman provided a foretaste when it reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter, which ended on August 31. Revenues were down 19 per cent as earnings from brokerage commissions, trading, and investment banking all fell. Expenses, however, were down only 5 per cent from a year ago, and Lehman's profits plunged 89 per cent to just Dollars 11m. The results of other large firms are expected to be equally discouraging. Since February, the rise in US and European interest rates, the troubles of stock, bond and currency markets, and a drop-off in corporate debt and equity issuance have all taken their toll on Wall Street's bottom line. The only positive aspect of the current environment is the steadiness of asset management revenues, and the robust health of the mergers and acquisitions business, which is thriving in the wake of a series of multi-million and billion dollar deals in the entertainment, defence, healthcare and telecommunications industries. These positive features, however, have not been enough to offset the deterioration in other businesses: rising securities underwriting and trading revenues fuelled the boom on Wall Street between 1991 and 1993, and this is where firms are hurting the most today. They have also begun to suffer in other areas, say analysts. According to Mr Flanagan: 'The industry's poor results during the first two quarters of the year were concentrated primarily in trading and underwriting categories. Those two areas have not improved in the third quarter, and it's becoming more evident that other revenue sources are also beginning to falter - such as (broking) commissions and mutual fund sales. And the yield curve is flattening somewhat, which will further depress net interest income for firms.' If the immediate future for Wall Street is not particularly bright, there is cause for hope over the longer term. US interest rates will probably rise further, but the current round of policy tightenings appears to be nearer its end than its beginning - so stability could return to earnings as early as next year. Also, for those big securities houses with formidable presences in capital markets outside the US, long-term growth prospects are even better. Economists predict a steady increase in demand for capital worldwide over the next decade, as less-developed economies in Latin America, eastern Europe and east Asia push for growth. With a greater concentration of expertise in raising money for corporations and governments on Wall Street than anywhere else in the world, a small group of US firms led by Lehman, Goldman Sachs, CS First Boston, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Salomon Brothers should be well-placed to feed the global hunger for capital.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: RTZ support in Rio Algom deal Sir, I refer to your report, 'Rio Algom to boost copper at Cerro Colorado by 50 per cent' (September 7). Part of that report might be seen as implying that RTZ had attempted to take over Rio Algom's Cerro Colorado mine in Chile at the time of the RTZ sale of its 41 per cent interest in Rio Algom. In fact, RTZ made no such attempt. Rather it provided valuable assistance to Rio Algom in the development of the Chilean project, both before and after the sale of its interest in the Canadian company. The successful commissioning of Cerro Colorado, a year and a half after the sale of that interest, was due in no small part to RTZ's continued support of the project. C A Macaulay, president and chief executive officer, Rio Algom, 120 Adelaide Street West, Toronto, Canada</p>

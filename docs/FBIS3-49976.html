			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Podgorica, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Montenegro  Government submitted a written notice today to the republic's  assembly to the effect that, following the adoption of a federal  law on defense, there is no longer any need for Prime Minister  Milo Djukanovic to perform the duty of minister for defense.    When the Montenegrin Government was being formed in March  last year, it decided that the prime minister, Milo Djukanovic,  would perform the duty of minister for defense until a federal  law on defense was passed which, the government explained, would  specify constitutional arrangements in this sphere and create  conditions for a uniform discharge of this duty at federal level.    Given that the Montenegro Ministry for Defense has been  dissolved following the adoption of the federal law in this  sphere, the government suggests that the republic's assembly  should relieve Deputy Defense Minister Veljko Vukovic of his  duty.</p>

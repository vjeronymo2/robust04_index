			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A bomb exploded in a hotel in the Colombian city of Cartagena, apparently  killing two people and wounding a third, the police chief in the Caribbean  resort said. Earlier, a bomb exploded at a Cartagena bank, injuring a  passer-by, Col. Luis Herrera told reporters in Bogota by telephone. Herrera  said the fatalities were believed to be doctors attending a convention at the  Cartagena Hilton. There was no claim of responsibility, but authorities  indicated the blasts likely were the work of drug traffickers who have declared  war on the Colombian government.  </P></p>

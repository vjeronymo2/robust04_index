			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Agrarian Party fails to see Aleksandr  Rutskoy as the united left's candidate in the upcoming  presidential race.    The party's leader Mikhail Lapshin would not place his bet  on  Rutskoy even though Rutskoy was in charge of the land reform  and, more than any other member of the Yeltsin Administration,  took to heart the needs and concerns of rural Russia.    Lapshin told Interfax the party's Council was yet to decide  who deserved the Agrarians' backing.    According to Lapshin, both Rutskoy and his Social-Democratic  party had to travel a long way before emerging as the leading  opposition force. Instead of searching for a presidential  candidate, Lapshin said, the opposition had better bring  together forces and launch a wide propagandistic and educational  campaign. The opposition leader, according to Lapshin, would  appear when his time came.</p>

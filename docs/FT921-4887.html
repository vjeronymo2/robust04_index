			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: An olive branch with dangerous roots - Tim Coone and Ralph Atkins examine Sinn Fein's latest search for political acceptance SENIOR British and Irish ministers meet in Dublin today amid hopes of a new panorama opening on Northern Ireland. After a seven-month lapse the four main political parties in Ulster are due to hold a symbolic first meeting of 'round-table' talks on the province's future on Monday. Church leaders have met paramilitary chiefs in an apparent effort to broker a ceasefire. These are small changes, but enough to refocus attention on the role of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, which has not been invited to the talks. The IRA is threatening to disrupt the British general election with a bombing campaign. Ironically, its efforts coincide with a diplomatic offensive by Sinn Fein to win a place at the negotiating table. At their recent congress in Dublin the 'Shinners' launched their first key strategy document for years, Towards a Lasting Peace, calling it an 'olive branch' to Ulster Unionists and the British and Irish governments. Both governments, the main political parties in both countries and Catholic and Protestant churches have condemned Sinn Fein for its association with the IRA, and its stance on armed struggle, which Mr Gerry Adams, party president and MP for West Belfast, spelt out again at the congress. Mr Adams said: 'Irish people have the right to use armed struggle in the context of seeking Irish independence and in conditions of British occupation of the Six Counties. Whether Irish people wish to exercise that right is a matter for them.' Sinn Fein has been firmly told that it will not be accepted at the negotiating table until it changes this equivocal stance. Peace overtures from Mr Adams are viewed with profound scepticism, if not anger. A Labour government in the UK would be equally antagonistic. Sinn Fein maintains that it has no formal links to the IRA, although the overlap is undeniable. It has social welfare programmes for IRA prisoners and many members have been interned or convicted for paramilitary activities. The extent to which the party's political leaders influence the military commanders of the IRA is open to question. Mr Adams says Sinn Fein and the IRA make their decisions independently. He and others in the party sometimes appear uneasy about civilian casualties. In an overt criticism of IRA tactics he told the congress: 'I repeat my firm conviction that attacks on Protestants are wrong for exactly the same reason that attacks on Catholics are wrong.' It was the loudest applause he received throughout his speech. The 'olive branch' Sinn Fein is offering is for the British and Irish governments to make 'the ending of partition their policy (goal)' and that this be carried out 'in consultation and co-operation with' the Ulster Unionists. Mr Adams did not rule out the possibility of a halt to the IRA's military campaign as a means of bringing Sinn Fein into the talks. 'At some point before, during or after this process, demilitarisation has to play a role,' he said. He believes the British government's strategy is not to involve Sinn Fein in talks 'as it wants to defeat the Republicans'. But he said the British government had talked to Republicans in the past. British ministers regard hinting at talks with Sinn Fein as dangerous - it would inflame Ulster's fiercely defensive Unionist community, ending for some time any chance of progress in 'round table' talks. It would also undermine the logic of the sophisticated and expensive military operation against the IRA. The British government argues that when new, workable forms of government for the province are found, Sinn Fein's most powerful argument - that Northern Ireland can never work in its current format - will have been lost. So far, ministers have not succeeded in that aim.</p>

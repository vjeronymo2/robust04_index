			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper's day of reckoning deferred A POTENTIALLY critical time in the London Metal Exchange's copper market - when September traded options were declared - passed quietly yesterday but traders suggested that a looming technical 'squeeze' had been rolled forward to the October/December period. 'There is still the potential for mayhem in the market,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain and Company, part of the Deutsche Bank group. 'All the big players (involved in the squeeze) appear to have rolled their options positions into October, and some into December. And these situations tend not to unwind themselves without doing some damage to some players.' The LME board has voiced its concern about possible manipulation of its 'flagship' copper market to boost the price by twice giving warnings that it has the authority to take any necessary action to maintain an orderly market. The situation is reminiscent of the technical squeeze in December, 1991, which resulted in the LME board taking the unprecedented step of limiting the backwardation (premium for metal for immediate delivery) to Pounds 25 a tonne a day - until recently LME copper was quoted in sterling. Last night the backwardation was Dollars 35.50 a tonne with cash metal closing at Dollars 1,971 a tonne, down 50 cents, while three-month metal was down Dollars 3 at Dollars 1,935.50. Unusual activity has kept the copper market in turmoil for much of this year. The price fell by one quarter in only five weeks, culminating in a 5 1/2 -year low of Dollars 1,705 a tonne in May. Several LME trading houses suffered huge losses because of that collapse. Traders suggest that Sumitomo, the Japanese group which is one of the world's biggest traders in physical copper, now controls most of the available LME copper stocks via option activity, even though stocks are at their highest level for 15 years. But Mr Yasuo Hamanaka, the senior manager responsible for Sumitomo's copper trading operations, has denied any manipulation is going on. He said the acute supply tightness was highly technical and could be traced to the sharp fall in prices in May from which there had to be some reaction.</p>

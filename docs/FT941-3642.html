			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banks oppose Payless buyout The Dollars 1bn buy-out of Payless, the US drug store chain owned by Kmart, has run into opposition from banks, threatening one of the biggest buy-outs launched in the US since the 1980s. The California-based Leonard Green &amp; Partners, which is leading the buy-out, originally sought Dollars 850m from banks, in financing led by Bankers Trust, Citibank and UBS. Late last week, financing was scaled back to Dollars 600m, having already been dropped to Dollars 750m, as a number of leading financial institutions said they would not back the transaction. To fill the gap left by the lower level of bank debt, the backers are now planning to raise Dollars 600m through one of the biggest issues of sub-investment grade bonds since the junk bond market sprang back to life a year ago. However, the bond issue comes at a time when mutual funds, which have been the biggest supporters of the high-yield junk bond market, have experienced a steady out-flow of cash. According to one estimate, investors have withdrawn a net Dollars 1.5bn from high-yield fund in the past fortnight as the US fixed income markets have fallen. Leonard Green said the size of the bank deal had been scaled back in part to enable the transaction to close by the end of this month. The firm added that the three lead banks had fully underwritten the transaction, so the financing for the deal was assured. The head of syndication of one big US bank which has not backed the transaction said: 'It's a very controversial deal - a lot of high-quality, leveraged lending banks have said no.' Another leading bank added that the difficulty in attracting cash showed that 'the market is not so over-heated that anything will sell'. One bank said that it had decided not to participate in part because previous Leonard Green buy-outs had a poor track record. The firm said, though, that only one of its buy-outs had resulted in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, that of Almac's, which sought protection from its creditors last year. 'That's not a bad record in 20 years,' the firm added. Until now, US buy-outs have been steadily increasing in size since the lull in the early 1990s, which followed the failure of a buy-out at United Airlines to attract bank finance. Mr David Browning, managing director of structured finance at Citibank, said the changes made to the proposed Payless financing did not mean that the deal was in trouble. 'You make your best judgment (about the sources of finance). We have not changed the debt structure, only the mix.' A leveraged buy-out of Jefferson Smurfitt in the US has become the first deal of the 1990s to attract more than Dollars 1bn of bank finance. The buy-out has won backing from 13 banks, each of which has underwritten Dollars 100m. Bankers in the US continue to predict a rash of big bank-financed buy-outs.</p>

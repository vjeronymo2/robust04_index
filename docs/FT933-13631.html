			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Books: A yearning for context THE HONOURABLE BEAST by John Dexter Nick Hern Books Pounds 25, 340 pages 'IF YOU don't shut up, Arnold, I'll direct this play as you wrote it' - a celebrated admonition from John Dexter to his long-time collaborator Arnold Wesker gives a fair indication of both his candour and lack of tact. Dexter was one of the sacred monsters of post-war theatre and advance word in thespian circles was that publication of his memoirs would cause as much consternation on the South Bank as Alan Clark's had at Westminster . . . this is unlikely to be the case. Indeed, apart from the same unrepeatable epithet applied to Rudolph Nureyev and Anthony Hopkins (the latter of whom is described as not only ambitious, cowardly and self-deceiving but a sexual failure), a lack of respect for the intellect of Eddie Kulukundis and the manners of Alan J Lerner, and the obligatory venom spat at Peter Hall, 'His Majesty Hall' 'Lord Vestibule', by ancient members of the Olivier regime, the book is notably short of vituperation. He is a positive Pollyanna compared to his old friend, John Osborne. And yet, if it is an also-ran in the gossip stakes, there's little of substance to compensate. In spite of the teasing title - a posthumous biography - it amounts to an ad hoc collection of notes, diary entries, memoranda, letters and commonplaces edited by Dexter's close friend, Riggs O'Hara. While such documents have a vital place in the writing of a biography, they are less compelling as the entire hook. Dexter was one of the greatest directors of the last three decades, notable for his many collaborations with Wesker and Shaffer, as well as premiere productions by Arden, Osborne, Rattigan and Griffiths. His classical productions included Olivier's Othello, Plowright's St Joan, Gambon's Galileo and the McCowen-Rigg Pygmalion. He discovered the translating talents of Tony Harrison (The Misanthrope, Phaedra Britannica), directed film (The Virgin Soldiers), musicals (Half A Sixpence, Do I Hear A Waltz?) and, for seven years, ran the Metropolitan Opera in New York, The Honourable Beast gives only tantalising glimpses of this. The lack is all the more acute as it is very much a work-story rather than a life-story. Dexter writes that 'work is the only worship I know and understand' and the book follows this line. In spite of his own suggestion that he suffered professionally for his homosexuality, there is little mention of his private life and none of his imprisonment for a sexual offence. After a few backward glances at his Royal Court training ground, the book is divided into a number of often overlapping sections which encompass his early days at the National, his freelance work after his sacking by Olivier, his return to the National under Peter Hall, and his plans for a company of his own. The centrepiece is his work at the Met, which he was determined to drag into the 20th century and where he was thwarted by the vested interests of the musical, technical and administrative staff and the all-important sponsors. Intriguing as such material is, it suffers from an almost total lack of context. The letters and notes are not revealing, witty or profound enough to be of interest in themselves and there is an insufficient background for them to illuminate the working process. The reader is constantly at sea, clamouring for a passing reference. Never have I yearned so hard for footnotes. The book is most valuable for the almost incidental credo on the importance of work and the role of the director and his tribute to the designer, Jocelyn Herbert. But, apart from the extended discussion of the operatic triple bill, Parade, in letters to Hockney and Nureyev, where, as the project's initiator, he is forced for once to fill in the artistic and historical background, there is far too much about his work-load and too little about his working methods. For the latter, it would be wiser to turn to Jim Hiley's Theatre At Work, a detailed account of rehearsals for the National's Galileo. Threaded through the book is a threnody of aborted projects: Shaw's Man and Superman, Verdi's Falstaff, King Lear with Richard Burton, The Seagull with Makarova; and it is tragic that his early death robbed us of so much more . . . although it's doubtful whether even he could have made a silk purse out of Howard Brenton and Tariq Ali's Moscow Gold. Another lost project is the book on directing which he discusses in a letter to Joan Plowright; instead, we have this compilation of preliminary notes. Some may consider it a worthy substitute, but I suspect that Dexter, a life-long perfectionist, would have disagreed.</p>

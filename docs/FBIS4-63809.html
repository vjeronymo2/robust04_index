			<p>BFN     [Text] Each of the parties proposed its own version of the  final document at the talks between the Russian and Ukrainian  governmental delegations headed by Premiers Viktor Chernomyrdin  and Yukhym Zvyahilskyy in Moscow. Earlier on the same day, the  two premiers had held a private meeting.    Interfax learned that Russian representatives insisted that  an inter-governmental agreement on the basing of the Russian  part of the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea [sentence as received].  The Ukrainian delegation wanted to sign a memorandum with the  same title.    Moscow has insisted that Sevastopol be the main base of the  Russian Navy and that the Ukrainian fleet be based beyond the  city limits. It can be stationed in Balaklava (Crimea) or in  Odessa. Russia recognizes that Sevastopol is a Ukrainian city  under jurisdiction of Ukraine.    Sources in the Ukrainian delegation told Interfax that the  joint expert group was trying to combine the versions and to  create a single final document which would provide for the  basing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol and for the  basing of the Ukrainian Navy in Balaklava and partially in  Sevastopol.    The final document is expected to be signed on May 24  evening.    Earlier today, sources in the Russian delegation had told  Interfax that Ukraine stood for division of the fleet ships in  accordance with the March agreements between the Russian and  Ukrainian presidents. However, Ukraine insisted that it keep  coastal facilities and infrastructure, including dwelling places  for marine servicemen which did not conform with the position of  the Russian delegation.</p>

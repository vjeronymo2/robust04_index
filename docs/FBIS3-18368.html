			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eugen Georg Schwarz: "Scharping Takes the Lead"] </F>   [Text] The chancellor talked for one-and-a-half hours to  the delegates of the federal Christian Democratic Union [CDU]  congress, who were listening raptly. He presented himself in a  fighting mood, certain of his victory. For 12 minutes, applause  roared in the Congress Center in Hamburg. However, only the  Political Compass poll in March will show whether, with this  brilliant speech, he managed to put an end to the opinion poll  jeers in the country, which continued to swell in February.    Even though the proportion of voters who would vote for the  chancellor and the CDU remained unchanged at 34 percent compared  with January, the results of the poll conducted by Basis  Research for FOCUS show: The water that is streaming into the  government ship through a hole will soon be up to the captain's  neck.    It is a phenomenon how Rudolf Scharping, to whom there is no  alternative, manages to put the "chancellor of unification" into  a corner like a useless umbrella, even though he himself still  lacks profile and is skillfully hiding his lack of competence in  material issues: Only 23.8 percent of the Germans (in January  29 percent) would vote for Helmut Kohl if they had the  opportunity to elect the chancellor directly. Rudolf Scharping,  who is obviously considered as some sort of radiant person and  messiah, for the first time easily jumps over the 50-percent  threshold in this comparison: 52.4 percent of the voters would  like to see him as the future head of government.    However, the most alarming result of this FOCUS poll for  Kohl  is proved by those who are still undecided as to whom they are  going to vote for. In January, 22 percent of those polled  answered the question "Who would master the most important  political problems and tasks best?" with "I do not know." Four  weeks later, this proportion has plummeted to 14.5 percent. At  the same time, the number of those who considered a federal  government headed by the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] most suitable to solve the problems rose from 39 to 46.3  percent. On the other hand, the proportion of voters who  favored the CDU remained unchanged at 24 percent.    Higher taxes, rising gasoline prices, an increasing number  of  unemployed, imminent zero wage rounds, and the disaster of the  nursing-care insurance are probably items on the opinion bill.    If the Germans did not have to elect the Bundestag, but  could  chose the composition of the federal government as they like,  the next chancellor would certainly be Rudolf Scharping. A  total of 34.2 percent of those polled by FOCUS want a coalition  government headed by the SPD; only 15.7 percent want one headed  by the CDU. A total of 25.7 percent would prefer a coalition of  the CDU, the Christian Social Union [CSU], and the SPD.    Helmut Kohl can turn the results around and whitewash as he  likes: The Social Democrats are nowadays overtaking his party  and his government in all fields regarding the acceptance of  their competence -- apart from one exception. In economic  policy there are still 36 percent of Germans who think that a  CDU-headed government can do more than one headed by the SPD  (33.8 percent). However, in this field, too, the SPD is in the  process of replacing the CDU. In January the ratio was still  38:30.    In the meantime, more Germans have come to the conclusion  that internal security, too, is better dealt with by the SPD.  While at the beginning of the year the CDU/CSU Federal  Government was narrowly ahead in the competence competition by  29:28, in February it has fallen behind at 30:31. This change  in the trend can be explained only by the rejection of tougher  measures against crime by the Free Democratic Party of Germany  [FDP].    In all other political questions the majority of those  polled  have expected Scharping and his party to give the better answers  for many months and no longer Kohl's and Kinkel's CDU/CSU-FDP  coalition.    The FDP, the junior partner not only in terms of size, are  shrinking in the voters' favor and come dangerously close to the  5-percent threshold. Polls still give it 8.5 percent of  secondary votes at the next Bundestag elections. However, the  doubts about its potency as a party that is capable of ruling  are rising. FOCUS also asked about this capability. The result  is somber for the coalition; however, it is not flattering for  the opposition either (0 percent = completely incapable of  ruling; 100 percent -- fully capable of ruling): SPD 62.4  percent, CDU 56.1 percent, CSU 48.4 percent, FDP 37.6 percent,  and Greens 30 percent.    The march of the coalition into ruin (even though still only  in public opinion polls) cannot be stopped by the government  team, at least not at the moment, because 40.7 percent of  Germans believe that Scharping can send the better team into the  race. Kohl's "lost bunch" only gets 25.7 percent in the favor  of the soon "interactive" audience. Even more devastating,  42.4:17.8 percent is the ratio in Kohl's landscapes in the  German east, which are flourishing a bit later.    Despite the self-confident whistling in Hamburg, which is to  hide one's fear of the darkness in the basement -- there is no  ray of light in sight for the courageous, steadfast men around  the black giant [Kohl].    However, the February poll of FOCUS still gives a little  consolation: The common fear shown by the "established" parties  of the numerous groups and small parties that want to run for  the Bundestag elections is increasingly shown to be unjustified.  Only 2 percent of those polled -- a figure that has remained  almost stable for months -- would vote for the "others." Only  the Republikaner (3.5 percent) and the Party of Democratic  Socialism (4 percent) could get close to the 5-percent  threshold. Even though the popularity values for the Instead  Party and the Association of Free Citizens are surprisingly  high, so far they do not have the slightest chance of entering  the next Bundestag.    Whether this will change will be decided by the CDU/CSU, the  SPD, the FDP, and the Greens. If they manage to contribute  their respective profiles to the election campaign, one need not  fear a fragmentation in the next Bundestag. However, achieving  one's own profile is obviously the problem. Asked how united or  how disunited the individual parties are on the central  political issues, the answers were the following (0 percent =  completely disunited; 100 percent -- completely united): CDU  53.4 percent, CSU 53.7 percent, SPD 54.8 percent, FDP 44,8  percent, and Greens 41.2 percent.    Long live the small difference.</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BRIEF HISTORY' MAKES SOME OF ITS OWN AFTER 2 YEARS AS BEST SELLER  </P> <P> Traditionally, the nonfiction marketplace was a black hole for science books.  Simplistic self-help books, cooking guides and glitz-biographies regularly  ascended to publishing superstardom. The egghead stuff disappeared into a  cultural cosmic void.  </P> <P> Then a gnomish University of Cambridge theoretical physicist wrote a book about  the possible origins of the universe.  </P> <P> This week, Stephen W. Hawking's "A Brief History of Time -- from the Big Bang  to Black Holes," celebrates its second year -- 104 weeks -- on the New York  Time's best-seller list. That is astronomical success for any book, but it's a  particularly quirky achievement for a serious book about quarks, quantum  mechanics and particle physics.  </P> <P> Disabled by the neurological disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (or Lou  Gehrig's disease), Hawking is confined to a wheelchair and to a body that  provides only minimal support to his celebrated brain. By most informed  estimations, he will be ranked alongside scientific luminaries such as Sir  Issac Newton and Albert Einstein.  </P> <P> "My goal is simple," Hawking once said. "It is complete understanding of the  universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all."  </P> <P> But shortly before "A Brief History" hit the bookstores in 1988, Hawking was  less grand in his explanation of why he wrote a layman's book discussing those  lofty matters. Speaking with a computerized voice that he laboriously activates  with a small joy-stick, and flashing the lopsided, devilish grin that has  become his trademark, he said: "I want to see it displayed in airport  bookstores."  </P> <P> "We always thought the book would do well," said Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman  for Bantam. But no one had a clue to just how well. The book is now in its 37th  printing, and with the 1.2 million hardcover copies still selling briskly at  $18.95 there are no foreseeable plans for a paperback release, Applebaum said.  </P> <P> With Steven Spielberg currently co-producing a 90-minute nonfiction film based  on the book -- with Hawking playing himself -- its potential for continued  success seems infinite.  </P> <P> Hawking has attributed his book's popularity to people's natural curiosity  about the universe they inhabit, and the fact that he left out the complex  equations of his craft, making it accessible to readers who are not  astrophysicists.  </P> <P> Scientists and publishers, meanwhile, have found hope in the public's growing  appetite for books about hard science. As Applebaum remarked: "Remember the old  H. L. Mencken dictum, 'No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence  of the American people?' The success of Stephen Hawking's book is a wonderful  rebuttal to that sort of cynicism."  </P></p>

Mr. Ray met the U.S. assistant  secretary for South Asian affairs, Mrs. Robin Raphel, in  Washington yesterday and discussed in detail President Clinton's  letter to a Democratic Congressman, Mr. Gary Condit.    The External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi had sharply  reacted on Sunday [23 January] to the development which comes in  the wake of the series of negative pronouncements by the U.S.  authorities on issues like Kashmir, human rights, and Punjab.  Meanwhile, a U.S. official in Washington has said that Mr.  Clinton's letter did not contain anything anti-Indian or sought  to encourage secessionist elements. According to the official  Mr. Clinton had mentioned that the situation in Punjab has  improved and that there have been regional elections leading to  the restoration of the local government and the level of  violence in the state also declined.    A United States delegation has appreciated the working of  the  National Human Rights Commission set up in the country recently.  A 12-member delegation consisting of two associate justices of  the United States Supreme Court, four U.S. circuit judges, and  five lawyers visited the National Human Rights Commission in New  Delhi today. The chairman of the commission, Mr. Justice  Ranganath Mishra, informed the visiting dignitaries that the  commission will soon publish its own regulations and make people  aware of its working procedures. The delegation has  specifically appreciated the commission for taking suo moto  cognizance of human rights violations and for its steps to order  independent inquiries into various cases.    The Punjab chief minister has criticized President Clinton  for his comments. Talking to our Chandigarh correspondent, Mr.  Beant Singh, said the U.S. President is ill-informed about  Punjab. The Sikhs are fully enjoying democratic rights in the  state. Reacting to the alleged violations of civil liberties,  the chief minister said he himself and the majority of the  elected legislators, sarpanchas [head of village council], and  panchas [village council member] in villages are Sikhs and the  state government is curbing militancy and not civil rights. Mr.  Beant Singh invited the U.S. President to Punjab to see for  himself the smooth running of democracy in the border state.</p>

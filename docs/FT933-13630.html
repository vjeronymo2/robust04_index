			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Books: Answering back DAUGHTERS OF DECADENCE: WOMEN WRITERS OF THE FIN DE SIECLE edited by Elaine Showalter Virago Pounds 6.99, 326 pages THE NEW WOMAN: WOMEN'S VOICES 1880-1919 edited by Juliet Gardner Collins &amp; Brown Pounds 6.99, 318 pages FROM CARMEN to Salome, from Rossetti's Persephone to Pater's Mona Lisa, how sexist we are in our love of the great heroines of the late 19th century. So powerful was the image of the femme fatale, the woman aestheticised by men as a dangerous sex object, that women artists seemed unable to answer back. 'My dear boy,' says Oscar Wilde in Dorian Gray, 'no woman is a genius. Women are the decorative sex. They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art.' In an earlier generation - the Brontes, George Eliot - women dominated the Victorian novel; why had they no successors in the fin de siecle? Here are two books which fill in the gaps. Daughters of Decadence is a collection of short stories which illuminates for the first time the Naughty Nineties from a female perspective. While Wilde, Whistler and the aesthetes swooned over dandies and green carnations, women writers were battling out their own answers to Victorian repression. Here, for instance, is Charlotte Mew's chillingly brilliant A White Night, a feminist counterpart to Heart of Darkness, where a girl on her honeymoon sees a woman ritually buried alive in a Spanish convent, at the heart of whiteness. In a horrid denouement to her dissection of idealised purity, Mew later killed herself by drinking disinfectant; her White Night also recalls the French nuit blanche, a sleepless night or twilight zone of consciousness where fantasies and fears are enacted. Written after A Doll's House but before Freud and The Interpretation of Dreams, such stories still flow off the page breathless with self-discovery and excitement at finding in dream and hallucination metaphors for liberation. An Egyptian Cigarette is Kate Chopin's opium dream of seduction by a sheikh; in Theodora Victoria Cross plays out androgynous eroticism in a game of oriental dressing up. Individually, these are curiosities; together they compel as testimony to the growing awareness of sexual possibilities. Elaine Showalter's excellent introduction suggests these writers were experimenters who paved the way for the feminist modernism of Virginia Woolf. Some of the best stories are savage assaults on the old guard: two, Lady Tal and Miss Grief, tell of gifted female novelists destroyed by a patronising hack modelled on Henry James. He never forgave their authors the 'treachery to private relations'. In another, Ada Leverson, who wrote a parody of Salome at dinner ('Is that mayonnaise? It is the mayonnaise of salmon, pink as a branch of coral . . . the pink roses that bloom in the garden of the queen of Arabia are not so pink'), mocks the sexual cruelty of a narcissist based on Wilde. Refreshing, powerful, different from anything by male writers: these stories make a rich, coherent anthology. The New Woman, which explores the socio-historical background of such fiction through letters, diaries, memoirs, is a sort of prosaic cousin. There are highlights here too - Beatrice Webb on the 'stupendous sacrifice of marriage' to Sidney; Marie Stopes on why 'nice' people expect women to have no sex drive - but much is of academic interest only. Juliet Gardner's theme is the dawn of new opportunities for women at work, in education, in and out of marriage, and her division of material into these sections throws up parallels and contradictions, differences between then and now. The material has been well researched, but little in the analysis is new, and the scissors and paste approach is maddening when it gives only titbits from correspondents like Woolf and Dora Carrington, interspersed with a great deal that is turgid and dated. Anthologies of women's writing are a growth area, and both these books will appeal to devotees. But the problem with reviving women's writing at all costs is that the mediocre and best-forgotten is carried along with the real and worthwhile discoveries, with the risk that women's work is further marginalised rather than brought into the mainstream. This is where The New Woman falls down, while Daughters of Decadence is a model, offering literature of originality, quality and a cultural interest which extends beyond the gender of its authors.</p>

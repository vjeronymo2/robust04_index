			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Christmas sales lift Fortnum &amp; Mason Fortnum &amp; Mason food fans helped the London department store to an increase in sales and pre-tax profits for the 28 weeks ended January 22 1994. A better-than-expected rise in Christmas catalogue sales - the wishbook of the famous Fortnum's hamper - helped boost operating profits by 21 per cent to Pounds 1.4m, on sales 10 per cent ahead to Pounds 17.2m. A drop in interest receivable, however, held back the advance at the pre-tax level and left the figure at Pounds 1.6m, compared with Pounds 1.5m. Earnings per share rose from 235p to 249p, while the the net interim dividend was maintained at 86p. Fortnum's, which is 89 per cent owned by George Weston Holdings, had net cash of Pounds 7m. This would fall after the purchase of a long leasehold for Pounds 1.75m. The company warned that the outlook for the second half remained uncertain. Trading continued to be buoyant, but the vast majority of Fortnum's profits were traditionally made in the first half.</p>

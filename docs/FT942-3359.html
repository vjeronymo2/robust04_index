			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Management: Travel sense for high-fliers - Michael Dempsey on corporate attitudes to air safety The recent Chinook helicopter crash not only wiped out decades of experience in the fight against terrorism in Northern Ireland; it raised questions about the sense of putting 25 senior personnel on one aircraft. In the commercial sector, the risk of losing an entire higher echelon has long been recognised as an issue that has to be addressed. 'If this happened to a commercial organisation I would expect to see the share price collapse,' says Michael Regester, a crisis management consultant with a long track record in the oil industry - a business that requires very senior staff to travel widely, often visiting remote sites by helicopter. Companies, says Regester, have to prepare for the worst. 'The basic rule is that you never put more than two directors on the same flight. And the company has to get across the message that it is not totally reliant on one individual,' he says. Regester warns that the loss of a high-profile director, by accident or otherwise, can be devastating to a company. Oil company Chevron rules that no more than two out of three of its principal officers can fly on the same aircraft. A total of five directors can fly together but they must comprise no more than two executive and three non-executive directors. 'The thinking is obviously that in the event of an accident we've still got at least one principal officer to assume command right away,' a Chevron spokesman says. 'It's just commonsense. You cannot afford to have your board wiped out.' 'Our board members do a lot of travel offshore,' says Chevron. 'If they have to visit a rig they might use up to three helicopters, even though the party would fit into one.' IBM, the world's largest computer company, also has a policy on air travel. In August 1983, Don Estridge, head of the company's Entry Systems division, was killed when a Delta Airlines flight crashed at Dallas Airport. The loss of Estridge, a visionary who had championed the personal computer within IBM, arguing against colleagues who refused to believe that one day a PC would sit on every desk in the business world, was keenly felt. By coincidence several other IBM personnel were also on that flight but in spite of the personal loss incurred, the crash did not wipe out a significant part of the company's leadership. IBM, which says its precautions predate the Dallas accident, issues an instruction letter on flight safety. It says no more than three country general managers or heads of divisions should travel on the same flight. Checks are carried out on airline safety. For corporate jet and helicopter hire only approved companies are used and IBM is rumoured to inspect individual pilot's records. The aim is to ensure that a business jet containing senior staff is only piloted by a very experienced crew. While companies like Chevron and IBM have formal procedures on air travel, elsewhere dividing travelling parties is regarded as too obvious to need spelling out. 'It's an unwritten policy,' a London-based spokeswoman for Japan's Nomura Bank explains. In January, Nomura's London arm sent 20 top staff in its bonds division to a fixed income conference in Prague. Mindful of eastern Europe's air safety record, the specialists travelled in three groups on separate flights. Taking a different approach, oil company BP has found that a new emphasis on the use of video-conferencing is one way to reduce corporate air miles. Britain's Ministry of Defence is already under pressure to contract out more facilities to the private sector. The armed forces view this trend with suspicion, but in the aftermath of the Chinook crash there would at least seem to be some lessons to be learned in the area of air safety.</p>

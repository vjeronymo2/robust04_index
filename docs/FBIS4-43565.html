			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has said  that between 1,000 and 2,000 soldiers would be needed to carry  out a French humanitarian operation in Rwanda. [passage  omitted] Alain Juppe was interviewed in the Ivorian capital by  Jean-Karim Fall:    [Begin recording] [Juppe] We have said very clearly that our  intervention should be given the green light by the United  Nations. We are examining the type of UN resolution that could  give a mandate to member states to intervene to save the  population, which is the prime concern.    Several European countries that we have contacted have told  us, some publicly, that they approve of the principle of the  operation. I spoke to my Italian, Spanish and British  colleagues, and other contacts have been made in Paris. Several  African countries have also expressed their support in  principle. We are now examining the concrete modalities of the  operation, the duration of which should be limited; it should  have precise objectives and should be exclusively humanitarian.  The aim is to save people who might be killed within the next  few days. The operation should be carried out by several  countries. To avoid any ambiguity, France does not wish to go  it alone.    [Fall] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is opposed to any  French presence in Rwanda. Could this mollify your  determination to intervene?    [Juppe] No. This does change our determination, but we would  like to convince the RPF of our intentions. I understand that  some extremists want to solve the problem through a complete  military victory. This will solve nothing. One day a  reconciliation process to share power will have to be reached,  enabling Hutus and Tutsis to live together in Rwanda. France  tried to obtain this kind of settlement, most notably through  the Arusha Agreement.    We will continue our contacts with RPF officials. I would  like to stress that we obtained their agreement to let a  humanitarian convoy through to Kigali; 30 tonnes are on the way.  I believe that it is possible to explain better what we are  doing.    [Fall] You told the daily LIBERATION that you are in favor  of  judging those responsible for this genocide. Are you in favor  of an international tribunal?    [Juppe] Yes. Such a tribunal will probably have to be set  up. It is out of the question to reinstate extremists with so  much blood on their hands when we sit around a table in an  attempt to find a peace agreement. They will have to be  identified and punished.    [Fall] Many observers consider that Hutu extremists started  this genocide. Do you share this view?    [Juppe] It is indisputable that the day after president  Habyarimana -- who was able to maintain a balance for years, who  agreed to the Arusha process -- died, extremists from his camp,  militias, initiated massacres which I myself called genocide, in  the proper sense of the word, namely: To exterminate a  population on the ground of its ethnic characteristics. There  is not any doubt about this. Massacres by the other side took  place when the RPF troops advanced: This is also obvious.    [Fall] You also said in LIBERATION that French policy in  Rwanda had not always be faultless. On which precise point do  you believe that France made mistakes?    [Juppe] Who can pretend to be infallible? Rather than stress  mistakes I would rather stress what we have attempted to do in  Rwanda. I will gladly mention it, since this process was partly  initiated before April 1993. As I said earlier, our aim was  reconciliation and power-sharing. [passage omitted]    I cannot accept the accusation of bias or of France's  support  for one side against the other. This is not what happened. I  repeat that what we tried to do was to help the population --  who will have to cohabitate one day or another -- live together.  [end recording]</p>

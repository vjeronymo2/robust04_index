Flores Mocari S.A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For CV to purchase price comparisons, we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For CV to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We also deducted from CV the weighted-average U.S. indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs, up to the amount of the greater of related party commissions or indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

However, we did not initiate a critical circumstances investigation because, since roses are extremely perishable, it is not possible to accumulate an inventory of roses in order to evade a potential antidumping duty order. Therefore, we determined that an allegation that critical circumstances exist is without merit ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

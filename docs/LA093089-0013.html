			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW YORK YACHT CLUB CRITICIZED FOR APATHY  </P> <P> Rich Roberts' article indicated a lack of interest among prospective  participants in San Diego Yacht Club's defense of the America's Cup. It seems  strange that the New York Yacht Club and some of the other East Coast  syndicates are not interested in defending the Cup.  </P> <P> Could there be a connection with the New York Yacht Club's court testimony that  Dennis Conner's defense against New Zealand's monohull with a catamaran was  unfair?  </P> <P> With all the charges of unsportsmanlike conduct against Conner, it should be  remembered that he did participate in three Cup defenses for the New York Yacht  Club. The New York Yacht Club has certainly shown its lack of sportsmanship by  failing to respond to San Diego's call for participation in a strong American  defense of the Cup.  </P> <P> BYRON SLATER, San Diego  </P></p>

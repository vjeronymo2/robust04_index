			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by chief editor Talal Salman: "The Nation Is Under </F> International Oil Guardianship."]    [Text] International guardianship over the Arabs from the  Atlantic to the Gulf has come full circle with Yemen.    The "war of the brothers", indeed the "war against  ourselves"  was noticeably delayed until oil was discovered in commercial  quantities in the "two parts of that country." This delay shows  the design: For the United States to get its hands on Arab oil  wherever it is, always in the name of international legality,  and to implement this international legality's resolutions to  prevent the Arabs from burning themselves with their own oil,  just like children playing with matches.    What is important is that, as of today, a "Security Council"  is the arbiter between one Yemen and another, deciding for each  miserable "part" what is good for it, what is bad, and what is  forbidden. The primary taboo is for Yemen to unite as a sound,  capable entity able to compensate for its historical misery by  exploiting its natural resources.    In the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf where "sovereignty"  belongs to the kingdom of black gold and white silence, everyone  is under the direct protection of several junior officers of the  U.S. Armed Forces. No ruler tenders an offer without their  permission or buys a motorcycle without their approval. Indeed,  those officers decide "what is needed", who to buy from, the  price, and the commission. These officers alone have the right  to "instruct" the sultans when and how much "democracy" to grant  to their citizens. Democracy there cannot be attained except  with the use of U.S. crutches, one of which would preferably be  a "Wahhabite" [form of Islam prevalent in Saudi Arabia] crutch  and the other a "revanchist" crutch with a mentality harking  back to such a distant past that it sees in Wahhabism an  atheistic, destructive ideology.    Although everyone in that region was committed to the logic  of "market economy", even prior to the official declaration of  U.S. protection, they were not required to adhere to the other  side of that baleful coin, namely human rights and political  pluralism.    While Kuwait, in U.S. eyes, is "more than a protectorate but  less than a negro [Zinji] quarter," this does not spare it the  necessity of surrounding itself with a legendary barricade  extending through the desert along the entire length of its  "border" with Iraq, filled with such luxuries as refrigeration,  cool water, and rugby and baseball fields. This will guarantee  that it will be a golden burial ground for the remaining oil  revenues, the so-called "fund for future generations," which the  "shaykhs" used to save for a rainy day.    Meanwhile, an irrevocable international sentence has been  passed against Iraq, with no room for appeal. The sentence is  to keep the tyrant safe and sound, but to execute the people,  with their various Arab, Kurdish, Turkoman, Assyrian, Chaldean,  Babylonian, Muslim, Christian, Sabian, and Yazidi sects and the  remnants of the fire-worshipping Magi.    A more serious matter is the starving of the Iraqis while  their huge oil reserves go to waste. Their tall refineries  stand still and their thousand-kilometer pipelines stretch to  the gulfs and seas, empty like their treasury, their wallets,  and home refrigerators.    If we assume that the fate of the eastern triangle--Jordan,  Syria, and Lebanon--hinges on what Israel, the "local" strategic  ally, decides is best for U.S. interests in this region, then  the option offered to the countries forming this triangle is as  follows: Either an Egypt-like Camp David arrangement with a  U.S.- dominated multinational observer force or a  Gaza/Jericho-like agreement with local police serving under  Israeli command.    The non-oil-producing countries--Sudan, Tunisia, Morocco,  and  Mauritania--can suffer a slow death and crawl on their bellies,  asking, today or tomorrow, for bits of the U.S. food surplus.    Or they can die in mass extermination orgies, as in Somalia.    Libya, however, and later on Algeria, must pay a retroactive  price for their revolutionary pretensions. Thus, sanctions are  imposed on the Libyan people, who know hardly anything about the  world, politics, or the taste of living. A ring of fire  surrounds Libya, impenetrable to even a single plane, even  medical or fire-fighting emergency flights to the oil fields.    How dare someone to whom fate has given fabulous wealth,  more  than they can personally use, speak of revolution, unity, the  liberation of Palestine, and jihad against Israel?    Therefore, it is necessary to condemn the entire Libyan  nation and fight it as if it were a scourge or contagious  disease. It must repent publicly, give up its wealth, and kill  with its own hand everything that remotely refers to revolution,  today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow. They might even  require the Libyan nation to dig up the grave of its heroic  martyr 'Umar al-Mukhtar, who was hanged by the Italian  colonialists, put his remains on trial, and hang him (again) on  the charge of prior incitement against the new world order and  the U.S. monopoly of Arab oil.    As for Algeria, let it sink gradually into an open-ended  civil war that will sap the state's and the people's energies so  that the oil and natural gas can remain in the hands of the U.S.  master, who will "hasten" alone to save the one-million-martyr  country from drowning in a multibillion-dollar debt, the  interest on which would eat up the world.    All Arabs are minors, wards of international guardianship.    In accordance with international legality's resolutions,  every "Arab" has a compulsory guardian (generally American and  only occasionally European) who makes decisions for him.    The oil belongs to those who discovered and extracted it,  laid its pipelines, built its refineries, and shipped it to the  "developed society," which deserves to enjoy its revenues since  it is qualified to utilize it as a source of energy that has a  decisive influence on the world's destiny and humanity's fate.    After Israel's and the oil's future is guaranteed, no  worries  will remain except this exceptional population increase in the  backward Arab societies. There can be no solution to this  except for the Arabs to exterminate each other.    Hence, the map of the Arab homeland resembles a lake of  futilely shed blood, all of it true Arab blood.    Only when it comes to killing is there no guardianship of  the  Arabs. In this they are free, to the point of total chaos.    The more the Arabs shed their own cheap blood, the greater  the share for the U.S. West (including Israel) of their precious  oil.    Thank God that Lebanon is not an oil country. Otherwise its  civil war would have continued until the last drop of its  stalwart sons' blood was shed.</p>

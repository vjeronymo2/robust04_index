			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand's first HIV/AIDS vaccine tests are expected  to be discontinued after it has been found they violate the  HIV/AIDS National Vaccine Development Plan.    The Thai Red Cross Society's AIDS programme director,  Praphan  Phanuphak, earlier this month injected 30 volunteers with an  initial dose of the candidate vaccine, GP 120, to test its  safety.    A senior official with the National AIDS Prevention and  Control Committee said yesterday the AIDS programme had not  followed the National Vaccine Development Plan's guidelines  which state that any institution testing vaccines should be  equipped with laboratories.    The results of the candidate vaccine on the volunteers are  not tested by Dr Praphan. They are sent to the vaccine  producer, United Biomedical Incorporation of the United States,  for testing.    A member of the World Health Organisation (WHO) steering  committee on AIDS vaccine development, Nat Phamonprawat, said  Thai researchers should carry out any vaccine tests even if the  vaccine is obtained from abroad.    He said Thai researchers should head the tests and any  foreign researchers should only act as advisers.    Dr Nat said Thailand should set up laboratories to test  vaccines so it can obtain maximum information about the results.    The Public Health Ministry's AIDS Division director, Wiphut  Phuncharoen said it was unacceptable for the blood of volunteers  to be sent to the United States for testing.    "How can we be sure the manufacturing firm is not biased  towards its own product?" he asked.    Mr Wiphut said it was the responsibility of the National  AIDS  Prevention and Control Committee's Data Safety Monitoring Board  to look into locally conducted HIV/AIDS vaccine tests.    The committee chaired by Dr Prasoet Thongcharoen of Mahidon  University now cannot function officially because Public Health  Minister Athit Urairat has not approved the committee's  appointment.    Dr Athit, the chairman of the Sub-Committee on National AIDS  Prevention and Control, cannot sign the appointment because he  is in hospital.    The deputy chairman of the House Committee on Public Health,  Wichai Chaichitwanitchakun of the New Aspiration Party, warned  Dr Praphan to stop the tests of the HIV/AIDS vaccine following  reports from the US that six of 300 volunteers being tested  there have become infected with the deadly disease.    But Dr Wiphut of the AIDS Division said the consent forms  signed by volunteers injected with the vaccine in the US clearly  states the volunteers were not infected with the virus due to  the vaccine.    Dr Wichai said the Red Cross Society should be responsible  for the volunteers' health for three to five years after the  tests, not simply for the nine months while the tests are being  conducted, as side effects may develop later.    He said he would also propose to Parliament that it issue a  law providing up to two million baht in social security benefits  for medical staff working with AIDS patients.    The Red Cross's Dr Praphan was unavailable for comment  yesterday.</p>

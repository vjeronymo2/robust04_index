			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Bookending the Oscar nominees for outstanding movie making are nominations for  the ninth annual Razzie Awards heralding the year's worst films. "Cocktail,"  "Rambo III," "Hot to Trot," "Caddyshack II" and "Mack and Me" stand out among  the bottom-of-the-heap nods given by the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation. The  awards -- a gold spray-painted, golfball-sized raspberry atop a plastic base --  will be presented March 29, same day as the 61st annual Oscar ceremony. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

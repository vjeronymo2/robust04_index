			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (23): More popular now inflation is down - Bond and cash funds / There's a prospect of capital growth, income or both. But high yields may eat up capital, so investors should know what they are buying UNIT TRUSTS in the UK have been dominated by equities, with bond and cash unit trusts accounting only for a small proportion of the industry. The reverse is true in the US, where the mutual fund industry is weighted in favour of bond and money market funds. The reasons for this are largely historical. 'The UK unit trust industry was started with an equity fund,' explained Victoria Nye, of the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds (AUTIF). 'The public in the UK has been able to find low-risk savings at the building society, and could in any case buy gilts directly.' The advantage of buying gilts  - UK government bonds  - directly is that the charges are lower than for unit trusts. The commission on a gilt purchase bought through the Post Office is Pounds 1 for the first Pounds 250, then 50p for every extra Pounds 125 or part. Those who buy large amounts through a stockbroker are also likely to pay less than for a unit trust, where the usual charges are a 5 per cent initial fee and a 1 per cent annual management charge. There is also a tax disadvantage to buying gilts in a fund. Gains are liable to capital gains tax, whereas gilts bought directly are CGT-exempt. The AUTIF is lobbying to end this discrimination and, in its Budget submission this year, has called for gilt funds to be made exempt from CGT. It has also succeeded in securing a change which will make UK-based bond funds more attractive to non-UK taxpayers. UK-based unit trusts do not pay income gross but, from the start of the 1994 tax year, they will be able to do so to non-UK taxpayers. For those who do not have the time or the expertise to manage a portfolio of gilts or other bonds, bond funds offer to take the hassle out of tricky investment decisions. They have been increasing in popularity during a rally in bond prices in the UK, thanks to low inflation and low short-term interest rates. Net sales of UK and international fixed-interest funds totalled Pounds 332.4m in the first half of the year, compared with Pounds 95.3m in the first half of 1992. The trigger for the rally in the UK was sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism, which led to a spate of interest rate cuts and to a rise in bond prices. Interest rates have also started to fall in Europe, again leading to capital gains for those holding international bond funds. With UK base rates at 6 per cent, long-term gilts now yield more than cash, a factor which has not been overlooked by income-seeking investors. Analysts such as BZW do not expect the difference in returns between equities and bonds to be as great in the 1990s as in the 1980s, and expectations are that inflation will be lower in the 1990s  - factors which are favourable to the sale of bonds. Bond funds offer investors income, capital growth, or a combination of the two. Some offer a high yield, which is achieved purely by eating up capital. That might be attractive to some investors, but they should know what they are buying. There are three main types of fixed-interest fund: UK gilt and fixed interest, international fixed interest and offshore bond funds. UK gilt and fixed interest funds: Most of these are dominated by gilts, but some also invest in the fixed-interest shares of companies. Since a company is more likely to go bust than the government, the increased risk is often reflected by a higher yield. The top two performers in the three years to September 1, according to Micropal, were: Abtrust Fixed Interest (84 per cent growth with net income reinvested; current yield 7.1 per cent) and Aetna Preference (69 per cent; 7.7 per cent). These invest heavily in preference shares, which pay a fixed dividend and rank ahead of ordinary shares in terms of dividend payment and capital repayment in the event of a wind-up. International bond funds: These are not confined to investing in UK-issued fixed-interest bonds, but also deal in those issued by foreign governments and corporations. They are considered to be riskier than UK bond funds, because of the added currency factor. European bonds are currently regarded as attractive, because interest rates, which are higher on the Continent than in the UK, have begun to fall, and this should lead to capital gains. Managers of a high-income fund are likely to be heavily invested in the high-yielding bond markets such as Italy and Spain. The highest performing funds in the one year to September 1, according to Micropal, were: Guinness Flight Global High Income bond (44 per cent growth with net income reinvested; 7.6 per cent yield) and Invesco International bond (38 per cent; 5.5 per cent). Offshore bond funds: Their main advantage to UK investors, particularly non-taxpayers, is that income is paid gross. A UK-resident non-taxpayer does not need to reclaim tax from the Inland Revenue, which is what they would have to do if they invested in an onshore bond fund. Even resident UK citizens who are liable for tax may find offshore bond funds attractive, because the tax payment can be delayed. Investors worried about risk should look for offshore bond funds which are recognised by the Securities and Investments Board  - the chief regulator for the financial services industry in the UK. Performance figures for offshore funds are usually quoted on an offer-to-offer basis. This is because some funds have a single price but add on an initial charge, so if all funds were ranked on an offer-to-bid basis, the single-priced funds would receive an unfair advantage. However, the effect of quoting in this way is that the performance figures are better than the returns which would actually have been achieved by an investor. The highest performing sterling fixed-interest offshore bond funds in the three years to September 1, according to Hardwick Stafford Wright, were: Hypo F&amp;C RA Sterling bonds (72 per cent growth, no yield and Barclays Sterling bond (72 per cent growth; 8.5 per cent yield). Cash unit trusts: Unlike the bond funds, these do not invest in fixed-interest securities but in the money markets, where money is bought and sold for short periods by institutions and rates change daily. Yields are quoted net of charges. The main advantage is that a higher rate is paid on a lower minimum than can easily be found at bank or building societies. Speed of access is similar to a postal account. The fund with the highest return in the year to September 1, according to Micropal, was LAS Maximum Distribution, with growth of 5.85 per cent. The second best trust - Lazard Money Market  - grew by 5.84 per cent.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Record year yields to change of sentiment - Why enthusiasm for Canadian bond offerings is waning JUST as Canadian and foreign securities dealers are rushing to capitalise on last year's surge of interest in Canadian bonds, investors' enthusiasm for these securities shows signs of waning. Foreigners poured a record CDollars 27.3bn into bonds issued by Canadian borrowers in either the domestic or international markets in the first 11 months of last year, more than double the inflow for the whole of 1990. However, a weakening Canadian dollar, narrower spreads between North American and European interest rates, and Canada's political uncertainties have lately raised doubts about the wisdom of further beefing up Canadian bond portfolios. ScotiaMcLeod of Toronto notes in its latest bond market letter that US and German institutions, which made up close to half of last year's buying, 'have begun to lighten their exposure'. New issues in the domestic and EuroCanadian markets have virtually dried up over the past month as borrowers wait for stability to return to the Canadian dollar and the bond market. One Toronto bond analyst predicts that 'Canadian entities will not achieve the same volumes, spreads or amounts in the Euromarket this year that they did in 1991'. They are expected to rely heavily in coming months on global offerings and foreign-currency issues, which can then be swapped into Canadian dollars. The impact of investors' loss of appetite for Canadian issues is likely to hit some borrowers harder than others. Thanks to , and CDollars 800m in 'pre-borrowings' completed last year, Ontario Hydro has already raised about half of its 1992 requirements of CDollars 4.6bn. The province of Ontario, which raised CDollars 6bn outside Canada last year, appears to face a stiffer challenge. With a spiralling budget deficit, the total amount of foreign borrowing is unlikely to be less than last year. The province's credit rating is expected to be lowered after the 1992-1993 budget is presented this spring. Treasury officials acknowledge that the proportion of foreign funding is bound to drop from the unusually high 70 per cent reached in 1991. Despite the recent setbacks, last year's huge inflows have fuelled unprecedented foreign interest in the Canadian market. The Canadian government bond market is now the world's seventh biggest, with a market value of close to CDollars 160bn. The cumulative return on federal government bonds included in Goldman Sachs' new Canadian government bond index was an annualised 15.8 per cent (measured in US dollars) between January 1988 and December 1991, including a 22 per cent return last year. By contrast, the return on Goldman's US Treasury market portfolio was an annualised 11.3 per cent over the past four years. Some institutions still hold as much as 40 per cent of their portfolios in Canadian bonds. Mr Steve McGirr, vice-president for government finance at Wood Gundy in Toronto, estimates that the firm's economists now spend about half their time with European and Japanese investors with Canadian bond portfolios. Wood Gundy has set up a desk in its London office to trade domestic Canadian issues, and has also started selling Canadian mortgage- and asset-backed securities in London. Another sign of the broadening investor base is an unaccustomed degree of competition among providers of bond indices. The Canadian bond-index market has long been the preserve of ScotiaMcLeod, which compiles more than a dozen different indices to help portfolio managers assess the performance of their holdings. But Scotia's heels are now being nipped by Burns Fry of Toronto and, most recently, by Goldman Sachs. Burns Fry began compiling a family of Canadian bond indices in 1990. Goldman launched its government bond index last month to supplement similar services on the US, German and Japanese markets. Prior to the present lull, interest was especially strong in bonds issued by the provinces. Yields on provincial issues are typically 40 to 60 basis points higher than those on federal government bonds. The yield on ScotiaMcLeod's portfolio of provincial issues was 23.4 per cent last year, compared with 21.3 per cent on its Universe Canada index. Provincial yields are somewhat lower than those of the two big power utility borrowers, Ontario Hydro and Hydro-Quebec. For instance, 10-year British Columbia bonds currently yield 8.92 per cent, against 9.13 per cent on a comparable Ontario Hydro issue. The outlook for Canadian issues should become clearer over the next few months. The federal government is due to present its budget within four weeks, to be followed in April and May by budgets for most of the 10 provinces. Those crossing fingers for a renewed burst of interest are pinning their hopes on the release of January's consumer price index figures on February 21. The figures, the first without the one-time impact of the 7 per cent goods and services tax imposed in January 1991, are expected to show a slowing of the inflation rate, perhaps to an annualised rate of less than 2 per cent. If the Bank of Canada sticks to its anti-inflation guns, confidence in the Canadian dollar and expectations of a further drop in interest rates could be revived.</p>

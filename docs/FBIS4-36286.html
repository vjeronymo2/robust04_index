			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, "president of the </F> Democratic Republic of Yemen," in al-Mukalla, by Nichole  Tannuri, in London, on 7 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Tannuri] 'Ali Salim al-Bid, president of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen, told MBC Television this evening  via satellite from his current headquarters in al-Mukalla,  Hadhramaut, that talks should take place after the war stops and  that they could address all issues. He welcomed the mission of  special UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi. He said that he will not set  any preconditions or make any prerequisites so that Ibrahimi's  mission is not fraught with obstacles.    We asked al-Bid at the beginning of our meeting with him  about the latest developments in the military situation.    [Begin recording] [Al-Bid] The military situation: I believe  it is well-known now that there are many battles raging around  Aden. There are also battles raging on the Hadhramaut and  Shabwah fronts. But there is also mythical heroism from our  people.    [Tannuri] What are the factors for the success of the  mission of UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi, in your opinion?    [Al-Bid] We welcome Lakhdar Ibrahimi in his capacity as the  envoy of the UN secretary general and as an Arab brother with a  respectable position and experience in the Arab homeland. I  also believe that he will find us cooperating with him. We are  confident that he is the man for such a mission.    [Tannuri] Is it possible to return to the subject of unity  once again?    [Al-Bid] All issues are open for discussion. We declared the  Democratic Republic of Yemen. The bases on which this republic  is established are known. The important thing now is to talk  about stopping the fighting. We can then discuss any other  topic.    [Tannuri] How did you receive the Gulf Cooperation Council  [GCC] statement regarding Yemen?    [Al-Bid] We believe that this is the result of the status  quo. Our relations with the GCC and with all the Arab countries  and the rest of the world are old relations going back a quarter  of a century. The transitional period during which we earnestly  tried to move toward unity is a period of a break in relations  that was not successful as a result of obstacles imposed by the  kind of thinking that interprets unity as control and hegemony.  It was a period of our estrangement from the rest of the world.  However, we believe that the statement is a good statement. We  expect more serious steps to be taken after this. [end  recording]</p>

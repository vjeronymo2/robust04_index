			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> FANCY FOOTWORK FROM THE TOM TOM CLUB  </P> <P> "Hi everybody! Welcome to the Tom Tom Club," said a beaming Chris Frantz as he  took his spot behind the drum kit Saturday at the 2nd Coming club.  </P> <P> From his buoyant, kiddie-show-host demeanor, you'd not guess the frustrations  and fancy footwork that preceded the belated beginning of the Tom Tom Club's  Los Angeles residency. After last Tuesday's opening at Variety Arts Center was  canceled because of permit problems, the group scrambled around and finally  opened Friday at the trendy mid-town dance club, a former Knights of Columbus  hall.  </P> <P> The Tom Tom Club, the funky side project of Frantz and his wife, bassist Tina  Weymouth -- the rhythm section of Talking Heads -- bounced and rocked through a  no-frills show Saturday that justified the "event" aura of this special  extended run.  </P> <P> What is light and airy on the three Tom Tom Club albums was downright massive  on stage. Weymouth (a stronger and more confident singer live than on the  records) and Frantz -- supported by guitarist Mark Roule, keyboardist Gary  Pozner and effervescent singers Trish Ippolito and Victoria Clamp -- gave extra  life to such already lively material as their old rap/funk hit "Genius of Love"  and tunes from the new "Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom" album. They encored with  "Under the Boardwalk" and a fun (yes, fun!) version of the Heads fave "Psycho  Killer."  </P> <P> The arty, post-Nina Hagen opening act Maria Excommunicada added to the "scene"  feel, as did the inexpensive tickets -- just $12 -- and souvenir T-shirts -- a  $6 bargain. The engagement continues Tuesday through Sunday.  </P> <P> Information: (714) 841-2872. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 22 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- At the  secondary schools of Mongolia there are studying some 370  thousand children. This is approximately by ten thousand less  than during the last year. More than 92 thousand schoolchildren  have stopped attending their lessons for the current schooling  year. Such a weakening children's interest in study is being  promoted by a number of objective and subjective factors. Among  them one can see such as a formalistic attitude to the teaching  in schools, low level professional skill of some teachers and at  last financial difficulties arising in the transition period to  a market. Last winter some 86 schools had to cease their  studies due to the absence of heating supply to their  schoolbuildings. For many of schools in the countryside there  is a serious lack of teaching staff.</p>

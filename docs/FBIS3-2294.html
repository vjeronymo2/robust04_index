			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Yaozhong (1776 5069 0022)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 3 Mar (XINHUA) -- Honorary President of  the China Industrial Economy Society Bo Yibo, attended and spoke  at its national congress today. He stressed that we should  regard raising economic efficiency as our central task to  enhance progress. He said: To accelerate progress, we must  uphold the principle of seeking truth from facts and proceed to  perform all our tasks in a down-to-earth manner. We definitely  cannot blindly compete for rates of progress. After integrating  speed, efficiency, quality, and the market in accordance with  the actual conditions of various trades and localities, we  should strive to raise efficiency in an effort to accomplish  rapid progress within our reach.    China's Industrial Economy Society is a national mass  organization voluntarily formed by representatives from large  and medium state industrial enterprises and industrial  enterprises under other ownerships; scientific research and  designing units; industrial economic research groups; relevant  state departments; and renowned figures from industrial and  economic circles. In the five years since its establishment, it  has achieved enormous accomplishments in providing two-way  services for the government and grass-roots units. The purpose  of the national congress and the second national executive  meeting is to summarize past work and study concepts for future  tasks.    In his speech at the meeting, Bo Yibo stressed two issues:  1. The necessity of strengthening macroeconomic regulation and  control; and 2. correctly handling the relationship between  speed and efficiency.    Addressing the first issue, Bo Yibo said: Under the guidance  of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th CPC  National Congress in 1993, China reported rapid economic  progress, reform was carried out in an all-around manner, and  the overall economy progressed favorably. In an effort to  resolve acute contradictions and problems since the beginning of  last summer, the party Central Committee and State Council  promptly deepened reform and have taken mainly economic measures  to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control. We have  attained positive results. While fully affirming the results,  we should also soberly notice: We have yet to thoroughly  resolve many deep-seated problems in economic work, and many  macroeconomic regulatory and control measures are merely  temporary solutions that do not effect a permanent cure.  Our ultimate goal is to reform the economic structure thoroughly  and to establish a socialist market economic structure. What  merits our attention today is the continued pressure of  inflation and strains on the macroeconomy as a result of the  overextended or evergrowing investment scale of fixed assets and  high price hikes in the markets. Such a phenomenon is  unavoidable in the process of establishing a socialist market  economy in China. Experience shows that the pace of  marketization must be commensurate with the ability of  macroeconomic regulation and control. A greater ability in  macroeconomic regulation and control can reduce problems and  make their solution easier. At the present, macroeconomic  regulation and control should be focused on strictly controlling  the investment scale of fixed assets. We should leave some  margin in our construction scale, which must be compatible with  our national strength. We should not rely on excessive issuance  of money to "keep up" with the evergrowing construction scale.  We must implement to the letter and in all economic sectors and  all fields of work the series of macroeconomic regulatory and  control policy measures which have been meticulously drawn up by  the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the  core, for thoroughly reforming the economic structure. It is  absolutely not allowed to continue the practice of "getting  around the central authorities' policies with countermeasures,"  and to ignore the order and do things one's own way. We must  consider the overall interests and safeguard the party central  committee's authority.    Discussing the question of how to correctly handle the  relationship between speed and efficiency, Bo Yibo pointed out:  Growth rate and economic efficiency must be organically combined  because development is the essential criterion. Since we have  stressed efficiency and quality, we must strive to develop the  export-oriented economy at a faster pace. This is Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's consistent thought. To accurately and  comprehensively understand this thought to ensure the organic  combination of growth rate and economic efficiency is crucial  for maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of  the national economy. In view of the already high national  economic growth rate and of the rising enthusiasm in all  sectors, it is necessary to emphasize the need to focus  attention on raising economic efficiency. Compared with the  developed countries, we do not see much change in our low  industrial economic efficiency as reflected in such problems as  seeking unduly high output value to the negligence of quality;  blindly turning out what one can produce without considering  market sales and demands; focusing attention only on expanding  production scale while failing to optimizing economic structure;  and competing with others for funds to launch construction  projects without giving a thought to our national strength and  financial and material resources. These problems, which  actually reflect the maladies of the production-oriented economy  and traditional planned economic structure over the years, have  almost become chronic and stubborn diseases in some enterprises  and localities, and have brought about serious consequences for  the progress of our undertakings. With the development of a  socialist market economy, we should say now is the time to wake  up to reality. We must correctly and unmistakably understand  the central committee's emphasis on seizing the opportunity and  accelerating development, and should not one-sidedly understand  it as a go-ahead signal to ignore the law on economic  development and to seek an unduly high growth rate. The central  committee's 8-9 percent targeted growth rate for the Eighth  Five-Year Plan is both positive and prudent. We must see to it  that the focus of economic work is truly shifted to the orbit  centering on improved economic efficiency. If we develop the  economy in this manner, even a 10 percent growth rate will still  be solid and sound. An overextended scale of capital  construction beyond the limit of our national strength will  inevitably lead to readjustment of the growth rate, and will  ultimately deprive us of the opportunity of development and  delay the progress of our socialist modernization drive.    Bo Yibo pointed out: To ensure the organic combination of  speed and efficiency, it is imperative to implement the state's  industrial policy by improving industrial structure, product  mix, and organizational setup of enterprises. As far as  industrial development is concerned, we should energetically  solve problems such as basic industries -- energy and  transportation in particular -- lagging behind the processing  industry, overdeveloped and underdeveloped sectors in the  processing industry, and low standards of specialization and  socialization of enterprises, so as to bring about a marked  improvement in the economic structure and to continually raise  efficiency through optimizing structure.    To ensure the organic combination of speed and efficiency,  it  is essential to promote scientific and technological progress  and improve the quality of the work force. It is crucial that  we rely on science and technology to educate and train a new  generation of people who have ideals, general knowledge, and a  sense of morality and discipline. We must be innovative in  applying science and technology, and must gradually develop our  own technology instead of relying mainly on imports so as to  reduce our gap in science and technology with the developed  countries.    To ensure the organic combination of speed and efficiency,  it  is necessary to strengthen the management and operation of  enterprises and strive to lower production costs. Commodities  have no national boundaries, and the key to opening up export  markets lies in improved quality. To this end, it is imperative  to set up a modern enterprise management system and practice  strict scientific management. It is also necessary to set eyes  on the internal management of enterprises, economize, and raise  labor productivity. In a sense, effective management can lead to  improved efficiency.    Bo Yibo emphasized: The road of development centering around  improved economic efficiency is an arduous and complicated  systems engineering project which requires our persistent  efforts, continuous exploration in the course of practice, and  summation of experiences in good time.    Lu Dong, chairman of the China Industrial Economy Society,  made a speech, entitled "Work Hard To Open Up a New Situation in  Society's Work."    Dong Shaohua, executive vice chairman of the society,  delivered a work report on behalf of the society's Council.    Today's meeting was attended by Duan Junyi, as well as  officials from relevant departments under the State Planning  Commission and the State Economic and Trade Commission. Ye  Qing, vice minister in charge of the State Planning Commission,  chaired today's meeting.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii said Friday he has no plans to discuss trade issues when  he meets U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen in Hawaii.    Ruling out any plans to seek resumption of the stalled  bilateral trade talks, Fujii stressed that a meeting with  Bentsen is not yet set but if it takes place in Hawaii it will  be to discuss Asia-Pacific affairs. "It all depends when the  talks are actually held," Fujii said, expressing uncertainty  over what Bentsen may want to discuss.    Fujii will leave for Hawaii on Friday evening to attend a  two-day meeting of finance ministers from the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.    Noting that APEC nations are highly interested in Japan's  economic trends, Fujii said he would explain the latest 15.25  trillion yen stimulus package that includes "extremely big" tax  cuts worth some 6 trillion yen.    He said the single-year tax cuts would have sufficient  effects to put the economy into a "full-fledged recovery phase  in fiscal 1994."    Asked what measures will be taken in and after fiscal 1995  to  attain the "stable growth" aimed for by the government, Fujii  said the Finance Ministry will stay "neutral."    He declined to elaborate but said the ruling coalition  parties are now discussing how they can decide on a permanent  tax reform by the end of the year.    Fujii remained cautious over the ministry's quarterly survey  released Thursday that showed signs that corporate earnings may  have bottomed out in the October-December period.    "Some figures turned upward but the overall figures remained  sluggish," he said.</p>

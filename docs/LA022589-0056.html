			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BUILDING BAN VOTED NEAR STADIUM SITE  </P> <P> The Irwindale City Council has put a moratorium on building permits in the area  south of Live Oak Avenue and west of the San Gabriel River Freeway where city  officials contemplate locating the proposed Los Angeles Raiders football  stadium.  </P> <P> City Manager Charles Martin said the moratorium, which is for 45 days but could  be extended after a public hearing, was needed to prevent anyone from trying to  drive up the value of several properties while their use is considered for the  stadium, and the council quickly adopted it unanimously at its Thursday night  meeting.  </P> <P> Martin also said he and other Irwindale representatives will meet with Raiders  team owner Al Davis in the coming week to seek his approval for making the Live  Oak site the preferred choice for the stadium instead of the gravel pit west of  the Irwindale Avenue exit on the north side of the Foothill Freeway.  </P></p>

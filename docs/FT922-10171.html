			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / International Company News: Asset write-down may hurt CSR CSR, the Australian sugar and building products group, is likely to report a substantial net loss for the year to March 31, following a ruling by the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) on the treatment of an ADollars 558m (USDollars 422.70m) asset write-down. The expected loss, due to be announced in June, follows a revaluation in February of CSR's plant and equipment, goodwill and trademarks, which CSR had intended to treat as an extraordinary loss. This would have allowed it to account for the write-down without reducing net profit for the year, which it had forecast would fall to less than ADollars 200m, compared with ADollars 355m. However, in a ruling published yesterday, the ASC said the write-down should be treated as an abnormal loss, which means it will have to be deducted from trading profits. The write-down was prompted by CSR's strict interpretation of a revised accounting standard, AASB 1010, which obliges directors to ensure that non-current assets are recorded in accounts at recoverable values. The revaluation surprised the Australian markets, and raised the possibility that other companies might be forced to take similar action to comply with the standard. However, the ASC's ruling follows widespread debate among accountants and regulators about CSR's interpretation of another accounting standard, AASB 1018, which deals with the treatment of extraordinary and abnormal losses. CSR said it had been advised that the write-down could be treated as an extraordinary loss, but acknowledged that the standard 'is capable of other interpretations, which may lead to a different accounting treatment'. The group said the ASC's ruling did not affect 'the fundamental nature of the revaluation,' which was unlikely to be repeated. Nor would it affect its ability to pay a dividend. CSR was given court approval recently to transfer ADollars 558m from its share premium reserve to the profit and loss account, to offset the impact of the write-down on retained profits.</p>

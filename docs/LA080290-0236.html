			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PHILIPPINE REBELS FREE PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEER;  </P> <P> PACIFIC: COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS RELEASE THE AMERICAN AND A JAPANESE CAPTIVE THEY  HAD ACCUSED OF SPYING.  </P> <P> Communist guerrillas freed a kidnaped U.S. Peace Corps volunteer and a Japanese  rural technician today after 50 and 65 days in captivity, respectively.  </P> <P> Timothy Swanson, 27, of Cheyenne, Wyo., was turned over to representatives of  the International Red Cross in his Patag village home in the mountainous  municipality of Silay on Negros Island, 300 miles south of Manila.  </P> <P> "I'm really glad to be out. I'm very tired; I'm going to pass out," Swanson  said during turnover ceremonies at a rebel campfire. He said the rebels were  "very good" to him.  </P> <P> Swanson was flown to Manila later in the day. He was expected to return shortly  to Cheyenne after a medical examination, U.S. officials said.  </P> <P> "I'll tell him it's about time he got home," his mother, Lynne Swanson, said on  hearing in Wyoming that her son had been released.  </P> <P> Her husband, Leonard, said, "I don't know exactly what we'll tell him when when  we see him, but for sure we will tell him we love him. We'll be so happy to see  him, out of danger and home."  </P> <P> Negros Gov. Daniel Lacson said Swanson's release was delayed because of the  rugged terrain and failure by the negotiators to locate the appointed place for  the release. But he said that before nightfall, the guerrillas came down from  the hills with Swanson to turn him over to civilian negotiators.  </P> <P> Earlier today, the guerrillas of the Communist New People's Army turned over  Fumio Mizuno, 36, to his Filipina wife and two children at a sugar plantation  on the outskirts of nearby Murcia.  </P> <P> Swanson and Mizuno, who appeared tired but otherwise in good shape, were  examined by representatives of the Red Cross and doctors before the rebels  released them.  </P> <P> Swanson was kidnaped June 13 from Silay. On June 27, Washington ordered the  suspension of the 29-year-old Peace Corps program in the Philippines and  recalled its 261 volunteers.  </P> <P> The suspension was prompted by reports the NPA planned to kill or kidnap the  volunteers in an escalation of its terrorist drive against Americans to press  demands for the withdrawal of U.S. forces.  </P> <P> Mizuno is training director of a Tokyo-based private aid group called  Organization for Industrial, Spiritual and Cultural Advancement.  </P></p>

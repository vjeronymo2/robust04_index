			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Poll suggests Lang may lose Galloway seat An opinion poll published last night suggests that Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, is set to lose his seat in Galloway and Upper Nithsdale, to the Scottish National party. He had a majority of about 3,500 in 1987, James Buxton writes. The poll, taken by System Three for Scottish Television and the Glasgow Herald, puts the SNP on 40 per cent, a rise of 8.5 points compared with the general election; the Conservatives on 33 per cent (down 7.4); Labour on 18 (up 6.1) and the Liberal Democrats on 9 (down 5.6). The poll in the rural constituency in southwest Scotland was taken between March 27 and 29, with a sample of 1,045 people.</p>

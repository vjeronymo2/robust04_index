			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 16 (AFP) -- The UN Protection Force  Saturday gave an ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs besieging the Moslem  enclave of Gorazde, threatening air strikes if they advance  further on the town, a spokesman said.    Major Rob Annink said UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi had  called for NATO air support earlier in the day, and said this  could be activated at any moment. "Do not shoot at the town, do  not advance," the text of the ultimatum read, according to  Annink.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1625 GMT on 20 May broadcast the regular "Details"  program presented by Sergey Dorenko, which was devoted to a  nine-minute video report by correspondent Vladislav  Flyarkovskiy. Before introducing this report, Dorenko briefly  commented on the Crimean crisis, saying:    "The Crimean Supreme Soviet today restored the peninsula's  Constitution, a highly autonomous Constitution, and everyone was  expecting a response from Kiev and possible clashes. But the  day passed off without clashes. We spoke to Crimean Prime  Minister Yevgeniy Saburov over the telephone and he, in contrast  to us, said that he was more interested in the problem of  Crimea's sewerage system, and that he did not share our fears  today."</p>

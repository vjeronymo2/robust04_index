			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TIS THE SEASON TO BE SANTA  </P> <P> If you couldn't make it as an Elvis impersonator and you're willing to put on a  little weight, there's still hope.  </P> <P> There are plenty of openings these days for Santa Claus in stores and shopping  malls. As any retailer worth his receivables has discovered, booking the man  with the rosy cheeks, twinkling eyes and furry red suit can boost sales by  bringing in hundreds of kid-toting shoppers.  </P> <P> At Nordstrom in South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Santa will attract "a couple  hundred" shoppers per day, said Greg Flotho, manager of the children's boutique  there. "When kids see him, they can drag Mom here to sit on Santa's lap, then  say, 'I like this tractor, Mom' or 'This is a neat doll,' " he said.  </P> <P> As a result, a booming business has emerged to supply sleigh loads of Santas to  malls, car dealers, restaurants, hotels and even banks during the holiday  season. And there is brisk competition for the most convincing Santas -- those  with the best pot bellies, silvery-white beards and hearty ho-ho-hos.  </P> <P> The jostling for likely candidates is no surprise considering that Santa can  mean the difference for merchants between a merry Christmas and an unhappy  holiday.  </P> <P> Besides helping boost sales for retailers, St. Nick is a source of revenue for  shopping malls, which can reap handsome fees by providing space for Santa, and  for suppliers -- typically photography firms or promotional agencies -- which  take in thousands of dollars from photo concessions.  </P> <P> Santa himself, however, most often earns blue-collar wages. In the Los Angeles  area, Kris Kringles typically make $5-$9 per hour for a seasonal gig and  $75-$150 per hour for parties, although in the most successful malls, a good  Santa can earn $18 an hour or more.  </P> <P> At least a dozen major agencies -- many of them national -- and scores of  smaller firms send Santas to Southland retailers. They include Western  Temporary Services of Walnut Creek; Ciresi &amp; Associates of Newberry, Ohio;  Chris Cringle Special Events of San Pedro; Dixie Doodle Entertainment of  Orange; Cherry Hill Photos from New Jersey, and Santa Plus of St. Charles, Mo.  </P> <P> Most of the suppliers provide a professional photographer with Santa, who snaps  shots of the kids with St. Nick at about $6 a clip. Some even offer videotapes  of the brief sessions with Kris Kringle, for about $20 apiece.  </P> <P> The Santa suppliers typically can gross $35,000-$40,000 at an average-sized  regional mall for the season from photo sales and sales of novelty items, such  as reindeer antlers and Christmas coloring books.  </P> <P> The potential revenue has caused competition in the Santa industry to climb  about 200% in 20 years, estimated Jenny Zink, national marketing director with  Western Temp, which began its Santa division in 1968 and now places about 3,300  St. Nicks each year.  </P> <P> Collectively, the agencies and photo studios each year suit up and ship out as  many as 20,000 Kris Kringles to malls, parades and parties throughout the  nation, retail officials estimate.  </P> <P> And of the money taken in from photo sales, 25% to 40% will go back to the  malls as a commission. It's not unusual for a regional center each Christmas  season to collect $10,000 to $25,000 -- depending on the mall's size -- from  photo sales, officials said.  </P> <P> Without the photo sales, malls and other retailers shell out anywhere from  $1,500-$5,000 for the season, or up to $150 per hour, to have a Santa or two  greeting customers.  </P> <P> The yearly demand for Santa's throne depends on how retailers size up the  holiday shopping season. With Christmas sales this year off to a slow start,  the Santa business has been brisk, retail officials said. Half a dozen firms  estimated that requests for St. Nick this year are running 15% to 20% ahead of  1988.  </P> <P> Retailers look to Santa to put shoppers in a jovial, carefree mood -- all the  better for opening their wallets. Moreover, his mere presence draws shoppers  into toy departments.  </P> <P> Santa's drawing power is especially helpful on slow weekdays, when busy parents  are less likely to shop. Zink estimates that mall traffic jumps 10% to 15% when  Santa is in a major store.  </P> <P> But a good Santa is not always easy to find. The supplier's search for St. Nick  often begins as early as September. But "it's always very difficult to get  Santas," said one Santa supplier who asked not to be named. "We're out there  busting our butts on this."  </P> <P> To find him, companies scour senior citizen bulletin boards, Daily Variety for  out-of-work actors and lists of last year's recruits. And the quest for  potential prospects doesn't stop there.  </P> <P> "If I see (a Santa look-alike) at a bus stop, I'll pull over" and ask him, said  Cathy Perks, a manager for Western Temporary Services in Tustin.  </P> <P> In fact, one elderly man told Perks that she was the sixth person to approach  him in five weeks. "He said he was going to shave off his beard because he  couldn't take it anymore. He was out here for a mellow vacation and everyone  was attacking him," she said.  </P> <P> Sometimes the search reaches right into the shopping mall, when customers with  whiskers -- or who just look jolly -- are cajoled in a pinch to fill Santa's  boots for even a day.  </P> <P> "The show must go on," explains Bill Salerno, sales director with Ciresi &amp;  Associates, which supplies Santas to about 300 malls across the United States.  </P></p>

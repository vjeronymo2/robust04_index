			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 26 Feb (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the Srpska republic [RS], this evening warned the  UN Secretary General's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, that  Muslim forces are abusing the Sarajevo cease-fire in order to  gain a military advantage.    In a letter to Akashi, a copy of which has been sent to  TANJUG, Karadzic points out that since the first day of the  cease-fire Muslim forces have been moving their trench lines  towards Serb positions.    "These engineering works have been going on constantly,  right  up to today," Karadzic alleges, assessing that this is "an  attempt to improve their military position under cover of the  cease-fire."    The RS president points out that these Muslim cease-fire  violations are being carried out in many places -- in Mojmilo  (three or four places), in the Jewish cemetery, in the  Dobrinja-Vojkovici area (two places), Rajlovac (three places),  on Zuc (two places), in Brijesce and in the Butmir-Ilidza area.    "We strongly protest against these Muslim military  activities, which are a clear and flagrant violation of the  Serb-Muslim agreement reached on 9 February," Karadzic writes,  assessing that "this cease-fire which was realized with such  difficulty is now under serious threat."    "Furthermore, the whole peace process is now in danger.  Unless the newly dug Muslim trenches are abandoned and  destroyed, the already begun measures to build confidence will  suffer huge damage," Karadzic assesses, adding that "if  something is not done quickly," the Serb side will not be able  to continue its cooperation in the efforts to achieve peace in  the Sarajevo region.</p>

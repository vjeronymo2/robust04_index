			<p>BFN     [Text] The Centrist Bloc of Political Parties and Movements  headed by Vladimir Voronin has made a statement against signing  the Agreement on Civil Accord.    In the statement published Tuesday, the bloc pointed out  that  the president and those close to him needed civil accord for the  sole purpose of "doing away with any possibility for society to  criticize the official line and therefore allow those who have  been granted access to power in any way, but demonstrated their  complete incapacity for managing a great country, to remain in  power for at least another couple of years, maybe more."    The bloc believes civil accord could be achieved through  early presidential elections and forming a new government.    The bloc called on all political parties and movements,  "healthy forces" in all branches of power and the people to  support early presidential elections and other related social  and state reforms.    On the same day, the bloc proposed the Patriarch of Moscow  and All Russia Aleksiy II call on the people to refrain from any  political activities on Easter day, May 1.</p>

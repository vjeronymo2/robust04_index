			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Trencherwood seeks borrowing change Trencherwood, the USM-quoted housebuilder which is in refinancing talks with its bankers, yesterday warned that the results for the year to end-October would reveal a level of adjusted share capital and reserves substantially worse than that reflected in the 1990 accounts. The reduction is a result of write-downs arising from a revaluation of the group's properties and developments, which are still subject to audit. Under the terms of the company's articles of association, the permitted level of group borrowings is restricted to a multiple of four times the adjusted capital and reserves. The company is seeking shareholder sanction, in advance of the audit, to relax this borrowing limit to permit borrowings up to the limit of Pounds 86.85m, at which they currently stand.</p>

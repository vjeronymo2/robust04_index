			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Residential Property: A tale of two chateaux TWO CHATEAUX among the many now on the market serve to illustrate the contrast in styles of such properties between the north and south of France. Representing the north is Chateau Saint Josse, built in 1840 in a village five miles from Le Touquet, on the Channel coast. It is a white, sharp-angled building with steeply-pitched grey-tiled roof and an even steeper pitch to the tower at its side. It has dormer windows and pale blue shutters and front door. It comprises 16 rooms on three floors. Some 6,000 sq ft of stables and outbuildings come with the property and nine areas of walled gardens. Representing the south is the listed Chateau d'Allemagne, in Provence. Originally a defensive fort in the 12th and 13th centuries, it was later enlarged and converted into a home. Stone buildings, one castellated, surround a courtyard. There is elaborate carving over the top floor windows. This chateau has six bedrooms and numerous reception rooms on its five floors. Now 'fortified' by five circular towers, it looks as romantic as the other looks businesslike. Both have British owners, and both properties are on the UK market at similar prices. For Chateau Saint Josse pounds 950,000 is sought (tel: 0638-712799); Chateau d'Allemagne is about pounds 1m (through Hamptons 071-493-8222).</p>

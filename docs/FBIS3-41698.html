			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marina Skazkina under the ``Problem'' rubric: </F> Diptheria -- New Disease Unfamiliar to Our Science'']    [Text] The mass media has already reported several cases of  the diseases cholera and malaria in Moscow. Judging by the  number of telephone calls to our editorial office, the report  has caused panic among a portion of Muscovites. As Anatoliy  Solovyev, head of the Main Medical Administration, announced in  a conversation with SEVOGDNYA correspondent, however, the  statistics on the diseases cholera (4 cases last year and 2 this  year) and malaria (33 persons, 24 of them foreigners, have  contracted it this year) do not give any basis for worry. In A.  Solovyev's words, physicians are alarmed at the increase in  adults and children of another highly infectious disease whose  initial symptoms are so similar to common angina and diptheria.    At the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s, more  than  20,000 persons died in Moscow each year from diptheria. Under  these conditions, the only correct solution was made -- mass  mandatory vaccination of the population. By the mid-1960s, the  disease's growth curve had fallen sharply, and prior to 1989 the  cases of diptheria in Moscow numbered in the single digits.    It was precisely then that physicians began saying that  diptheria was finally conquered, and some even expressed doubt  as to the feasibility of antidiptheria vaccination. Some  physicians suggested that the mercury-containing preparation  Merthiolate, which is used as a preservative for preparing the  vaccine, is detrimental to health even though the World Health  Organization has officially authorized the use of this  preparation.    On the one hand, an entire generation of physicians has  grown  up who have studied diptheria's symptoms based on institute  textbooks, and on the other hand, most of the population has  simply refused antidiptheria vaccinations. According to  specialists' data, about 50 percent of Moscow's permanent  residents are not currently vaccinated against diptheria.    The result has not been slow in coming: according to data  from Moscow's Main Medical Administration, 774 persons (197 of  them children) have had a confirmed diagnosis of diptheria in  1992. During treatment, 17 adults and 6 children died. In the  first 7 months of this year, 932 cases of the disease have been  recorded, and 188 of those cases have been among children.  Ninety-five adults and three children have died. It should be  noted that not one of those who died had been vaccinated against  diptheria. Specialists estimated that the per capita vaccination  of Muscovites for 10 years will cost city authorities 56 billion  rubles. Its costs about 4,000-500,000 rubles to keep such a  patient in a clinic for 1 day, and diptheria patients often stay  in hospitals for 90 and 120 days each.    ``Until recently, the serum for treating diptheria was  supplied by the Stavropolsk Biopreparations Plant,'' says  Anatoliy Solovyev. ``Since 1 July of this year, supplies have  been halted and we have been forced to buy drugs from abroad,  which is of course more (about 30 percent) expensive.''    According to physicians' data, Moscow hospitals now only  have  enough serum to last until the end of the year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara--President Demirel invited leading banking  officials to a dinner at the Presidential Palace last night and  asked them "not to panic, but help the government." Before  dinner, Demirel made a statement to the directors and chairmen  of the executive committees of the public and private banks. He  recalled the argument that the invitation was linked with the  monetary crisis last week and said: "An effort has been made to  create the impression that I invited you because of the monetary  crisis. But I invited you before the crisis began."  <H5>  I Am Hinting </H5>   Demirel created interest by emphasizing the importance of  macro analyses, as former President Turgut Ozal did in the past.  Stressing that his views should create no "anxiety," but should  be taken as a "hint," Demirel asserted: "Everyone must fulfill  his obligations without anxiety. No one must panic. Monetary  issues are very sensitive. You may ask me: `How can we not  panic?' I reiterate that you should not panic. You should not  be carried away by anxiety. I wish you success, because you  will be confronted with many problems. I expect you to show  understanding toward the country's problem and help the  government solve them."  <H5>  On the Country's Agenda </H5>   Stressing that issues relating to the effort to control  inflation, establish a balance in public financing, reduce the  need for borrowing, and resolve the issues of parity, interest,  and prices are on the country's agenda, Demirel asserted: "I  have not said that they are on the political administration's  agenda. They are on the country's agenda. They will remain on  the country's agenda, regardless of the administration that is  in power. Turkey must not ignore the measures that can prevent  instability from being created in the country."    Demirel stressed that a liberal democracy and a liberal  economy cannot be separated. He also said that achieving the  two together will be difficult. He noted: "Turkey has problems  in both cases. But what is important is how determined we are to  surmount the problems. Turkey is determined to solve its  problems. It will solve all its problems."  <H5>  I Reiterate My Call </H5>   Journalists were not allowed into the dining hall. Demirel's  statement during the dinner created interest: "I am an  impartial president. I do not wish to interfere in the  executive organ's work. But I will intervene to express my  opinion on issues that concern the country, issues that must be  resolved. I don't want to do so now. But that does not mean I  will not summon you to discuss issues relating to the economy  and banking procedure in future. I will invite you in smaller  groups, that is, if necessary."</p>

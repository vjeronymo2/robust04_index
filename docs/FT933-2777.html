			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Romania hopeful onties with Hungary THE Romanian foreign minister, Mr Teodor Melescanu, yesterday said he believed differences with Hungary over a bilateral treaty could now be solved and that 'real progress' had been made in talks with Mr Geza Jeszenszky, his Hungarian counterpart. Earlier Mr Jeszenszky, the first senior member of the Hungarian government to make an official visit to Romania since 1990, said that, while he was hopeful relations would improve, many bilateral problems remained. He said treatment of the Hungarian minority in Romania was the most sensitive point. Romania is home to 1.7m ethnic Hungarians, the majority of whom live in the western province of Transylvania, which was ruled by Hungary until 1918. Mr Jeszenszky said the two countries should put their differences behind them. He said Romania's ethnic Hungarians had enriched the country and that their aspirations were in no way dangerous to the national majority. Romanian nationalist parties, who hold 13 per cent of seats in parliament, have repeatedly accused the Hungarian minority of seeking the return of Transylvania to Hungary. Mr Jeszenszky said it was difficult to understand why there was opposition to the reopening of a Hungarian consulate in the Transylvanian town of Cluj.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Bullion rise lifts gold issues A late rise in the bullion price to Dollars 380 an ounce encouraged gold and related shares, and the sector index saw the day's best performance, climbing 29, or 1.4 per cent, to 2,181. The overall index shed 11 to 5,813 and industrials gained 5 at 6,610. De Beers fell throughout the session after the previous day's advance, shedding R3.75 to R109.50. Anglos rose 50 cents to R257.50 and Minorco receded 75 cents to R111.75. Randgold finished 25 cents off at R8.50 after a session's low of R8, in reaction to shareholder approval of a management takeover. In golds, Freegold moved forward R1.50 to R68, Loraine added 50 cents at R20 and Joel gained 15 cents at R6.80. Elsewhere, Sasol hardened 50 cents to R31.25.</p>

The conference called on all  nations to enact municipal legislation against laundering. A  year later, the Nigerian authorities promulgated Decree No.48 of  1989 which provides a jail term of not less than 25 years as  punishment for anyone convicted of laundering money earned from  illegal drug trafficking. The law also stipulates a fine of 2  million naira for a corporate body found guilty of laundering.  This was roughly five years ago. But since then no single  person has been prosecuted under the decree. The impression  which one will get from this is that money laundering has not  been going on in Nigeria. But this is most probably a wrong  impression. Not many Nigerians are unaware of the establishment  of large-scale ventures by proprietors whose sources of income  are questionable. But problem really is that most Nigerians do  not bother to ask pertinent questions about sources of income.  And this is why the society tends to accommodate all sorts of  characters who use money from whatever source to procure  respectability. With law, however, it should be a different  matter altogether. The law enforcement agencies should be  encouraged or even compelled to trace the sources of sudden  wealth by individuals or groups. The aim in this particular  consideration is to prevent or stamp out money laundering which  constitutes a serious danger to the economy.    There are several ways of laundering drug money. The most  prominent is through bank transactions. The proceeds with drug  business are lodged in a bank, particularly in a country where  the transactions were carried out or in a neighboring state.  The money is lodged by using fictitious business names. In  most cases, the banks are interested in the economic gains which  may accrue from such huge lodgement. Besides, the banks  emphasize the need for confidentiality between them and their  customers. The launderer then repatriates the money, sometimes  through inter-bank transactions or through what looks like a  legitimate business venture. That explains why such businesses  as boutiques, supermarkets of expensive tastes, and motor  companies parading luxury and state of the art vehicles spring  up in parts of the country. Some of the drug traffickers import  goods with the proceeds and these are brought into the country  through the sea port. At the port, there is a syndicate which  cuts across all departments which make sure that there is no  hitch in clearing the goods and other transactions.    As for the economy as a whole, it is believed that the black  or autonomous market, through which the naira is traded at very  low rate in relations with other currencies, responded largely  with proceeds from drug trafficking. Besides, the drug  traffickers, through their expensive tastes, have infested the  society with strange orientations. In a situation where money  can be got through easily or repatriated with little effort, not  many people would like to depend on hard work to earn their  livelihood. They would rather join the company of drug peddlers  to make the easy money. This is a terrible danger to the  society. As the need to check the adverse effect of laundering  on the nation and its economy becomes imperative, it may be  necessary to review the relevant legislations to make it  possible for security agents to investigate bank accounts  without hindrance. The banks themselves should be compelled to  inquire into the sources of huge lodgements and alert the  appropriate authorities. In this way, the country would be put  in a better position to protect its economy from the effects of  money laundering.</p>

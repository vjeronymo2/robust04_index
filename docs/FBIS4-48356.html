			<p>BFN     [Text] The Electoral Commission's committee on violence has  announced that it has investigated 50 cases involving breaches  of electoral law. In the announcement in Lilongwe, the  committee said 22 of the cases were reported to police for  prosecution. It said the police, on their own, also prosecuted  cases of a similar nature. The announcement said the cases  involved, among other things, the disruption of campaign  meetings, assault, intimidation, incitement, and use of abusive  and inflammatory language. The committee said two offenders  have already paid fines, one was still at large, and another one  was fined and could have served a three-month prison term. The  announcement said the rest of the cases are either in court or  investigations are still under way. The electoral commission  has since engaged private lawyers who are following some of the  cases involving violence and intimidation and vote registration  irregularities.</p>

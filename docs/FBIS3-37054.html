Everything in it  is distorted! This is a provocation!" the art critic Irina  Sergeyevna Kulikova, who prepared Zhirinovskiy's text for  publication, told IZVESTIYA.    This strange and unexpected statement by one of the most  loyal supporters of the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia [LDPR] seems absurd. In the four months since its  publication the book has caused Zhirinovskiy and his comrades in  arms nothing but delight. There is only one explanation for  this contradiction -- the criminal investigation which the  Russian General Prosecutor's Office started against Zhirinovskiy  a few days ago. He may be charged under Article 71 of the Penal  Code concerning war propaganda contained in the pages of "The  Last Dash to the South." The real prospect of spending at least  three years behind barbed wire is forcing Zhirinovskiy to look  for a way out of the dangerous situation he has found himself  in. It seems that it is specifically for this purpose that what  at first appears to be a senseless scandal is now being hatched.    Ms. Kulikova claims that the book's "sponsors" have  perpetrated a forgery. Her arguments sound pretty strange and  even illogical, however. "You can see places in the book which  have been purposely printed in boldface so as to attract the  attention of corrupt journalists, like you IZVESTIYA  journalists," Ms. Kulikova said. Struck by the typeface, I asked  her about these evil sponsors. "I am not going to give you  their names, but, believe me, they are to blame for everything!"  came the answer.    Apart from the "boldface" in certain places, Ms. Kulikova  drew attention to two other terrible circumstances.  "Zhirinovskiy's real text contains bits of his speeches, and we  removed all the repetitions. But in the pirated book, the text  looks as though Vladimir Volfovich keeps saying the same thing,  over and over!"    Irina Sergeyevna's bitter observation is entirely just, but  only from the viewpoint of an art critic. Maybe she does not  know that deliberate repetitions in the structure of a speech  were considered to be the most successful propagandist device,  even among orators in ancient Greece. After all, the crowd does  not hear, it feels. In order for the sense of what has been said  to be brought home, the same thing has to be drummed into it  several times.    Carried away by the conversation, Ms. Kulikova said that she  personally placed the floppy containing the text of the book in  the "sponsors'" hands. This text was simply dictated by  Zhirinovskiy. On Kulikova's own admission, she is not so much  his editor as a proofreader, and she never changes the sense of  what has been said. From the day of publication and up until  the end of January, when the investigators from the General  Prosecutor's Office finally got down to reading the book, it did  not enter anyone's head that this was a forgery. Even  Zhirinovskiy's head. Aside from that, there are more rational  proofs of identity.    The secret "sponsors" are in fact indicated at the end of  Zhirinovskiy's book -- the "Pisatel" Limited Partnership and the  "Bukvitsa" Publishing Cooperative. It was they who put in an  order at Moscow Printing Works No. 13 to publish the book.    As Yuliya Mikhaylovna Lobacheva, chief of the production  department of this printing works, assures us, the clients'  license was perfectly in order. Admittedly, of the 75,000  copies of Last Dash to the South ordered, the  printing works only printed 35,000.    "You see, we do not take orders without prepayment, and  they only paid for half of the print run. We printed 34,000 in  the normal cover, and another 1,000 in a prepublication cover,  just as they asked. Aside from that, I do not understand how  this book can be `pirated' if Zhirinovskiy waves it around at  every news conference he holds," Ms. Lobacheva said.    These 1,000 copies -- in the prepublication version -- were  sold to deputies in the State Duma. From this you can conclude  that Zhirinovskiy is unbelievably prudent in matters of  propaganda. But the interference of the General Prosecutor's  Office upset some of his plans. The sale of the book within the  walls of the State Duma, organized by the LDPR leader, in no way  squares with the idea of a "pirated" publication. In any case,  Zhirinovskiy in no way looks like a victim here. But Ms.  Kulikova is so keen on the piracy theme that she has completely  rejected the fact of the sale of the book in the State Duma.    "Don't believe it, it's lies!" the art critic exclaimed.  "There is no such book as Last Dash to the South and  there never has been. This is only the second part of  Zhirinovskiy's trilogy On the Fate of Russia ripped  out of context! That book will be on sale soon."    Let us sum up. So, no one has changed the essence of the  published text but, admittedly, objections have been made about  the typeface. This is evidently not enough to confuse the  investigators from the General Prosecutor's Office.  Particularly since the title page of Last Dash to the  South bears the "V.V. Zhirinovskiy" copyright symbol.  Maybe this is a completely different "V.V."? It does not seem  possible to ask Zhirinovskiy himself about this. Irina  Sergeyevna reported with great satisfaction that he is demanding  $100 per minute for interviews. At rates like that you could  never save up enough money to get to see the LDPR leader.  Incidentally, this constitutes illegal operations with foreign  currency. Article 88 of the Russian Federation Penal Code goes  as far as execution by firing squad. After you have paid your  taxes, of course.    But long before my conversation with Ms. Kulikova I had the  good fortune to meet with Mr. Vengerovskiy, chief of the LDPR's  intelligence unit. In his boss's office he handed me a copy of  Last Dash to the South with the words: "Here you  will find the answers to all questions!" The cunning nature of  the journalist and the feeling of simple human vanity did the  intelligence agent a bad turn, and he gladly left a dedication  and his autograph on the sleeve.    Irina Sergeyevna's reaction to the story about my meeting  with Vengerovskiy and his autograph suggests to me that the  General Prosecutor's Office will not find it easy going. She  immediately changed her stance and started to defend the pirated  book, stating that there is no war propaganda in it and that no  one intends to attack Turkey or Iran.    "Vladimir Volfovich has always been opposed to weapons. He  is simply proposing to station Russian military settlements in a  corridor leading to the Indian Ocean. You would have to know  history. The Cossacks have always defended the Russian state's  borders," Ms. Kulikova stated.    The fact that Turkey and Iran, as well as Georgia,  Azerbaijan, and Armenia, which have inadvertently found  themselves in that "corridor," do not consider themselves to be  part of Russia was not taken into consideration by Irina  Sergeyevna. What would happen in that "corridor" is obvious to  an idiot.    Quests for "pirates" and "sponsors" are not preventing Irina  Sergeyevna from now being involved in gathering orders for the  translation and publication of the book abroad.    "We have had such offers from Britain, Japan, and the United  States. But we will choose the ones which are most profitable  for us. Those who pay the most will get the publishing rights.  Admittedly, I do not remember how many offers we have had and  which publishing houses they came from, but we have had offers.  One of Russia's representatives at the United Nations is  conducting talks on our behalf with American publishers. It  doesn't matter what his name is!" Ms. Kulikova stressed.    The latest publication offer came from Paris recently. A  small French publishing house, F2F, has decided to publish the  book Last Dash to the South. The publishing house  department which is fortuitously called "Material Evidence" is  already prepared to get down to the translation.    When Rene Bousquet, an old French collaborationist, was  shot in Paris, F2F found and published his anti-Semitic  resolutions drawn up under the Vichy regime, during World War  II. This publishing house recently published the last issue of  PRAVDA when it was banned by Yeltsin during the October events  in Moscow.    Incidentally, something about the expected royalties and the  right to publish. If Ms. Kulikova is telling the truth and  Zhirinovskiy himself confirms the "piracy" of the book "Last  Dash for the South Seas," then the French will be able to  publish it without paying the LDPR leader a centime.</p>

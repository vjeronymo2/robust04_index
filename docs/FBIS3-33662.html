Your Excellency, the chairman [of the Higher  State Council]; members of the Higher State Council; ladies and  gentlemen: It is my duty at this historic moment solemnly to  salute the souls of all our righteous sons who paid for the  freedom and independence of Algeria and the unity and  sovereignty of our nation with their lives.    I stand before you at a time when the homeland is going  through a decisive turning point which makes it the duty of  every Algerian citizen, male or female, to shoulder his  responsibility and devote all of his forces in order to preserve  the supreme interest of the homeland and secure the continuity  of the Algerian state and the independence of its decision in  faithfulness to the principles of the 1 November Revolution.    Not long ago my brothers called on me, from the highest  authority in the country, to assume the post of minister of  national defense. I responded to the call of duty out of my  feelings about the seriousness of the situation and put all of  my energy into the service of the military establishment, not  striving for posts and protocol, but out of my belief that the  homeland is above all other considerations, just as the National  People's Army supported and backed--and is still supporting and  backing--all efforts to take the country out of its multi-sided  crisis by way of serious dialogue. Therefore, I supported my  brothers' efforts to make the national conference successful in  order to obtain a national consensus within the framework of the  document for organizing the transitional phase in accordance  with the spirit of the constitution. This is so that it will be  a true expression of the tendencies of various sections of  society, in order to guarantee a wide popular mobilization, and  in order to end the scattering of the nation and to recruit all  the sons of the Algerian people, regardless of their political  affiliations, for the sake of building a new national order in  which the people are allowed to express their choices with total  freedom and on correct bases remote from any pressure or  falsification, without infringing the homeland's supreme  interest and the stability of the state and its establishments.    Mr. Chairman, members of the Higher State Council,  gentlemen,  ladies: My appointment as head of state by the Higher Security  Council comes after all means have been exhausted [to solve the  crisis] and in response to the requests from large sections of  our society who want security, stability, and tranquility. I  placed myself at the service of the supreme interests of the  homeland and the nation, with all modesty and sincerity, after I  saw the deep fragmentation occurring on the political scene, in  order to unite the sons of Algeria. I have never aspired at any  time to acquire this lofty task and heavy responsibility.    Mr. Chairman, members of the Higher State Council: Thanks to  your sincere spirit of responsibility and nationalism, you have  been able to manage the affairs of the country; you have been  eager to follow the constitution and preserve the state  institutions. You have created the atmosphere for dialogue and  consultation that enabled us to entrench the principle of  rotation in power. By doing this you have provided the proof of  your sincerity and your zeal in the service of the state and the  homeland within the framework of the principles of the November  revolution, and you have fulfilled the pledge you made in the 14  January 1992 declaration.    The coming generations will remember and history will record  this exemplary stand. In my turn I offer you my thanks for what  you have done for the people and the homeland. May God render  us successful and guide our steps. Peace and blessings of God  be upon you. [applause]</p>

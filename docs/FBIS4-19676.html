			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Stavros Liyeros: "The Most Appropriate </F> Moment"]    [Text] In a few days Greek Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou will visit the United States and discuss the Skopje  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue. This  may be the most appropriate time for Greek diplomacy to show its  flexibility by opening up the road to an overall agreement that  will definitively settle the problem.    The tactic of negotiating in phases is now counterproductive  and disadvantageous for our country. Prime Minister Papandreou  should dare to get involved in the substantive negotiations over  their name, even if it is not assured that such negotiations  will end in the complete abolition of the term "Macedonia." It  is obvious that if he avoids this, it will result in the "de  facto" acceptance of the complete international acceptance of  the current name "Republic of Macedonia." Even if this is not a  crime of omission, it would still be a crime.    Before the embargo, imposing preliminary conditions was  meaningful. Now that the embargo was been imposed though, the  balance has drastically changed in Athens' favor. As long as  the embargo is being strictly implemented, Greece will have  every interest in having a dialogue on the name, for it can aim  for a package agreement. First of all, Greece will make the  best impression because it will appear to be compromising and  pliable regarding the process, without even having to make a  compromise. In the international arena, anyone who makes  conditions for beginning talks is fighting the battle of  impressions from a disadvantageous position.    If Athens accepts the resumption of a dialogue, the dilemma  will be Skopje's. It will either refuse and thus be the target  of pressure, or it will begin talks under the disadvantage of  the embargo. The embargo will put pressure on them, not only on  the secondary issues such as the flag and constitution, but also  on the main issue of the name. What is indispensable to the  nation is to search for a name that will reflect reality and not  affect either side. One such solution could be the name  Slavomadeconian for the nationality, and Slavomacedonia for the  country. It is the only way to achieve the famous  "de-Skopjenization" acceptably, with no one coming out the loser.</p>

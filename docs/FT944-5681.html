			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / People: Gavin Laird joins EIT The 105-year-old Edinburgh Investment Trust has made a bit of history by becoming the first big investment trust to put a trade unionist on its board of directors. Gavin Laird, 61, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, will pick up around Pounds 7,500 for attending six board meetings a year of Scotland's biggest investment trust. The Earl of Eglinton and Winton, EIT's old Etonian chairman, says that Laird will provide 'an additional perspective on developing trends within the UK economy'. Earlier this year Laird was involved in a controversy when the government refused to extend his appointment as a director of the Bank of England. He had been appointed to the Bank's governing body in 1986 by Lady Thatcher, the prime minister of the day. Although Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, had pressed for his re-appointment, the government decided against giving him a third term - thus breaking the tradition of having a trade unionist on the Bank's board. However, Laird's appointment to the board of EIT suggests that in Scotland, at least, he is now regarded as an establishment figure. He is already on the boards of Scottish Television, GEC Scotland and Britannia Life and Laird now joins a board which until recently boasted one Earl, a Lord, a couple of knights, and four commoners.</p>

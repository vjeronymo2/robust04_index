			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jorge Valentim, UNITA spokesman, by Walter </F> Medeiros in Lusaka on 2 February]    [Text] Angola faces the challenge of the peace talks.  Interviewed earlier today by Walter Medeiros, Jorge Valentim  guaranteed that UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola] does not want the talks to break down and replied to  Luanda's charges by saying that the party of the black cockerel  wants neither Balkanization nor federalism for Angola.    [Begin recording] [Valentim] I have a degree in political  science from Brussels University, and I know what Balkanization  means. This is not the Europe of 1914, with all those fledgling  republics. No one wants to set up republics in the interior of  Angola. What fighting there is is the consequence of the  massacre of October/November 1992. What we want to achieve  here, what we, the UNITA delegates [to the Lusaka talks], are  openly advocating here in the negotiations with the government  delegation--and there is noticeable political goodwill between  the two sides at delegation level--we can say that we advocate a  unitarian, but decentralized state. And political and  administrative decentralization is not incompatible with, nor  antithetical to, the concept of a unitarian state. This is  scientific, textbook stuff, and its application is universal.    [Medeiros] The agenda item that will be discussed in the  next  few days is national reconciliation in Angola. As is known,  this will entail power-sharing at government level. What  ministries would UNITA like to have in a national unity  government?    [Valentim] Regarding the question of UNITA's participation  in  the government, I would rather it was not defined in the general  terms of power sharing versus no power sharing. UNITA wants to  participate very substantially at all levels of the central  administration. Now it is up to the two sides to find a modus  vivendi for this participation. But to start calling it power  sharing could cause a bit of a headache, because power sharing  is defined in a certain way in the teaching of political  sciences, but the public define it differently. So we would  rather see our aims interpreted in a more legitimate way: We are  ready to participate in the central government in a significant  manner, not along the lines of the [government] theses of 1992.    [Medeiros] When you speak of a significant manner, what do  you mean in concrete terms?    [Valentim] I mean participating by taking on public and  important responsibilities such as may inculcate feelings of  security and confidence that the process of national  reconciliation has indeed begun and that a bright future lies  before all Angolans alike.    [Medeiros] Does that mean UNITA wants the Defense or  Interior  Ministries? Does it mean the Economy, Finance, or Petroleum  Ministries? Does it mean the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?    [Valentim] All I would like to say is that the government  knows us well, and we know the government. The party in power,  the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola], has  its history. We have ours, too. And we know each other's  histories.    [Medeiros] What if the government offers UNITA the  Ministries  of Education, Health, Social Rehabilitation, and Culture? Will  UNITA accept these portfolios?    [Valentim] We are....[pauses] We are not in the realm of  hypothesis. That is not what the government is saying. We  would rather wait. We are in direct communication with the  government. Today we had a very fruitful meeting of over two  hours, but we did not talk in those terms. We discussed  political and administrative decentralization. We discussed  security for all Angolans, the leaders and the led alike. We  talked about UNITA's participation in the central government.  We talked about the status of the president of UNITA. We  talked about reciprocal pardons or amnesties. We talked about  lots of things.    [Medeiros] What status is UNITA claiming for Dr. Savimbi?    [Valentim] Well, we have already defined it. It is the  status he merits as a historic figure and leader of the largest  opposition party. There are certain prerogatives and privileges  that we wish accorded to him so that he may in fact fully  exercise his role in society for the good of national  reconciliation.    [Medeiros] Does that include his personal security? And what  post would he have?    [Valentim] No, no, no. We are still only at the stage of  security matters. The question of his post will be a basis for  negotiation with the government and we believe that, for the  moment, [if we settle for] the status of UNITA president, with  full security and respect for his person, I believe we shall  have taken a good step forward.    [Medeiros] So an announcement that the talks have broken  down  is out of the question.    [Valentim] Well, there has never been a question here of  announcing that the talks have broken down.    [Medeiros] I do not mean over there [in Lusaka], I mean in  Huambo.    [Valentim] In Huambo, UNITA criticized a bellicose trend  emerging on the government's side. That was UNITA's position.  UNITA did not say it wanted a breakdown. All it did was note  the discrepancy between the negotiating steps being taken here  and the recrudescence of the fighting in the interior. [end  recording]    UNITA pledges that Angola is one and indivisible. Jorge  Valentim was being interviewed by Walter Medeiros.</p>

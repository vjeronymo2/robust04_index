			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Director sentenced to five years A company director was yesterday sentenced to five years in prison for his part in a Pounds 2.1m tax fraud through 'phoenix' companies, in what is believed to be the most severe custodial penalty yet imposed for contrived liquidations. The prosecution follows recent calls by the Confederation of British Industry for a reform of insolvency legislation to prevent 'reckless' directors from leaving behind a 'trail of debt' while continuing to trade in phoenix companies - businesses which fold only to rise again, often under a slightly different name in the hands of the same directors and management.

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT MUSEUM IN COURT OVER NEA OATH  </P> <P> Attorneys for the Newport Harbor Art Museum and the Bella Lewitzky Dance  Foundation asked a federal judge Monday to declare unconstitutional the  National Endowment for the Arts' anti-obscenity oath.  </P> <P> The attorneys argued that the controversial NEA provision, which required arts  groups applying for 1990 grants to certify the content of art or dance works  when applying for federal grants, places a "potential chill" upon free speech.  </P> <P> Additionally, the vagueness of the anti-obscenity stipulation -- its lack of  clear-cut standards and procedural safeguards -- violate the arts groups' right  to due process of law, the attorneys argued.  </P> <P> At stake is not only the anti-obscenity provision, which has been dropped for  1991 grantees, but also two grants totaling $172,000 to the Newport museum and  the dance company that were awarded but not distributed to the groups because  they refused to sign the provision.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge John G. Davies declined to make an immediate decision about  granting a summary judgment in the case.  </P> <P> James V. Selna, a Newport Harbor trustee and an attorney with O'Melveny &amp;  Myers, which is representing the museum, said he expects a ruling in a week or  10 days.  </P> <P> Last year, in response to protests over federal support for a few controversial  art exhibits, new legislation required 1990 recipients of NEA grants to sign an  agreement that they produce or exhibit no "obscene" work. No grant money is  being released to recipients unless they sign.  </P> <P> Newport Harbor was to receive a total of $100,000 for three separate grants,  and the Lewitzky Foundation was awarded a $72,000 grant. NEA funding represents  slightly more than 5% of the museum's $1.8-million operating budget this year  and about 8.5% of the dance company's budget of about $850,000.  </P> <P> In September, Newport Harbor became the third arts organization -- and first  museum -- in the country to file a lawsuit seeking a court order barring the  obscenity certification. The Lewitzky Foundation filed a similar brief in July.  On Oct. 23, the court denied an NEA motion to dismiss the lawsuits.  </P> <P> On Nov. 19, the museum submitted a request for funds for three of the  exhibitions covered by the grants, but with a paragraph stating its  noncompliance with the obscenity certification.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with diplomat Omar Morales, chief of </F> Latin American multilateral and global matters of the Cuban  Foreign Relations Ministry, in Mexico City, by Reporter Bianca  Govin; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Govin] Mr. Omar Morales is currently in Mexico as a  member of the Cuban delegation to the Latin American Economic  System [SELA] conference. Mr. Morales, although this event ends  on Friday, could you tell us what issues were addressed.    [Morales] Let me tell you that the 20th Conference of the  SELA is important, not only because it is the 20th of its kind,  but also because there have been important parallel events. One  such event was an important seminar. Many Latin American  figures participated, including the five permanent secretaries  the system has had during its 20 years. There were four round  table discussions on the dilemma surrounding development in  Latin America and the Caribbean; on Latin America and the  Caribbean within the context of the new international agenda; on  Latin American and Caribbean integration, and on the challenges  of the 21st Century.    Comrade Ernesto Melendez, president of the State Committee  for Economic Cooperation, participated in one of these  discussions. He addressed the issue of the 21st Century and the  challenges that SELA now faces and its plans for facing these  challenges. It was a very significant discussion, as were  almost all of the presentations at the seminar. At this time  there is a meeting with all of the participating ministers on a  very special issue -- the relationship between the United States  and Latin America and the Caribbean. That has become the main  issue of this meeting, as the so called Hemispheric Summit,  summoned by the United States, draws closer.    The delegations here have all been probing to see what the  various countries in America have to say about such an important  matter as relations with the U.S. There has been plenty of work  and the SELA reached a decision regarding the important issue of  the contrasts between Latin American integration and hemispheric  integration. Furthermore, they discussed the possible role of  the so-called Hemispheric Summit. This is rather a  quasi-hemispheric meeting because, as you know, our country has  been excluded from the event. All the delegations here  expressed their will.... [pauses] There are several doubts  about the meeting: Why there is no agenda? Why and how was  Miami selected as the seat? The lack of will by the U.S.  Government to discuss issues such as trade, cooperation,  investment, and the transfer of technology, which are so very  important to Latin America.    Minister Melendez pointed out other additional issues. He  asked how Latin American can explain a debt of $487 billion,  while more than 200 million people live in extreme poverty.    [Govin] We also know that you plan to participate in a  meeting of the technical committee discussing the creation of  the Association of Caribbean States. The meeting is planned to  begin today, and will last for three days. Please tell us about  the meeting?    [Morales] We are going to hold what we expect will be the  last meeting of the technical committee on the creation of the  Association of Caribbean States. We are sure the end results of  our work here will be the installation of the Association of  Caribbean States, which will then carry out its own agenda among  meetings of Caribbean heads of states and ministers in the near  future.</p>

This measure states that people from elsewhere in the  Mainland with RMB [renminbi] 1 million worth of investment in  the municipality and have had their items or businesses  operating for more than two years may also apply for such  residential status.    Other qualified applicants include overseas people who have  bought a housing unit specially for overseas buyers measuring  over 100 sq. metres and Mainland personnel hired by a particular  Shanghai entity for at least three years.    The regulation stipulates that people with this special  residential status have to renew it annually with the municipal  public security department. Following such renewals after  certain years, the provisional residential status may be changed  to permanent residential status.    People with such residential status can have their spouse  and  children apply for the same status provided that they meet the  requirements. They will enjoy the same treatment in their daily  living as all other Shanghai residents including being able to  send their children to a child care centre and receive a general  education, applying for a business licence and the installation  of gas and telephone.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The KBS Television Network conducted a poll over  the phone with 600 male and female adults as respondents.    Reporter Kim Chin-suk reports on the details of the poll:    [Begin Kim recording] The reaction of our people to the  possibility of North Korea's military provocation is, above all,  negative.    As the result of the telephone poll of 600 male and female  adults living in Seoul, 60 percent of the respondents said that  even if the United Nations imposes economic sanctions against  North Korea, North Korea will not carry out a military  provocation, and only 32 percent replied that it will commit  military provocations.    Seventy-two percent of the respondents, namely three out of  four citizens, denied the possibility of North Korea's  triggering a full-scale war such as the 25 June Korean war on  the Korean peninsula, and only 24 percent replied that there is  such a possibility, thus reflecting our people's insensitivity  to war.    However, more than half of the respondents pointed out  diplomatic efforts through dialogue as effective means for  blocking North Korea's nuclear development; 27 percent pointed  out economic sanctions; and 15 percent pointed out South Korea's  nuclear development. Meanwhile, 4 percent of the respondents  stressed that a preemptive attack should be launched against  North Korea.    Concerning international community sanctions against North  Korea's nuclear development, 83 percent of the respondents  replied that sanctions must be imposed by all means. This shows  that most of the people are sympathetic with the necessity for  sanctions by the international community in order to prevent  North Korea's nuclear development.    In view of the results of the poll, we come to a conclusion  that our people, based on their negative assessment of the  possibility of North Korea's military provocation, think that  the North Korean nuclear problem should be resolved through  dialogue to the most possible extent, and, even if this  resolution method is difficult, North Korea's nuclear  development must be blocked by all means through economic  sanctions against North Korea.

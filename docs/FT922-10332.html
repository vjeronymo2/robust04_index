			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / US probes Lonrho-Libya dealings THE US administration is investigating Lonrho's dealings with Libya, including an offer by Lonrho of a deal involving its north American hotels. News of the probe came as it emerged that Mr Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi Arabian arms dealer who played a central role in the Iran-Contra affair, acted as middleman between Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's chief executive, and Libyan government officials in the Pounds 177m sale of a one-third stake in the UK-based Metropole Hotels group. These contacts led to a series of secret meetings between Mr Rowland and Col Muammer Gadaffi. Investigators are examining reports that Mr Khashoggi visited Tripoli after the United Nations sanctions against Libya over its alleged involvement in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing came into force last month. The reports suggest that Mr Khashoggi discussed other possible deals between Libya and Lonrho. Documents obtained by the Financial Times show that Col Gadaffi's main investment vehicle also discussed the possibility of acquiring part of Lonrho's North American Princess hotel chain, which includes properties in Arizona and California. A senior official of the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) said last night that Lonrho could be placed on the US government's list of banned companies if Libya acquired a shareholding giving it significant influence in the running of a Lonrho company. OFAC was talking with Lonrho about the Libyan stake, the official added. Last year OFAC handled the banning of US transactions with companies owned by or having ties with Iraq. Since 1986, the US has barred US companies and individuals from dealing with Libyan-owned or controlled institutions. A decision by the US to move against Lonrho could force Lonrho's second-biggest shareholder, Fidelity Management Research, the US mutual institutional investor, to disinvest. The documents obtained by the FT show that Mr Khashoggi first approached Mr Rowland last October. Mr Rowland wrote to Mr Mohamed Ali El Huwej, chairman of Lafico (Libyan Arab Finance Company), saying how pleased he was to learn, from Mr Khashoggi, of Lafico's interest. Ten days later, Mr Ali El Huwej replied, suggesting a meeting with the aim of seeking Libya's 'highest collaborations' in Lonrho's activities. A series of meetings took place between Lonrho and Lafico, first at a fashionable Paris restaurant last November and then at the Richmond and President hotels in Geneva in February. A deal was announced in March whereby the Libyans took a one-third stake in UK Metropole Hotels for Pounds 177m. A financier with close knowledge of the company confirmed that the Paris and Geneva meetings had taken place and that Mr Rowland had discussed possible further deals with Libyan officials. Mr Rowland subsequently met Col Gadaffi in April to discuss further investment and business ventures as the UN sanctions came into force. Speaking for Lonrho last night, Mr Andrew Nitch-Smith, a partner in London solicitors Denton Hall, said: 'Lonrho's only transaction with any Libyan institution to date concerned the Metropole Hotels sale, which was announced in March. 'Since that date there have been no other discussions on any other financial transaction with any Libyan institution. In particular, Lonrho has never had any discussions with any Libyan institution concerning any joint venture in the US.' In London, Mr Sam Evans, personal attorney to Mr Khashoggi, said he could not comment on Mr Khashoggi's business affairs. However, Mr Reda Alaywan, a Paris-based Lebanese businessman, confirmed Mr Khashoggi's involvement. The two signed a joint venture last September to broker such deals.</p>

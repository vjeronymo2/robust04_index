			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, in a commentary in the name of Chang Ki-ho,  a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the government  expressed regret and worry over the fact that it has been  confirmed that North Korea has begun replacing fuels at the 5-mw  atomic reactor.    The government also urged North Korea to fulfill its duty of  implementing safety measures in connection with the replacement  of fuels at the 5-megawatt atomic reactor through immediate  negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  which says that there remains the possibility of the  implementation of safety measures if North Korea no longer  pushes ahead with replacing fuels.    The government also made it clear that it will work out  further countermeasures through close consultations with  friendly countries, while watching the results of negotiations  between the IAEA and North Korea.</p>

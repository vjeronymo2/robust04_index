Eviction may be based on such criminal activity by a household member, a guest or another person under the tenant's control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For existing housing under the section 8 Loan Management Program (24 CFR part 886, subpart A) and section 8 Property Disposition Program (24 CFR part 886, subpart C), the proposed rule would implement section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(d)(1)(B)(iii)), as amended by section 546 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act and section 145 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At present, HUD's Multifamily Model Lease (Handbook 4350.3 Appendix 19a) contains similar provisions allowing eviction for drug-related criminal activities or criminal activity that threatens other residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would revise 24 CFR parts 247, 880, 881 and 883. The proposed rule would apply to evictions under the section 8 new construction and substantial rehabilitation programs and under the section 8 Loan Management and Property Disposition Programs. This proposed rule also would cover the following subsidized projects subject to 24 CFR part 247: multifamily housing projects that receive the benefit of subsidy in the form of below-market interest rates under sections 221(d)(3) and (5); interest reduction payments under section 236 of the National Housing Act, including Rental Assistance Payments (RAP); below-market interest rate direct loans under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959; rental subsidy in the form of rent supplement payments under section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965; section 8 in connection with section 202 Loans for Housing for the Elderly or Handicapped (24 CFR part 885), the section 8 Additional Assistance Program for Projects with HUD-Insured and HUD-Held Mortgages (24 CFR part 886, subpart A) and the section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition of HUD-Owned Projects (24 CFR part 886, subpart C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

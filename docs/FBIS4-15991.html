			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 11 Apr -- Dmytro Korchynskyy: "We positively  assess the results of the elections. Three UNA [Ukrainian  National Assembly] members were elected to Ukraine's Supreme  Council: Yurko Tyma, chairman of the UNA Ternopol Oblast  committee, Oleh Vitovych, commander of the Lvov UNSO Oblast  command, and Yaroslav Ilyasevych, chief of staff of the Lvov  UNSO branch. We consider that we could form a faction of 20 or  30 people in the parliament who will support the UNA platform.    We assess this as our victory despite the fact that enormous  pressure was put on UNA-UNSO members and parliamentary  candidates both by the power bodies and by representatives of  the communist and democratic blocs with the aim of not allowing  them to take part in the elections. The pre-election campaign  was conducted in an atmosphere of fierce fighting, slanders  against UNA-UNSO, arrests, searches of its members and  confiscation of documents. There were incidents of physical  violence against parliamentary candidates. For example, a  parliamentary candidate in Ternopol Oblast was seriously wounded  in the head and several UNA-UNSO election observers were  arrested.</p>

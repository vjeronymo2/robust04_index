			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Sport: The winners in the money game - In sport, many of the 1993 records were set at the bank. Peter Berlin looks at the year's big names and numbers It was the year of the big pay day. It was the year Linford Christie was paid Pounds 100,000 for a meaningless 100m race with Carl Lewis. It was the year Lennox Lewis won the WBC world heavyweight title the smart way, without throwing a punch and became Britain's highest-paid sportsman. He earned Pounds 3m for beating Frank Bruno, who appears more often in panto than in the ring, and Pounds 6m for defeating Tony Tucker, who ought to follow Bruno's example. Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bowe shared Dollars 15m when they fought for the WBA and IBF titles. Lewis and Holyfield may split a far larger purse in 1994. The winner will then try to hang on for the biggest pay-day of all when Mike Tyson's six-year prison sentence ends. French police found FFr250,000 buried in the garden of the mother-in-law of Christophe Robert, a Valenciennes player. Robert said the money was a bribe to lose to Marseilles. Marseilles became the first French club to win a European trophy but was then thrown out of this season's Champions Cup and Intercontinental Cup. The New Zealand Rugby Union said it would try to provide its top players with Pounds 30,000 a year and the Welsh Rugby Football Union and Swansea found a job for Scott Gibbs who was talking of turning professional. But in the year of the big cheque, the biggest earners in men's and women's sport left the stage. Monica Seles won Dollars 2.6m in 1992. She was on the way to passing that total when, at a tournament in Hamburg in April, she was stabbed by Gunther Parche, who wanted Steffi Graf restored to number one in the rankings. The injury required one stitch but damaged the shoulder muscles of Seles' playing arm. Parche received a two-year suspended sentence. Seles has not played since. Rumour surrounds her: is she psychologically scarred? Is she using the injury as an excuse to allow her battered knees to recover? Is she secretly turning herself into a serve and volley player? Seles plans to make her comeback in January at the Australian Open. Michael Jordan who earned an estimated Dollars 36m this year. retired 'for now' in October. In June, Jordan led his 'supporting cast', the Chicago Bulls, to its third consecutive National Basketball Association title. In August, his father, James, was killed, apparently while being robbed. Then Jordan's gambling, frowned upon in US sport, became the subject of investigation after a golf partner wrote a book dedicated to the size of Jordan's bets. For a man whose greatest quality was his willingness to take responsibility on court when the spotlight was most intense and who is paid an estimated Dollars 28m a year to be the public face of, among others, Nike, Gatorade and McDonald's, life under the unrelenting scrutiny of the US media seemed to have paled. Even though Jordan is not playing, the Bulls are said to be paying Dollars 3.9m of his contract this season. It means that, under the complex NBA complex rules, the Bulls would be able to play Jordan should his competitive nature draw him out of retirement. The biggest stocking filler of all was announced this week. In the US, Fox Network won the television rights to the National Football Conference,the older of the National Football Leagues' two divisions. CBS had broadcast NFC games for 38 years, but could not match the Dollars 1.56bn (Pounds 1.06bn) four-year bid by Fox, seen as a down-market interloper by its rivals. This may ring a bell with UK soccer fans, but then the largest shareholder in BSkyB is Rupert Murdoch who owns Fox. He makes an unlikely Santa Claus.</p>

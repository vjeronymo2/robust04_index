Davalos  indicated that the procedures followed by the covert agents in  Panama are not legal. Because of this we have to be very careful  because it is a direct act against our sovereignty.    The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty has not yet been approved  by the U.S. Senate, and, therefore, the operations conducted by  the DEA agents are illegal, the acting Attorney General said.  According to Davalos, at no time since he has been in charge of  the Attorney General's Office have U.S. narcotics officials  requested authorization to operate in the country.    Covert U.S. federal agents, in an operation set up a year  and  a half ago, intercepted more than $10 million in drug  trafficking money in which lawyers, accountants, and Panamanian  and Colombian businessmen are allegedly involved.    Among those accused are Frank L. Greene, the vice president  of the firm Merril Lynch International in Panama; Steven L.  Mills, a top official of the same firm; and Panamanians Ricardo  Leyton, a lawyer; Charles Richard McFaden, an accountant; and  businessman Luis Sanchez. Also involved are Jorge Rogelio  Krupnik, Gilberto Straub and his son, Jorge Rivera, and Patrick  Van Duel, who according to the list is an official at the  Colabanco Bank. The bank, however, has stated that Van Duel no  longer works for them.    The acting attorney general pointed out that any procedure  or  probe conducted by the Panamanian Government on those involved  in the drug trafficking network discovered by the federal agents  has to be conducted through the Foreign Ministry. Likewise, any  protest by the Panamanian Government toward the United States  for the covert work performed by the DEA agents has to be filed  by the Foreign Ministry, from whom a statement in this regard is  expected.    Meanwhile, Hernan Rubio, president of the Bar Association,  said the entire drug trafficking network discovered by the  United States is part of a campaign to discredit the country.</p>

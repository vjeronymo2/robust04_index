			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Banks 'face Soviet debt moratorium': Balance of payments crisis threatens repayments by republics, Salomon Brothers warns WESTERN commercial banks face the 'almost certain prospect' of a moratorium on principal debt repayments by the former Soviet republics throughout this year, according to a report by Salomon Brothers, the New York-based merchant bankers. This is because the republics are more preoccupied with their own domestic problems and are suspicious of Russia's role in negotiating the debt. Even if the political circumstances were more favourable, the report argues that a moratorium would still be likely because the former Soviet republics face a balance of payments crisis. Under the terms of an inter-republican agreement signed last December, western official creditors agreed to a temporary moratorium on medium and long-term official debt. This was followed by a temporary moratorium on payment of principal to commercial banks. A moratorium on official credits was extended to the end of 1992. This agreement, which committed each republic towards contributing a share of the convertible currency needed to make debt-service payments, was a precondition for assent by official creditors to an extension of the principal moratorium for all of this year. Salomon Brothers say that the agreement is almost impossible to implement, because: 'there is no way to ensure that each republic will contribute to the debt-service pool, even if they had access to convertible currency income'; 'all the republics, particularly the Ukraine, are suspicious of the (banking and financial) apparatus that appears to be under the control of the Russian republic.' In recent weeks, the Ukraine government has repeatedly stated its opposition to channeling debt service through a Russian-controlled institution. 'although the G7 (group of industrialised countries) warned the constituent republics that their specific creditworthiness would be harmed if the debt is not fully serviced, it is doubtful if the political elite in many republics are overly concerned with international creditworthiness at a time when popular discontent with food prices and shortages is the major concern'. Apart from political instability and inter-republican disagreements, the report shows how balance-of-payments crises, caused by the rapid rise in inflation, budget deficits, and an increase in the money supply, undermined the worth of the rouble. 'The fundamental source of the Soviet Union's balance-of-payments crisis in 1991 was the rapid rise in both suppressed and open inflation during the year, and the resulting disappearance of the rouble as a valid medium for economic transactions,' says the report. The public's lack of confidence in the rouble led to the internal flight to hard currency by households - estimated to be between Dollars 5bn and Dollars 10bn; the capital flight of hard currency abroad, estimated between 15bn and Dollars 40bn; and the hoarding abroad of hard currency by Soviet enterprises in order to avoid the 40 per cent conversion tax on convertible currency remissions. The report argues that it is unlikely that the country's balance-of-payments problems can be rectified in 1992.</p>

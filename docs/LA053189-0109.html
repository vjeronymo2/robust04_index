			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: DRIVING A PIER TRAM ISN'T ALL BLUE SKY AND SUNSHINE  </P> <P> The air temperature was 71 degrees. A cobalt sky soared overhead, no clouds in  sight. The ocean breeze was out of the southeast at 4 m.p.h. Gentle breakers  carried surfers in Day-Glo wet suits underneath the Seal Beach Pier.  </P> <P> David Hughes, 25, peered through his wrap-around sunglasses as the tractor  lurched ahead on the pier at a snail's pace. "Everybody seems to think this is  a great job," the former South Dakota farmer said, easing past two young women  in not-quite-wrap-around bikinis. "It's not as easy as it seems. You gotta  watch out for people."  </P> <P> Hughes has a lot on his mind these days as he the beach maintenance worker  pilots a city tram back and forth on the Seal Beach Pier. About 500 yards long,  the tricky stretch of wood planking and asphalt can be a treacherous obstacle  course, Hughes insists. Why, sometimes he even feels anxious.  </P> <P> "It gets really nerve-racking, worse than the freeway," Hughes said, his long,  blond hair suddenly lifted by the sea breeze. "Sometimes you have a couple  hundred people out here and it gets pretty crowded. You'd be surprised at how  reckless people can be."  </P> <P> It's a tough job, but yes, somebody's got to do it. Hughes shares this  demanding duty with three other city employees. The ride is only a quarter each  way, children under 7 free. It's the only municipal pier tram service in Orange  County.  </P> <P> But sometimes the public can turn on even a mild-mannered tractor jockey such  as Hughes.  </P> <P> "What'd you do? Get rid of old nasty Harold?" bellowed Harold Hirsch, 78,  waving a fishing rod in Hughes' direction as he boarded the tram one recent  morning.  </P> <P> "Nah, he's on vacation," said Hughes, who was pitching in this day to cover  colleague Harold Griffin's shift. "He's in Mexico."  </P> <P> "Good, I hope he stays there," said Hirsch, a tram regular. Hughes hollered  back that not everyone is perfect like Hirsch, who smiled. But only for a  moment.  </P> <P> "I don't know what you're paid, but it's certainly not hard work," Hirsch said  with a wink and a grin as the tram eased up in front of Ruby's restaurant at  the end of the pier. Debbie Dalton, 37, piped in to defend Hughes. "He's nice,"  she said. "I doubt he gets paid enough."  </P> <P> Then everyone clambered off the tram for fishing, lunch or just horsing around  on another beautiful day.  </P> <P> One more load delivered, Hughes broke for a cigarette. He pondered the pitfalls  of chauffeuring fishermen, families, oil roughnecks and "smart-aleck" kids at  this quaint beachside community.  </P> <P> "You don't look forward to summer," the long-suffering Hughes said, grinding  the cigarette butt into the pier with his tennis shoe. "It can be a real  headache."  </P> <P> Take the young people who like to race his tram -- top speed of 5 m.p.h. Or the  ones who will suddenly leap in front of the tractor as he putters peacefully  along.  </P> <P> "I've never hit anybody," Hughes said, his tone suggesting that some terrible  and different fate lurks in the future. "I've been pretty lucky. But there's  always close calls."  </P> <P> The key to tram success, Hughes revealed, is total concentration.  </P> <P> "After a while, you don't actually see people," Hughes said. "Just figures.  You're too busy. You have to have a pretty clear mind."  </P> <P> On a hot and crowded summer day, Hughes said the Seal Beach Pier can be a  veritable Grand Central Station.  </P> <P> One day he ferried 460 people on a single 10-hour shift, Hughes said. At an  average of what he calculates were eight runs per hour, that worked out to an  almost sardine-like half a dozen passengers on the 15-foot-long tram each ride!  </P> <P> "And that was just paying customers," Hughes added.  </P> <P> Yes, even here at the bucolic Seal Beach pier, chiselers sometimes try for a  free ride. Not everyone puts his 25 cents into the fare collection bin --  shaped like an oversize thermos -- that hangs at the end of the tram.  </P> <P> "You wouldn't believe the people who won't pay the quarter," Hughes said,  shaking his head. "They'll want to fistfight. You just make them look bad in  front of the other passengers. We're not supposed to fight."  </P> <P> Yet, for all the gorgeous weather, body-beautiful sun worshipers, high-stress  crowds and deadbeat customers, Hughes said he probably prefers jockeying the  Seal Beach tram to the grueling grind of running combines on a South Dakota  farm.  </P> <P> "The work was too hard and the pay was terrible," Hughes recalled. "There's  quite a bit of difference."  </P> <P> People columnist Herbert J. Vida has been on vacation. He returns Friday.  </P></p>

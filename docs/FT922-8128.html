			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Warning over costs in accounts proposals PROPOSALS unveiled yest-erday by the Auditing Practices Board may create extra costs and impose additional responsibilities on directors and auditors, experts warned yesterday. The plans were welcomed by Mr Roger Davis, head of audit at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm. However, he warned that auditors would be put on the spot by the proposed requirement to express an opinion on whether a company was a going concern for the following 12 months. Mr Hugh Collum, chairman of the 100 Group of leading finance directors, said the going concern statement was an important contribution but 'it's going to need careful handling, particularly for companies in difficulties.' The Confederation of British Industry commented: 'It puts a heavy burden on directors and auditors.' The proposal for an expanded report spelling out that directors and not auditors are responsible for the accounts giving a true and fair view of the business was welcomed by the Institute of Directors. A report commissioned by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said that an expanded report would be useful in reducing the 'expectations gap' in public understanding of the role of auditors.

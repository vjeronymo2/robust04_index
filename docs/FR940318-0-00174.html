			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Substitutes acceptable subject to narrowed use limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Metals Cleaning. (None).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Electronics Cleaning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Perfluorocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronics cleaning sector for high-performance, precision-engineering cleaning applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only where reasonable efforts have been made to ascertain that other alternatives are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technically feasible due to performance or safety requirements. PFCs covered by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination are C5F12, C6F12, C6F14, C7F16, C8F18, C5F11NO, C6F13NO, C7F15NO,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and C8F16O. The uses of PFCs in solvent cleaning are restricted due to global warming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns. PFCs display intrinsic properties that point to their potential to be contributors to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> global warming. All PFCs, for instance, have very long atmospheric lifetimes. As an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, C5F12 (perfluoropentane) has a lifetime of approximately 4,100 years. This means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that for practical purposes, any global warming effects from PFCs are irreversible. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contrast, the lifetime of CFC&hyph;113 is, at 110 years, 40 times smaller. Since greenhouse gases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> come from many diverse sources, even small emissions of PFCs warrant controls if global  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warming is to be successfully mitigated. The risk screen for the solvent cleaning sector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discusses the atmospheric properties of PFCs and provides a more detailed discussion of why  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PFCs merit being listed as acceptable only for narrowed uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite concerns about the global warming potential of PFCs, the Agency has listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this niche application as an acceptable use of perfluorocarbons because, for certain high-performance, precision-engineered components and equipment, a PFC-based cleaning system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be the only viable alternative available to replace use of class I or II compounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The characteristics of components or equipment that may require PFC-based cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are if the part:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Requires extremely low levels of remaining particulate and residue for adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance (as opposed to cosmetic appearance). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Possesses complex geometric configurations and or capillary spaces (as small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as 1 micron) which greatly hinder cleaning and drying. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Contains or is made of materials sensitive to corrosion, oxidation or other damage from water (such as ceramics, gallium arsenide, silicon nitride, or magnesium), where that damage would degrade subsequent performance of the product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Contains temperature-sensitive materials that cannot maintain their integrity at the high drying temperatures of alternative systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Contains materials that are hydrophilic or otherwise impaired by contact with water. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Is extremely fragile, requiring the use of a low viscosity, very low surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tension fluid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Is contaminated with specialized halogenated lubricants or damping fluids such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as perfluoropolyethers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Is a low-volume prototype under development for research, testing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Users should note that the presence of one of these parameters alone does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessarily indicate the need to use a PFC. For instance, a water-sensitive part could potentially also be cleaned using a solvent wash, solvent rinse without PFCs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples of components where PFCs may be necessary are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Precision optical and electro-optical systems such as components for highpowered lasers or weapon targeting systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Specialized electrical, semiconductor and electronic components, connectors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and assemblies such as precision electronic components used for military and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avionics applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Sensitive medical devices and medical equipment components such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic circuitry for pacemakers (does not include prosthetic devices).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Precision telecommunications and communications components such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microwave hybrid components for electronic warfare.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;High-performance computer components and computer electro-mechanical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assemblies such as direct access storage devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other examples are listed in the section on precision cleaning. Examples of parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where alternatives other than PFCs exist are electronic parts for low-value, mass-produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer or standard machined metal parts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A specific example under electronics cleaning where PFCs may be necessary exists in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture of certain direct access storage devices (DASDs) for computers. To make the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical improvements demanded of the storage devices, such as faster access times and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher recording densities, companies have been required to use magnetically superior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials. These materials are extremely prone to corrosion from water and are vulnerable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any contamination introduced in the manufacturing process, such as organic or particulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter. Consequently, the storage device itself must be a miniature ``clean room'' if it is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform correctly. Manufacturers of some DASDs can use water-based cleaners in much of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the production process, but may need to rely on the PFCs as water-displacement agents to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve the required high degree of cleanliness while protecting the water-sensitive materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the acceptability determination states, before users adopt PFCs as part of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute cleaning system, they must ascertain that ``other alternatives are not technically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasible due to performance or safety requirements.'' This statement implies users will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertake a thorough technical investigation of alternatives before implementing the PFCs. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination, for instance, that PFCs are necessary simply ``because my parts cannot tolerate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water,'' is insufficient. Similarly, companies should avoid rejecting an alternative simply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because it is flammable or toxic, since equipment now exists which may be feasible for some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses that makes it possible for a broad spectrum of alternatives to meet performance and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Users may contact vendors of alternatives to explore with experts on these alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether or not they would work. This effort may involve a detailed discussion of the type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parts, e.g., function, substrate, geometry, and cleanliness standards. A possible approach is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actually arrange for the parts to be tested with other cleaning alternatives. For example, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern regarding the flammability of isopropyl alcohol is not sufficient reason to reject this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative, unless the user has contacted vendors and examined the newer styles of equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and found them insufficiently safe. To assist users in their evaluation, EPA has prepared a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list of vendors selling substitutes for cleaning solvents. Although EPA does not require users  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to report their test results in a certification to the Agency, companies must keep these results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on file for future reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In cases where users must rely on PFCs due to lack of other options, they should make every effort to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Adopt closed systems and recover, recycle and destroy where possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Pre-clean where possible with other alternatives so as to avoid unnecessary use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of PFCs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Reduce emissions to a minimum through equipment features and conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices that address idling losses, liquid dragout, and operator variables  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (adequate freeboard, chillers, welded piping, programmable hoists, operator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training, etc.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Continue to search for long-term alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that it is reasonable to expect users to achieve favorable CFC/PFC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement ratios since PFCs have relatively higher boiling points. In addition, the high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price of PFCs makes additional containment cost-effective. Companies forced to use PFCs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to lack of other alternatives may use the PFC-based equipment to clean and dry other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precision parts, but only if the amount of PFCs needed to stock the equipment does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

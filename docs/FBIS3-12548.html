In a statement  today, he said that the security men's task was to prevent the  students from leaving the university campus to preserve security  and stability. He stressed that reports that certain security  men fired bullets at students are totally baseless and false.  He asserted that the task of the security men is primarily to  keep law and order and maintain stability, noting that students  have the right to express their feelings by staging a peaceful  demonstration inside the campus without causing riots and  instability.</p>

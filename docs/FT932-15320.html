			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Leading Article: Mr Keynes and the Japanese 'PRACTICAL MEN, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences,' wrote John Maynard Keynes in the General Theory, 'are usually the slave of some defunct economist.' Which academic scribbler have Tokyo's bureaucrats been studying as they prepared Japan's second fiscal package in less than nine months? Certainly not the economists who advised President Clinton that a package of tax increases and spending cuts would improve US economic performance. The voices in the air, encouraging Japanese politicians to spend their way out of recession, appear to come from Keynes himself, with a little neo-Keynesian encouragement from Washington. Not that Keynes, experienced in the ways of international finance, would disagree with America's need for Clinton-style fiscal austerity. The high long-term interest rates that US-style fiscal profligacy deliver have damaging effects on economic activity. Japan's advantage is that it used the fat years of the 1980s to build-up a healthy fiscal surplus. By prudently avoiding placing itself in a position in which old-style Keynesianism is counter-productive, it has been able to run down this surplus as economic growth has slowed. Market reactions Japanese fiscal activism, far from frightening investors, has allowed long-term bond rates to fall by a percentage point since the first fiscal package was announced and remain 1 1/2 points lower than in America. The combination of the latest Y13,200bn (Pounds 76bn) fiscal package and a recent government-managed revival of animal spirits, has lifted the Tokyo stock market through the 20,000 barrier, closing 44 per cent above last August's low, while the the yen has risen to a record high against the dollar. The announcement yesterday was also an impressive propaganda coup. By announcing the package on the eve of a summit of the world's leading finance ministers in Tokyo, the government secured the public praise of US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, despite yesterday's news that Japan's trade surplus rose to Dollars 111bn (Pounds 73bn) in the 1992 fiscal year. But will it work? In the short-term, Japan's fiscal activism cannot fail to boost economic growth. The package, adjusted for the various dodges and leakages which enrage zealous US officials, will inject around Y8,500bn (Pounds 49bn) worth of new spending into the economy this fiscal year, equivalent to 1.8 per cent of Japanese gross national product. The Economic Planning Agency confidently expects the spending, mainly on infrastructure, to push GNP growth above 3 per cent this fiscal year. Private investment Yet fiscal expansion on such a scale cannot replace private spending and investment for long without leading to structural fiscal problems. Worryingly, the prospects of a marked revival in private-sector activity look poor, despite modest signs of an upturn in housing starts, car sales and broad money supply. Retail sales to nervous consumers are still falling and companies say they plan to cut investment spending again this year. The appreciation in the value of the yen, which fiscal expansion and the revival in the stock market are already helping to deliver, will further postpone a revival in Japanese industrial activity. In the short term, it will also make the trade surplus larger as yen import prices fall. Even if investment demand picks up, it will take years rather than months before Japan's debt-burdened banks are able to support a recovery in private investment. The revival in the stock market, and widening of interest margins, have eased the prudential pressures on the banks. But the yield curve remains flat, suggesting a further cut in short-term interest rates is overdue, while bad debts are being written off at a sluggish pace. In short, the revival in consumer demand for US imports and a fall in the trade surplus look many months away. The spirit of Keynes lives on in Tokyo. But, for all Japan's far-sighted prudence and political guile, modern-day pump-priming looks unlikely to produce quickly what the Japanese need and the US wants.</p>

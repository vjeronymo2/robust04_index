			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: DAMON GROUP TO SELL UNIT FOR $12 MILLION  </P> <P> Damon Group Inc., which recently changed its name from American Magnetics  Corp., said it agreed to sell its electronic products business to the U.S.  subsidiary of a European company, System 4 International B.V., for $12 million.  </P> <P> The sale completes the transformation of the Sherman Oaks company from an  electronics concern making card readers, like those used to operate bank teller  machines, to a medical testing lab business.  </P> <P> The transformation began last spring when American Magnetics acquired control  of Massachusetts-based Damon Corp., a company that operates a string of labs  that perform medical services like urine and blood tests, in a deal worth about  $317 million.  </P> <P> Previously, American Magnetics' chief business was making the card readers. But  after the acquisition of Damon, the company's sales came 80% from medical  services, 19% from electronics and about 1% from commercial real estate.  </P> <P> The sale of the electronic card reader business completes Damon's strategic  shift.  </P></p>

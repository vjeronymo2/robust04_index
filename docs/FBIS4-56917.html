			<p>BFN     [Text] Colonel Morris Eugenio de Leon, chief of the  Information and Press Department of the Army (DIDE), says the  Armed Forces are preparing for a postwar era and for a revision  of goals, according to a strategic modernization and  reorganization plan.    The Armed Forces will no longer devote their time solely to  wiping out guerrillas. Now, they will also participate in  social activities. According to De Leon, a close look at the  situation shows that individual rights must be respected.    An example of the Army's new duties is its decision to  cooperate with the arrival of 521 refugee families from Mexico.  As of 13 May, the Guatemalan Air Force will begin making 18  flights in Araba airplanes to transport the belongings of the  refugees, who will be returning to Mayalan, Quiche, where they  will attempt to live despite the continuing presence of  guerrillas in the area.    The return of the refugees, De Leon added, is part of the  aforementioned program, the deadline for which is the year 2003.  The plan does not include a reduction in the Armed Forces High  Command because its goal is to control future military  promotions to prevent saturation.</p>

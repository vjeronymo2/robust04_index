The Secretary also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may transmit the notice by other, more expeditious means, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The revocation takes effect on the date that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary mails the notice to the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The notice states the basis for the revocation, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of the revocation to the institution, and that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution may request the Secretary to reconsider the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revocation. The consequences of a revocation are described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.26.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)(i) An institution may request reconsideration of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revocation under this section by submitting to the Secretary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 20 days of the institution's receipt of the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice, written evidence that the revocation is unwarranted. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution must file the request with the Secretary by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand-delivery, mail, or facsimile transmission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The filing date of the request is the date on which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the request is_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Hand-delivered;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Mailed; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Sent by facsimile transmission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Documents filed by facsimile transmission must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmitted to the Secretary in accordance with instructions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by the Secretary in the notice of revocation.

The Secretary also may transmit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice by other, more expeditious means, if practical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the Secretary determines that the revocation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warranted, the Secretary's notice informs the institution that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution may apply for reinstatement of participation only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the later of the expiration of_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Eighteen months after the effective date of the revocation; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) A debarment or suspension of the institution under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12549 or the Federal Acquisition Regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If the Secretary determines that the revocation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution's provisional certification is unwarranted, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's notice informs the institution that the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisional certification is reinstated, effective on the date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Secretary's original revocation notice was mailed, for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)(i) The mailing date of a notice of revocation or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request for reconsideration of a revocation is the date evidenced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the original receipt of mailing from the U.S. Postal Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The date on which a request for reconsideration of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revocation is submitted is_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If the request was sent by a delivery service other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the U.S. Postal Service, the date evidenced on the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt by that service; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If the request was sent by facsimile transmission, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date that the document is recorded as received by facsimile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment that receives the transmission.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1099c and E.O. 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> p. 189) and 12689 (3 CFR, 1989 comp., p.235)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8.

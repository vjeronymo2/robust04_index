			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (46): The new rich emerge - The rising money culture. FT correspondents discover the ingenuity of some of China's growing band of entrepreneurs HEARD the one about the man from Sichuan who made a fortune out of nothing by buying used Russian aircraft in exchange for train-loads of Chinese consumer goods? This true story is just one of many told in admiring tones to illustrate the helter-skelter of money. Ill-paid bureaucrats are goggle-eyed when they see the riches being made by China's new entrepreneurs. Suddenly, in the words of one, 'money is flying in the air.' Here we offer some snapshots of the new culture of money from around China. MR XUE'S HERBAL REMEDIES OUT of herbs which cost nothing except the labour needed to pick them, Mr Xue Yongxin has in seven years generated a company with annual turnover of Yn300m, writes Alexander Nicoll. 'In my opinion, it's only a starting point,' says Mr Xue, who aims to quintuple the figure by 1996. The company's main products are a lotion and tablets, made entirely from Chinese herbs, for the treatment of vaginal inflammation. Mr Xue, 41, says he was previously an itinerant worker studying medicine, Taoism and architecture. He educated himself because his schooling was interrupted by the Cultural Revolution. In 1986, he founded Chengdu Enwei group, in which he holds 92 per cent. At the time, few people were willing to invest in a new company - 'I was very adventurous to establish this enterprise,' he says. With annual pre-tax profit of Yn100m, Mr Xue is already a rich man - though he professes Taoist beliefs in harmony and helping society. 'Money will do no good to the human body, unlike medicine,' he says. Boasting 46 group companies and 30 sales offices around China, as well as in Vietnam, Thailand, Russia and Japan, Mr Xue can see few obstacles to further exponential growth. He is applying to have his main products approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (as cosmetics, rather than drugs). After finding that poor packaging limited his ability to export, Mr Xue is building a new packaging plant with imported equipment. A man with marketing flair which has been rare in China, he is looking for cross-marketing agreements with foreign manufacturers of name-brand products. Mr Xue uses television and poster advertising in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, and is expanding sales throughout China although he is hampered by inadequate railways and roads, power supplies and telecommunications. And, inevitably for a medicine company with an eye for massive growth, Chengdu Enwei has a cure for Aids as well as other fatal diseases including liver cancer. Its Qian Kun Ning herbal capsules, according to the company's literature, have 'the effect of replenishing Qi to invigorate the spleen, promoting blood circulation, relieving flatulence, removing heat, detoxicating and enhancing the effect of the body's immunity.' Chinese researchers are examining the claims. MR MO'S PROFITABLE PICKLES THE IDEA is extraordinarily simple. But from a few sheds in Sichuan province, Mr Mo Goshun says he makes a profit of Dollars 1m per year, writes Alexander Nicoll. His five-year-old enterprise in Xian Yang township cuts, salts and pickles vegetables, and sells them to Japan. Mr Mo himself spotted the market opportunity. Mushrooms which grow wild in the mountains of Sichuan sell for Dollars 250 a kilogram in Japan, he says. He claims that it costs him Dollars 400 to process one ton of mushrooms and that he sells them for Dollars 14,000 per ton. Seeds for cabbages and other raw materials are imported from Japan, and the enterprise also processes onions, eggplant and other vegetables according to demand in Japan. Mr Mo admits that he is already a rich man in Chinese terms - he expects to set up a co-operative agreement with a Japanese company, but says that 'we do not need the money.' STORES REPORT SPENDING FEVER 'MY POCKETS are bulging with money,' says Mr Fanchunfu, a stallholder in Tianjin's biggest department store. He transports zip-up jackets from the southern provinces to Tianjin, sells around 40 of them a day, and makes Yn1,300 a month, writes Bronwen Maddox. The store's four teeming floors in Tianjin's Hongqiao district, which open at six in the morning every day, are testimony to the spending fever gripping Chinese families. Customers elbow each other out of the way to try out the electronic games, cosmetics, and karaoke microphones. Mr Ye Furong, the store's general manager, explains that the store has been set up as a market, with space rented to private stallholders, 'because we (the store's founders) do not have enough experience in developing a market system. Our aim is to mobilise private businesses to do that.' Open for nearly two years, it now has more than 1,000 stallholders who supply their own goods and set their own prices. Trading volume is expected to reach Y300m this year. ***** 'These businesses work according to the law of the market,' comments Mr Ye. 'If it is cheap, lots of people will buy it.' The managers' embrace of market values is now so firm that when asked what makes a good businessman they give a textbook answer: good information; matching supply with customers' tastes; quick transport; good quality, and setting prices in line with quality. Although the managers hotly reject the label of speculators, the enterprise also illustrates the kind of property deal of which Beijing officials have become wary. The cost of building the store, Yn30m, was financed by a loan from a local property company on a interest rate of 7.2 per cent a year, with part of the interest deferred. The interest rate is lower than hotels and restaurants would pay 'because this kind of project is encouraged by the state' says Mr Ye. 'We are selling little goods that people need.' Yet, although they have paid back only a third of the loan, they now have an empty site earmarked for a second, bigger store, which they plan to finance with a second loan from another property company. Questioned on whether they would earn more money as traders in their own store than as its managers, they roar with laughter, but the eventual answer is 'yes.' That response reflects one of the new tensions of China: officials and managers are increasingly confronted with the spectacle of poorly-educated entrepreneurs earning a fortune. The stallholders themselves express no doubts about their new jobs. Mrs Han, 40, who runs a sock stall in the store, used to work in a Tianjin factory repairing machines - 'twenty years ago I never would have dreamed I'd be doing this. The market system is good. Business is good.' NEW FASHIONS CATCH ON AFTER ONLY three weeks of running a Japanese joint venture clothing store in Beijing, Mr Kunio Kawasato, is already fascinated by the mystery of conspicuous Chinese consumption, writes Robert Thomson. 'You look at the statistics on what people are supposed to be earning, then you see how much the customers are spending, and the figures don't add up,' says Mr Kawasato, general manager of a venture by Taka-Q, famed for its contribution to Japan's post-war development by supplying the standard blue suit to salaried workers. He puts the willingness of Chinese customers to spend at least Yn1,200 and sometimes much more, on the lack of spending options - 'people are not saving for a house or a car, and the taxes are not high,' he says. 'Food is relatively cheap, so people are using their money for clothes and entertainment.' Tapping into those relatively large urban incomes is the aim of the Taka-Q venture, though publicity in Japan has put the shop on the tourist map for visiting Japanese. While Mr Kawasato was explaining how he has encouraged good manners among the shop assistants, a tourist group was downstairs looking for Japanese quality at Chinese prices. The store, near the main Beijing shopping street of Wangfujing, is a joint venture with Leimeng Garment, which ran a Mao suit store during the cultural revolution. As political fashions changed, Leimeng moved into western suits and, now, a foreign partnership in Italian-style suits, leather jackets and business shirts. ***** Taka-Q Leimeng looks like one of the Japanese company's outlets in suburban Tokyo, but Mr Kawasato is still coaching the sales assistants in the Japanese arts of politeness. In many Chinese stores, change is often tossed back at customers by mute assistants for whom a sale is an unwelcome intrusion. 'We have trained the assistants to say, 'thank you very much, please come again,' as would be the case in Japan. I think the customers can feel a difference between this store and other Chinese stores, but our levels are still not high enough,' he says. Mr Kawasato has made the assistants more attentive to sales by giving them a relatively low base salary and introducing a commission system. But retraining the former Leimeng staff, accustomed to low-effort service, has been more difficult than coaching recently hired employees. In Japan, stores such as Taka-Q often keep files on customers and run a discount card system for frequent buyers, but Chinese customers are reluctant to provide information for a personal file. Until now, only the Communist party, the police, and the State Security Bureau have kept personal files. Taka-Q is supplying the store from its own joint venture factory near Beijing, which also exports garments to Japan. Among men, suits account for about half of the sales, while Chinese women are most influenced by fashion trends started in Hong Kong, Mr Kawasato says. 'The level of brand and quality awareness in China is even higher than that of some Japanese consumers. But the use of the suit is different in China,' he says. 'Men don't wear a suit to work, but they wear one on their day off, if they go out.' Taka-Q is planning a chain of Chinese stores, though opening dates are not fixed - 'if we open more stores, the production costs will fall,' he adds. 'Before the war, the company had a store in Shanghai, so there is a historical reason for the interest in China.'</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Turkey pushes to bolster Russian connection - A string of trade and debt deals have put bilateral ties on a firmer footing A HUGE poster draped from the roof of a hotel greeted the Turkish prime minster as his cavalcade swept through Moscow recently. Hosgeldeniz Baba, it said - Welcome Baba, as Mr Suleyman Demirel is affectionately known at home. Mr Demirel's visit to Russia served to underline the importance of Russian trade ties with Turkey despite the focus of public attention on Ankara's future role in central Asia and its tentative economic links with the Turkic republics of the region. It also bolstered the position for 40 Turkish companies doing construction work in Russia. Mr Demirel and Russian officials ironed out a number of key problems on the current natural gas protocol, which has been the main catalyst for a dramatic rise in bilateral trade in the past few years. 'We're not the Red Cross,' said the head of one of Turkey's leading contracting companies, worried that attachment to the Turks of Central Asia was distracting Ankara from what they see as its main task to win contracts in Russia, where it has a track record. Mr Demirel caused some consternation in banking circles in Ankara last month, when he promised more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) in credits to the Turkic republics during a visit through the region. However, officials have since clarified that this is little more than insurance cover for those Turkish companies game enough to venture into these markets. Turkey's best bet in Central Asia remains those deals based on barter arrangements in a region rich in natural resources but without the banking infrastructure and the creditworthiness to warrant extending loans. The extended Russian gas deal - under which Russia agreed to repay its Dollars 35m debt to Turkey - could well provide the model. In 1990, Turkey's trade with the Soviet Union was worth Dollars 1.7bn on the back of 1984 trade protocol under which Turkey imports Soviet gas in part exchange for Turkish goods and services. Business collapsed with the break up of the Soviet Union. Turkey's Eximbank, which helped finance Turkish contractors in the region, and has extended more than Dollars 1bn worth of credits to the Soviet Union in the past four years, has frozen all new lines. For the Turkish contractor who decided to build a hospital in Yalta, the visit will have had little impact. Like a number of contracts financed on the back of this six-year-old Soviet-Turkish trade protocol, the hospital has been left half completed. Mr Demirel's Moscow visit completed a string of high-level exchanges. According to Turkish officials, the breakthrough came during Mr Demirel's meeting with Mr Yegor Gaidar when the Russian first deputy prime minister gave assurances that Russia would settle a Dollars 35m outstanding debt. Mr Erdogan Hurbas, head of agreements at the Turkish treasury, says that Russia will repay over the next three months, and what's more in hard currency. It will interesting to see how western banks react to such a move, given that Russia is in default of the Dollars 60bn it owes to western finance houses. Turkey argues this is a contractual obligation under an international accord. Between 1987 and 1990 Turkish Soviet trade more than trebled to Dollars 1.8bn. Turkey is facing a projected energy shortage and is certainly in desperate need of the Siberian gas which today provides energy for industry and households and has done much to reduce pollution in cities like Ankara. But Mr Demirel's projection that trade would increase five-fold over the next few years may prove optimistic. Moreover, Russia is also demanding a new price structure, with the price set according to a central European benchmark as opposed to the Mediterranean price. Turkey scored another success in Moscow when the Russians agreed that the proceeds from the gas agreement - about Dollars 270m in 1991 - should in future be paid by Botas, Turkey's pipeline company, direct to the Turkish Eximbank, and not the Vnescheconombank as before. Under the current agreement, Botas pays hard currency upfront, according to its projected monthly gas needs. Under the old terms, 70 per cent is dedicated to the purchase of Turkish goods and services and the remainder is a free currency portion to service Eximbank's credits. As a result of this week's talks, the Eximbank says it will unblock its credit lines to Russia from this month.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TURKEY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              1987   1988   1989   1990   1991*   1992*++  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Exports to Soviet Union   (Dollars m)                 169    271    705    531    611     134 Percentage of total exports   1.7    2.3    6.1    4.1    4.4     3.7 Imports from Soviet Union   (Dollars m)                 307    442    625  1,200  1,100     215 Percentage of total imports   2.2    3.1    4.0    5.6    5.2     4.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Former Soviet republics, predominantly Russia. ++First quarter  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Turkish treasury  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

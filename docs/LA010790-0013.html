			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: A GOOD DRESSING-DOWN;  </P> <P> POKING THROUGH WHAT MAY BE CLOSETED REASONS FOR AN ANNUAL SARTORIAL SNUB  </P> <P> ONCE AGAIN, a year has rolled around, and the Tailors Council of America has  published its annual list of the "Ten Best Dressed Men in America."  </P> <P> And once again they have seen fit to leave me out.  </P> <P> For 10 years, at least, I have eagerly awaited the list, hoping to find myself  included among the most sartorially noteworthy of American men. I have been  repeatedly disappointed.  </P> <P> If I were not, by nature, inclined to think the best of my fellow men, I would  suspect the tailors of prejudice against individuals of my profession and  economic level.  </P> <P> I notice that, as usual, the 10 best are all successful in their fields, and  presumably men of means. It is true, I suppose, that to dress really well a man  needs a liberal bank account. But it seems to me that the tailors ought to make  room on their list for one or two men whose good taste supersedes their  budgets.  </P> <P> I grant that I am not poor, but I doubt that I would spend more money on  clothes even if I became rich. I don't think a man needs $800 suits and $200  shoes to look sharp.  </P> <P> Perhaps I was excluded again because there was no category for journalists. The  closest categories were comedy (Don Rickles) and television (Arsenio Hall). I  suppose television would include such news anchors as Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather  and Peter Jennings, but it obviously does not include newspaper columnists and  reporters. Are we pariahs?  </P> <P> Other categories were government, Mario Cuomo; motion pictures, Michael  Douglas; sports, Pat Riley; industry, Malcolm Forbes; business, Michael Milken;  design, Mr. Blackwell; entrepreneurial, Donald Trump, and music, Placido  Domingo.  </P> <P> As far as I know, all those gentlemen are snappy dressers, and I don't resent  their selection. Honesty requires that I examine my own wardrobe for some fatal  flaw, some gauche costume that left the tailors no choice but to include me  out.  </P> <P> I wonder if it could be the lime-green jacket my wife ordered for me from a  mail-order house. It's light, fresh and pretty and fits fairly well, except for  a kind of hunch between the shoulder blades. But it isn't easy to find  accouterments suitable for a lime-green jacket. Maybe one of the tailors'  scouts saw me that time my gray slacks were at the cleaner's and I wore the  lime-green jacket with blue slacks. I have seen lime green and blue in nature  (lime-bearing trees against a blue sky), but on a man they don't look too good.  </P> <P> Also, I might have been blackballed because of my pale plaid jacket. Its colors  are pink, green, gray and yellow. I bought it off the rack for $50. But the  first day I wore it, alas, I put an uncapped pen in the breast pocket and it  leaked a large black stain. The cleaner couldn't quite get it out. Not that  that kept me from wearing it.  </P> <P> I suspect, though, that I was undone the night I spoke at a dinner in the Four  Seasons Hotel. That's just the sort of place the tailors' scouts would haunt.  It was black tie. My tuxedo is 10 or 15 years old but still serviceable. What I  didn't know, though, until my wife pointed it out, was that I had forgotten my  cummerbund. My pleated dress shirt tended to pooch out under the jacket button.  That certainly would have been enough to disqualify me.  </P> <P> On the other hand, it might not have been my formal attire that did me in but  my athletic attire. I suppose what one wears to the gym is as important as what  one wears to a black-tie dinner. I admit that I have been rather careless in  the togs I wear when I work out. I sometimes wear a T-shirt that says, "How can  I be expected to cope with life when I can't even program my VCR?" But I think  it would be petty of the tailors to disqualify me because of my technical  ineptitude.  </P> <P> I can think of only one other thing. It might be my shoes. Ever since I  suffered nerve damage in my right leg, I have worn a pair of black deerskin  shoes. They are very soft and pliable. It is true that after several years they  have become wrinkled and shabby looking. I wear them with every outfit,  whatever its color. I wear them with my tux.  </P> <P> So that's probably it. They won't select me as one of the 10 best dressed  because my shoes are tacky.  </P> <P> It's either that or they're prejudiced against newspapermen. It is the nature  of our jobs that we are always being thrust into different environments, at  different social levels -- a Skid Row murder in the morning, an interview with  an ambassador in the afternoon. It is difficult to dress properly for all  contingencies.  </P> <P> It was once said of journalist Heywood Broun that he looked like an unmade bed.  Don't we all?  </P></p>

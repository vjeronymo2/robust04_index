			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Turmoil on Cyprus"] </F>   [Text] The statement President Clinton made before he met  Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, to the effect that "an  important development will take place on the Cyprus problem in a  few days and the ball is in Denktas' court" has created a  turmoil in Ankara. The opposition parties moved into action and  blamed Prime Minister Tansu Ciller after they read the report in  HURRIYET's headlines. Ciller responded by saying: "I did not  discuss the Cyprus problem with Clinton. Nor did he make such a  statement."    However, Ciller's decision to suddenly send Ambassador  Volkan  Vural, who is her adviser, to Nicosia drew attention to the  Cyprus problem in Ankara. Meanwhile, the Greek newspapers  reported that one of Prime Minister Papandreou's advisers  informed the Greek prime minister that "Ciller has made a  promise. Denktas will approve the new package of  confidence-building measures." That report created a reaction  in the opposition party leaders.    President Suleyman Demirel was the first to react. Replying  to a question on Clinton's statement during a reception in the  Cankaya Mansion, he said: "Something that is wrong, something  that is undesirable, and something that violates and harms the  rights of Turkey, its kinsmen in north Cyprus, and the TRNC  [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] cannot be accepted."  Regarding the reports that Rauf Denktas has agreed to the  package of confidence-building measures, Demirel said: "I  conferred with the speaker of the TRNC Republican Assembly  yesterday. As far as I know, the matter is being discussed.  Meanwhile, I have been informed that the United States wants  progress to be made in the talks. However, that is all. The  question is not related to pressure but to the need for  something to be done. That is the official information I have.  Naturally, the problem is not a matter between Turkey and the  United States. Nor is it between Turkey and Greece. It is  related to the agreement the two communities will reach to  coexist in Cyprus. That is a matter that does not closely  concern Ankara. Naturally, Ankara maintains a very sensitive  and careful approach on the Cyprus problem. That applies to  public opinion, the parliament, and the government. I am also  very careful."    Demirel's attention was drawn to Clinton's statement that  the  problem will be solved in a few days. He replied: "He has  mentioned two or three days. We shall wait to see developments  in the next few days."    Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said: "I have the  text of the records on the meeting Prime Minister Ciller had  with President Clinton. Ciller has not made a promise."    Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz's reaction was as  follows: I cautioned the prime minister before her visit to the  United States. I was worried that a concession might be made on  Cyprus. The prime minister must disclose the views she exchanged  with Clinton, particularly the promise that was made to him. We  proposed that the Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] hold a  general session on the Cyprus problem. We have conferred with  the speaker of the TGNA. The convocation will be held on  Tuesday. I shall address the session and explain our anxiety on  the Cyprus problem.    Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan reacted as  follows:  No one can make a concession. An administration that has lost  its grass roots cannot make a concession on the matter. A  secret policy cannot be maintained within the state. The  records on the prime minister's meeting with President Clinton  in the United States must be placed in the archives.    Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin  said: I do not believe that the reports are true. The prime  minister will issue a statement on the matter.</p>

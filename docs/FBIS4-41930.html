			<p>BFN     [Text] A KAZTAG correspondent learned from the  Constitutional Court that it postponed examination of the  constitutional validity of Article 60 of the Election Code until  1 July. This article concerns election collateral and the  obligatory collection of 3,000 signatures supporting a  constituency candidate for deputy in Supreme Kenges. Candidates  from the state list do not have to collect any signatures.    In the opinion of Deputy Burnashov, who instituted the legal  issue, these provisions contradict the constitutional norms on  the equality of rights of citizens and create allowances for  some categories of voters and candidates. As is known,  examination of the case on 6 June was postponed in connection  with the untimely appointment by parliament of their  representative. This mistake has now been corrected. The  necessary procedural measures have been taken in order to ensure  the rights of one of the sides, namely the Supreme Kenges.</p>

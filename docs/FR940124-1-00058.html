			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary is considering adding to this section a requirement that agencies notify the Secretary prior to taking final adverse action against an institution when the information that caused the agency to take the adverse action may relate to the institution's continued participation in Title IV, HEA programs, as, for example, in the case of fraud or gross mismanagement of Federal funds. The Secretary is considering this additional notification requirement because of the length of time it often takes agencies to reach a final adverse decision, due to an institution's rights under due process, even when circumstances indicate a gross violation of agency standards. The Secretary invites comments on this additional requirement and alternative approaches to notifying the Secretary when an agency has such serious concerns about an institution that it initiates an adverse action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Secretary is considering adding to this section a requirement that an accrediting agency must notify the Secretary and the appropriate State postsecondary review entity of any final adverse accrediting action at the same time the agency notifies the institution of this action. The Secretary believes this addition would prevent excessive draw-down of SFA funds by an institution after it loses accreditation. The Secretary notes that, while this topic was not discussed during negotiated rulemaking, many negotiators have told Department staff that this additional requirement would not present an undue hardship to their agencies. The Secretary invites comments on this proposed additional requirement and suggestions for alternative approaches to prevent unwarranted expenditure of SFA funds by institutions that have lost accreditation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 602.30&blank;Regard for Decisions of States and Other Accrediting Agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 496(l)(2) of the HEA implies that accrediting agencies are responsible for knowing what actions other recognized accrediting agencies have taken against an institution. The Secretary addresses this issue in &sect;602.30 by proposing that all agencies, including those that accredit only programs, take into account the decisions of States and other accrediting agencies when making any accreditation or preaccreditation decision involving an institution or program. The Secretary believes the inclusion of programmatic accrediting agencies in this requirement is essential to ensure that the problems that caused a programmatic accrediting agency to take adverse action against a program within an institution are promptly reviewed by the institutional accrediting agency that accredits the institution to determine if the institution is still in compliance with the latter agency's standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;602.30(a)(3) of the proposed regulations, the Secretary requires that agencies routinely share with other appropriate recognized accrediting agencies and State agencies information about any actions they have taken regarding an institution's or programs's accreditation or preaccreditation. The Secretary is considering adding to this section a requirement that agencies share information about actions they are taking or are about to take regarding an institution's or program's accreditation or preaccreditation. The Secretary invites comments on this additional requirement and alternative approaches to sharing information with the other members of the triad regarding actions either under way or planned by the agency with respect to an institution or program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in &sect;602.30(b) the Secretary proposes that agencies are subject to the requirements in &sect;602.30(a) if they ``knew, or should have known,'' of the actions being taken by another recognized accrediting agency or State agency. The Secretary believes that it is reasonable to expect an agency to have known of these actions if there is evidence that the other agencies have sent information concerning these actions to the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following discussion addresses other issues either discussed by negotiators or raised by the Secretary after the negotiations. None of the issues, however, involves a significant change from the current policies and procedures governing the accrediting agency recognition process, and thus none warrants inclusion in the previous section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

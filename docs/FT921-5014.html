			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Observer: Niefarious? The 64-year-old boss of Daimler-Benz Edzard Reuter may be staying another two years beyond his official retirement date, but it is all change at vehicle subsidiary Mercedes-Benz. With Reuter around until end-1995, one person ruled out as his successor is the combative Werner Niefer, Reuter's deputy and head of Mercedes-Benz. Now with an honorary professorship and two honorary doctorates under his belt, Niefer began his career at Daimler aged 15 as a tool-making apprentice. But he has tripped more recently, not least as the result of an incident in Italy when he injured a German woman tourist whilst at the wheel of a Mercedes bus. Niefer, 63, goes at normal retirement age next year, making way for the suave self-confident 55-year-old Helmut Werner, now head of trucks, as his successor and probable Reuter replacement. Niefer's consolation, it seems, is to pick his successor's senior colleagues. The supervisory board yesterday formally approved Bernd Gottschalk, who at 48 heads the Brazil operation, to replace Werner, and Dieter Zetsche, just 38 and president of Daimler's US truck company Freightliner, to take over as head of car development. Mercedes was strongly hinting that Niefer, 'in the interests of continuity', had got the very men he wanted. Maybe Werner will have to wait to rise one step further for his own wish list.</p>

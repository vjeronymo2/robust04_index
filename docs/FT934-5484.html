			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Unions sue over Tupe work rights Five unions yesterday issued writs against the government for failing properly to implement the European Union's Acquired Rights Directive which provides certain protections to employees in the event of a transfer of ownership. The government has recently rectified its implementation of the directive by extending coverage to public-sector employees. But such employees who were not covered between 1981 and 1993, and who suffered as a result, might be able to claim damages after a ruling in the European Court of Justice. The five unions - Unison, the public-service union; the TGWU and GMB general unions; NUCPS, the civil service union; and the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance - have issued writs on behalf of 128 affected individuals. The unions say that tens of thousands of people may have claims but that a 'negotiated settlement' is still on the table. The writs have been issued now because any claims had to be registered within three months of the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993 coming into operation. That act corrected the omission of 'non-commercial' ventures from the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (Tupe), which implemented the Acquired Rights Directive into British law.</p>

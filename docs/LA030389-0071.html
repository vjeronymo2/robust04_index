			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER TOWER  </P> <P> So, the Democrats voted against the confirmation of Tower. Imagine, he has  received large amounts of money from the defense industry. They must have been  deeply shocked. And it was great to see Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) vote nay, in  righteous indignation -- those rumors about Tower's sinning -- wine, women and  song. Good for you, boys!  </P> <P> ELEANOR SWEET  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

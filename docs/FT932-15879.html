			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Blockleys tumbles to Pounds 352,000 BLOCKLEYS, the Shropshire-based brick and pavior manufacturer, suffered a further downturn in 1992 as recession continued to take its toll on the construction industry. On turnover down by Pounds 1m to Pounds 9.3m, pre-tax profits were Pounds 352,000, against Pounds 1.06m. Mr Brian Taylor, chairman and managing director, said the UK brick industry saw both production and sales fall by some 6 per cent, while stocks of bricks rose to a new peak of 1.54bn at the year end. There is still no real indication of any recovery in the construction industry, he said, and the forecast for sales of bricks in 1993 was only 2.5 per cent above the 1992 level. Staff numbers have been cut by 45, leading to an exceptional charge of Pounds 85,000. A final dividend of 0.5p (1.43p) makes a total of 1p (3.38p). The dividend is uncovered by earnings per share of 0.73p (2.48p).</p>

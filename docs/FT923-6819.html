			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Alfred McAlpine falls Pounds 71,000 into red DEPRESSED house prices and recession in the construction industry almost wiped out operating profits at Alfred McAlpine, which fell from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 879,000 in the six months to April 30. But a reduced interest charge of Pounds 950,000 (Pounds 4.01m), helped by the proceeds of last year's Pounds 39m rights issue, contained the pre-tax loss to Pounds 71,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 700,000 last time. Turnover slipped to Pounds 250m (Pounds 254.8m). Construction recorded an operating loss of Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 4.2m profit) although turnover fell only slightly to Pounds 164.4m (Pounds 175.9m). There were redundancy costs of Pounds 500,000. Housebuilding improved to an operating profit of Pounds 1.4m (nil) and 469 units (393) were sold. But average prices fell 5 per cent to Pounds 83,000. The company has 3,500 plots with planning consent, with an average purchase cost of Pounds 22,000, and margins are improving as more expensive sites acquired in the late 1980s are developed. McAlpine is buying the 40 per cent minority stake it does not already own in the housebuilding division from the founding Grove family. The group will pay a mixture of cash, shares and loan notes for the stake, which is valued at about Pounds 18m at yesterday's closing price. There is also an earnout consideration based on average profits in the three-and-a-half years to October 1995. Minerals made operating profits of Pounds 800,000 (Pounds 1.6m) while the US division reported unchanged profits of Pounds 500,000. Earnings fell to 0.2p (2.8p). The interim dividend is cut to 3p (4.5p). There was a retained loss of Pounds 1.29m (Pounds 380,000). COMMENT Shareholders who applauded the 1990 appointment of Mr Graeme Odgers to energise McAlpine may be having second thoughts. Yesterday's was the second dividend cut he has implemented. Assuming the final payment is similarly scaled back, this year's total of 6.5p compares with 16.1p before his appointment. Meanwhile, those who subscribed for rights last year at 225p have already lost more than half their money. Undoubtedly, recession takes much of the blame. But it is difficult to see any short-term release from the pain. With construction looking grim until 1994 at least, housing is crucial to McAlpine's recovery prospects. There is scope for more margin improvements as costly land is replaced, and the company's plans to increase volumes 10 per cent each year may be successful. But what McAlpine and many others really need is rising new house prices, and that has already been ruled out until 1993. Profit forecasts for this year have been scaled back to Pounds 6m, putting the shares on an unappealing 14 times.</p>

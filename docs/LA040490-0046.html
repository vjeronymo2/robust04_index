			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ACTION URGED ON FREEWAY INTERCHANGE;  </P> <P> CALTRANS: THE COUNCIL WANTS THE CONTROVERSIAL PROJECT TO BE FINISHED QUICKLY,  BUT HOMEOWNERS ARE SUING FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday urged Caltrans to move quickly to build  a controversial freeway interchange at Valley Circle Boulevard and the Ventura  Freeway because state highway officials have expressed doubts about the  $35-million project.  </P> <P> Spurred on by Councilwoman Joy Picus, lawmakers reaffirmed the city's  longstanding support for the Caltrans project, which is now under legal attack  by local homeowner groups.  </P> <P> "Over my dead body will this be dropped," Picus said during an interview after  the council voted 13 to 0 to reaffirm its support for the project and urge the  California Department of Transportation to move "as expeditiously as possible"  to complete it.  </P> <P> Picus said the existing Woodland Hills interchange, designed to handle traffic  in the 1950s, has produced "terrible bottlenecks" on adjoining surface streets.  </P> <P> Jack Hallin, Caltrans deputy director for Los Angeles, said the state has  misgivings about the project because of the opposition. Homeowner groups,  including the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization, have sued Caltrans in  state and federal courts to force a full environmental review of the project.  The groups also have proposed an alternative to the solution the state agency  has proposed.  </P> <P> "We haven't backed away from the project yet, but we are evaluating what to  do," Hallin said. "We're asking ourselves if it's going to be cost-effective."  If the agency is forced to conduct an environmental review, he said, "We may  back away from the job."  </P> <P> Final say over the project rests with the California Transportation Commission.  But the commission can be influenced by the recommendations of Caltrans staff  members.  </P> <P> Picus said the city backs Caltrans' interchange design. She said she is neutral  on the issue of whether a full-blown environmental impact report is needed. "It  doesn't seem like a good idea to me for Caltrans to fight doing an EIR if  there's a 50-50 chance of having to do one anyway," she said. "I'd rather they  just do the EIR and get on with it."  </P> <P> Robert Gross, president of the Woodland Hills group suing Caltrans, said the  concern is that the project will direct more traffic into the area and  "probably spur additional growth." A full environmental study is needed to  determine the effect of the project on traffic and to propose ways to ease  those effects if the project goes forward, Gross said.  </P></p>

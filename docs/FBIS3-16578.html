"If the Crimean president fails to understand this and  begins  to demonstrate his power or exceed Ukraine's laws and  Constitution, this will pose the start of confrontation. The  entire responsibility for it will lie on the person who starts  it," Kravchuk declared.    Nevertheless, Kravchuk pointed out that "we shall not resort  to the use of force toward the Crimea." He is "calling for  common sense," the Ukrainian president said.    "The Crimea continues to receive subsidies from Ukraine,"  Kravchuk noted, and added that "there is no political  independence without economic freedom."    According to him, the issue of dual citizenship, that was to  be decided by referendum in the Crimea, "is within the  competence of Ukraine and Russia, not that of the Crimea."    During his first meeting with Yuriy Meshkov, Kravchuk said,  he reached agreement to come into contact when working out  political decisions. "Evidently there are forces which directed  the Crimean president to a different road," Kravchuk said.    "If some people think that they will become a state as soon  as they proclaim it, they are deeply mistaken," he said. The  Ukrainian president referred to the experience of  Trans-Dniester, which, he said, "proclaimed itself a state, but  failed to become one in practical terms."</p>

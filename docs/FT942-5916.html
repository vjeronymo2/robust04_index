			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Arts: Playing Away fails to score - Opera Remember Damn Yankees? An American musical of the 1950s that enjoyed a Drury Lane run, it retold the Faust legend against the background of professional football. Howard Brenton's libretto for Benedict Mason's opera Playing Away combines the Faust myth with football; not hard to do when most successful players look like mafiosi. The musical's most diverting character was a temptress called Lola. Consciously or not, Brenton echoes this with another sultry Lola, the footballer-hero's wife. Alas, she has nothing so entertaining to sing as What Lola wants, as immortalised by Gwen Verdon. The direction by David Pountney, which won a prize for Opera North at the world premiere at the Munich Biennale a fortnight ago, can be seen at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, this week and then in Hull, Nottingham and Manchester. As a production it has all the theatrical audacity and exuberance of Pountney at his best. He turns an opera chorus into a mob of soccer rowdies charging into Munich (very self-referential, this piece) with the topical cry of 'My team is fed on British beef]' He can, with Quinny Sacks' choreography, depict the relationship between star player and anthropomorphic ball (soprano Nicola Sharkey in a piebald body-stocking) as a tenderly manipulative ballroom dance. A bierkeller scene evokes those Germanicisms so wickedly caricatured in ENO's Konigskinder. Like Huntley Muir's award-winning sets and costumes, the production deserved its prize. The work itself is more problematic. Brenton's libretto is too wordy for opera, especially with the company's less than perfect diction. After the acid test of seeing the piece without reference to cast or synopsis, I was startled to see I had missed a singing dachshund, not to mention the universal issues of morality, power-play and the unsuitability of women in the players' baths. The production's swish and style fails to disguise the episodic, undeveloping nature of the first half, or the delay in getting to grips with the Mephistophelean element until well into the second. Mason's score is a cheerful kaleidoscope of allusions, quotations and parodies where the listener, however fleetingly, snatches fragments of everything from Humperdinck and Wagner to Bernstein and 'The Stripper'. Even Terry Bond, the golden-boy of the pitch, suggests vulnerability with a stammer that recalls Billy Budd. Philip Sheffield makes the most of the one adequately-characterised role, oddly resembling Tony Blair, who doubtless also has various diabolical pacts to consider. As a spectacle the work is fun, with its vivid if obvious depiction of tabloid hacks (who end up briskly copulating) and its excitingly choreographed soccer match. But for the most part the characters remain tokens, fleshed out neither with words nor music. Richard Suart as the manager could turn to juggling, soft-shoe shuffles or Gilbertian patter at the drop of a trilby; splendid stuff, but better than the work deserves. Grand Theatre, Leeds.</p>

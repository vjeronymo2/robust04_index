			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Free to speak their minds In a free country even former prime ministers have the right to express their views. If Mrs Margaret Thatcher declines to enter a nunnery, as many of her erstwhile colleagues wish she would, that is her business. Her celebrated article in Newsweek is best regarded in this light. It tells us a bit about her, and a bit about the internal debate among Tories. It is a contribution to public knowledge. There is no need to expostulate about its author's claims to political immortality. What it tells us about Mrs Thatcher is unsurprising. She does not say so, but it is clear that she is no longer an imminent threat to the stability of the government, as she was perceived to be last year. She cannot diminish the authority given to Mr John Major by the decisive victory won under his leadership on April 9. These are unpalatable facts. Her reaction to them reveals her to be as vulnerable to fits of self-justification as anyone else. 'If a man gets up and says, 'Look, really, I'm a very modest man', would you believe him?' she writes. 'What about the person who says 'I care far more about people than she did'? Look at the record, and make a judgment.' Plainly, Mrs Thatcher is unable to see herself as others see her; most of us have the same difficulty with ourselves. Those who consult the record will judge Mr Major to be more modest, and more caring, than his predecessor. There is, however, profit in considering the issues she raises. These are real enough. 'They think they would do more for the public services than I did,' she protests. 'Some think that implies taking a bigger proportion of growth, leaving less to the people.' This is a serious argument, to which Mr Major must eventually respond. The health and education services cannot be improved by the magic wand of opting-out alone. When the new management structures are in place, the demand for more cash will be strongly supported by accompanying accounts. Mrs Thatcher, whose insistence on 'sound finance' has always been unwavering, speaks for an important segment of the party when she warns that the government's share of the national income must be reduced. If he had not taken a vow of silence about her outbursts, Mr Major could reply that he is aware of the need to restrain public spending. He appointed one unreconstructed Thatcherite, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, and another, Mr Peter Lilley, to head the most intractable of the giant spending departments, social security. A third, Mr Michael Howard, will cap local authority spending. The new defence secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, will stand or fall by his ability to squeeze a maximum peace dividend out of a notoriously spendthrift department. After a while we may consult the record and assess whose administration turned out to be the most frugal  - Mr Major's or his predecessor's. Mrs Thatcher has also warned against what she calls 'a policy of intervening in industry', by which she must mean Mr Michael Heseltine. She is not the only Tory to be worried about our tall friend. We may assume that he will reverse the dry-as-dust strategy of the old Thatcherite industry department. There would have been little merit in his taking the job if he was not to be allowed to do it his way. Mr Major must have known this when he offered the post to Mr Heseltine. He cannot have appointed so powerful a politician to so important a department with the intention of struggling to restrain him at regular meetings throughout the next four years. These and other well-known Thatcher concerns (such as further integration of the European Community) will be voiced through her new foundation and perhaps from a platform in the House of Lords. Mr Major has no need to worry. Since his election in his own right he can reasonably expect the allegiance of the bulk of his party. Yet he will not have a free ride. Where Mrs Thatcher has a legitimate point, he will have to win the argument. So much for her. Another politician in a spot of bother over something he wrote is Mr John Patten, the education secretary. His article in last week's Spectator affirms his belief in God and bemoans the increasing secularisation of our society. The question I have heard people ask this week is: 'Should an education secretary express religious views?' My answer is: 'Of course he should. Why on earth not?' I have previously criticised Mr Patten, but that was because I do not agree with his views on constitutional reform. His right to be a Christian and proud of it is, however, unquestionable, even if he is education secretary. I will venture further down the path of political incorrectness, to suggest that perhaps Mr Patten is wiser than his critics. 'Secularisation,' he writes, 'submerges the quaint and old-fashioned idea that in the end happiness comes not from cars, colour televisions and consumables but from within ourselves.' He is right, right, 100 per cent right.</p>

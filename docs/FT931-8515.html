			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Bond prices rise but shares ease after early gains PRESIDENT Clinton's package was given a mixed reaction by the US markets. Government bonds rose sharply but share prices fell after an initial jump. In early afternoon trading the benchmark 30-year government bond, the key indicator of bond market performance, was up almost  3/4 of a point at 101 1/16 . But the prospect of slower economic growth undermined shares. By mid-session the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 14.59 at 3,297.60. The foreign exchange markets responded positively at first. In New York, however, trading was more subdued, and by early afternoon the US currency had slipped back to stand at DM1.6285, up about half a pfennig. Report, Page 16</p>

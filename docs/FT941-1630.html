			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Darty helps Kingfisher to Pounds 309m: Analysts concerned with retailer's underlying performance despite 51% rise Kingfisher shares fell yesterday in spite of better than expected results, reflecting disappointment over the retailer's underlying performance in the UK. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 309.3m, a rise of 51 per cent, were about Pounds 10m ahead of expectations. Sales rose 26.3 per cent to Pounds 4.48bn. The profits advance was largely fuelled by a Pounds 79.2m operating contribution from Darty, the French electricals retailer acquired in February last year for Pounds 1bn. Profits were further cushioned by a lower than expected interest charge of Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 700,000) and a rise in the property contribution from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 43m. Operating profits from the main UK retailing businesses, where Kingfisher launched a strategy of everyday low pricing last year, fell 3 per cent. One analyst described the returns from Comet, Woolworths, B&amp;Q and Superdrug as 'a bit disappointing'. 'It would appear that the strategy is not delivering great profit growth.' The shares fell 9p to 561p, and have dropped 22 per cent since January's trading statement after which analysts downgraded expectations from Pounds 315m to Pounds 300m. Analysts also indicated that 1995 forecasts would be pulled back. Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman, rejected criticism of the low price policy. 'It is designed to attack the lower growth and more competitive retail environment of the 1990s,' he said. 'I am convinced that strategy is right and it is working.' Kingfisher has decided to step up introduction of electronic points of sale throughout the group to cut costs and reinforce the strategy. Sir Geoffrey said Epos would be in every store by the Christmas trading period. He was pleased with the results, which had demonstrated the 'soundness of both Kingfisher's businesses and its balance sheet'. Debt was reduced from 66 per cent of shareholders' funds to 33 per cent. Darty had been 'particularly encouraging', said Sir Geoffrey, 'given the recession in France'. The group had increased market share in an intensely competitive environment, and deliberately avoided chasing lower-margin volume. The chairman would not comment on current trading. However, Kingfisher has decided to make two trading statements a year in addition to announcing its results. The next statement is due in June. The dividend was raised 10 per cent to 10.5p, for a total 9 per cent higher at 14.9p. Fully diluted earnings rose 15 per cent to 36.9p.

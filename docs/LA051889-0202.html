			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ASSAULT GUN BAN IS SENT TO GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> COMPROMISE MEASURE WOULD MAKE CALIF. 1ST TO FORBID SUCH ARMS  </P> <P> The Legislature today passed and sent to Gov. George Deukmejian a final  compromise bill that would make California the first state in the nation to ban  military-style assault weapons.  </P> <P> If, as expected, Deukmejian signs the compromise legislation by Assemblyman  Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), the sale of about 60 models of assault firearms will  be illegal after June 1. He has 12 days to act.  </P> <P> Both houses today approved the measure, which included provisions sought by the  governor.  </P> <P> The governor had complained that another assault weapons bill, sponsored by  Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and approved earlier by the Legislature,  provided excessive penalties for people who fail to register assault weapons  legally obtained before the ban takes effect.  </P> <P> "This (the Roos bill) recognizes the governor's concerns that an otherwise  law-abiding citizen could face felony penalties" for possession of an assault  weapon, Roberti said.  </P> <P> The Senate vote on the Roos follow-up bill was 27 to 11. The Assembly approved  the changes on a 41-35 tally -- the exact majority needed in the 80-member  house.  </P> <P> The action came almost four months to the day that drifter Patrick Purdy used  an AK-47 assault rifle to kill five children and wound 30 other people at a  Stockton schoolyard Jan. 17.  </P> <P> Critics of the legislation charged that it was an overreaction to such highly  publicized incidents.  </P> <P> Sen. Ed Davis (D-Northridge), a former Los Angeles chief of police, denounced  the measure as "twisting the Constitution out of shape."  </P> <P> "This is a sad day for liberty in America," Davis said. "This is the result of  emotion and panic thinking (but) it is not going to work."  </P> <P> The legislation would, with a couple of exceptions, ban the sale of more than  60 models of weapons, including the type of AK-47 used by Purdy.  </P> <P> People who legally obtain assault weapons before June 1 of this year could keep  them but would have to register the firearms with the state.  </P> <P> It would take a special permit, such as those required for machine guns, to  legally keep an assault weapon obtained after the cutoff date.  </P></p>

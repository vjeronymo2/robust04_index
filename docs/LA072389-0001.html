			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Brent Spiner deserves praise for his portrayal of Lt. Data on "Star Trek: The  Next Generation." I'm sure it's not easy bringing an android character "to  life," but Spiner does it with skill and sensitivity, making Data one of the  more enjoyable characters on the show. I hope his work is recognized when the  nominations go out for Emmys.  </P> <P> Julie Hoffman, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / International Company News: Minebea forecasts first loss due to NMB burden MINEBEA, a leading Japanese machinery maker, has forecast consolidated pre-tax losses of Y7bn (Dollars 57.4m) for the year to September - the first loss for the world's foremost maker of miniature bearings since its founding in 1951. The company blamed the turnround - from taxable profits of Y7bn the year before - on losses at its semiconductor subsidiary, NMB Semiconductor, and on the fall in the Tokyo stock market, which is likely to result in paper losses of about Y2.8bn. Like many Japanese industrial companies, Minebea had relied on the stock market to boost earnings during the late 1980s, but the continuing weakness of the market has forced these companies to book losses on their holdings. Consolidated sales are likely to total Y270bn, down from a previous estimate of Y280bn and last year's Y285.4bn, while the company is expecting net losses of Y13.5bn, compared with profits of Y888m last year. NMB, expecting losses of about Y12bn, has become a burden for Minebea because of the severe competition in the semiconductor market, and the company is planning to shift away from the production of standard memory chips to application-specific chips. But competition in the that market is also severe, and the cost of keeping up in the semiconductor sector is putting extra pressure on Minebea when sales of core products have slowed in tandem with the Japanese economy. The forecast for parent company profits was revised down to Y8.5bn from Y9.5bn on sales of Y200bn, down from Y207bn. Net profits were revised down to Y2.7bn from Y4.8bn, and the parent is expecting to post book losses of Y1.9bn on its securities holdings. Minebea intends to pay an annual dividend of Y6, down from Y11.75 last year.</p>

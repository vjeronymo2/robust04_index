			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Sales improve at Georg Fischer GEORG FISCHER, the Swiss foundries and engineering group, said sales rose 7 per cent in the first half to SFr1.28bn (Dollars 969m), with foundries, piping systems and machine tools all contributing to the growth. The board forecast that the profit for the full year would be higher than that of 1991 provided there was no further deterioration in the economy. Orders on hand at mid-year amounted to SFr1.02bn, down 19 per cent since the end of last year mainly due to the closure of the Schaffhausen steel foundry. Sales of the foundry division in the first half were ahead of budget at SFr520m, up 9 per cent on the same period of last year. Sales of automotive castings benefited from relatively heavy demand from the German motor industry. Piping systems sales gained 10 per cent to SFr326m, with substantial growth in demand for plastic and automation products. Manufacturing technology sales rose 25 per cent to SFr209m, but orders for flexible machining systems declined because of the weak investment goods market. The plant engineering and construction division was also affected by the weak capital goods market, but large orders for environmental protection equipment were received.</p>

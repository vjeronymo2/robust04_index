Keep in mind that data reported on the register are outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches or on separate registers for different loan types (small business or small farm), but make sure each loan number is unique. Entries need not be grouped on your registers by MSA, or chronologically, or by census tract, or in any other particular order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

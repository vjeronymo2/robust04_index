			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Wednesday: The governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, gives evidence on the Bank and the UK economy to the Treasury select committee. UK gross domestic product figures are expected to confirm an earlier estimate that the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research publishes its latest economic forecast. Friday: The Confederation of British Industry's monthly industrial trends survey will provide further evidence of the strength of the UK recovery. One key indicator will be domestic orders, which may have been affected by April's tax increases, but analysts will also scrutinise the balance of companies which intend to raise prices. Previous surveys have shown little sign of inflationary pressure. Japanese inflation has been phenomenally low for some time, but Morgan Grenfell is expecting the Tokyo May data to disappoint, with the annual rate moving up to 1.2 per cent. The market consensus, however, is 0.8 per cent, both for the May Tokyo figure and for the April whole nation inflation rate.</p>

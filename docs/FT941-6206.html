			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Hurd admits 'incorrect' link over Pergau The government guaranteed Malaysia up to Pounds 200m of aid - the same amount as pledged to secure a controversial arms deal - despite declaring that the two could not be linked, it was revealed yesterday. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, disclosed that the government had granted the money through its high commissioner in Kuala Lumpur on the same day that the then defence minister was forced to retract a promise of aid equivalent to 20 per cent of the Pounds 1bn arms deal. In evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee, Mr Hurd admitted that there had been 'an incorrect entanglement' between the aid and arms deals in the run-up to Britain's funding for the Pergau dam project. He said the link had been made between March and June 1988 under a protocol signed by Lord Younger, then defence secretary. Mr Hurd's admission came as Malaysia appeared ready to modify its stand against British companies. It made clear that the effective break in trade relations applied only to government contracts and procurements and not to the private sector. British companies had feared they could also lose private contracts because of Malaysian government pressure. Despite Malaysia's apparently softer stance, Mr John Major accused the country of short-sightedness and said it owed much of its economic development to British trade and investment. The prime minister was said by officials to be 'deeply frustrated' at the Malaysian action. Brussels officials said the European Commission would be ready to intervene in the dispute if Britain complained about discrimination Meanwhile, a television show of The Brit pop awards has become the first victim of Malaysia's trade restrictions against British companies. The Dutch-owned Polygram Television International, responsible for selling the show worldwide, said a Malaysian television station pulled out of a deal to take the programme on government orders. Mr Hurd told the Commons committee that the protocol signed in 1988 by Lord Younger 'reflected the Malaysian wish' for British aid equivalent to 20 per cent of the arms deal. Mr Hurd said that had been 'wrong and irregular' and had to be untangled. 'The two policies cannot be linked,' he added. Three months later, on June 28, Lord Younger wrote to the Malaysian government to say such a link was not possible. However, on the same day that Lord Younger delivered his letter, the British high commissioner in Kuala Lumpur sent a separate letter to the Malaysian minister of finance confirming the UK government's intention to provide up to Pounds 200m for development projects. The then prime minister Lady Thatcher also mentioned both the arms deal and the aid in a letter sent on August 8 1988. Asked repeatedly whether the government had not continued to conduct the same policy by different means, Mr Hurd said the two policies were pursued separately, although in parallel. He appeared to blame Lord Younger for the 'incorrect entanglement' of aid and arms between March and June 1988. Mr Hurd said the then defence secretary had 'pursued it with great energy', although Lord Younger had failed to clear the protocol with any other government department or minister. He added: 'The Foreign Office was not consulted before the protocol was signed.' Mr David Sumberg, a Conservative member of the committee, described the original decision to link arms with aid without reference to other department as an 'extraordinary state of affairs'.

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (9): Now for China - Profile / Kvaerner When, in 1988, Erik Tonseth took the helm of Kvaerner, Norway's second biggest publicly-quoted group, he started to look for a yard which could be acquired to build ships for the company's fleet. Little more than five years later, Kvaerner has become Europe's biggest shipbuilder, and one of the three biggest in the world, and Mr Tonseth has led a successful expansion of the group in which sales and profits have more than tripled. About 35 per cent of Kvaerner's sales are generated from shipbuilding; oil and gas contracting contribute 30 per cent, mechanical engineering 20 per cent, pulping 11 per cent, and shipping 4 per cent. Shipbuilding revenue is expected to increase by NKr1.5bn to NKr10bn in 1994. But Mr Tonseth is is in no doubt about the effect a No vote on EU membership would have on Kvaerner's future: 'We would have to consider if it would be good for us to remain in Norway. About 40 per cent of our shareholders are outside Norway, along with two-thirds of our employees. Both these proportions will increase substantially in future, so we could not afford to remain in a closed, nationalistic environment.' Although Norway's long tradition as a maritime nation has probably been the single biggest factor influencing Kvaerner's industrial participation, Mr Tonseth does not believe the country is unique. 'We could be in Switzerland as a financial holding company and survive, but we could not have a vigorous, active management based there. We could be in Britain or elsewhere. . . But wherever we are, it must be in an environment where there is interest in our industry.' Kvaerner's expansion into shipbuilding began in the summer of 1988, when the group acquired the loss-making Govan shipyard on the Clyde, in Scotland. The plan was to build gas carriers for Kvaerner's fleet. Five years later, the long-troubled yard achieved its first profit in 30 years. And this year it is forecast to make a profit of Dollars 5m. 'In retrospect, the acquisition was not the best decision,' admited Mr Tonseth. 'We had many ex-shipbuilders but no active shipbuilding organisation, and then to buy a yard which desperately needed new management and a new way of thinking was a fairly ambitious move. 'Govan also needed total support from its new owner. At the time, Kvaerner was not really in a position to give this level of support to the yard, which is why it took so long for us to turn it around.' Kvaerner's strategy was then to acquire a yard which could not only meet the group's internal demand for ships but could also participate in an upswing in shipbuilding foreseen by the group, and without requiring huge investments. 'We believed that, with our resources, we could become a major factor in this industry. We were very convinced that by 1995 the shipbuilding market would improve. So, establishing that strategy, we bought the Masa-Yards in Finland and four small yards in Norway.' The acquisition of the four Kleven yards has been a success for Kvaerner. 'These yards already had good management and a good reputation in the market,' explained Mr Tonseth. 'With our resources, they were able to take on bigger engagements than they otherwise could have managed, because of their fairly limited financial flexibility. These yards are regarded among the world's best when it comes to building chemical carriers and reefers.' The acquisition of Masa-Yards has also been a success. The two yards, in Aabo and Helsinki, are among the most technologically advanced in the world, and came equipped with strong leadership and expertise. It also helped the yards' competitiveness when Finland floated the domestic currency in 1992, resulting in a devaluation of the markka. This underpinned the yards' bid to win a substantial contract last year  - in competition with Japanese and Korean yards - to build four LNG carriers for the Abu Dhabi National oil company. 'The Masa-Yards have a proud history, and were basically good yards which needed a willing shareholder to help them realise their potential. They have done outstanding work and this has become a successful marriage,' Mr Tonseth said. Last year, Kvaerner acquired Warnow Werft, in Rostock, in eastern Germany for a symbolic sum and a pledge to modernise the yard which is about 20 per cent complete. While it is too early to judge whether Warnow has been a successful acquisition, it did achieve satisfactory results in 1993, and operations exceeded expectations. 'Our motivation to acquire Warnow was not specifically with shipbuilding in mind, but for Kvaerner to secure a major industrial engagement in Germany,' explained Mr Tonseth. 'In retrospect, I would say that we have fulfiled expectations relating to the yard, which has advanced significantly since we became involved.' Kvaerner's next objective for is to establish a bridgehead in China. The group is currently seeking to negotiate a joint venture with the Chinese in the Dalian New Shipyard. 'If China is a waiting game, there is no urgency on our part,' said Mr Tonseth.</p>

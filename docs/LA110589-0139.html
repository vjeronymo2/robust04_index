			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A 'ROOKIE,' ROBINSON, BEATS LAKERS;  </P> <P> SPURS: EX-MIDSHIPMAN SCORES 23 POINTS AND GRABS 17 REBOUNDS IN HIS NBA DEBUT AS  SAN ANTONIO WINS, 106-98, TO EVEN L.A.'S RECORD AT 1-1.  </P> <P> They are claiming here that David Robinson, the Spur of the moment and the  franchise's future, is a rookie and, as such, mostly unaware of the demands of  NBA play. Magic Johnson does not believe it, not after what he saw Saturday  night.  </P> <P> "It's hard to say he's a rookie," Johnson said. "He's a man already, you know.  Some guys just aren't ever rookies."  </P> <P> San Antonio's celebrated 7-foot-1 center, finally making his professional debut  after a two-year naval commitment, was more than just eager to start his  career. That was obvious by the way he played. Robinson, the first overall  selection in the 1987 draft, had 23 points and 17 rebounds to help the Spurs  score a 106-98 victory over the Lakers before 15,868 fans at Hemisfair Arena.  </P> <P> Robinson did not disappoint those who already have anointed him as the NBA's  next great center. He is menacing and confident, casting a looming presence in  the middle, and has all the skills to match his demeanor.  </P> <P> The funny thing is, Robinson said he does not feel as if he's a rookie, either.  Spending two years shuffling papers, or whatever his naval commission involved,  apparently gave him a lot of time to prepare mentally for this night.  </P> <P> "I feel like I've been around forever," Robinson said. "I definitely don't  think of myself as a rookie. I've got a lot of confidence in what I can do. I  don't get nervous or anything. It was good just to kind of get it over with."  </P> <P> The Lakers, who were outplayed in almost every aspect of the game but still  avoided being blown out one night after beating Dallas, could relate to that  emotion. Suitably impressed, they seemed relieved that they only have to face  Robinson and the Spurs three more times in the regular season.  </P> <P> "(Robinson) is simply a great player," said Laker Coach Pat Riley, more  impressed by the Spurs than disturbed by the Lakers' play. "He's a presence,  offensively -- running, getting the second shots. They truly have a significant  center."  </P> <P> This is not all the Spurs have, however, which is sobering news to the rest of  the Western Conference. As impressive as Robinson was, one thing he cannot do  is win games single-handedly. Saturday, he did not have to.  </P> <P> Forward Terry Cummings, the former Milwaukee Buck, had 22 points and 12  rebounds; small forward Sean Elliott, a true rookie, had 16 points in his pro  debut, and former Philadelphia 76er point guard Maurice Cheeks added 14 points  and was a steadying influence on offense.  </P> <P> With Robinson, the erstwhile midshipman, in the middle and a flotilla of talent  for a convoy, the Spurs figure to be a threat in the Western Conference.  Saturday, they dominated a Laker team playing its second road game in as many  nights but not showing any ill effects.  </P> <P> The Spurs, taller and -- on this night, at least -- quicker than the Lakers,  simply beat them. San Antonio outrebounded the Lakers, 58-39; forced the Lakers  out of their offense and into a succession of perimeter shots, and had a 58-30  edge in inside scoring.  </P> <P> It might have been just a bad night for the Lakers and a good one for the  Spurs. After all, San Antonio beat the Lakers by 15 points in their opener last  season, then won only 20 more games all season.  </P> <P> This, however, is a drastically revamped and replenished Spur lineup. Cummings,  Elliott and Cheeks are all new, but the franchise-altering addition was  Robinson.  </P> <P> He scored his -- and the Spurs' -- first basket 2:02 into the game with a  savage reverse slam dunk off a pass from Cummings. More dunks and low-post  moves and converted free throws followed as Robinson easily handled adversaries  Mychal Thompson, Vlade Divac or any other Laker who tried to help.  </P> <P> Seven of Robinson's 17 rebounds were on the offensive end, as the Spurs had as  much as a 13-point fourth-quarter lead with such rebounding aggressiveness.  </P> <P> Robinson's defense, which he calls a weakness, helped keep the Lakers out of  the low post -- not that Robinson wasn't challenged. Most of the time, he did  not back down.  </P> <P> "Defensively, I'm not where I want to be," Robinson said. "I haven't blocked  shots the way I'm capable of, but it'll come along."  </P> <P> Robinson had only one blocked shot Saturday, but it was significant.  </P> <P> It came with 1:56 left in the third quarter during a 9-0 Laker run that cut the  Spurs' lead to 72-70. Cummings had missed a jump shot, and the Lakers initiated  a fast break. Byron Scott beat his defender and headed in for the layup.  Robinson was waiting and swatted the ball away. The Lakers never got that close  to catching the Spurs again.  </P> <P> "They were driving in, and I had to make sure they didn't get through (without  being punished)," Robinson said. "I think we earned the Lakers' respect tonight  with our defense."  </P> <P> This being only the second game of a long season, Riley praised his team's  effort and defensive play, but not much else.  </P> <P> The Lakers shot only 38.4%. They received only nine points from the bench,  Michael Cooper making two of 10 shots. They also had a combined total of 16  points and 10 rebounds from Thompson and power forward A.C. Green. The scoring  load was limited to James Worthy, who had 25 points, and Johnson and Scott,  each of whom had 24.  </P> <P> "They flattened our offense out with their pressure," Riley said. "Plus, we  didn't shoot well and got hammered on the boards. Our running game was  nonexistent. Running comes off rebounding, and their speed also neutralized our  running. We need five guys rebounding all the time. We know that."  </P> <P> The Spurs also know that a season-opening victory over the Lakers does not  assure subsequent success. Robinson was not around last season when the Spurs  beat the Lakers in the opener, but he kept tabs.  </P> <P> "I know that," Robinson said, laughing. "It was kind of one of those feelings,  like I don't know whether we should win this one because of last year. But no,  of course, we want to win 'em all."  </P></p>

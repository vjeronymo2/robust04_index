			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Elf sell-off three times subscribed The privatisation issue of Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group which is France's largest industrial company, attracted more than 3m individual investors and was three times subscribed, Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister announced yesterday. He described the sale of Elf shares as 'a popular success'. The strong level of demand for the issue, the largest in the government's programme to sell 21 publicly-owned groups, would result in a full clawback of shares from institutional investors, he added. Under terms of the issue, the 27m shares allocated for institutional investors can be reduced by 20 per cent to satisfy demand from individuals, who were originally allocated 33m shares. Proceeds of the sale of most of the government's 51 per cent stake in the oil group are expected to be FFr35bn (Pounds 4bn). 'The Elf sale shows there is still strong demand in the French market,' said an industry analyst in Paris. He said the level of interest in the privatisation issues partly reflected the pricing - Elf shares were offered at FFr385 compared with a market price of FFr415 at yesterday's close. First privatisation candidates are also among the most attractive in the state sector. The issue of Elf shares comes against a background of falling profits. In 1993, the group saw net profits fall to FFr1.1bn from FFr6.2bn. Mr Philippe Jaffre, who took over as chairman last August, has outlined a strategy of cost-cutting and tighter control over investments. The government will retain about 13 per cent of the company's shares through Erap, the state holding company, and will hold a golden share which gives it veto rights in certain areas of decision-making. A hard core of stable investors, which includes several of France's largest industrial and financial groups, will hold a combined 10 per cent of Elf's shares, which will also protect the company from predators.

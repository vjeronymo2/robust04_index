			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Rates eased The French and Spanish authorities took their cue from the Bundesbank yesterday to cut their interest rates by a quarter of a point, writes Rachel Johnson. The French cut their intervention rate by 25 basis points to 6.2 per cent, while the Spanish central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by the same amount to 9 per cent at its regular seven to twelve day repurchase tender. Both moves followed the Bundesbank's clearing of the decks for lower European interest rates with its 25 basis-point cut in the repo rate to 6 per cent on Thursday. The Bundesbank said the rate would not change until January 5, taking the steam out of market speculation of a cut on December 16. The unexpected aspect of the French move was timing. The Bank of France announced the rate for its repurchase tender yesterday, days before it takes place on Monday. In London, the French franc rose to close at FFr3.437 against the D-Mark, after a previous FFr3.446. Currencies which have had their interest rates cut over the past couple of days rose against the D-Mark. This follows the pattern in European currencies since the summer crisis in the exchange rate mechanism: investors have been favouring currencies with better growth prospects rather than those with the highest interest rates. The Spanish peseta was the latest to flout conventional wisdom by rallying against the D-Mark after the  1/4 point cut in its money rate. The peseta set a Pta82.74 low after the rate cut news but closed higher in London at Pta82.26 compared with the previous close of Pta82.37. The dollar rose against the D-Mark on the back of encouraging US payroll data but its rise was not sustained for long. Figures from the US Labour Department showed a rise of 208,000 in non-farm payrolls in November, with the unemployment rate at 6.4 per cent, better than analysts' expectations of 170,000 and 6.7 per cent respectively. Sterling rallied against the dollar and the D-Mark, gaining over a pfennig on the German currency and around a cent on the dollar in late European trading. Rate cuts in France and Spain helped underpin the pound, as did the fizzling-out of the dollar's rise very soon after the US data had been released. Investor interest in UK government bonds and shares helped boost the pound. In London, sterling closed at DM2.5650, after a previous DM2.5525, and against the dollar it finished at Dollars 1.4905, after a previous Dollars 1.4825. On the UK money markets, expectations of a further cut in interest rates were only modestly reflected in the three-month interbank rate which finished at around 5 9/32 , unchanged on its previous close. But the December short sterling contract closed around 6 basis points higher at 94.70 amid continuing high expectations for further monetary easing. France's decision to cut lending rates served to strengthened optimism among money market dealers that Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget opened the way for a sustained, lower level of interest rates. In the morning the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 2.15bn. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 2.3bn. This was removed in afternoon operations and no late assistance was offered. German call money eased in a liquid market, encouraged by the Bundesbank's decision on Thursday to lower its repo rate. Cash was on offer as banks, in anticipation of cheaper money, unloaded liquidity which they had obtained from the Bundesbank at the former rate of 6.25 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS;  </P> <P> IT'S THAT TIME;  </P> <P> CLOCK-SHOP OWNERS SAY SATURDAY WOULD BE A MAJOR SETBACK IF THEY HAD TO ADJUST  THEIR PIECES.  </P> <P> Here's the first of probably many reminders: Before going to bed Saturday, set  the clocks back for the resumption of Pacific Standard Time.  </P> <P> Sure it's a hassle, but imagine owning a clock shop.  </P> <P> An informal survey of local clock-store owners revealed that they don't reset  their merchandise.  </P> <P> "I just change one clock in the store -- for myself," said Kingo Uchida, owner  of the Time Shop in Port Hueneme. "If I changed all of them, I'd have to change  20 to 30 clocks and then 40 to 50 wristwatches."  </P> <P> We recently received a letter from the Moorpark Woman's Fortnightly Club  describing what the group is all about. We know now that the club is 85 years  old and that members are involved with the arts, conservation, education and  other social issues.  </P> <P> We also know the organization is "nonprofit, nonpolitical, nondenominational  and, of course, nonracist."  </P> <P> That's a good thing. Racists traditionally make poor community service leaders.  </P> <P> Like teacher, like student, and vice versa.  </P> <P> John Solem, a California Lutheran University art instructor, mand Jerry Sawitz,  a student of his in the early 1970s, will show their artwork together in a  ceramic show Saturday and Sunday at Images West Galleries in Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> "John was what all the students wanted to be," said Sawitz, now an art  instructor at Thousand Oaks High School. "I was told from an early age that if  you're an artist, you're going to starve. Then I went to college and here's  this instructor doing well financially."  </P> <P> It was eventually the student who got the teacher to work in ceramics. Until  about three years ago Solem had been involved solely with printing and  painting. "Call it a midlife crisis. I just got burned out. I thought to really  move ahead I'd start with something I didn't know anything about."  </P> <P> Historical note in honor of the recently concluded Major League baseball  season:  </P> <P> The first baseball team in Ventura County, the Ventura Baseball Club, was  organized 117 years ago last week. Just 35 days after the nine men officially  became a team, they went out and played their first game against an assorted  group of Ventura citizens.  </P> <P> Final score: Baseball Club 56, Citizens 17.

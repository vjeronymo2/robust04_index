			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Relocation 'not hit' by tax changes There is no evidence that employers are cutting relocation as a result of tax changes, the Confederation of British Industry and accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young said yesterday. Relocation expenses and benefits are now subject to a cap of Pounds 8,000, there are strict new time limits, and the Inland Revenue lays down strict reporting requirements. The CBI survey said that employers who spend between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 25,000 per person on relocation within the UK are finding new ways of containing costs. However, nearly half the 577 respondents either have no system or an inadequate system for tracking and reporting relocation expenses.</p>

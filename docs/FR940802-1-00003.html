			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's staff has recommended revisions to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current ASTM warning labels, including a warning label to tell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers to block stairway openings, rather than to tell them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> never to use walkers near stairs. The staff also suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the stair warning label be redesigned according to the ANSI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Z535.4&hyph;1991 Standard for Product Safety Signs and Labels. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the staff suggested that the ASTM baby walker standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state specifically several options of where the stair warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label should be placed to assure that it is conspicuous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the Commission's staff continued to monitor data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted from hospital emergency rooms through the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electronic Injury Surveillance System (``NEISS''), it became  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apparent that falls down stairs were a major cause of injuries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with baby walkers. While the staff was considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what action to recommend for this hazard, the Commission was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioned, in August of 1992, to ban wheeled baby walkers. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioners were the Consumer Federation of America (``CFA''), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Academy of Pediatrics, the Washington Chapter of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Safe Kids Campaign,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Consumers Union. The petition asked that the Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> declare baby walkers to be a mechanical hazard under the FHSA. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in section G of this notice, such a declaration would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ban the product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the available information on deaths and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuries associated with walkers, and other available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, the Commission unanimously voted to deny the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition on April 15, 1993. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The petition was denied because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available information did not establish a reasonable probability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Commission would be able to make the necessary statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> findings if a rulemaking proceeding were commenced at that time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It appeared that several potential design modifications to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing baby walkers were feasible to address the major hazard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario with walkers_that of falls down stairs. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications included a device without wheels with a treadmill  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to simulate walking, a walker with a ``wheel-stop'' mechanism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (which would resist motion of the walker if a wheel or feeler  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> went over the edge of a step), or a walker that is too wide to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fit through most door openings at the top of stairs. Given these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible alternatives to a total ban, the Commission could not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclude that it would likely be able to make the requisite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory finding that the requested total ban was the least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdensome alternative that would adequately reduce the risks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from baby walkers. In addition, not enough was known about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs and benefits of a total ban to conclude that the Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would likely be able to make the statutory findings that the ban  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was reasonably necessary to reduce an unreasonable risk of injury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that the benefits of the ban would bear a reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship to its costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> At that time, the Commission consisted of Chairman Jacqueline Jones-Smith, Commissioner Mary Sheila Gall, and Commissioner Carol Dawson.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the Commission denied the petition for a total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ban, at the same time it directed the staff to develop a proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project that would produce recommendations to address the hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with baby walkers. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Shortly thereafter, the Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved a project to determine the feasibility of developing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard to effectively reduce the risk of injury associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baby walkers, particularly the risk of falling down stairs. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project included a special study of emergency-room-treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuries related to walkers that were reported through NEISS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This data-gathering activity is discussed in section D of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission voted 2&hyph;1 to develop this project, with Commissioner Carol Dawson dissenting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During fiscal year 1993, the Commission's Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance and Enforcement conducted a field program to assess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the compliance level of certain juvenile products with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandatory small parts regulations (Juvenile Products Small Parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance Survey, FPC 93&hyph;010). Baby walkers were one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products included in the survey. As part of the survey, baby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> walkers were also screened for compliance with the mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements regarding scissoring, shearing, and pinching (16 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1500.86(a)(4)), and for conformance with the warning label  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in the voluntary standard (ASTM F977&hyph;89). The survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered 74 major juvenile product manufacturers or importers that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were randomly selected for inspection. Eleven of these firms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured or imported baby walkers. Thirty-four styles of baby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> walkers were screened. All walkers complied with the mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements regarding scissoring, shearing, and pinching, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all but two styles of one manufacturer conformed with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntary labeling requirements. This manufacturer agreed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label its current inventory and future production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A status report on the baby walker project was submitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Commission in June 1994. After considering the status report,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Commission decided to commence a rulemaking proceeding by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publishing this ANPR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. The Product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The products that are the subject of this proceeding are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baby walkers, as described in section A of this notice. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission's staff does not expect this proceeding to result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional features to prevent falls down stairs for stationary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> walkers and other walkers which a young child cannot move.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, performance requirements may have to be developed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine which walkers have the requisite degree of immobility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most traditional walkers range in price from $25 to $60,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the average price about $32. The Commission's staff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates that there were approximately 4 million new and used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> walkers in use in the U.S. in 1991. Consumers spend about $115  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million per year on baby walkers. This represents sales of at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least 3 million units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Staff has conducted a number of interviews of caregivers in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connection with the ongoing baby walker project. Caregivers were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asked to evaluate the most useful functions of walkers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Caregivers believed most often that the walker, ``Keeps the child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> happy or quiet,'' ``Helps the child exercise,'' ``Gives the child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> freedom and independence,'' and ``Is a place to put the child while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the caregiver is occupied.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

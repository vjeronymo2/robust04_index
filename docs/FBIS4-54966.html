			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova </F> by Lubo Rabay; place and date not given: "Not Only Macroeconomic  Connections"]    [Text] What is our true position in relation to the  large international financial institutions such as the IMF and  the World Bank? We discussed the changes in our approach to  these institutions, and in their approach to us, with Deputy  Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova.    [Rabay] Has devaluation under certain circumstances ever  been considered?    [Schmognerova] No.    [Rabay] Even if it had been considered, you would hardly be  likely to admit it. Let us therefore formulate the question the  other way around: What will save us from devaluation at a time  when we talk about the need for financial balance?    [Schmognerova] The IMF does not discuss these issues with  the government but with the National Bank. Of course, we, too,  would know about it.    [Rabay] At a news conference following your return from  Washington you said that the IMF's position in relation to the  Eastern European countries is becoming more flexible. In which  way?    [Schmognerova] What I had in mind was that they are now  incorporating the building of a social safety net into their  program so as not to jeopardize the reforms through a  deterioration in the position of the weaker social strata, which  might provoke unrest....    [Rabay] This new approach thus has a political rather than  an economic dimension....    [Schmognerova] The IMF focuses mainly on the macroeconomic  balance. My critical objection to this was that it is necessary  to see the broader connections of reforms.    [Rabay] Could you be more specific about how their position  is more flexible today?    [Schmognerova] For example, until recently, they had not  been pushing for the building of a social safety net. Now it is  also possible to cooperate to a greater extent with the World  Bank in structural changes to the economy. If measures taken in  fiscal and monetary policy, which can be implemented fairly  quickly, are not supplemented with measures in the real sphere,  that is, at the company level, the effect from the attained  financial balance disappears very quickly and even tougher  monetary measures will have to follow.    [Rabay] I think that we have already been able to convince  ourselves of the truth of this statement. As regards the World  Bank, we know that, when promising assistance, it demands from  the other side a clear setting of priorities. Are we able to  set them today, or are we going to subordinate ourselves to  whatever life will bring?    [Schmognerova] Our problem is not that we did not formulate  our basic priorities but that we have not been able to implement  them. Even the preceding government subscribed to  transformation and privatization. In the Memorandum on Economic  Policy, for example, it pledged to liberalize energy prices, but  it was not able to push it through. Privatization ground to a  halt. The law on bankruptcies preserved in many enterprises the  pretransformation situation because only the article of the law  permitting the suspension of bankruptcy proceedings was used.  In short, all kinds of things had been prepared but little was  actually done.    [Rabay] Are you suggesting that the present Slovak  Government's more active approach, which you have repeatedly  stressed on other occasions, actually means that the previous  government's policy is being shifted into the phase of  implementation?    [Schmognerova] We are realists, we know that only five  months are ahead of us. At any rate, we would like to set this  phase in motion.    [Rabay] Are you thinking of privatization?    [Schmognerova] Not only privatization. We would also like  to speed up the transformation of the social sphere and start  very energetically tackling also the financial situation in the  company sphere and in commercial banks. This is a long-term  process but it needs to be speeded up....    [Rabay] Is this a signal that bankruptcies will start? Is  there some kind of a list of companies that are earmarked for  bankruptcy?    [Schmognerova] There is a list at the Ministry of Economy.  Of course, it will not be applied mechanically. Especially  with respect to enterprises of regional significance with great  impact on the social sphere, bankruptcies must be preceded by  measures providing security for the people laid off. The World  Bank's assistance could be significant precisely in this regard.    [Rabay] Do you think that foreign investors' interest in  Slovakia will increase during this government's term of office?    [Schmognerova] Measures such as tax relief do not seem to me  to matter all that much in this respect. Foreign investors are  interested chiefly in political stability, which, it seems, we  have succeeded in improving, as foreign reactions show. As  regards specific steps, we are expecting the arrival soon of a  mission of potential U.S. investors....    [Rabay] A large-scale mission of Canadian financiers and  businessmen pursuing a similar aim was to take place a few days  ago. Why did it not materialize?    [Schmognerova] It had not been well prepared on the Canadian  side, that is, on the part of Canadian Slovaks. With regard to  conditions for foreign investors, we want to concentrate  particularly on eliminating administrative obstacles to their  participation in privatization.    [Rabay] But is coupon privatization not one such obstacle?  Three years passed before the companies privatized in this way  in the first wave could proceed to their actual transformation  and behave as independent entities....    [Schmognerova] What we need most badly today is a real  change in the conduct of companies.</p>

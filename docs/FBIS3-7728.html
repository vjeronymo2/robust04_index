			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Veronika Seyr from Skopje] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Greek punitive blockade  is not only causing serious economic damage in Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], a country that  has been strangled by Yugoslavia's disintegration, the wars in  Croatia and Bosnia, and the UN embargo against Serbia. The  economic situation is desperate and the political consequences  are unpredictable, says Petrus Stefanov, economics minister in  Skopje.    [Begin Stefanov recording, in Macedonian with superimposed  translation into German] The blockade is seriously endangering  our economy, but it also affects the overall political  situation. It is a direct attack on the stability of the whole  region. [end recording]    The nationalist opposition in Macedonia sees all its fears  confirmed. Ljupco Georgijevksi from the Internal Macedonian  Revolutionary Organization says:    [Begin Georgijevski recording, in Macedonian with  superimposed translation into German] The decision of the Greek  Government has not surprised me very much. It is the logical  consequence of the Greek policies of the past three years. I  would not be surprised either if Athens were to resort to  military means. This is a cold war against Macedonia, a cold  war which is aggravating the conflicts in the whole of the  Balkans and also has consequences for Europe. Accordingly, we  deplore that the European Community is not doing enough. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

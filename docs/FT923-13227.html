			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Department tests contracting-out THE FEASIBILITY of contracting out jobs at several divisions of the Department of Employment, including Acas, the arbitration, conciliation and advisory service, is to be tested by the government. The department said that market testing to evaluate Acas, the information division, parts of the research and evaluation division and activities in the Health and Safety Commission will begin later this year. Other divisions are being shortlisted for contracting-out evaluation. Jobs will be evaluated against criteria including cost-effectiveness and the quality of provision compared with private-sector providers. The department formally denied that a shortlist had already been drawn up. It said: 'In line with other government departments we have been looking at areas of activity to market test. What aspects we will look at have yet to be decided.' The contracting out of jobs at the centre of the government machine is part of a drive to put much of the Civil Service work out to competitive tender. A white paper published last November suggested that 'market testing' could save as much as 25 per cent of the Pounds 20bn central government costs. All government departments are currently drawing up lists of activities they could put out to tender. Last month it was disclosed that the Inland Revenue was contracting out work to Manpower for secretarial and typing work.</p>

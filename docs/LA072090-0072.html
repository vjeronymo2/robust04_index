			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Ballot-Stuffing: Cincinnati financier Carl H. Lindner Jr. skewed results of a  USA Today call-in poll to favor real estate mogul Donald Trump, the newspaper  said Thursday. The June poll showed that 5,640 of 7,802 calls came from two  phone numbers at a subsidiary of Lindner's American Financial Corp. A  spokeswoman for Lindner said Lindner admires Trump's "entrepreneurial spirit."  </P> <P> House Report: Lindy Boggs reportedly will not seek reelection to her New  Orleans congressional seat. She has been under increasing strain because of the  cancer of her elder daughter, Barbara Sigmund, friends of the family say. The  daughter is mayor of Princeton, N.J. Boggs, 74, was expected to announce her  decision today. Boggs won a special election in March, 1973, to succeed her  husband, Hale Boggs, the powerful House majority leader whose plane disappeared  over Alaska six months earlier.  </P> <P> Whaddya Bid?: Personal possessions of former billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt --  including a ranch, porcelain art figures and a popcorn popper -- will be  auctioned Saturday. Hunt and brother William Herbert Hunt, who sought  bankruptcy protection when their silver fortune collapsed a decade ago, were  ordered to sell the goods to pay creditors. Trustee Carter Pate in Westlake,  Tex., called the auction "distasteful for all parties involved."  </P> <P> Fun at Last: Gymnastics is not the same these days for Olympic gold medalist  Mary Lou Retton, 22. "Now I perform, I don't compete, and that makes a real  difference," said Retton, who will be married in December. In Los Angeles, she  won a gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in the all-around competition, the  first ever for an American woman gymnast. Now she performs six to eight times a  year and travels as a motivational speaker. "When we were practicing for the  Olympics, we spent eight hours a day in the gym," she said in New Orleans. "We  were too tired to do anything else."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hideo Seki, professor, Ryutsu Kagaku Daigaku: </F> "NTT Begins Preparing for Multimedia in Earnest"]    [Text] 123 Trillion Yen Economic Impact    Multimedia is no longer just a concept but is getting closer  to becoming a reality in Japan, too. At a time when the pace of  social innovation is said to have slowed to a sluggish crawl,  expectations are high that the multimedia field will spawn a  new, next-generation industry.    According to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications'  January report, Toward the Creation of a New Information  Industry, by the year 2010, the market that will be created  (in video programming, new television services, and terminal  units) as a result of optical fiber networks will generate no  less than an estimated 56 trillion yen. Related markets  (including existing markets for terminal equipment and software)  will grow to 67 trillion yen, bringing the total by the year  2010 to 123 trillion yen. Optical fiber networks will also  create new jobs for an estimated 2.4 million workers, to account  for about 3.6 percent of Japan's workforce, which is expected to  reach 27 million by 2010.    But will multimedia really take root in Japan?    On 12 January [1994], Nippon Telegraph and Telephone  Corporation president, Masashi Kojima, announced "NTT's Basic  Ideas for the Multimedia Age."    The report touched on the following four points, among  others: 1) in February 1994, NTT is expected to set up a  multimedia promotion desk; 2) in September 1994, it will  inaugurate a high-speed, wideband pilot backbone network (for  intracompany office automation [OA] transmissions); 3) from  1995, it will begin pilot multimedia services for general  residential use, and 4) it will attempt to lower the cost for  customers wanting to access optical fiber networks.    The advent of a multimedia society, though often discussed,  is an idea that belonged to the world of fantasy in the past.  But with the recent announcement of the basic idea by NTT,  Japan's core information communications enterprise, that fantasy  world seems capable of becoming reality. Related industries--in  communications, broadcasting, cable television, computer games,  home electronics, printed news, and publishing--are all keeping  their eyes on NTT's movements. Last October, when one of the  regional Bell telephone companies, Bell Atlantic, announced  plans to purchase the foremost cable television company,  Tele-Communications, Inc. [TCI], there was suddenly a multimedia  boom in the United States. NTT's announcement is comparable to  that of Bell Atlantic.    A closer look at NTT's multimedia plans would show that:    1. The role of its multimedia promotion desk is to a)  collect  data from all parts of the world about trends in information  communications, b) formulate NTT's basic strategies, c) set up a  pilot office to handle business matters, and d) establish an  intracompany multimedia organizational structure. Rather than  engage directly in business activities, the promotion desk will  be responsible for preparing the way for NTT to go into the  multimedia business.    2. The pilot high-speed, wideband backbone network will put  NTT's existing nationwide, intracompany OA net into routine,  practical use. NTT will set up new super-high-speed ATM  (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) switch nodes for existing optical  fiber networks at each of its bases (10 main cities, including  Tokyo and Osaka) and test high-volume, ultra-high-speed  transmissions of 2.4 gigabits (1 Gb = 1 billion bits) per second  and 10 gigabits per second, as well as develop network  applications and operational technology.    The backbone network will be linked to university research  institutes and hospitals, etc., and be used for LAN [local area  network] communications and trial transmissions of high-volume  data files. Also to be tested are multimedia communications with  user participation.    3. In pilot multimedia projects aimed at the average  household, a model residential area will be designated and  projects carried out in cooperation with cable television  companies (with NTT leasing lines to them) and information  providers [IP] (companies providing information services).  Optical fiber cables will be laid in the designated areas to  bring interactive television into households -- videos-on-demand  (where users can see programs or films of their choice anytime  they want), home-study courses, communication games  (electronically distributed computer games) -- through a merger  of cable television and the telephone.    4. NTT is aiming to lower the cost of optical access  circuits  into homes by the year 2000 or 2005 to levels comparable to  current copper wiring.  <H5>  Important Not To Lose Out to the United States </H5>   Behind NTT's decision to announce its multimedia plans at  this time, we see several factors: tie-ups have been occurring  between U.S. regional Bell companies and cable television  companies, the United States has been witnessing a multimedia  boom, and U.S. and British information communications companies  are expanding into a global operation. Moreover, the Ministry of  Posts and Telecommunications, the agency overseeing activities  in this area, has been favorable to the aggressive stance NTT is  taking in its field. By way of background, U.S. cable television  and telephone companies began investing in cable companies in  Japan in 1993. That was the year TCI tied up with Sumitomo  Corporation and invested in Suginami Cable Television. The  second-ranking cable company in the United States, Time Warner,  tied up with Itochu and invested in Cable Vision 21, a Fukuoka  city cable company. And Nynex Corporation, another regional Bell  company, tied up with Tomen Corporation and invested in a  Yokohama television station.    Even before these tie-ups, regional Bell companies -- US  West, Nynex, Southwestern Bell, and Pacific Telesis -- were  making their way into the British cable television field.    If NTT were to sit quietly by watching these developments,  there was a chance it would be left behind by multimedia trends  in other advanced countries. No doubt it was also moved to hurry  its multimedia strategy along from a sense that the multimedia  industry in the United States would overpower Japan's own  multimedia and cable industries.    NTT's plans with regard to multimedia as a business,  however,  end with its building fiber optic networks and providing circuit  services to users, those in the cable television field and IP's.  It is not, apparently, to enter into program production or the  field of terminal equipment. Although NTT announced in January  [1994] that it had invested in General Magic, a company that  boasts the best technology in communications software  development anywhere, the aim behind this tie-up is to build a  communications network that can easily be linked up to the next  generation of information terminals.    As multimedia gains in popularity, what form can we expect  to  see it take in Japan? First of all, we can probably expect to  see it catching on with businesses and in the office rather than  the average household. In the United States, cable television is  already widely subscribed to and the expectation is that it be  equally popular among businesses as in the home. This is not so  in Japan's case.    For business use, we can imagine, for example, several  enterprises, though located apart from each other, all watching  the same screen to come up with joint designs for machinery and  parts. The same with posters. Revisions and changes can be  worked out on the spot, even though the client and advertising  firm are in different locations. We can also expect video  conferencing to take place, bringing a greater sense of  proximity and immediacy to users than is now possible. Among its  many other possibilities, multimedia might also be used in  employee education and the introduction of new products within  companies.  <H5>  Japan's Technology Is Best in World </H5>   NTT's optical communications technology is the best in the  world. Though still in the experimental stage, during the autumn  of 1993, NTT succeeded in 100 gigabit per second optical  transmissions, thus setting a world record for speed. Neither  AT&amp;T nor BT (British Telecom) has as yet rivaled NTT in  carrying  out such ultra-high-speed transmissions.    When it tests its backbone network this September [1994]  with  optical transmissions of 2.4 gigabits per second and 10 gigabits  per second, NTT will again be setting a world speed record. Even  AT&amp;T is only now at the stage where it will start testing  transmissions this year of 2.4 gigabits per second.    In size, Japan has the second-largest communications and  terminal equipment markets in the world, and those in the  communications industry in other major countries, including the  world's leading manufacturers, are eager to enter these markets.  As indicated earlier, the process has already begun, with U.S.  cable companies entering Japan's cable business. Also occurring  more frequently are tie-ups between Japanese and U.S.  manufacturers for the development of next-generation information  terminals (to handle a mix of voice, data, and images at high  speeds). Cases in point include tie-ups between Apple Computer  and Sharp, Microsoft and Toshiba, and AT&amp;T and NEC. In the  area  of multimedia games, tie-ups have also occurred between  Microsoft and Sega Enterprises, Silicon Graphics and Nintendo,  and AT&amp;T and Matsushita.    NTT, however, seems to be working as a kind of deterrent for  foreign communications, cable companies, and manufacturers,  somewhat tempering the ambitions of foreign companies toward  Japan's markets. In addition to its strength in terms of  technical development and ability to create a national network,  it is a business enterprise backed by some 58 million telephone  subscribers. Parenthetically, U.S. and British communications  companies are said to have made a clean sweep on the European  continent, capturing its markets in data and mobile  communications.    Leading U.S. cable companies are very powerful. TCI and Time  Warner link their respective operating regions together by  satellite to broadcast programs throughout the United States.  TCI has 13 million subscribers nationwide. Moreover, wideband  cable networks are continuing to grow. One reason is that cable  companies, while having monopolistic management rights in their  regions, are not under fee restrictions. Satellite communication  is also growing. The national character, which seems to indicate  a liking for direct visual media, as testified by the world  preeminence of U.S. television and film industries, can be  considered a factor as well. Thus, as of the present, U.S.  software and know-how to create programs are far more advanced  than Japan's.    On the other hand, the United States is behind in  modernizing  (digitalizing, opticalizing) its regional telephone networks --  one of the aftereffects of AT&amp;T's breakup. Although the  Clinton  administration is pushing the idea of building an information  highway and regional Bell companies are putting their efforts  into modernizing their present communications networks, there  will not be enough wideband networks to be sufficient for  multimedia. Regional Bell companies do, however, have more funds  at their disposal than cable companies and are moving to buy up  the latter and acquire their wideband networks and through these  networks to go into multimedia services.    In Japan, the work of modernizing networks is progressing  not  only in the long-distance communications field, but in regional  communications as well. The conversion of subscriber circuits to  optical fiber in central Tokyo is slated for completion by 1995  and in the business districts of large cities like Tokyo, Osaka,  and Nagoya by 1997. Also slated for completion are optical fiber  networks for suburban residential areas by the year 2010 or 2015.    In contrast to the progress that is being made in  modernizing  its telephone networks, Japan is behind when it comes to  developing wideband cable television networks. The reason is  that cable companies until now have operated within local,  administrative units such as municipal districts. At the end of  fiscal 1992, of the 123 municipal cable companies (accounting  for 1.075 million subscriber households), only 24 (roughly 20  percent) were operating in the black (if we include  hard-to-reach reception areas, we are talking about some 56,437  cable television facilities and 8.34 million subscriber  households).    In December 1993, the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications released a report, Measures for  Developing CATV, with the aim of strengthening the  management base of cable television companies, stimulating  businesses to accommodate multimedia, and expanding wideband  networks. Such aims depend mainly on plans to 1) expand the  geographic scope of cable television enterprises; 2) move cable  television companies toward the communications business; 3) put  "model" pilot undertakings, like videos-on-demand, which  accommodate the merger of communications and broadcasting, into  operation; and 4) bring in the capital, technology and software  know-how of foreign enterprises to foster the spread of cable  television.    In addition to the cost of investing in circuits, the cable  television business has been troubled by the slow growth in  subscriber numbers due to a lack of interesting programs. Though  it has been possible for cable companies to gain approval to  enter the telecommunications business, there have been very few  examples of this happening because of the heavy burden of  investing in new equipment and facilities. Taking such  circumstances into account, the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications seems to have set out on a course of  nurturing the cable television industry, the goal being to  improve management by effecting economies of scale in  advertising, cable installation, the procurement of video  programs, etc.    In response to these new measures, two Nagoya cable  television companies, Cable Network and Central Cable  Television, announced their joint merger at the start of 1994.  With roughly 300,000 subscribers, the newly formed company will  have the largest customer base in Japan. In the future, there is  a strong possibility that cable television business interests  will move in the direction of operating multiple CATV stations,  which require large amounts of capital, in order to develop MSO  (multiple system operator) companies. In the long term, we can  expect to see more and more entries into the communications  field through MSO's and greater regional communications  competition. For cable television companies to begin offering  multimedia services, however, it seems that for awhile they will  have to rely on NTT circuits. It seems highly likely that it  will be in this form -- using NTT's circuits -- that cable  television companies will provide programs to their subscribers.  The conversion of NTT's trunk line to an optical fiber network  is already nearing completion.  <H5>  Putting Energy Into Developing Software </H5>   With Japan being so much behind the United States in the  software field, will there really be a multimedia boom in this  country? Considering the high educational level of the  Japanese, the emergence of all sorts of creative and original  programs and commercial messages (CM) on broadcast television,  and the extraordinary energy that has been thrown into applied  technology and the creation of commercial products in the past,  the development of programs and software to meet demands seems  quite possible. Again, with Japan's preeminence in optical  technology both as it relates to hardware and transmissions, the  construction of the next generation of optical fiber  communication networks is steadily moving ahead. Timely  investments and detailed studies of demand are important in  building optical fiber networks; however, when the important  factors are considered, it seems very likely that the future, as  seen in mid-range terms, will hold for Japan the flowering of  multimedia.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / BT3 beats BT2 on first-day trading THE NEWLY issued British Telecommunications shares yesterday closed at a premium considerably larger than in the last sale in 1991. On the first day of trading after the Pounds 5bn sale of the government's final 21.9 per cent stake, the shares closed at 168p - 8p above the 160p paid as a first instalment by institutional investors and 18p above the 150p paid by small shareholders. Last time on day one, the new shares gained only  1/2 p above the price paid by institutions. SG Warburg, the government's global co-ordinator, said small investors had made a good profit while public assets had not been sold on the cheap. But the merchant bank's role was called into question by some global managers. One complained that Warburg would receive 'the lion's share of commissions', as more than 40 per cent of institutional bids were handled by the UK merchant bank. The Labour party called for an inquiry into the Stock Exchange's management of the sale. Mr Jim Cousins, Labour's spokesman on telecommunications, voiced his concern over whether the BT price could be maintained in the longer term, when Warburg would not be able to stabilise the share price. Some analysts have said the government created an 'artificial market' by warning institutions they would not receive all the shares they applied for if they sold large amounts of BT stock before the sale. There was some surprise that the existing fully-paid share price rose by 5p to 413 1/2 p, instead of falling on the first day of trading as they had last time. In the short-term Warburg can exercise a 'green shoe' option - or stabilisation provision - by buying an additional 91.5m shares, equivalent to 7.5 per cent of the 1.2bn sold. Warburg said the price had risen yesterday without its intervention. More than 180m partly-paid shares were traded. The share shops reported fairly heavy buying by retail investors who had not received any shares. Mr Tony Vine-Lott, chief executive of Barclays Stockbrokers, said: 'Small shareholders who were disappointed in the allocation process have been topping up their holding.' UK institutional demand for the new shares was weak, mainly because they received a bigger allocation than their counterparts in the rest of the world.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Belyayev, deputy chairman of the </F> board of Kronbank, by DELOVOY MIR correspondent Marina Talskaya;  place and date not given: "What the Screen of Privatization Was  Concealing"]    [Text] The end of last year saw a smooth reduction in  the rate of growth of inflation and a stable exchange rate of  the ruble against the dollar. This made the January surge of  prices and the dizzying upswing in the exchange rate of the  dollar all the more surprising for many. Why did this happen?  How will events develop in the future? This was the topic of our  discussion with Mikhail Belyayev, deputy chairman of the board  of Kronbank.    [Talskaya] As specialists from the Ministry of Finance, the  Central Bank, and the government view it, the fourth quarter of  last year was marked by general financial stabilization. The  inflationary flareup that began literally in the initial days of  the new year prompts us to suspect that talk about the beginning  of recovery was somewhat premature. Why and how did the illusion  emerge, which many people came to believe in with relief?    [Belyayev] The arguments of those who heralded the beginning  of financial stabilization rested on four "pillars": reducing  the budget deficit as much as possible; retaining the dollar at  a relatively stable level compared to the ruble; allegedly  reducing the rate of inflation; and having a positive balance of  trade.    Even at that time it was clear to specialists that all of  this apparent success is merely a screen which conceals the old  ills of our economy, and that sooner or later they will make  their presence known again.    Let us begin with the first argument, this technical  parameter that needed to be "run by" the International Monetary  Fund. Unfortunately, the greatest possible reduction of the  budget deficit was not accomplished by increasing the  contractual segment of the budget out of the financial profits  of enterprises. Hardly anyone can dispute this, because the  numbers indicating a decline in production testify that the  slump has already exceeded, in terms of magnitude, the level of  America's Great Depression. The revenue side of the budget was  generated with taxes which they kept inventing and making  harsher. The taxes smothered production completely. Therefore,  such "recovery" in the budget cannot by any means be called  healthy. It is just like pouring ice on a sick person and  registering a reduction in his fever based on purely technical  attributes.    As far as inflation is concerned, the rate of growth of  which  fell to 15 percent in November, this happened solely for  trend-related reasons: At the end of the year economic  activities usually die down; nobody buys anything in particular  from anyone, and for this reason prices barely grow. However,  tell me whether it is possible to turn a one-time phenomenon,  whereby inflation merely took a slight "dip," into a trend and  proclaim this the beginning of a turnaround (given that for two  years the monthly rate of inflation came to 20-25 or even 30  percent)? January served up an unambiguous answer to this  question.    The exchange rate of the dollar against the ruble was indeed  quite stable. However, it was visible to the naked eye that the  exchange rate of the dollar was vigorously depressed. This was  accomplished through the fourth "pillar."    A positive balance of trade was attained, but not at all by  increasing commercial deliveries of machinery and equipment to  foreign markets. First, this happened as a result of reducing  import purchases, and second, due to the peculiar structure of  exports (precious metals and precious stones accounted for more  than one-half of them). We might say that even silverware was  put to use. Even energy sources account for 10-12 percent of our  exports. The foreign exchange generated in this manner was  passed around on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange and the  exchange rate of the dollar against the ruble was reined in.    [Talskaya] You mentioned a reduction in import purchases.  However, wherever you turn we have nothing but imports  here--both foodstuffs and manufactured goods.    [Belyayev] This is not quite it, these are dirt-cheap goods.  I meant reductions in such items as machinery, equipment, raw  materials. Instead of one machine tool you can buy a  steamship-load of pantyhose or a train-load of Snickers, which  is what is happening now. Besides, exotic imported consumer  goods are far from abundant in the entire country.    Therefore, we may say with certainty that all the machinery  was at work in order to present numbers in a favorable political  light in time for the December elections. This propaganda  technique had nothing to do with real economic analysis.    [Talskaya] So, January came....    [Belyayev] Economic laws are as objective as the laws of  physics, the laws of nature. They may be suppressed for a period  of time, but the time of artificially manipulating them is far  from infinite. Such manipulation is permissible and bears fruit  if the causes of unfavorable influence on the economy are  eliminated at the same time. However, if this does not happen,  the compressed spring shoots out all the more forcefully the  longer and more brutal the pressure applied to it. The magnitude  of the shot was also influenced by the political events of  December and the slamming of doors in January. Since  oversensitivity to all kinds of political flareups has already  been instilled here, the reverberations from the abrupt release  of the compressed spring, that is, economic parameters, were  stronger.    This was primarily reflected in inflation, which is logical.  At the beginning of the year economic activities picked up, and  all the old ills came to light--the crisis in production,  nonpayments, political agitation, the soaring exchange rate of  the dollar.    The growth of the exchange rate of the dollar against the  ruble was also predictable from the outset. We must grasp  clearly that our currency market is not at all a money market in  the classical interpretation but a hoarding-and-speculation  market. It is highly sensitive to political changes and prone to  panicky attitudes on account of any rumor. This is why at the  beginning of the year the dollar once again played its peculiar  Russian role of a vehicle for accumulation and hedging one's  savings.    Factors of a strictly trend-related nature also contributed  to the growth of the exchange rate. Perceiving that an upward  move in the exchange rate of the dollar was beginning, many  banks decided to play for a rise and committed all their spare  resources to purchasing dollars. In one week of unprecedented  upswing, the dollar appreciated 15 percent, that is, ensured a  profit margin for the banks that no banking operation can yield.    [Talskaya] If so, why did it subsequently fall?    [Belyayev] It could not fail to fall. Panic buying  catapulted  it upwards way beyond the natural mark, that is, the genuine  ratio at which transactions are effected. Besides, the play for  a rise by banks was no longer that careless, first, because  their resources are finite and they could not generate demand  endlessly; second, they began to be afraid of generating demand  in principle because they fully understood that the triumphant  climb of the exchange rate of the dollar would end soon and that  there was the risk of "taking a beating" in sales.    A fall in the exchange rate of the dollar was also caused by  active currency interventions by the Central Bank of Russia,  which has dumped about $1 billion from gold and currency  reserves on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange in order to  control panic.    However, we cannot by any means draw the conclusion that the  ruble has strengthened since the exchange rate of the dollar has  fallen. The ruble may only strengthen against stocks of  merchandise or against inflation if the latter is being reduced  as a result of actual economic operations rather than due to  trend-related factors. The ratio of the ruble to the dollar in  the present-day Russian market is speculative play, nothing  more. This should be clearly understood.    [Talskaya] The sacramental question: What should be done in  order to really strengthen the ruble?    [Belyayev] So far we have only been discussing the monetary  parameters of the economy. However, it should be understood that  real money is derived solely from real stocks of merchandise,  from the process of production. This is the foundation of a  market economy.    Of course, it is better when high-quality goods are produced  with great effectiveness. However, qualitative characteristics  of production are a secondary issue. If nothing at all is  produced, any and all economies or reforms are altogether out of  the question. Meanwhile, our reformers have so far introduced  only secondary and tertiary categories and attributes of the  market, whereas production has been destroyed and perished.    [Talskaya] Appeals on the need to normalize production have  now become a generality. How is this actually to be ensured?  What should the combination of production and financial policies  be?    [Belyayev] Taxes on production activities should definitely  be reduced. Even the volume of the budget deficit may be  sacrificed. This is not all that terrible. The budget deficit  does make an inflationary impact. However, if production of some  merchandise begins, its real value will counter the increase in  the money supply. These factors will balance each other out.    Production needs centralized and preferential credit. So  that  the credit will not sink into oblivion through incomprehensible  funds run by officials, we may take advantage of the experience  of the EEC. When providing financial assistance to developing  countries, the EEC also ran into the problem of the embezzlement  of credit at the local level. They brought in commercial banks.  First, a commercial bank already knows approximately who it can  provide for and how much; second, it will see that the credit is  paid back. Besides, it should also keep records on the targeted  use of credit: As it were, contracts with borrowers envision the  use of the funds received for specific types of activities.    Of course, even the EEC system for the distribution of  centralized credit does not eliminate the issue of bribes. Is  this not an issue at present, too? However, in that case there  will be at least some hope to get the production process off the  ground. If this process does not get underway, nothing at all  will.    This is all the more so because the process of the movement  of money--transferring it from one pocket to another from the  bottom up (as we have had in recent years)--is not endless in  the absence of the real movement of merchandise, either. At  present, the redistribution of profits from trading in pantyhose  and Snickers is nearing completion. There is nothing else to be  moved from the pockets of 90 percent of the population. Please  note that a large proportion of citizens no longer buy anything  except basic foodstuffs as they continue to balance at the  poverty-line level. Very rich people are buying, but the set of  goods they need is specific to them.    Therefore, even the appearance of the operation of the  economy produced by the movement of money will soon be  dispelled. An imitation of reformist actions no longer convinces  anyone. Since there is nowhere to retreat, we will apparently  have to engage in real economic activities.</p>

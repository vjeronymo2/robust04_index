			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-JOINT CHIEFS ON GULF CRISIS  </P> <P> Your editorial ("Bush Sends a Clear Signal to Baghdad," Dec. 1) posed the  question as to how Hussein can "negotiate a face-saving retreat from Kuwait and  avoid war." This is an equally vexing question for the Bush Administration,  which, like Hussein, has painted itself in a corner by insisting on complete  withdrawal before negotiations can begin.  </P> <P> What may be a face-saving retreat for both sides is this: Hussein withdraws all  his troops from Kuwait and allows the restoration of the Kuwait government, as  the U.N. resolutions demand. In exchange, Bush and the Security Council will  agree to an international conference to settle all issues in the Middle East,  including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the interim, a U.N. peacekeeping  force would replace the U.S. armed forces in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> If such a settlement could be negotiated, each side could claim victory. War  would be avoided.  </P> <P> ROBERT S. VOGEL  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / People: Head of Private Finance Unit The Treasury has a new mastermind for its efforts to attract private capital into the provision of public services. Richard Saunders has taken over as head of the private finance unit from Kingsley Jones who joins the team working on the department's fundamental expenditure review. Saunders, 42, has spent the past two years in Washington, where he was economic counsellor at the British embassy. His work there has included liaison with the administration and Congress on economic issues, banking and tax. Before that, he was Treasury press secretary between 1990 and 1992, seeing Norman Lamont through the deepening recession and the negotiations over European Monetary Union leading up to the Maastricht treaty. A graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, Saunders joined the civil service in 1974, initially with the old Civil Service Department. When it was abolished in 1981, he moved to the Treasury, where his posts have included a spell as private secretary to the permanent secretary, Sir Peter Middleton. He worked on the 1986 building societies reform and covered health in the public expenditure division during the government's national health service reforms. Saunders' new role involves liaising with Sir Alistair Morton's Private Finance Panel and its full-time team in identifying projects where private finance could play a part. His job will be to lift any obstacles blocking such projects, either in the Treasury or elsewhere in Whitehall. (See Leader)</p>

The plan shall include, at a minimum the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) procedures to be followed by employees who remain to perform critical ATCT operations before they evacuate; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) procedures to account for all employees after emergency evacuation has been completed; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) rescue and medical duties for those employees who are to perform them; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) names or job titles of persons or departments who can be contacted for further information or explanation of duties under the plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) This plan shall be posted in a place readily available to employees. A diagram of designated emergency egress routes shall be posted along the path of egress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Before implementing the emergency action plan, the employer shall designate and train a sufficient number of persons to assist in the safe and orderly emergency evacuation of employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The employer shall review the plan with each employee covered by the plan at the following times: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. initially when the plan is developed; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. whenever the employee's responsibilities or designated actions under the plan change; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. whenever the plan is changed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. The employer shall review with each employee upon initial assignment and annually thereafter those parts of the evacuation plan which the employee must know to protect the employee in the event of an emergency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Fire drills shall be held periodically. Fire drills shall be held often enough to ensure that each employee participates in at least one drill annually. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Since all personnel may not be able to leave their positions during a fire drill, employees who were not able to participate shall be briefed on the emergency evacuation route and instructed to use this route the next time they leave the facility in order to familiarize themselves with the exit route. Supervisors shall document employee briefings in employee records. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Ladders shall not be used during evacuation drills as their use during drills poses unnecessary risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Hard choices for Mr Clarke POSTERITY WILL judge Mr Lamont more kindly than did Sir Norman Fowler. It could hardly do otherwise. The question that matters, however, is how it will judge his bouncy, bluff successor, who announced only this week his desire to strengthen the 'real economy'. Will he be judged 'brilliant' three years from now, to be denigrated subsequently as another in a lengthy line of 'dash for growth' Tory chancellors? British postwar chancellors of the exchequer are either unpopular in office, because they have to clear up the mess made by their predecessor; or they are unpopular after leaving office, because they made the mess their predecessors must clear up. Mr Lamont can comfort himself with the thought that he is in the first category. He is so doubly. The ex-chancellor's predecessor but one, Nigel Lawson, presided over the economic expansion of the latter part of the 1980s. The ex-chancellor's immediate predecessor, John Major, decided to put sterling into the ERM at a central rate of DM2.95. The first bequest led to the subsequent recession. The second blocked off the escape route when it was desperately needed. Mr Lamont could do little but cope with the inevitable unpopularity. He was hapless rather than tragic, but hapless he certainly was. Despite the limited room for manoeuvre he enjoyed, Mr Lamont was even something of a reformer, notably over fiscal procedures. He will be remembered for the new top-down approach to the control of public spending; for the multi-stage Budget introduced in March; and for the unified Budget, first due in November this year. He will be noted also for designing a post-ERM framework for consolidating low inflation, which includes the 1-4 per cent inflation target, the monthly monetary report and the Bank of England's inflation report. Specious arguments Mr Clarke does, in short, inherit much of value from his now universally denigrated predecessor. It includes an opportunity for sustained growth. Unfortunately, his temptation will be to throw it away. If Mr Clarke is to recognise the dangers he faces and the opportunities he enjoys, he must first see through some of the specious arguments he is being offered. Some of those who blame the ERM for everything wrong with the economy fail to admit they have really been against the costs of lowering inflation. Some of those who say that monetary and fiscal policies must be targeted at real economic growth fail to say that they do not care about higher inflation. The first group was against lowering inflation. The second is against keeping it low. Neither approach is acceptable. The warning was properly given by Mr Eddie George, the next governor of the Bank of England, on the very day that Mr Lamont fired his missile at the occupants of the front benches. Sound money, said Mr George, 'is about jobs and investment; it is about living . . . standards; it is not just the abstract ideal of a crusty, academic profession'. Headless chickens Stopping inflation is painful. It is painful for those who bought houses in the belief that prices could only go up. It is painful for property investors. It is painful for the banks. It is painful for those who lose their jobs. To have paid so much for lower inflation was quite bad enough. To have to undergo the agony once more would be unforgiveable. It is hard to be optimistic, however, since success depends on the judgment of politicians subjected to the panics of a few hundred headless chickens behind them and the often unrealistic expectations of the millions of their masters in front. Policymaking is also going to be exceptionally difficult. The debt-encumbered recovery now under way has no postwar precedent. Experience elsewhere suggests further cuts in interest rates may well be needed. But how far can interest rates be cut and how much should fiscal policy be tightened to compensate? Nothing will be more difficult than the fiscal policy decisions. The least the chancellor can do is keep to existing spending targets. These are tight, allowing an increase of only about 2 per cent in real terms between this year and 1995-96. They will not be achieved without making tough decisions even in sensitive areas. So what does Mr Clarke mean when he says he did not come into politics to dismantle the welfare state? Is invalidity benefit sacrosanct? What about mortgage interest relief and other perks for the middle classes? And why is income tax to be left out of the fiscal equation? If the budget deficit needs to be tackled, those who earn most will have to contribute too. What Mr Clarke intended when he set sustained recovery as his aim will be shown by how he makes such choices. At each point, there will be both more prudent and riskier options. At each point, arguments will be made in either direction. A disastrous chancellorship is one in which every decision is taken in the riskier direction. Recovery will come. Mr Clarke must persuade his party to allow him to err towards caution.</p>

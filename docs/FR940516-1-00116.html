			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> W. Duration of Certificates of Conformity, Definition of Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Year, Annual Production Period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is considering adopting one of the following three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options for defining model year, annual production period, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duration of the certificate of conformity. Regardless of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option selected, EPA is also proposing in this notice that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be a prohibited act to introduce an uncertified small SI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine into commerce after August 1, 1996. Furthermore, it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be a prohibited act to introduce a specific model year engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into commerce prior to or after the model year for which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate of conformity was issued and in effect. EPA requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on each of these three alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Option 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA would incorporate the on-highway definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of model year, annual production period, and duration of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate of conformity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The model year would include January 1 of the calendar year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which it is designated and would not include a January 1 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any other calendar year. Thus, the maximum duration of a model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year would be one calendar year plus 364 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``annual production period'' for any specific model within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an engine family would begin either: (1) When such an engine was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first produced, or (2) on January 2 of the calendar year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preceding the year for which the model year was designated,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whichever date was later. The annual production period would end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either: (1) When the last engine was produced, or (2) on December  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31 of the calendar year for which the model year was named,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whichever date was sooner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A certificate of conformity would be issued to cover engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduced into commerce for a single model year. Under option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1, the 1997 model year certificate could cover production between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 2, 1996 and December 31, 1997, although engines regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under this proposal would be manufactured after August 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested parties may wish to consult OMS Advisory Circular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A/C No. 6B, issued December 31, 1987, which summarizes the on-highway treatment of model year, annual production period, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duration of the certificate of conformity. A copy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circular has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Option 2:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This option represents a variation of Option 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that the dates selected for the commencement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model year and the annual production period more closely parallel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the experience of the small engine industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under option 2, the model year would include August 1 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preceding calendar year for which it was designated and would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include an August 1 of any other calendar year. The maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duration of a model year would remain one calendar year plus 364  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``annual production period'' for a specific model within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an engine family would begin either: (1) When such an engine was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first produced, or (2) on August 2 of two calendar years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preceding the year for which the model year was designated,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whichever date was later. The annual production period would end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either: (1) When the last engine was produced, or (2) on July 31  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the calendar year for which the model year was named,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whichever date was sooner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The certificate of conformity would be issued to cover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production for a single model year. For example, the 1997 model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year could cover production between August 2, 1995 through July  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31, 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed extended coverage period described in options 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 2 for a certificate of conformity (that is, up to one year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plus 364 days) is primarily intended to allow flexibility in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production of new models. Under no circumstances should it be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpreted that existing models could ``skip'' yearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification by pulling ahead the production of every other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model year. While this situation, to our knowledge, has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred in the on-highway program in the past, a practice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producing small SI engines for a two year period would violate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress' intent of annual certification based upon an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> annual <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production period. EPA is not currently proposing rules for how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine when abuse has occurred since this has not been a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problem to date. However, manufacturers should note EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern in this area and should use normal yearly production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods for existing models.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Option 3:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this option, the certificate of conformity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be issued to cover production from August 1 of a given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar year through July 31 of the subsequent calendar year for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which it was issued. EPA would retain the model year concept  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in on-highway programs but would define it as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Model year  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the manufacturer's annual production period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which includes August 1 of a given calendar year through July 31  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the subsequent calendar year.'' Thus the maximum duration of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model year would be 365 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Environmental Benefit Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) have been set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for criteria pollutants which adversely affect human health,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vegetation, materials, and visibility. Concentrations of ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) are impacted by HC emissions and, to a lesser extent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of CO. Ambient concentrations of CO are, of course,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacted by CO emissions. EPA has determined that the standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set in this rule would reduce emissions of HC and CO and, despite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also increasing emissions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , help most areas come into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the NAAQS for ozone and, to a lesser extent, CO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following provides a summary of the emission reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected and the health effects of HC components, CO, and ozone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A discussion of the roles of HC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in ozone formation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also presented. The underlying analysis is described in greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detail in the draft RSD, a copy of which is in the public docket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPACE TELESCOPE LAUNCH DELAYED  </P> <P> The long-awaited launching of the Hubble Space Telescope will be delayed from  March to April because of a problem with one of the shuttle Discovery's solid  fuel booster rockets, NASA officials announced Friday.  </P> <P> The $1.7-billion telescope is expected to become astronomy's most significant  tool in expanding knowledge of the universe.  </P> <P> It will look seven times more deeply into space and detect objects one-fiftieth  as bright as those seen by the best ground-based observatory.  </P> <P> The space agency said shuttle managers decided to exchange one of the motor  segments on the right booster rocket because there was a question as to whether  a check was done properly. Assembly operations have advanced to the point where  the test cannot be repeated.  </P> <P> The launching was scheduled for March 26. Estimates of the delay range from 10  days to two weeks.  </P></p>

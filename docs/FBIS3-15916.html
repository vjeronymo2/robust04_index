Memorandum of  Accord Has Avoided Acute Political Crisis" -- first two  paragraphs are introduction]    [Text] Sergey Shakhray has unexpectedly become a key  figure in the disposition of political forces this spring. His  parliamentary speech in support of the amnesty has muddled up  quite a few people's cards.    Our talk took place in the new office of the minister for  nationalities affairs and regional policy on Krasnopresnenskaya  Embankment. Five months ago a hail of bullets flew through  these windows on the third story of the White House. Now they  look onto a peaceful view of the Moscow River.    [Ustyuzhanin] Sergey Mikhaylovich, a number of your former  kindred spirits have now turned on you with accusations of a  shameless act of betrayal.    [Shakhray] It is the same old story. The moral aspect was  left out of the debate about the amnesty altogether. It was  obvious to all that both sides were to blame for the events of  3-4 October last year, albeit to differing degrees. These  events were preceded by a creeping usurpation of power without  any formal violation of the Constitution by the Supreme Soviet.  The president cut this Gordian knot by formally violating the  Constitution. The result was the assault on City Hall and  "Ostankino" and the shoot-out at the White House. It was an  episode of civil war. The logic of civilian clashes does not  know of any precedents for identical punishment. First of all  the victors put the vanquished on trial, later the tables are  turned, and so on ad infinitum. And at every stage of this  process innocent people become casualties. There is only one  effective way to get out of strong-arm confrontation, and that  is through an act of reconciliation. And we have now proposed  one.    [Ustyuzhanin] Are you not oversimplifying things?    [Shakhray] To many people it is was clear that 1994 could  have become a year of civil war. The charge of confrontation  that had accumulated over recent years had become too powerful.  For a time we lifted this threat. But the amnesty act  relegated the "Russia's Choice" bloc to the political  wilderness. Hence the sharp reaction to the other parties'  peacemaking initiative.    [Ustyuzhanin] What in your view are the principal political  gains of the amnesty?    [Shakhray] The whole of society has won. I know the  reaction from the regions -- it is a sigh of relief. The heads  of administrations with whom I spoke recently are requesting  that we take further steps in this direction. The president,  government, parliament, and those who benefited by the amnesty  are all winners by this. The president and the Duma will  cooperate closely (surprisingly, this is happening at the  moment), passions will finally die down, and "Democratic  Russia's" censure will abate. It will become apparent that the  interests of the Duma and the president coincide, at least  tactically and temporarily. Some of the Duma deputies, who came  to the Duma with the aim of freeing the Lefortovo inmates, have  kept their promise and a potential hotbed of conflict has thus  been extinguished. Although their interests and those of the  released Lefortovo prisoners will probably diverge in the future.    [Ustyuzhanin] What makes you say this?    [Shakhray] New leaders have appeared within the Duma itself,  they do not want confrontation, it is important to them to  retain the image of initiators of civil reconciliation and to  accumulate political capital. The fact that Rutskoy and  Khasbulatov are free is also advantageous for the president.  The juridical and political bases of their bid for power have  now entirely vanished. Anyone may return to power, but only  through elections. Which is great! This in itself is a step  toward reconciliation. The main point is that the Memorandum of  Accord has become the valve which has let off steam from the  acute political crisis expected in April or May.    [Ustyuzhanin] Why in April or May, and what crisis are you  talking about?    [Shakhray] In society today we are currently witnessing a  struggle between three elites -- the Moscow elite, the regional  elite, and the sector elite. Moreover, the latter two elites  have begun to move closer together. For its part, the Moscow  elite has concentrated over 70 percent of the entire country's  banking capital in the capital's banks, and it has powerful  levers of influence on the authorities. All of these forces are  seeking a leader and middlemen to help the competing sides avoid  clashes. One way of letting off steam might have been a demand  for the president to "surrender" his premier and his cabinet.  The amnesty, however, has disrupted the already established  "combat alliances" and thrown their plans into disarray. The  amnesty has basically saved Chernomyrdin's skin.    [Ustyuzhanin] Sergey Mikhaylovich, judging by your analysis,  this summer we will witness universal brotherhood....    [Shakhray] There is still a long way to go before we reach  that stage. The country has gained a temporary breathing space,  a pause. This is the one thing we can thank the amnesty for.  But it is only a breathing space. Unless we exploit it, we  could see a repetition of the events of October. And then a new  figure would appear at the forefront of the political stage --  the man in shoulder boards. The establishment of order in the  country would then cost far more lives. We must do much more to  achieve brotherhood.    [Ustyuzhanin] What exactly?    [Shakhray] Right now orthodox Christians, Muslims, and all  other Russian faiths should hold funeral services for the dead.  We all need to beg forgiveness of the families of the killed  and wounded, to acknowledge that it is impossible to define who  is right and who is guilty by juridical methods. Our leaders  need to repent most of all. The package of documents adopted by  the Duma offers this opportunity for repentance and civil  reconciliation.    Right now it is important to give the new parliament the  chance to work at full throttle. The economy will suffocate  without laws. After all, there is virtually no time left for  the Duma to finish its work -- 22 months. It would be offensive  and shameful to waste these months on new political clashes.</p>

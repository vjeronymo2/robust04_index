			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE NFL DRAFT;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> BEATHARD HAS A 5 UP SLEEVE, BUT WHAT ELSE?  </P> <P> Bobby Beathard, the Chargers' general manager, finds himself in such an unusual  position today that he almost doesn't know how to act.  </P> <P> Beathard has a first-round pick in the NFL draft -- and likely will use it.  </P> <P> The last time he did that was in 1983, when he was the general manager of the  Washington Redskins. He selected cornerback Darrell Green with the final pick  of the round. This time, the pick is the fifth overall, a lofty position  Beathard never enjoyed with the Redskins.  </P> <P> "I've never been here before," Beathard said. "I'm not sure what to do."  </P> <P> That is one reason, Beathard said, that he is speaking so freely about the  available players. And he has made no secret about his interest in offensive  tackle Richmond Webb of Texas A&amp;M.  </P> <P> Webb appears to be what the Chargers need to help rebuild their offensive line.  At 6-feet-6, 290 pounds, he could step in and play immediately. Beathard has  said he clearly is the best offensive lineman in the draft.  </P> <P> "He is a tough guy to pass up," Beathard said.  </P> <P> Maybe Beathard is speaking this openly because the pick appears too good to be  true. But late-changing events could alter his plans.  </P> <P> Beathard has become all but convinced that Tampa Bay will select linebacker  Keith McCants of Alabama with the fourth pick. Combine that with a possible  late trade between New England and Seattle that would allow the Seahawks to  move up and take Miami defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy third, and the Chargers  could be looking at linebacker Junior Seau of USC and Oceanside High School.  </P> <P> Beathard might then take Seau, who could help at inside linebacker, and worry  about filling the offensive line needs later.  </P> <P> This, of course, is if the New York Jets do not upset the modified scenario by  taking someone other than running back Blair Thomas of Penn State with the  second choice.  </P> <P> "I really don't know what's going to happen," Beathard said.  </P> <P> He is not alone. The draft is a guessing man's game. And Beathard has a  reputation of being one of its shrewd players.  </P> <P> He has a history of being active and creative on draft day. Last-minute deals,  mid-round deals, trading a first-round choice for later picks, swapping a high  pick next year for a lower one this year, trading players for picks -- he can  conjure up just about anything.  </P> <P> But this year, he's saying it could get mighty boring around Charger  headquarters, especially if they hold onto their current picks. After the first  round, the Chargers do not have another choice until the third. They have three  picks there, the first of which is 57th overall, acquired from Tampa Bay in the  deal for running back Gary Anderson.  </P> <P> "It might be kind of a dull day," Beathard said. "It's a long time between the  fifth pick and the third round. Maybe something will happen, but right now, I  can't think of a way to make it happen."  </P> <P> But those who have watched Beathard doubt today will be any different than the  past.  </P> <P> "Don't worry, he'll do some trading," said Bruce Allen, a Phoenix-based agent  whose father is former Redskin Coach George Allen.  </P> <P> Beathard has been saying for weeks that he would like to trade his No. 1 pick  for a slot later in the first round, with the idea of picking up another choice  in the bargain. The Chargers would prefer that it be something in the second  round, where they are without a pick because of the trade with Chicago for  quarterback Jim McMahon.  </P> <P> But as the draft has drawn closer, Beathard has said he is beginning to accept  the fact that he might not be able to swing such a deal. Beathard lately has  labeled the chances of making it happen as "50-50" at best.  </P> <P> That could change quickly if any of the four teams ahead of the Chargers in the  first round do other than what Beathard expects. His dream might be to have  Kennedy left on the board when the Chargers pick. Several teams close behind  them have said that they like Kennedy, including Detroit, which has the seventh  pick, and Seattle (Nos. 8 and 10).  </P> <P> Beathard said he likes Kennedy, too, but might be willing to trade him for the  right price and a spot close enough to the top to take Webb -- if that is who  he really wants.  </P> <P> One other scenario could have the Chargers using a first-round choice to fill  what Beathard said is their other most glaring need -- cornerback.  </P> <P> The options there appear to be as limited as they are at offensive line.  Beathard said this is not a strong year for cornerbacks, either.  </P> <P> The best may be J.D. Williams of Fresno State, whose sprinter's speed is  attractive. But some scouts wonder if he has coverage ability to match. The  next best choice might be Ben Smith of Georgia. The Chargers worked Smith out  on Monday, but that might have been more as a contingency in case they move  well back into the first round.  </P> <P> Another backup plan could have the Chargers taking one of several other highly  regarded linebackers, including James Francis of Baylor and Chris Singleton of  Arizona State.  </P> <P> But Beathard has said these scenarios are unlikely, because he does not want to  trade back to further than the 10th pick overall.  </P> <P> And while attention might be focused on Round 1, the Chargers have plenty of  other business to take care of over the next two days.  </P> <P> They have 14 choices in the 12-round draft, including three selections in both  the third and seventh rounds.  </P> <P> Beathard has identified several other areas the team would like to address as  wide receiver, tight end and return specialist. About the only position  Beathard has said he would not draft would be a kicker.  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Rod Bernstine, the Chargers' first-round choice in 1987, has changed positions  again. A tight end as a rookie, an H-back last season, Bernstine has been moved  to running back, General Manager Bobby Beathard said. Beathard said that Coach  Dan Henning said he thought he could make more use of Bernstine as a runner.  Bernstine, who has missed part of each of his first three seasons because of  injuries -- the most serious of which required reconstructive knee surgery in  December 1988 -- was a fullback during his first two seasons at Texas A&amp;M.  Last season as an H-back, Bernstine gained 137 yards on 15 carries, an average  of 9.1 yards, before being injured in the fifth game against Denver and later  undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHARGER PICKS, THOSE THEY TRADED  </P> <P> Round, Pick: Acquired From, Sent To:  </P> <P> Rd. 1, Fifth Overall: Chargers retain their own 1990 pick  </P> <P> Rd. 2, 33rd Overall: To Chicago for QB Jim McMahon, Aug. 18, 1989  </P> <P> Rd. 3A, 57th Overall: From Tampa Bay for RB Gary Anderson, April 21, 1990  </P> <P> Rd. 3B, 60th Overall: Chargers retain their own 1990 pick  </P> <P> Rd. 3C, 67th Overall: From Indianapolis for OLB Chip Banks, Oct. 17, 1989  </P> <P> Rd. 4, 89th Overall: To Raiders for RB Napoleon McCallum, Aug. 11, 1988  </P> <P> Rd. 5, 116th Overall: To Dallas for RB Darrin Nelson, Oct. 17, 1989  </P> <P> Rd. 6, 145th Overall: Chargers retain their own 1990 pick  </P> <P> Rd. 7A, 172nd Overall: Chargers retain their own 1990 pick  </P> <P> Rd. 7B, 185th Overall: From Cleveland for RB Barry Redden, Sept. 3, 1989  </P> <P> Rd. 7C, 187th Overall: From Washington for P Ralf Mojsiejenko, Aug. 29, 1989  </P> <P> Rd. 7D, 193rd Overall: From San Francisco for WR Wes Chandler, June 2, 1988  </P> <P> Rd. 8, 201st Overall: Chargers retain their own 1990 pick  </P> <P> Rd. 9, 227th Overall: Chargers retain their own 1990 pick  </P> <P> Rd. 10, 256th Overall: Chargers retain their own 1990 pick  </P> <P> Rd. 11, 283rd Overall: Chargers retain their own 1990 pick  </P> <P> Rd. 12A, 311th Overall: To Indianapolis for CB Leonard Coleman, July 8, 1988  </P> <P> Rd. 12B, 326th Overall: From Washington for 1989 12th-round pick, April 24,  1989  </P></p>

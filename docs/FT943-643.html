			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at Sears with 38% rise Sears yesterday announced a 38 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits, confirming the recovery that began more than a year ago at the retailing group, which includes such names as Selfridges and Dolcis. For the six months to July 31 profits rose from Pounds 38.9m to Pounds 53.8m on sales 4 per cent higher at Pounds 949.6m. Mr Liam Strong, chief executive, who has led the group away from interim losses in 1992 of Pounds 97m, said the improvement reflected Sears' ability to get 'more pounds of profit for every pound of sales'. The company dismissed suggestions that it would not be able to maintain such momentum in the longer term. 'Sears is still very much in the process of upgrading its retail skills,' it said. Sears compares itself with Marks and Spencer, which operates in many of the same markets but achieves higher margins. 'Their trading margin last year was 13 per cent and ours was 6 per cent,' the company said. 'We reckon there is still some way to go.' The profits improvement was helped by strong growth in underlying sales. Like-for-like retail sales were almost 5 per cent up. The trend continued in the second half with like-for-like sales in the first seven weeks about 7 per cent ahead. Sears enjoyed strong interim profits growth in all divisions, with the exception of its children's wear business, the Olympus sports shops on the high street, and the shoes joint venture in Germany and the Benelux countries. Problems in the two UK businesses left profits from high street fashion 69 per cent down at Pounds 1.5m. The decline masked a substantial improvement in womenswear, the group said. Recession in Germany left the joint venture with losses of Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 600,000 profits). Sears reported its strongest growth in Selfridges, the London department store, which increased sales by 12 per cent to Pounds 107.7m and profits by 52 per cent to Pounds 9.1m. Footwear, where Sears claims about 20 per cent of the UK shoe market, showed a 5.9 per cent like-for-like sales improvement. Sales and profits were helped by the success of new concepts such as the self-service Shoe Express, and Shoe City, a large format out-of-town store. Trading profits were 24 per cent ahead to Pounds 11.2m, on overall sales 3 per cent ahead to Pounds 261.5m. Cost-cutting helped the Freemans home shopping business lift profits 91 per cent to Pounds 18m. Excluding one-off charges profits rose by 21 per cent. The dividend is increased by 5 per cent to 1.05p (1p). Earnings rose to 1.85p (1.45p). See Lex</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Huhtamaki gains 27% to FM506m Huhtamaki, the Finnish group whose interests range from chewing gum to contraceptives, yesterday reported a 27 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to FM506m (Dollars 92m) in 1993, from FM399 in 1992. The improvement was driven by a 64 per cent increase in earnings by the Leiras pharmaceuticals division which returned operating profits of FM243m, helping to offset a 34 per cent slump in operating profits by the Leaf confectionery business to FM207m. Overall group sales rose 21 per cent to FM7.93bn, helped by the continued fall during 1993 in the value of the Finnish markka. Mr Timo Peltola, chief executive, said the pattern of 1993 would shift this year as a recovery in profitability at Leaf, the world's 10th-largest confectionery company, was balanced by slower earnings growth for Leiras which would be held back by clinical trials.</p>

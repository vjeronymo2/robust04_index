			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Venezuelan debt downgraded THE outlook for Venezuela's long-term debt was amended to negative yesterday by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, only days after the country's successful return to the D-Mark sector of the international bond market. S&amp;P, while it affirmed Venezuela's double-B credit rating, said its adjustment to the country's outlook was prompted by 'the increasing political difficulties' the government faced in pushing through electoral and economic reforms. Moody's Investors Service, the US agency, has lowered the credit ratings of two Japanese trust banks due to asset quality problems and a poor outlook on long-term profitability, Emiko Terazono writes in Tokyo. Long-term ratings at Sumitomo Trust and Banking and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking were lowered to Baa1 from A2.</p>

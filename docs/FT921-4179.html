			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Late payment of business bills to be deterred - Debt Recovery THE chancellor announced in his Budget a package of measures to help tackle the problem of late payment experienced by many small firms and to encourage businesses to adopt the good practice of government departments in making prompt payment to suppliers. The government will require large companies to state in their annual report and accounts how quickly they pay their bills. Simpler procedures will be introduced for small claims and debt recovery cases. Prime contractors of government departments must include a clause in their sub-contracts committing themselves to pay subcontractors promptly - ordinarily within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice. In addition the Department of Employment will provide up to Pounds 90,000 for three trade associations to run one-year pilot schemes to provide 'late payment hotlines' for their members. The chancellor said the government had every sympathy with small companies who found that their larger debtors were deliberately delaying payment to boost their own cash flow. Government departments had a good record in paying their own bills on time and the government hoped the example it had set would be followed by large companies throughout the private sector. Company accounts. The government proposes to amend the Companies Act 1985 to require large companies to state in their annual reports and accounts how quickly they pay their bills. Subject to the outcome of consultation, the necessary statutory instrument will be laid later this year. This will enable prospective suppliers to have an idea of a company's payment performance and discourage late payment. Court procedures. Small traders who either sue, or are sued, for debts of Pounds 1,000 or less will benefit from continuing improvements to the quick, informal, 'do-it-yourself' small-claims arbitration procedure under which the loser does not risk being required to pay the winner's legal costs. The level at which defended debt claims are dealt with under this 'no-costs' regime has already been doubled from Pounds 500 to Pounds 1,000. The Lord Chancellor's department has also already consulted on further proposals (planned to be introduced from July this year) to dispense with preliminary hearings in all but exceptional cases, so that cases are dealt with at a single substantive hearing, and changes to court rules to encourage district judges (formerly county court registrars) to help unrepresented litigants put their case. Government contracts. In future, all those successfully negotiating a prime contract with a government department will be required to commit themselves by contract to pay their subcontractors promptly. The government expects that the commitment should ordinarily be to pay the subcontractor within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice as defined by the contract requirements. The new procedures will be introduced from April 5, 1992. Where a prime contractor fails to comply with the provision for making prompt payment in his subcontract, the subcontractor will have a remedy through the courts in the normal way. Where there is evidence that the performance of a prime contractor has been unsatisfactory for reasons which may include the late payment of a subcontractor, that will be taken into account by the department in awarding subsequent contracts. Late payment hotlines. Trade associations will be invited shortly to tender to run one-year pilot schemes to provide late-payment support services for their members in areas where the problem of late payment is thought to be most serious. The Department of Employment will provide up to Pounds 90,000 to support three schemes proposed by trade associations. They will be invited to suggest what form the late payment support services should take but it is thought likely that one of the services will be telephone 'hotlines' to give advice to association members on how to pursue late payers through the courts. The usage and effectiveness of the support schemes will be monitored and experience from the pilots will be made widely available to all trade associations and other similar small firm support organisations. Government departments are already required to pay their bills promptly. Government Accounting, the Treasury's guide to departments on financial and accounting procedures, requires the timing of payment normally to be stipulated in contracts and, where there is no such contractual provision or other understanding or accepted practice governing timing of payment, for departments to pay within 30 days of receipt of goods or services, or the presentation of a valid demand for payment, whichever is the later.</p>

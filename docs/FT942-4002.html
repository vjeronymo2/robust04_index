			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Sport: A surprise for the wildlife - FT Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. This week they have been in Europe. We scattered marmots as we trudged up towards Mont Gele. They are not used to skiers at this time of the year. After a winter hibernating, they normally find the slopes empty until summer skiing begins at the end of June. What the marmots did not know was that our presence was part of a rescue act following the sudden closure of the cable cars due to take us to the Diablerets Glacier across the valley. At noon, when the high winds and sleet ruled the glacier out of contention for our daily ski outing, Anita, the receptionist at the Eurotel hotel, telephoned two other Swiss summer skiing areas - Saas-Fee and Zermatt. To our alarm, they were closed too. There was only one thing for it: a telephone call to Patrick Messeiller, Verbier's tourist director, interrupting his Sunday lunch. It produced the promise of a jeep. Francois-Xavier, our driver, would take us as high as possible up a mountain track. From here we could walk for half an hour or so, giving us a mile's skiing - our minimum requirement in an emergency. Once again, for about the tenth time this year, our bacon had been saved. Before the bad weather, we had been enjoying the skiing at Diablerets, even though we had to share it with 500 guides holding their annual ski races. One run was the most beautifully-groomed piste I had ever encountered. You only had to think a turn and it happened. Another run, Audon, was almost four miles long and full of challenges - the longest, most exhilarating descent we had experienced for weeks. Earlier, we had enjoyed extensive skiing in fresh snow on Austrian glaciers at Stubai and Solden, with the wildest and most picturesque at Pitztal and Kaunertal, where we were again in illustrious company, sharing the slopes with the Austrian and Swiss national ski teams. We then faced a 450-mile drive in heavy rain from Austria, across Switzerland and into France, where we slept at Chamonix, before skiing above Courmayeur on the Italian side of Mont Blanc. It's all go, this search for snow.</p>

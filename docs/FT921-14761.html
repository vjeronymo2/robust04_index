			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Arts: A humorous Watteau - The work of Nicholas Lancret One of the most delightful small exhibitions in America at present is the retrospective of paintings and drawings by the French 18th-century artist Nicholas Lancret (1690-1743), lately at the Frick Collection and which reopens at the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas from February 15 to April 2. In the Frick, a veritable chapel for devotees of the ancien regime with its masterpieces by Boucher, Fragonard, Greuze, Chardin (and a just-acquired early Watteau of 'Soldiers at Rest Before the Gates of a Town'), the 28 paintings and 14 drawings by Lancret are shown to the best advantage in the most congenial company. Curated by American scholar Mary Tavener Holmes, the Frick show is, surprisingly, the first ever devoted to the artist and, while a rehabilitative effort, may be taken on its own terms just to see some of the most delightful genre paintings of the 18th century. The son of a coachman, Lancret begun his career as a painter of fetes-champetres in the manner of Watteau, who, after first befriending the younger man, became infuriated when some paintings by Lancret were mistakenly taken to be his own. Lancret enjoyed great success in the pastoral genres that Watteau initiated, earning the Royal patronage of Louis XV and Frederick the Great of Prussia, who collected dozens of paintings by Lancret and his rival, Jean-Baptiste Pater, for his palaces at Potsdam and Sans Souci. Although Lancret has retained a devoted following among private collectors, the artist's critical fortunes have greatly suffered, due to the artist's initially close dependency on Watteau. For much of this century, Lancret has usually been dismissed as a mere facile imitator of Watteau, relying, in the words of one ungenerous critic, on 'a set formula without understanding (Watteau's) poetry or originality.' The Frick show demonstrates that Lancret, while unable to fully divest himself of Watteau's style (especially in his drawings, which as a whole are rather weak), was no slavish follower and he explored genres and subjects that were very different from the older master. Whereas Watteau's genius is demonstrated in the compelling, haunting ambiguity and silvery tones that imbues his canvases, Lancret opted instead for both richer, bolder colours and narrative clarity in his fetes-champetres and genre scenes, adding a cheerful humour that Watteau eschewed. What Lancret lacks in poetry, he makes up in affable charm. There is no mistaking the meaning of Lancret's jolly Luncheon after the Hunt, from the Boston Museum, featuring a gaggle of pleasantly inebriated nobles lounging in their chairs. And the poignancy of Watteau's view of childhood is replaced by the simple pleasures of Lancret's Toy Windmill, depicting a pug-faced little girl blowing herself purple while vainly attempting to make a booby-trapped toy spin. In such paintings, Lancret is the French heir of the seemingly straightforward 17th century Flemish and Dutch genre subjects of Dou, Metsu and Teniers that 18th-century French connoisseurs were infatuated with (Diderot once remarked that he would give ten Watteaus for one Teniers). Occasionally Lancret pandered to that taste by adding figures to 17th-century Dutch kitchen interiors by Kalf, Saftleven and others (a good example, unavailable for the Frick show, is the Wallace Collection's Flea Catcher), and in at least one instance, Lancret's additions have been cleaned away by judicious 20th-century restorers. Another aspect of Lancret's art that may have been provisionally influenced by Dutch examples, and one minimally dependant on Watteau, was the conversation piece. Lancret was one of the very few proponents in France for this essentially English convention, and he is represented here by his very best examples, notably the famous La Tasse de Chocolat from the National Gallery, London, and the Seated Hunter with a Servant (private collection, New York), which especially recalls Gainsborough. According to one account, Lancret's only vice was his great love for the theatre and opera, and one of the fruits of his obsessions, and a highlight of the show, is the pastoral portrait of the prima ballerina La Camargo dancing with a companion (National Gallery, Washington). If the Frick show finally coaxes Lancret's reputation out from under Watteau's shadow, it is worth recalling that for his contemporaries, there was no confusing the two artists. Commenting on two Lancrets, one astute 18th century critic decreed that while they were 'in the genre of Watteau, but in a style that M Lancret had already created for himself - and true connoisseurs will not confuse them'.</p>

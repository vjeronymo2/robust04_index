			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries retreat after disappointing auction AFTER rising sharply on good inflation news, longer-dated US Treasuries fell back from their highs following a disappointing auction of three-year notes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond, which had been up 1 1/8 in the morning, was only  23/32 higher at 101 7/16 , yielding 6.139 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 9/16 , to yield 4.091 per cent. The October inflation data turned about to be a big, and pleasant, surprise for the beleaguered market. Analysts had expected the producer prices index to have risen by about 0.3 per cent but when the figures were released, it showed a decline of 0.2 per cent. Even better, core PPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, fell by 0.5 per cent. The numbers immediately raised hopes that today's consumer price index will also be bullish for bonds. Prices surged at the long end as soon as the PPI came out, with the 30-year bond quickly posting a rise of more than one point. The buying, however, was not particularly widespread, with dealer short-covering contributing to the gains. Analysts said trading was not as heavy as might have been expected because investors were cautious ahead of the afternoon auction of Dollars 17bn in three-year notes. That approach proved prescient, because the auction went off poorly, with weak demand from retail investors and a higher than expected average yield. When it became clear that the auction would disappoint, longer-dated prices fell back from their early highs, pushing long-term interest rates higher. CONTINENTAL European government bond markets bounced back to life, mostly taking their cue from the US. Italy was one of the top performers, with the futures contract gaining over a point. The Liffe BTP contract rose from 113.79 at Monday's close to trade at 114.90 by late afternoon. Dealers said domestic factors contributed to the rally. Traders were focusing on the 1994 budget, as some key clauses were due to be voted on by the Senate last night. GERMAN government bonds gained half a point, pulled up by the US news and by the release of poor retail sales figures, which only confirmed the need for lower interest rates in the market's view. Treuhand, the agency responsible for the privatisation of former east German enterprises, issued a new 6 per cent 10-year bond. Dealers noted switching out of existing 10-year Treuhand issues into the new bond as investors searched for longer duration and were lured by the yield pick-up of about 14 basis points over Federal issues. Western German retail sales fell 1.8 per cent in real terms during September compared with a year earlier. Mr Julian Callow, economist at Kleinwort Benson, said the news only highlighted the need for another cut in German interest rates by year-end. Less favourable for the bund market was the news that new government borrowing may rise to over DM70bn next year. Mr Rudi Walther, the chairman of parliament's finance committee, was quoted as saying new government borrowing would be DM73bn - DM75bn, which dealers said was higher than previously expected. UK gilts gained nearly a point at the long end on the back of positive inflation news. Initially, the gilt market appeared to be digesting the favourable producer price data released on Monday, while the release of the US PPI data helped to give the market an extra boost in the afternoon. The 8 3/4 per cent 2017 gilt climbed from 116 7/16 to 117 11/32 while shorter-dated issues gained nearly a quarter point. JAPANESE paper closed up on the day, having reached a new six-year high as the weakness in the Tokyo stock market and generally gloomy economic background boosted hopes of a further easing in short-term interest rates. The benchmark No 145 issue opened with a yield of 3.445 per cent before moving to 3.415 per cent - corresponding to the high price of the day - and closed at 3.42 per cent.</p>

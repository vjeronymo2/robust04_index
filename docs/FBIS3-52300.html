			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunisia has expressed its satisfaction in a  statement issued by the Foreign Ministry after the South African  parliament's approval of the interim constitution calling for  the equality of all citizens in South Africa without  discrimination by color or race.    It stressed that this new gain constitutes without any doubt  new mortar in the building of a free and just society. It is  also a sign indicating that the democratic process of this  fraternal country is an irrevocable choice.    While Tunisia values the courage of the presidents, Mandela  and De Klerk, and their foresight, it expresses hope that the  multi-racial elections scheduled to take place in April 1994  will bring about a democratic non-racial state under a unified  structure with all its capabilities.</p>

			<p>Croatia,      Slovenia Downplay Istrian Border Issue                          SUMMARY      Apparently hoping to calm anxieties about the possible revival of  irredentist claims to the formerly Italian Istrian peninsula,  Slovene and Croatian officials have minimized the significance of  the recent victory in Italy of the center-right coalition.                           END SUMMARY    While acknowledging that the victory of nationalists in recent  Italian elections has raised apprehensions in Croatia and  Slovenia, officials of both countries have tried to calm fears  and offer assurances of continued neighborly relations.  Apparently referring to calls by Italian nationalists for  restitution of Italian assets in Istria that were seized by the  Yugoslav Government after World War II, Croatian Foreign Minister  Mate Granic, during a 23 April visit to Istria, said that "some  uncontrolled post-election statements in Italy are causing  tension and fear in Croatia, although they do not represent the  official Italian policy." Granic assessed bilateral relations  with Italy as "good," noting that Italy was Croatia's second-  largest trading partner.  He emphasized that Croatia would  respect the rights of its ethnic Italian minority "in accordance  with the highest international standards and the Croatian  Constitution" and said he expected that the Italian minority in  Istria would serve as "one of the strongest links of friendship  and cooperation" between the two countries (Vjesnik, 25 April).     Similarly, at a 28 April Ljubljana news conference covered by  Ljubljana Radio, Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle was  guardedly positive about Slovene-Italian relations.  He assessed  cooperation with Italy "as positive on the whole," adding that in  the future he expected good neighborly relations "that would set  an example for others."  Peterle told reporters that minorities  in Slovenia are protected "in accordance with the highest  European standards."  He stressed that demands to abrogate the  Osimo Treaty signed between Italy and Yugoslavia in 1975 and to  revise Italy's borders with Slovenia made by "certain Italian  politicians "--an apparent reference to Mirko Tremaglia, a deputy  of the National Alliance/Italian Social Movement--were not the  official position of the Italian Government.  According to  Peterle, recently revived property claims of Italians who left  Istria and Dalmatia after World War II had already been settled  by the compensation agreement signed by Italy and Yugoslavia in  1983, an agreement that Slovenia has pledged to honor.  Although  current Slovenian law restricts the purchase of land by  foreigners, Peterle asserted that "within the process of joining  Europe" he saw no problem with foreign citizens buying property  in Slovenia, "as we have never differentiated among people."   He  expressed hope that Italy would therefore cease blocking  Slovenia's association agreement with the EU and will finally  withdraw its objections.     Echoing his stance on the issue, Peterle's political party,' the  Christian Democrats (SKI)), adopted a declaration on bilateral  relations with Italy at their annual conference.  According to  the text published on 25 April by Republika, a Slovene-language  Trieste daily, the SKI) opposes the revision of the Osimo Treaty  and the revision of state borders, while advocating "sincere"  cooperation between the two countries, without conditions,  pressure or extort ion.  The SKD declaration also stated that  Slovenia, while not yielding to threats, would seek its place in  Europe among those nations and countries that respect "Slovene  national independence."     Italian regional government leaders in the region bordering on  Slovenia are also apparently anxious to avoid heightening  tensions over Italian nationalist claims on Istria.  The 21 and  25 April Republika reported that the leadership of Italy's  Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, which borders Slovenia, supports  cooperation with Slovenia and Slovenia's integration into the EU.  Renzo Travanut, a Christian Democrat and chairman of the regional  government, denounced Forza Italia's call to freeze relations  with Slovenia and oppose Slovenia's accession to the EU.  Such  "bombastic statements and muscle flexing", he said,  do not  strengthen Italy's foreign policy, promote bilateral relations,  or serve the business interests of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and  especially do not contribute to the protection of the Italian  minority" in Istria.  Travanut emphasized that the border region  wants to be involved in shaping policy toward "such a sensitive  area" as "relations with our neighbors" (Republika, 21 April).     Travanut's position has been backed by the Friuli-Venezia Giulia  trade union organizations, affiliated with center to leftwing  parties.  The unions issued a joint statement supporting  cooperation with Slovenia and Slovenia's integration into the  European Union as the only means to increase economic prosperity,  solve border issues, and protect ethnic minorities.  The trade  union statement denounced revanchism, which causes "unnecessary  tension," and called on the regional government to intervene at  the national level to support Slovenia's association agreement  with the EU (Republika, 21 April).

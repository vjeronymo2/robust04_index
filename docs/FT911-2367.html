			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / French store's stake triggers bid THE COMPLEX interlocking family and shareholding structures of France's department store sector appear to be on the point of being unravelled, opening the prospect of a FFr5.4bn (Pounds 541m) bid for the Nouvelles Galeries group. Galeries Lafayette, owner of the elegant Boulevard Haussmann department store, appears likely to be forced to bid for Nouvelles Galeries after buying 16.4 per cent of its capital last week from Proventus, the Swedish retailing group. The acquisition takes Galeries Lafayette's overall stake to 39 per cent, past the 33.3 per cent level at which a full bid must normally be triggered under French law, but the company had hoped to be exempted from the obligation since control of Nouvelles Galeries remains in the hands of the Devanlay textile group which is headed by Mr Leon Cligman. But the French stock exchange council has ordered it to bid, making an offer for Nouvelles Galeries of FFr950 a share, the price Galeries Lafayette paid Proventus, seem inevitable. The irony is that if Galeries Lafayette had wanted to take control of Nouvelles Galeries, it could have bought the whole of Proventus' 25.7 per cent stake. Instead, it insisted on taking only 16.4 per cent. Despite these peaceable intentions, however, Galeries Lafayette appears to have provoked Mr Cligman's irritation, raising the possibility of a stock market battle over Nouvelles Galeries. The origins of this upheaval go back to the acquisition two-and-a-half years ago of stakes in Galeries Lafayette, Nouvelles Galeries and Bazar l'Hotel de Ville by Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand investor. Sir Ron sold his shares in Galeries Lafayette last August to Axa, the insurance company, and then sold his BHV and Nouvelles Galeries shares to Proventus. This week's developments, however, provide belated recognition for his analysis that the sector was ripe for restructuring. Proventus, which had obtained French government permission to take its stake up to 33 per cent, appeared bent on provoking this restructuring but withdrew, although it kept its 16 per cent stake in BHV.</p>

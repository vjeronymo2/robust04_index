			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (8): The rural fabric of domesticity - Most new towns are notable for their unmemorable architecture BRITISH new towns conjure up the whole range of architectural visions of the second half of the twentieth century. In fact, their architectural origins go right back to the early days of new town propaganda when Ebenezer Howard published his manifesto about garden cities in 1898, Tomorrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform. This book was full of utopian ideas about town planning based upon Howard's own version of what he called, 'Common sense socialism'. Ebeneezer Howard was to go on to found in the early 1900s his First Garden City Company and to assemble the land and devise a plan for the building of Letchworth Garden City in Hertfordshire. To plan the very first British new town Howard employed the services of Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin, two very young architects who were responsible for the physical form of Howard's socially reforming ideas. Gardens and landscape were almost as important as the architecture - indeed the main architectural virtues of Letchworth are to be seen in the modest and sensibly planned traditional houses. Architects involved in the early days of the garden city movement were responsible for building the visions of practical idealists. At Letchworth and later at Welwyn Garden City the architecture definitely takes second place to the planning of interrelated housing and industrial areas. Domestic architecture is agreeable and modest in these towns and the public buildings are mainly traditional and unadventurous. The mission of the early new towns was not to create architectural monuments but to provide good simple homes with gardens and easy access to the workplace. In Britain, the first new towns were far from the forefront of 20th Century architecture. There is little sign of the influence of the International Modern Movement or of pioneers such as Le Corbusier in the British new towns until well after the second world war. Harlow new town in Essex was one of the first towns to acquire a distinctive architectural character. The architect for the town was Sir Frederic Gibberd, probably better known as the architect of Heathrow Airport and the wig-wam shaped Roman Catholic cathedral of Christ the King in Liverpool. He had very strong architectural ideas and introduced the first tower block of flats into a new town. Harlow was designated in 1947 and its town centre has some of the modern sentimentality of the early 1950s. The sentiment comes in modern interpretations of traditional market square and clock tower. The atmosphere of the new towns of the 1950s was that of the Festival of Britain - a sort of spiky contemporary architecture and a child-like use of primary colours. Harlow, however, did pioneer the commissioning of works of art and is now famous for its outdoor sculpture collection. Stevenage, Crawley, Bracknell, Basildon, Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead and Welwyn, Newton Aycliffe and Peterlee all belong to the English first generation of new towns being designated in the 1940s. They are all architecturally unmemorable. Of this first wave only Peterlee had a distinctive architectural agenda. The emigre Russian modernist architect Berthold Lubetkin, famous for the penguin pool at London Zoo, was brought in to design the town. His proposals were imaginative and very promising essays in abstract modern architecture. But Lubetkin fell foul of the elaborate committee system that tends to dog any major public enterprise in Britain and felt obliged to resign. He was not prepared to compromise on his distinctive architectural designs and so Peterlee lost the chance to be an uncompromisingly modern new town. Of the second wave of new towns (late 1950s and early 1960s) it was Cumbernauld in Scotland - commissioned in 1955 - that took the opportunity to have a remarkable town centre design that separated the motor car from the pedestrian and effectively made the whole town centre one large megastructure. The architects were a firm called Wilson and Womersley. Their design was based on the wish to make the town easy for the pedestrian. The vast town centre on a hilltop has never won many architectural plaudits. The use of concrete as the main material was an unwise choice for the Scottish climate and the centre has weathered badly. It has been left to Milton Keynes, Britain's largest new town founded in North Buckinghamshire in the 1960s, to be the one town that had produced architecture and landscaping that could be considered remarkable. The appointment of Fred Lloyd Roche and Derek Walker to head up the development team of architects created an unusual architectural climate in the new city. The Development Corporation built up a very strong team of architects so that a great deal of the new architecture was designed 'in-house'. The main manifestation of this policy is the great shopping centre that is one giant mall. It is designed in a simple and elegant way - unremarkable outside but beautifully planted and finished internally. Two things particularly distinguish Milton Keynes - its grid plan of roads - designed by the master planners Llewelyn-Davies, Weekes, Forestier Walker and Bor, and the quality of its industrial buildings that were all supervised by the Development Corporation architects. On the housing front the town is also interesting being built at a time when private housing played its part in the growth of the city. A wide range of architects and developers built housing in the city including Sir Norman Foster and Ralph Erskine. There are no monuments in any of the new towns - Milton Keynes is remarkable for a Buddhist Temple and a domed ecumenical church in the very centre of the town. Architects played their part in the development of the new towns but it has to be said that the British wish to live in green places that may well appear suburban is what has won the day in the new towns. Their mixture of uses makes them urban but in appearance and spaciousness they are not so much towns as new suburbs. The British like the idea of the country in the town and MIlton Keynes has achieved this to an unusual degree. Although Milton Keynes has very good architecture - it has millions of very good trees. These make the town almost invisible from the roads - and perhaps it is true of almost all the towns that the landscaping puts the architecture in its place.</p>

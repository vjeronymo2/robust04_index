			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.75  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims not payable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Exclusions listed in paragraphs (a) through (l) of this section are based upon the wording of 28 U.S.C. 2680. The remainder are based either on statute or court decisions. The interpretation of these exclusions is a Federal question to be decided under Federal law; for example, the tort of assault and battery listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(h) should be interpreted in accordance with Federal common law principles, and where State law differs, the former will prevail. Where a claim is considered not payable under this paragraph, consult DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 8 for other methods of handling. A claim is not payable under this subpart if it_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Is based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation is valid (28 U.S.C. 2680(a)). Where no negligence on the part of any Government employee is shown, and the only ground for the claim is the contention that the same conduct by a private individual would be tortious, or that the statute or regulation authorizing the project was invalid, the sole question is the existence of the statute or regulation, not its validity. However, a claim should not be denied based solely on this exception without the prior approval of the Commander, USARCS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Is based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a Federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved is abused (28 U.S.C. 2680(a)). A claim should not be denied solely because of this exception without the prior approval of the Commander, USARCS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Arises out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter (28 U.S.C. 2680(b)). It should be noted that administrative settlement and payment of certain mail claims is authorized under subparts C and F. Further, a limited indemnity may be obtained through other channels for the loss or damage to registered, insured, and C.O.D. mail (39 U.S.C. 5001,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;61). The exclusion may not be applicable where State law recognizes a cause of action for invasion of privacy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Arises with respect to the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods or merchandise by any customs or other law-enforcement officer (28 U.S.C. 2680(c)). Adequate remedies are available to anyone aggrieved by the application of the tax or customs laws of the United States (26 U.S.C. 6213), or the claimant may pay the tax and sue in the U.S. Claims Court or the appropriate U.S. District Court for a refund (28 U.S.C. 1491 and 1346(a)(1)). Other remedies are also available for the loss or detention of goods or merchandise; for example, Tucker Act, bailment provisions of the MCA (chap. 3), or destruction of evidence for scientific analysis (AR 190&hyph;22, paragraph 3&hyph;8). With respect to the detention of goods by a law enforcement officer, this exception may apply to seizures in connection with an arrest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Is cognizable under the Suits in Admiralty Act (46 U.S.C. 740&hyph;752) or under the Public Vessels Act (46 U.S.C. 781&hyph;790). To be cognizable under this exclusion, the tort must have a maritime situs and a maritime nexus, otherwise the tort is cognizable under the FTCA. Maritime claims may be considered under The Army Maritime Claims Settlement Act (10 U.S.C. 4801,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and subpart H, and they must be settled or suit filed within 2 years of accrual of claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Arises out of an act or omission of any employee of the Government in administering the provisions of the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. appendix 1&hyph;31; 28 U.S.C. 2680(e)). That Act provides that the sole remedy of any person claiming money or other property held by the Alien Property Custodian is as provided by that Act. This exception should be broadly construed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Is for damages caused by the imposition or establishment of a quarantine by the United States (28 U.S.C. 2680(f)). Claims for failure to impose a quarantine or delay in enforcing a quarantine come within the discretionary function exclusion discussed in paragraph (b) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Arises out of an assault or battery (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Often artful pleading is employed to create a cause of action in negligence, such as alleging negligent supervision; such does not create a separate cause of action as the exception bars a claim arising out of an assault and battery even though there may have been negligent supervision. Under the 1974 amendment to 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), the activities of law enforcement officers that result in an assault or battery are removed from this exception and can create a cause of action. Such activities have accounted for most of the past claims and litigation involving the assault and battery exception. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Therefore, any claim alleging use of threatening or deadly force, especially by a law enforcement officer, must be thoroughly investigated to determine whether the nature, amount, and use of such force was justified under the circumstances. (See paragraph (i) of this section for definition of investigative or law enforcement officer). Also, section 2680(h) does not apply to a claim arising out of performance of medical, dental or related health care functions (10 U.S.C. 1089(e)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Arises out of false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution or abuse of process (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)). This exception has universal applicability to tall acts of false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, or abuse of process when committed by an employee of the United States in the scope of employment. However, by amendment to 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), this exception is not applicable on or after 16 March 1974 to such actions when committed by an investigative or law enforcement officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, seize evidence, or make arrests for violations of Federal law (88 Stat. 50). Such employees are considered to include military police, but not post exchange detectives. Whether or not a Federal law enforcement officer is involved, the defenses of probable cause, reasonableness, and good faith are available, provided the arrest is otherwise lawful under State law. DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;8c, refers to certain claims based on unjust convictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Arises out of libel, slander, misrepresentation, or deceit (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)). The misrepresentation exception has been broadly construed to include negligent as well as intentional misrepresentation. It has not been applied in situations involving negligent failure to perform some operational task or to convey information related to public safety independent of any secondary misstatement. Where an erroneous medical diagnosis is made, the exception does not apply because malpractice is the gravamen of the action and the misrepresentation incidental. Similarly, the misrepresentation exception was held not applicable where the United States sold bomb casings to a scrap dealer expressly warranting that they were safe and fit for scrap metal processing, and one of the casings exploded. Before this exception can be applied in the determination of an administrative tort claim, the claims investigation must consider the nature of the Government's acts or omissions, as well as the information upon which the claimant may have relied to his or her detriment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Arises out of interference with contract rights (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)). This exception includes both interference with existing contract rights and interference with prospective or executed contract rights or economic advantage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) Arises from the fiscal operations of the Department of the Treasury or from the regulation of the monetary system (28 U.S.C. 2680(i)). This exception includes all disbursing operations of the DA or other military services. However, such claims may be forwarded through Army finance channels for consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m) Arises out of the combat activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war (28 U.S.C. 2680(j)). ``Combat activities'' is defined in the glossary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n) Arises in a foreign country (28 U.S.C. 2680(k)). There is no clear delineation of what constitutes a foreign country. However, the exception has been held applicable to claims arising in a leased military base in Newfoundland; in the American Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand; on Okinawa under the de facto sovereignty of the United States; on Kwajalein under the trusteeship of the United States; and to various occupied countries. (See subpart J and DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 821, for handling of certain claims arising in a foreign country.) Where the actionable negligence has occurred in the United States and only the consequences occurred in a foreign country, this exception has not been applied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (o) Arises from the activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority (28 U.S.C. 2680(i) and 16 U.S.C. 831  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 27 (AFP) -- A conference to promote  stability in Europe agreed Friday [27 May] on measures aimed at  preventing border conflicts in eastern Europe and solving  problems over ethnic minorities.    The two-day conference, which opened at UNESCO headquarters  here on Thursday, agreed to set up two regional round tables,  one dealing with the problems of Russian minorities in the three  Baltic states, and the other with Hungarian minorities in  Slovakia and Romania.    Accords reached at the round tables will be enshrined in a  Stability Pact which could be signed early in 1995 and  registered with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE).    The conference is sponsored by France and the European Union  to defuse potential conflicts between would-be candidates to the  European Union from eastern and central Europe.</p>

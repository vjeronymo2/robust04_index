			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (7): Love-in that may not last - Corporatism has been embraced with relief After generations of often bitter confrontational economic management, with government, labour and big business at each other's throats, it is hardly surprising that South Africans should have embraced the corporate state with a mixture of enthusiasm and relief. Even the sceptics concede that the smooth transition owes much to the forum system where different stakeholders - in the economy, in housing, health and education - sat around the table in an effort to sink their differences and work out compromises. All three sides of the 'golden triangle' - government, business and the unions - are keen to build on such past successes as the National Economic Forum, responsible among other things for securing consensus in the difficult and complex negotiations over last year's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade submission for the Uruguay round. All sides were conscious of what was at stake in the decision to lower tariffs radically over the next five years - markets, exports, jobs and industrial peace. But the system worked, setting what many see as a model for the future. Those with memories of failed experiments in corporatism - the UK in the 1960s and 1970s - have their reservations. The concept is riven with internal contradictions. Take, for example, the contradiction between the ANC's commitment to anti-trust legislation and a more active competition policy, and tax measures in the last two budgets designed to encourage businesses to reinvest. Threats to clip the wings of big organisations conflict with measures encouraging them to reinvest. A second, more serious, potential weakness is the economic management crunch that is bound to come during the five-year life of the national unity government. The ANC has a mandate to restructure the economy. In this process one - or both - of the other two sides of the triangle is going to get hurt. Sooner, rather than later, too, ministerial impatience with government by forum and consensus will develop. The government's commitment to implement - not just announce - important social programmes during its first 100 days in office, is vulnerable to delay as the number of participants proliferates. Above all, there is a question mark over the ANC's willingness to share power, not just with defeated political opponents but with the unelected representatives of what many on the left see as the old enemy, big business. For the present the love-in between business and government looks rock solid, but the third side of the triangle seems to be increasingly suspect. Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, agrees that there is little prospect of a compact with labour, but hopes for a tacit, unspoken deal that would link wages with productivity. Employers are less sanguine, noting the tendency for wage settlements to average out at two or three percentage points above the inflation rate. In early July, negotiators in the mining industry were a full 10 points apart, with employers determined to keep the 1994 wage round in single figures while the unions were demanding 18 per cent. Management worries that now the top echelon of union leaders has moved off into politics and government, there is a very real danger that - even if wage agreements are reached - the unions will lack the capacity and credibility to sell the deal to their members. Some 1.2m working days were lost to strike action in the first half of 1994  -the country's worst industrial relations performance for seven years. While this was partly attributable to pre-election disruption, it also reflects wage disputes which, according to industrial consultants, Andrew Levy and Associates, accounted for one third of the stoppages. The danger here must be that labour, which played a crucial role in bringing down apartheid, will push hard for an immediate, substantial, liberation dividend. Ministers and employers believe this will not happen, arguing that labour leaders are more preoccupied with job security than wage levels, but the current trend of above-inflation pay awards will put this thesis to the test. Government has a similar, if less acute, problem in terms of ensuring that what is agreed at central government level is translated into action by provincial administrations and parastatals. This too, is an inherent weakness of corporatism - the difficulty of ensuring that all the main players stick to their agreements. Some larger employers, for example, accuse their smaller colleagues of conceding unnecessarily high wage claims. Missing from the golden triangle - if central bank independence is to be a reality - is one of the key actors. As many in business voice their impatience over the Reserve Bank's caution on exchange control liberalisation and abolition of the financial rand, while anxieties surface over inflationary wage claims and job generation, the role of the central bank becomes increasingly crucial to the success of corporatism. In many countries, corporatism has foundered on this issue - the refusal of the monetary authorities to accommodate wage inflation, to lower interest rates - to boost output and employment - and the need for tight monetary policy to counter fiscal weakness. In the new South Africa, that too will become a crunch issue.</p>

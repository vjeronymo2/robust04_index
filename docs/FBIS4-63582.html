			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and ITAR-TASS correspondents </F> Tamara Zamyatina, Vladimir Beskoromnyy, Aleksandr Mineyev, and  Vladimir Tenin under the "Topic of the Day" rubric: "Will  Moscow Become NATO's Partner? The West Considers that the  Security System Is Impaired without Russia, but Is in No Hurry  To Grant It Special Status"]    [Text] On 24 May Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev will deliver a report to the session of North Atlantic  bloc defense ministers in Brussels on Russia's terms for signing  the Partnership for Peace program. According to the Russian  mass media, the report was prepared jointly by the Defense and  Foreign Ministries and amounts in essence to the demand that  Russia be granted a special status within the program  demarcating its position and role from that of the other  participants, particularly the former Soviet republics.    According to reports coming in from Brussels, the NATO  leadership is inclining toward meeting Moscow's requests and  even toward signing a special agreement with it which would  provide for holding additional consultations on problems of  European security but only after Russia's signing the  Partnership for Peace program, to the text of which the West  categorically refuses to make changes.    As we succeeded in elucidating, the leadership of this  Western military-political bloc is afraid that if it meets  Moscow halfway in all its demands a situation could develop on  the spur of the moment whereby Russia would achieve for itself  the right to veto NATO military-political decisions and would  thereby be able not only to block the activity of this  organization but also to exercise control over it  [kontrolirovat] which, after the breakup of the USSR and the  ending of the Cold War, the NATO leadership could not even have  envisaged in their wildest dreams. By all accounds, a quite  tough reception awaits Pavel Grachev in Brussels.    Will Russia join the North Atlantic bloc one way or another  or not? -- swords are going to be crossed on this score for a  good while yet both in the West and in our own country. And  although limited membership -- via the Partnership for Peace  program, drafted by the United States -- rather than full  membership is involved, it is obvious that this step could be  the prologue to another drastic redrawing of the geopolitical  map of the world in the 20th Century. What are the basic pros  and cons, and who stands to gain?    Let us remember that the Partnership for Peace program  appeared after Moscow's demarche opposing the immediate  admission of East European and Baltic countries to NATO and that  it is a kind of transitional stage toward full membership.    It has to be acknowledged that the program has been to the  liking of many people. The framework agreement on affiliation  to the Partnership program has already been signed at NATO HQ in  Brussels by the top officials or foreign ministers of 18  countries (among which number eight former Soviet republics),  including Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Estonia, Hungary, Ukraine,  and Slovakia.    The Partnership was conceived as preparation for carrying  out joint peacemaking operations under UN and CSCE auspices, as  a means of improving operational coordination.    In the opinion of a high-ranking representative of the NATO  military planning committee interviewed by us, some partners,  particularly in Russia, do not altogether grasp the meaning of  operational coordination. The opinion is current that this  means replacing military equipment and purchasing armaments from  NATO countries. That is not so, he maintained. The capability  for operational coordination implies common doctrines, common  procedures, and, of course, the possibility of maintaining  liaison with one another, maintaining contact. It does not mean  major expenditure, large-scale conversion of the defense  industry, or its switch from producing Soviet weapons to the  manufacture of NATO-type equipment.    According to our observations, NATO is certain that Russia  will sign the framework document. First, they think that Russia  would otherwise remain on the sidelines in self-isolation.  Second, the Partnership differs from participation in the  present consultative North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC]  by virtue of its individualized approach, and Russia wants to  develop relations with NATO precisely on an individual basis.    At the same time Russia's nonaffiliation would, it is  thought  in Brussels, have undesirable political repercussions.    As far as Russian statements about its intention to have  special status within the Partnership are concerned, NATO HQ  makes clear that the program embodies the principle of equality  and identical opportunities and that NATO will not agree to any  amendments or additions to the framework document. But it is  recognized here that it is in the general interests of NATO and  the countries of Central and East Europe and in the interests of  European security to take Russia's weight and significance into  account. If NATO accepts any proposals by Russia that go beyond  the Partnership program they will be the subject of separate  agreements.    NATO Allied Command Europe received a delegation of Russian  journalists and political scientists on 17 May. During  discussion it became clear that while Russian political circles  pay paramount attention to the military aspect of the program,  its initiators pay equal attention to joint rescue and and  humanitarian operations. However, their conduct has been  hampered without the affiliation of Russia and CIS countries to  the Partnership.    Asked whether NATO leaders don't see contradictions between  the interests of Russia as a Eurasian power in its simultaneous  participation in the CIS defense union [oboronyy soyuz] and the  NATO program, the military replied that "in that event there  will be complementarity of interests and the idea of a  transcontinental community stretching from Vancouver to  Vladivostok will be realized." Global security in Eurasia will  thereby be guaranteed, in their opinion.    The Russian Foreign Ministry's standpoint was expounded by  senior adviser Andrey Androsov: "The program has concentrated  within itself, as it were, the potential for collaboration which  has emerged since the demise of the bipolar world. It takes  account of our main thesis that NATO should not be enlarged by  the mechanical admission of new states."    Foreign Ministry experts consider that the Russian  Federation's nonaffiliation to Partnership for Peace will do  great harm to the interests of Russia itself and that  nonparticipation in the Partnership threatens seriously to  isolate Russia in the international arena and reduce its scope  for influencing the process of shaping a new Euro-Atlantic area.    And Aleksandr Piskunov, deputy chairman of the State Duma  Defense Committee, considers that the Partnership program is an  attempt to find a new raison d'etre for NATO while moving,  albeit in veiled form, toward confrontation with Russia. With  its affiliation to the program Russia forsakes the opportunity  effectively to influence the CIS and destroys the treaty on  collective security among Commonwealth countries.</p>

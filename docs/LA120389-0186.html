			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'REFORM LAW WAS DOOMED FROM START'  </P> <P> Jere Witter's "Reform Law Was Doomed, Denounced From the Start" (Nov. 20)  offers neither solutions nor alternatives to deal with complex immigration  matters.  </P> <P> It is important to point out that the new immigration law has already enabled  more than 3 million people "to come out of the shadows" and become legal  residents. Other provisions have also been successful. Employer sanctions have  effectively reduced employment of illegal aliens and provided protection  against discrimination in the workplace. Also, INS should be commended for  promulgating regulations and opening 107 legalization offices nationwide in  record time.  </P> <P> Finally, Witter misleads your readers by stating the law " . . . would have  caused a march on Washington if it affected employers nationally. . . ." Well,  Congress passed this law for all employers, and voluntary compliance has been  very high in all 50 states.  </P> <P> WILLIAM S. KING, JR.  </P> <P> Director, Office of Immigration Reform, Immigration and Naturalization Service,  Western Region  </P> <P> Laguna HillsGasoline Taxes and Road Improvements  </P> <P> Re the two articles "O.C. Transportation Panel Studies Fees for Drivers" and  "County Poll Gives Edge to 2 Tax Initiatives" (Nov. 28):  </P> <P> In the wake of all the official hand wringing over the loss of Measure M on the  recent ballot and the proposed 9-cent gas tax increase to be voted on in June,  hasn't something been overlooked?  </P> <P> If I'm not mistaken, our existing gasoline taxes were specifically earmarked  for new road building and highway improvement, but some have been diverted into  the general fund for years. Could it be that the electorate held the Orange  County Transportation Commission and the Legislature accountable on Election  Day?  </P> <P> Supervisor Thomas F. Riley says it was a terrible setback. Caltrans director  Keith McKean says we're in serious trouble. Former Supervisor and state  Transportation Commission member Bruce Nestande says that he is hopeful that  this proposed increase in the gas tax will pass in June. If approved, will it,  too, be diverted into the general fund?  </P> <P> If, as Supervisor Harriett M. Weider has suggested, "the OCTC must do a lot of  soul searching," they might attempt to get voter support by pressuring the  Legislature to use the existing gas taxes for the purposes for which they were  intended. Or, perhaps as Bill Ward of Drivers for Highway Safety has commented,  maybe it's time to get rid of the OCTC in its present structure, as it would  appear completely out of touch with commuters and voters.  </P> <P> And now, according to The Times, a $1-a-day parking fee for all employees  driving to work in Orange County is also under consideration by the OCTC?  </P> <P> KENT S.

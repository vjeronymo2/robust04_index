			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions SALES WERE a prominent feature during a fairly quiet week. Two directors of Alba, chairman John Harris and chief executive Daniel Harris, each sold 650,000 shares at 145.6p. The group has a diverse range of businesses including audio and video goods and giftware. Over the past six months or so, the share price has performed steadily and both men retain considerable holdings, accounting for more than 34 per cent of the company. Evans of Leeds, a property development group, is another company where the share price has been doing well. Recent sales at between 204-208p by Michael Evans, a non-executive director, and Bill Gibson, an executive director, still leave each with a considerable number of shares. Indeed, Evans - who, with other members of his family, holds almost 50 per cent of the company - has reduced his holding by only a small proportion. Scantronic makes alarms used against intruders and for the care of the elderly. The recent sale by Christopher Brookes, the chairman and chief executive, was made for tax purposes.

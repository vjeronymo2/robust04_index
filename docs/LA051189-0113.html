			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY, STADIUM DISPUTE FOR WHOM THE WHO TOILS  </P> <P> The Who is the rock group bringing in the money, but the question is, who will  get the money that The Who brings in?  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager Jack McGrory says the estimated $300,000 the British  rockers are expected to net for the stadium should pass automatically into the  city's general fund, to be used for city improvements as a whole.  </P> <P> Stadium Authority Board member Mike Gotch said he and others on the nine-member  body favor the money's being used for stadium improvements, such as seat  replacement and the installation of rubberized, non-slip flooring.  </P> <P> The stadium is bringing The Who to San Diego, Gotch argues, so the stadium  should get the money.  </P> <P> "I work for the city manager," said stadium Manager Bill Wilson, who has booked  The Who for an Aug. 22 concert. "So you see where I stand on this one. My job  is to run the stadium. I want to stay out of this one."  </P> <P> McGrory said the City Council, which has jurisdiction over the authority board,  may have to decide the matter at a stadium budget hearing in mid-June.  </P> <P> "Our position is that the stadium operation has been subsidized by the general  fund as long as we can remember," McGrory said. "We put $500,000 to $1 million  into the stadium every year just to help it break even. We think earmarking  revenues is a bad precedent. It hasn't been done before. Why should we do it  now?  </P> <P> "Money coming into the city goes into a general fund and is spent according to  citywide priorities," McGrory said. "Our suggested compromise is that, if the  stadium breaks even on its own (in 1989), we could take the surplus revenues  from the concert and put those into capital improvements at the stadium."  </P> <P> Gotch said the authority board has recommended to the council that all  stadium-generated proceeds be directed to the stadium for improvements. He said  the rubberized, non-slip flooring has been budgeted for $140,000 for fiscal  year 1990, $460,000 in 1992 and $600,000 in 1995. He said seat replacement will  cost $125,000 a year over the next four years.  </P> <P> "By the time those improvements are completed, the next Super Bowl will have  come and gone," Gotch said, provided San Diego is approved as host of one of  the upcoming games. "Hopefully, a World Series will have come and gone. At  least 10 million people will have passed through the gates by then," he said  "We're going to ask the City Council to condense the capital-improvement time  frame to three years. It can easily be accomplished if revenues from concerts  be directed to the stadium."  </P> <P> Wilson said the new flooring and seats could be installed sooner than expected,  provided the National League Padres continue at a pace that will see 2.4  million fans pass through the gates during the current baseball season. If the  National Football League Chargers have a good year, that would only bolster the  capital-improvement timetable, Wilson said.  </P> <P> He noted that the Rolling Stones want to come to the stadium for a two-day  concert in November that McGrory said could net the stadium (or is it the  city?) as much as $750,000. But both said the Stones' chances are nil, since a  two-day event, spanning seven hours each day, would do permanent damage to the  field. They said the Stones' proposal is bitterly opposed by the Chargers and  San Diego State University Aztecs, regular tenants who share the  </P> <P> field during that month.  </P> <P> "Two days of the Stones would reduce the field to what (Chargers' official)  Jack Teele calls Astro Dirt," Wilson said. "We can't have a two-day concert on  that field at that time under any circumstances. In August, we'd have a chance  to repair the field. But in November, with two teams playing on it, we'd have  to play 10 games on nothing but dirt."  </P> <P> Wilson said a one-day appearance by the Stones hasn't been ruled out, but rock  fans shouldn't be optimistic about seeing them here; the Stones have said they  want to play in November for two days or not at all.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $5 Million in Improvements  </P> <P> McGrory said the city manager's office has approved $5 million in stadium  improvements over the past four years, including a new parking lot and sound  system. He said the stadium requires about $5 million a year from the general  fund just to break even. He said its operating expenses run about $4.5 million  a year and its annual bond payment of $2.5 million will have to be made through  the year 2003.  </P> <P> Its revenues run only about $6.3 million a year, McGrory said, "so if the  Padres and Chargers have lousy years, we're the ones making up the difference."  </P> <P> McGrory pointed out that, despite having jurisdiction over the authority board,  the City Council need not approve events booked for the stadium. So the council  won't be asked to rubber-stamp the Stones, The Who or any other group Wilson  schedules for rock shows.  </P> <P> What happens to the money such groups generate is, of course, a different  matter. As McGrory pointed out, money is the only reason rock bands would ever  be courted. As it is, the stadium has not permitted a rock show that required  seating on the field since 1983, and the group playing that night was The Who.  </P> <P> The unofficial ban on concerts came about because of the quagmire the field  became and the extra security that such events require.  </P> <P> If individual tenants had their way, "We'd never have a concert in the  stadium," McGrory said, "and that includes The Who -- no matter how much money  we make. The tenants just don't feel it's worth it. We've worked too hard to  get the field in its present condition, and we're not going to tear it apart  just for the sake of money."  </P></p>

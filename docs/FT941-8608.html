			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Losses cut at Gulf Canada Resources Gulf Canada Resources, 70 per cent controlled by its lenders for the past two years, reduced losses sharply in 1993 while maintaining oil and gas production at high levels. Gulf Canada was acquired by the Reichmann family as a property diversification in the mid-1980s, but after the failure of their Olympia &amp; York Developments, the banks took control. The Reichmanns had pledged their Gulf Canada shares as collateral for USDollars 2.5bn in loans. The company has since been restructured through asset sales and heavy cuts in manning, but has retained some international projects, especially in south-east Asia. The 1993 loss was CDollars 31m (USDollars 23m) or 37 cents a share, compared with a deficit of CDollars 252m, or CDollars 1.85, after special charges in 1992. Revenues were CDollars 702m, against CDollars 827m. Net debt was reduced 28 per cent to CDollars 947m. A USDollars 300m 10-year subordinated debenture issue was completed this January to continue the debt reduction programme. The lenders' shares in Gulf Canada are held through A&amp;G Resources, a company formed by a group of O&amp;Y lenders, and will eventually be sold. The sharp fall in oil prices is, however, the latest challenge to Gulf Canada's recovery.</p>

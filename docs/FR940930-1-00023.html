			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although there are uncertainties in acetone's atmospheric photo-oxidation mechanism and in the other aspects of ozone-related atmospheric photochemistry, one can reasonably deduce, based on the Carter report, that acetone and ethane probably have nearly the same reactivity for most sets of environmental conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional studies have been conducted on the relative reactivity of acetone in Europe. For example, R. G. Derwent and M. E. Jenkins (Hydrocarbons and the Long-range Transport of Ozone and PAN Across Europe,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Atmospheric Environment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , vol 24A, pp 1661&hyph;1678, 1991) used a chemical mechanism to calculate ozone impacts of acetone, ethane, and other VOC for three trajectories across Europe. The photochemical trajectory model the authors employed was developed at Harwell Laboratory (United Kingdom) and was used to calculate the photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) values for 69 organic compounds, including acetone. The POCP values were assigned to VOC species according to a relative scale, with ethylene having a value of 100.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dr. Derwent reported in a letter (January 27, 1994) to EPA that: ``A comparison of POCP's for ethane and acetone in the work of my colleagues at Harwell Laboratory, which incidentally updates the acetone entries in the VOC Protocol Annex, gives 8.2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  4.0 and 9.2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  2.0, respectively.'' The difference between these numbers is not considered to be statistically significant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If acetone is accepted as having negligible photochemical reactivity, exempting acetone from regulation as an ozone precursor could contribute to the achievement of several important environmental goals. For example, acetone can be used as a substitute for several compounds that are listed as hazardous air pollutants (HAP) under section 112 of the Act. Methylene chloride and methyl chloroform are HAP that are used for metal cleaning and for flexible polyurethane foam blowing. Other HAP, such as toluene, are often used as solvents in paints and coatings. Acetone can substitute for these substances in some circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Acetone can also be used as a substitute for ozone depleting substances (ODS) which are active in depleting the stratospheric ozone layer. Under the London Amendments to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer (``Montreal Protocol''), the United States agreed to phase out production and consumption of certain chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) by the year 2000 and methyl chloroform by 2005 (see 58 FR 15016 (March 18, 1993)). In 1990, Congress added title VI to the Act in part to provide for the implementation of this phaseout (see 42 U.S.C. 7671  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The 1990 Amendments specified an initial list of Class I and Class II ODS, authorizing EPA to add compounds to both lists depending on a given compound's potential to contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion, ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . &sect;7671a.) The 1990 Amendments further required phaseout of the production and consumption of Class I ODS by 2000, methyl chloroform by 2002, and Class II ODS by 2030 (see 42 U.S.C. 7671c, 7671d). At the fourth meeting, in 1992, of the parties to the Montreal Protocol in Copenhagen, Denmark, the parties adjusted the phaseout schedules for Class I substances under the Montreal Protocol to phase out Class I CFC and methyl chloroform by 1996. In 1993, EPA proposed to accelerate the phaseout of Class I CFC and methyl chloroform in order to discontinue use of these compounds after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1996 (see 58 FR 15022).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of these phaseout deadlines, there is a need to develop substitutes for ODS. Allowing wider use of acetone will facilitate the transition away from ODS without adversely affecting efforts to control ground level ozone concentrations. For example, chlorofluorocarbon-11 and methyl chloroform have been used as foam-blowing agents in the manufacture of polyurethane foam. These compounds are also used in metal cleaning in the aircraft manufacturing industry. Both CFC&hyph;11 and methyl chloroform are listed as Class I substances under title VI of the Act, i.e., as substances that have the highest stratospheric ozone- depleting potential. Acetone may be able to be used as a foam-blowing agent and cleaning agent in place of these chemicals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

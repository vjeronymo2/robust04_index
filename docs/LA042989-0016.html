			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: MIKE + 2 GREAT SINGERS STILL = A MECHANICAL SHOW  </P> <P> During the Mike + the Mechanics show at the Universal Amphitheater Wednesday  night, you couldn't help feeling sorry for singers Paul Young and Paul Carrack.  They're first-rate rock vocalists, capable of intense expression and excitement  with the right material.  </P> <P> But they're not miracle workers.  </P> <P> The problem is that this band, headed by British bassist/guitarist Mike  Rutherford when he's not working in Genesis, doesn't have any songs these  vocalists can sink their teeth into. They do elevate overly sentimental,  skin-deep tunes like "All I Need Is a Miracle" and "The Living Years," but not  to a level of excellence.  </P> <P> Like Genesis colleague Phil Collins, Rutherford needs a pop/commercial outlet  for material that's not suitable for Genesis. With the Mechanics, he's been  very successful at cranking out soppy, yuppified pop-rock. But he should aim  higher than lowest-common-denominator rock -- and stop wasting the talents of  Young and Carrack. DENNIS HUNT LIVE ACTION: New Order will return to the  Southland, heading a tour also featuring Public Image Ltd. and the Sugarcubes,  with a date at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on June 16. Tickets will go on  sale May 6. . . . Former Husker Du singer/songwriter Bob Mould will be at the  Roxy on May 17. Tickets on sale now. . . . The third annual L.A. Salsa Fest  will take place May 20 and 21 at the John Anson Ford Theatre.  </P></p>

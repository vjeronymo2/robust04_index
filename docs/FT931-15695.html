			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Forecasts derided by new study BUSH administration forecasts of the gains to be derived from a completed Uruguay Round were attacked yesterday by the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think-tank. It estimated the US economy could lose Dollars 36.3bn-Dollars 62.4bn per year. The report will provide ammunition for the many Clinton supporters who oppose any Gatt deal at all or want numerous changes made in the Dunkel text  -the list of compromises proposed by Gatt chief Arthur Dunkel. The ESI projects an annual increase in the US trade deficit of between Dollars 32.3bn and Dollars 37.2bn. It scoffs at an early administration claim that a Gatt deal would have resulted in a Dollars 125bn increase in domestic output in 1991 alone. This would have required Dollars 500bn in increased investment, it says, and about 8 per cent of all US manufacturing would have had to be converted from low- to high-value added activity in one year.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / UK, France block Ukraine reform aid The UK and France are blocking a joint US-German effort to mount an international financial aid package to encourage economic reform in Ukraine. The stand-off is creating further tensions in the transatlantic alliance in conjunction with US criticism of the European Union's efforts to stabilise eastern Europe and former Yugoslavia. Last week, President Leonid Kuchma was given red-carpet treatment in Washington following Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Clinton administration is particularly upset by British resistance to supporting a Dollars 600m (Pounds 365.8m) balance of payments loan to Ukraine. 'We believe that President Kuchma needs a strong vote of confidence from the west, and we are very disappointed with the EU's lack of response,' said a US official. Ukraine is expected to be discussed informally at today's meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, but the decisive meeting will take place among European finance ministers a week later, just before the European Council summit in Essen on December 9 and 10. At stake is whether the EU will provide Ecu85m (Pounds 66.9m) out of the planned Dollars 600m to help to bridge a total Dollars 1bn gap in Ukraine's balance of payments in the fourth quarter of 1994, according to the International Monetary Fund. The money is needed to finance energy imports to keep houses heated, to provide energy for industry, and reduce dependence on nuclear energy. The US has already agreed to 'front-load' the package with Dollars 70m in grants which would rise to Dollars 100m if the EU comes on board. Canada is putting up Dollars 20m and the Dutch are offering Dollars 5m. Without the EU contribution, Japan and Russia will hold back, risking a reignition of inflation and social upheaval, according to an internal IMF assessment. Britain - backed by France, Italy and Belgium - argues that the EU cannot take part in balance of payments lending without the security of an IMF-stand-by loan which contains strict conditions tied to a reform programme. The US and Germany argue that conditions already exist following the disbursement of a Dollars 371m 'systemic transformation facility' - a new financial instrument created to help former communist countries take the first steps to economic reform. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, is taking a particularly hard line. 'The EU is not an international financial institution,' one UK official explained. 'That's the job of the World Bank and the IMF.' France is equally unsure about putting forward an EU loan before an IMF programme is in place. It has argued that Ukraine's main energy suppliers and creditors - Russia and Turkmenistan - provide the bulk of the cash. Italy is pressing for early repayment of outstanding debts. But the US, Germany and the IMF are pushing for an activist policy to help Ukraine whose strategic importance lies in its position next to Russia, its nuclear status, and its faltering nuclear energy industry. Officials point out that, in fact, the EU is only being asked to provide Ecu20m net because Ukraine is supposed to repay Ecu65m before the end of the year. Ukraine's total foreign debt is around Dollars 7bn.</p>

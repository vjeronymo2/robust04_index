According to one of its members, Konstantin Zatulin,  chairman  of the Committee for CIS Affairs and Relations With Compatriots,  the delegation "went practically everywhere and met practically  everyone." "Certain obvious conclusions" of the group were  offered the Duma at the end of the past week, in the form,  specifically, of a draft federal law on a suspension of Russia's  participation in the sanctions against the FRY [Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia].    "We consider it essential that the Duma address to the  parliaments and peoples of the world a message reflecting its  idea of how the Yugoslav conflict should be settled," Konstantin  Zatulin shared his conclusions. "First, an immediate cease-fire,  without any conditions. The second idea is an appeal to  parliaments that they not add fuel to the fire. Finally, the  third initiative concerns a conference with the participation of  the great powers and the Balkan countries, which would discuss,  in particular, the prospects of a lifting of sanctions in  respect to the new Yugoslavia."    [Sharyy] This initiative is, obviously, the main conclusion  that the group of Russian deputies reached in the course of  their trip?    [Zatulin] Yes, and it is reflected in the documents of the  State Duma: that it be recommended that the president, the  government, and the Foreign Ministry adopt vigorous measures  within the UN framework for a repeal of sanctions. I would like  to explain why Carthage, which is to be destroyed, is in this  case to be restored. Sanctions are pernicious and ineffective.  However paradoxical, they have united the Serb people now living  on the territory of various states. Militarily, the prohibitory  measures do not play a big part: The armed might of the Serbs is  great enough. But when it is a question of the position of the  civilian population, the prospect of social conflicts.... Here,  yes, sanctions are simply strangling Yugoslavia. The immorality  of an attempt to bring an entire people to the brink of  extinction is obvious.    That Russia formerly adopted the decision to participate in  the sanctions is a cause of constant internal political  friction. We were in too much of a hurry, disregarding the  country's national interests, and all of Russia's subsequent  diplomatic maneuvers have been clumsy attempts at  self-rehabilitation.    [Sharyy] The Duma occupies a hard-line position in respect  to  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it would seem?    [Zatulin] Deputies structuring their relations with the  diplomats on a confrontational basis is not what I would want.  But we are having to do this, unfortunately: Compliance with the  decision of the State Duma is being monitored, and unless the  Foreign Ministry and the government take the appropriate action,  we shall be forced to pass a law on Russia's unilateral  withdrawal from the regime of sanctions. This is a disputed,  declaratory decision, which will do little, but it will help  Russia preserve its honor. And honor is something in itself. It  is absolutely pointless for our foreign minister to imagine  himself a latter-day George the Dragon-Slayer, who is intent on  lancing socialism and communism in Serbia.    I am concerned for the friendship of Russia and Serbia, but  I  do not believe that friendship can justify everything. What kind  of friendship of Moscow and Belgrade, generally, are we talking  about? The Serbs had and continue to have a desire to rely on  Moscow, but our Foreign Ministry has never endeavored to lend a  hand. Russia cannot allow a people that are related to it to be  reduced to a primitive condition. The Yugoslav conflict has  demonstrated that no one can be confident of his own security  with a hungry, confused neighbor, one armed to the teeth, what  is more. The Serbs, like the Russians, are not in a position to  secure for themselves a decent life but they could perfectly  well spoil the life of others.</p>

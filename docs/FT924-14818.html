			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Deadlock on Gatt may be broken soon DESPITE intense efforts to lower hopes before this weekend's EC-US talks on a Gatt trade agreement, officials in Brussels said yesterday the meetings represent the best shot at a breakthrough in recent memory. But the same EC officials cautioned that narrowing differences on the outstanding issues in agriculture, services and market access remained fraught with difficulty. Concern exists, too, on how to present a potential breakthrough in public. A premature declaration of victory by a beleaguered President Bush or an over-eager UK Presidency of the EC could generate a backlash, either among the Democratic majority in Congress or in Paris, where the French government has warned of the risks of a Gatt 'sell-out'. The talks, starting in Brussels on Sunday, are surrounded by extraordinary secrecy. The European Commission could not reveal yesterday where they will be held, nor how long they will last, only that they may stretch into Monday. Involved are Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC farm commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary. The biggest obstacles on agriculture are how far payments to EC farmers in compensation for big price cuts agreed in the recent Common Agricultural Policy reform should be exempt from progressive cuts under the Uruguay Round 'final act'; and how far the EC must cut the volume of its subsidised farm exports, and the amount of subsidy. Mr Andriessen and Mrs Hills will cover services and market access or 'tariffication'. Later, they may join Mr McSharry and Mr Madigan in four-way talks. The original impetus for the talks came from President Bush who sought them in a letter to Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. One theory is that Mr Bush, who trails Governor Bill Clinton, his Democratic opponent in all the recent polls, views a Gatt deal and its promise of a world economy revival as his secret weapon. Officials also said EC leaders could endorse progress in the talks at the Birmingham summit on October 16, letting Mr Bush and European leaders declare, credibly, their belief that a detailed deal could be reached by the end of the year - in time for the March 1993 deadline for expiry of the administration's 'fast-track' trade negotiating authority.</p>

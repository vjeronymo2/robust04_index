			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Coats firmer Textile group Coats Viyella firmed 4 to 241 1/2 p as at least two securities houses decided that the shares offered a buying opportunity. UBS was reiterating its buy stance on the stock and Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken published a buy recommendation. Mr Khaleeq Taimuri, Carr's textile specialist, argued that the group's premium rating was well justified in the light of its earnings potential, the recovery of the dollar and the containment of losses in Brazil. ICI hardened a penny to 1143p as the soon to be demerged company slapped a gag on a large area of the market ahead of its impending Pounds 1.3bn rights issue. The group needs to raise the money for the creation of a separate pharmaceuticals arm, Zeneca, and the rights issue is expected in June. However, the market has been somewhat surprised at the breadth of the gag, which extends to all its brokers whether they are core advisers or subsidiaries, and whether they are involved in the UK or overseas areas of the cash call. SG Warburg, BZW, Goldman Sachs and Hoare Govett are all being banned from comment. Concern that an area of Smith &amp; Nephew's US business would be hit affected the stock, which closed 4 1/2 lower at 151p. US Surgical, which provides equipment for keyhole surgery, had announced that it was shifting from direct supplier to distributor and there were fears that Smith &amp; Nephew would have to follow the same route. However, an analyst said Smith played a very small part in keyhole surgery and 'marking down the shares was wholly inappropriate'. Reuters Holdings recovered 7 to 1337p after the news and electronic information group announced a deal with its US subsidiary. The first day of dealing in Holliday Chemical Holdings went very well considering the desultory holiday atmosphere in the market. The new shares began trading at 195p and were bought up to 213p, with 12m traded. The utilities areas all suffered from profit-taking, with the water shares especially vulnerable. Anglian declined 6 to 546p, Thames 7 to 556p, Severn Trent 5 to 527p and North West 4 to 528p. SG Warburg appreciated 9 to 649p, still boosted by the prospect of substantial fee income for its participation in the BT III issue later this year. Mirror Group Newspapers approached their issue price, adding 4 at 121p, following a positive results statement earlier in the week. The shares received a further boost from a buy note from NatWest Securities. The house likes the aggressive stance taken by the new editor and management team. A positive statement from Carlton Communications ahead of a forthcoming conference broadcasters meeting helped the shares recover from an oversold position. Carlton is very confident about its Quantel digital manipulation system, which has been doing well, particularly in Japan. The stock ended 9 higher at 747p. BICC shares retreated sharply, closing 13 lower at 343p following heavy turnover of 3.2m after James Capel, the agency stockbroker, was reported as having downgraded the stock. Housebuilders responded to recent surveys hinting at an upturn in sales in recent weeks. George Wimpey rose 6 to 149p, Persimmon 6 to 244p and Wilson Connolly 3 to 166p.</p>

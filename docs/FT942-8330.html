			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Firmer bonds sector helps to lift Dow Wall Street A wave of program-guided buying lifted US stocks near midday yesterday, and a firmer bond market supported share prices through the rest of the afternoon, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 26.09 higher at 3,758.98 and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.79 ahead at 456.48 in moderately heavy New York SE volume of 303m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 2.14 better at 437.04 and the Nasdaq composite added 5.41 at 727.31. Early on, the temptation to book profits on the Dow's net gain of 61 points over the previous two sessions proved too great for some investors. In the morning, the bellwether index softened in listless activity in parallel to a weaker tone in the US Treasury market. The day's economic news was mostly favourable for equities. The Commerce Department said the US trade deficit had narrowed by 15.6 per cent from February to March. Record levels of both exports and imports indicated that the economy was expanding at a healthy pace, economists said. This interpretation was supported by news of a small decline in claims for unemployment benefit last week. Further evidence of a robust economy came from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's monthly survey of business conditions, which showed a moderate acceleration of activity after five months of decline. Best of all for stocks, the bond market held up relatively well amid the data barrage. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government security had reversed course and pushed into positive ground, mostly because of a firming trend in the dollar. The currency rallied from overnight weakness on optimistic remarks by US officials on trade relations with Japan. With other financial markets lending support, the blue chips were free to resume their advance. Most of the Dow components posted moderate gains on the day. Walt Disney was ahead Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 44 1/4 . Semiconductor stocks were in demand after a report that some analysts were predicting a period of sustained growth by the computer industry. Micron Technology climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 33 7/8 and National Semiconductor gained Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 19 7/8 . The car makers were stronger, with General Motors appreciating Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 55 1/4 and Ford Motor Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 59 1/4 . Chrysler put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 47 1/8 after announcing a dividend increase. Woolworth, up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 16 3/8 , turned in a good performance. The stock improved after an internal investigation of accounting irregularities found that no senior executive had sought personal gain. The report was released after the close of trading on Wednesday, when the stock fell sharply on news of disappointing quarterly earnings by the retailer. In telecommunications, AT&amp;T advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 56 3/4 after Bell Atlantic selected the company to supply equipment for a new multimedia network. General Instrument, which also won a contract, jumped Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 59 1/8 , while DSC Communications, which was passed over, plunged Dollars 8 3/8 to Dollars 49 on the Nasdaq.</p>

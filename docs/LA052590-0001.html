			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ACQUITTED SKIPPER LAMENTS CRASH THAT SCUTTLED CAREER  </P> <P> Cmdr. John Cochrane had always figured himself a lifelong Navy man. As skipper  of the destroyer Kinkaid, he dreamed of commanding a carrier group or a  battleship. But, on Thursday, one day after being acquitted of criminal  negligence, he said he realizes those dreams were shattered in a twist of metal  last November when his vessel collided with a Panamanian merchant ship.  </P> <P> "I suspect it will never happen," said Cochrane, 44, who would like to command  a ship again. "It's difficult to convey to someone who hasn't striven to  command, but being in command is one of the most rewarding and satisfying  experiences. I would go back if I could. What I want to do is what I had been  doing before Nov. 12."  </P> <P> Over the past two weeks, during eight days of court-martial proceedings,  Cochrane heard his crew testify about the crash, which killed the Navy  navigator and injured 17 sailors.  </P> <P> Much of the testimony made the ship's crew seem ill-prepared. And Cochrane  himself took the stand to testify about an embarrassing "memory lapse" that  prompted him to give an erroneous account of the accident to an investigating  admiral.  </P> <P> On Thursday, in a 90-minute interview with The Times, Cochrane and his wife,  Suzanne, said that, despite his acquittal, the accident has not only derailed  Cochrane's career but also damaged the carefully wrought world they had  created.  </P> <P> "I likened it to a death -- it was a death to our way of life as we knew it. In  one brief moment, John knew his career would never be the same," said Suzanne,  42.  </P> <P> Cochrane realized as soon as he woke to the alarm on a clear, dark November  morning that disaster had struck his ship by the Strait of Malacca. And, in the  days that followed, he fell into a deep depression -- trying to understand how  the accident had occurred.  </P> <P> "I gladly would have traded places with the navigator. . . . I would much  rather it had been me than him," Cochrane said.  </P> <P> In late March, Cochrane requested permission to retire from the Navy but the  request was denied as high-ranking Navy officials decided to press criminal  charges against him in court-martial proceedings. Today, however, Cochrane says  he wants to stay in the Navy -- probably for two to three more years. And, he  says, he certainly wants to receive his promotion to captain, which is slated  for August.  </P> <P> Cochrane's court-martial does not affect that promotion, which will be awarded  unless it is vetoed by the secretary of the Navy, said Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a  Navy spokesman in Washington.  </P> <P> Cochrane is still uncertain about his plans and has not received his next  assignment, though he requested a posting in San Diego.  </P> <P> "There's an old saying that the reward for a general is not a bigger tent but  command. In the Navy, the job is your reward," said Cochrane, dressed in beige  slacks and a light blue sports shirt, appearing more relaxed than he had been  during the past two weeks.  </P> <P> "When you accept command, you recognize you are going to be held accountable.  They didn't force me to be a commanding officer, I volunteered. I asked. I  worked 20 years for it."  </P> <P> Even now, Cochrane cannot explain how the accident happened, except to point  out the failures of two men upon whom he had relied: the navigator and the  officer of the deck. The two were the cream of his crew, he said.  </P> <P> "That's a mystery," he said. "I'm sure that's the way all tragedies happen. A  whole bunch of things went wrong at the same time. If the officer of the deck  called me, I would have been on the bridge in a flash, and it never would have  happened. People who had not made serious mistakes in the past did so -- I am  at loss to explain."  </P> <P> The navigator had miscalculated and told him the ship would arrive in one of  the world's busiest straits about 10 a.m., so Cochrane had scheduled a  navigation briefing for the morning. But, in fact, the Kinkaid arrived at 5  a.m. -- while its captain and navigator slept, and half the appropriate number  of sailors manned the Combat Information Command.  </P> <P> Confused, the officer of the deck tried to figure out the destroyer's location.  He ordered more than four course changes -- including one of 45 degrees and one  that put the ship on the wrong side of the shipping lanes. But the officer  neglected to call Cochrane -- though he had orders to do so with any course  changes or questions.  </P> <P> On the night of the crash, Cochrane was sleeping in the cabin only yards from  the bridge, and he woke to the piercing alarm. Pulling on his trousers, he  reached for a shirt and realized in a flash that he had no time to put it on.  Instead, he dashed for the bridge. Halfway there, the ship lurched. The  merchant vessel had punched a 56-by-15-foot hole in the Kinkaid's side.  </P> <P> Cochrane realized he was too late.  </P> <P> He scrambled to the bridge. He issued orders to douse the three fires that had  broken out and to rescue the five men who had tumbled into the water. And he  tried to find the injured.  </P> <P> "In that one instant when the ship lurched, I realized that things would never  be the same again," Cochrane said.  </P> <P> Although he did not have to issue a statement to the investigating crew aboard  his ship, he felt obligated to explain what had happened, he said. But he could  remember nothing, he said.  </P> <P> In looking at the charts, he figured that the Kinkaid would reach the Strait of  Malacca about 5 a.m. So he issued a statement saying he knew it would arrive  early morning.  </P> <P> "You just don't say, 'I don't know' or 'I can't answer.' I felt complete  responsibility," Cochrane said. "It was inconceivable to me that Sean (McPhee,  the navigator) hadn't told me. It was so out of character. The error was by  several hours. I just wanted to cooperate. I didn't feel I was construing what  had happened. Sean had always told me; there was no reason to believe he didn't  this time.  </P> <P> "If I had been more my usual self, I wouldn't have made the statement. But that  would have looked terrible. I thought I was remembering when I looked at the  chart. I was trying to explain what had happened. I recognized at the time that  the statement I was making was very damaging but it was inconceivable to me to  lie. No way."  </P> <P> But, within 10 days, Cochrane realized that his statement was incorrect and  that, in fact, the navigator had told him the ship would arrive that morning at  10 a.m., he said.  </P> <P> "I didn't double-check him -- he was a reliable officer," said Cochrane,  wearily. Cochrane said he was able to jog his memory by talking with his  executive officer, who said the navigator had suggested an early-morning  briefing before reaching the strait.  </P> <P> The charts also contained a note that Cochrane said he had directed the  navigator to write about going into column formation with another ship before  entering the strait at mid-morning.  </P> <P> Within days, Cochrane said, he realized that his statement was in error and  that he had made it because he had felt so guilty.  </P> <P> "Because I felt so responsible, I was ready initially to plead guilty to  anything," Cochrane said. "I was the commanding officer, and therefore, by  definition, I was guilty. But, talking to senior officers, I realized there was  a difference between responsibility and criminal liability. I decided I was not  a criminal, and that I was not going to just roll over and be branded as one."  </P> <P> From that point on, Cochrane began the battle to salvage his career. He offered  to resign rather than endure a court-martial. But that offer was refused. Then  he braced himself for the ordeal of spilling out the details before a courtroom  of how he ran his ship.  </P> <P> Appearing poised but strained, he sat through the hearing, watching as 21 years  of accomplishments threatened to dissolve. And, when the judge announced that  Cochrane was not guilty of dereliction of duty and negligently endangering his  ship, the skipper gave a weak smile.  </P> <P> "I knew I was not guilty," said Cochrane, his face flushed. "And I'm not  bitter. I still love the United States Navy."  </P></p>

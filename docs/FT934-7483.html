Thus we have the somewhat pricey - Pounds 125 a copy - Higher Education Financial Yearbook, the work of Noble &amp; Co, the small Edinburgh issuing house, which has produced it with the Times Higher Education Supplement. Noble &amp; Co compiled its data base on higher education through giving colleges financial advice and running business expansion schemes for student accommodation.

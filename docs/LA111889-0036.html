			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND TV;  </P> <P> LECH WALESA ON 'NEWSMAKER SATURDAY'; 'TILL WE MEET AGAIN' SWEEPS IN ON CBS  </P> <P> As usual during those infamous ratings sweeps, it is the best of times and the  worst of times on television this weekend. While Lech Walesa visits the United  States, the three major networks and PBS trot out some of their heaviest  ammunition in the battle for ratings.  </P> <P> Walesa will appear with CNN journalists Charles Bierbauer and Ralph Begleiter  on "Newsmaker Saturday" today at 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. Meanwhile, "Sunday  Morning" reports on Walesa's life history and his U.S. visit on Sunday at 8  a.m. on Channels 2 and 8.  </P> <P> Sunday at 9 p.m., CBS (2)(8) unveils the first installment of a five-hour  miniseries based on Judith Krantz's novel "Till We Meet Again." NBC (4)(36)(39)  counters with Raymond Burr again starring as the unbeatable attorney in "Perry  Mason: The Case of the All-Star Assassin." And ABC (7)(3)(10)(42) plays it safe  with Bette Midler and Shelley Long in the 1987 feature "Outrageous Fortune."  </P> <P> Perhaps the weekend's best bet, however, is the first of "Masterpiece  Theatre's" new, four-part adaptation of Charles Dickens' "A Tale of Two  Cities," Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channel 28 and 15, 8 p.m. on Channels 50 and 24.  James Wilby, Xavier DeLuc and Serena Gordon star. STEVE WEINSTEIN  </P></p>

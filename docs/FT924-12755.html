			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / The European Market: E Europe entices the bold - Expansionist western retailers face rough ride FOR western retailers the nascent consumer markets of eastern Europe are tempting the bold and taunting the wary. The prospect of converting 400m eager consumers into loyal shoppers is encouraging many retailers to invest in the region. But the drawbacks of exposing themselves in countries with low incomes and uncertain prospects are growing more evident by the day as the former Yugoslavia disintegrates further and hyper-inflation stalks the region. In a report published today the consultants Corporate Intelligence Group attempt to analyse and assess the collective experience of the western retailers who have pioneered investment in eastern Europe. 'The lesson is that no one has had an easy ride, and if you are going into the region do not expect one. But the companies we talked to were universally optimistic about the long term,' said Mr Clive Grant, one of the report's authors. About 90 western retailers have invested in eastern Europe, although some ventures amount to little more than attempts to test the water. However, 40 companies have begun trading in more than one country, with the total number of separate retail operations reaching 181. German companies have been the most active investors, accounting for a third of western retail operations in eastern Europe. Austrian retailers have also moved quickly into the market - often re-establishing trading links with businesses that existed before communism took over. Following some way behind in investment terms are retailers from the US, Canada, UK, France and Italy. 'It is clear that there is a pull factor operating here,' Mr Grant said. 'Retailers say they cannot afford not to be there; to wait would be too late. But there is also a push factor in that many western companies are seeking to escape the restraints of saturated home markets.' Retailing investments come in many forms, ranging from joint ventures, to franchising and acquisitions. One of the most interesting approaches comes from ComputerLand, the Californian-based computer retailer, which has opened 25 franchised outlets in the region, including seven in Russia. The company found it difficult to find suitable local franchisees and had to call on a Russian emigre already working for ComputerLand in the US to open its first Russian stores. It has also had problems finding suitable sites and has had to open showrooms in a Moscow hotel lobby and on the eighth floor of an office building in Warsaw. In spite of the obstacles, ComputerLand believes it can entrench itself in the region's rapidly developing computer markets and secure a strong foothold for long-term growth. Other western companies are trying to implement the same strategy in other retail sectors. For example, the Swedish Ikea group has invested heavily in five furniture stores in Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, while Ahold, the Dutch food retailing group, is developing the Mana supermarket chain in Czechoslovakia where it now has 11 stores. German retailers such as Tengelmann, Quelle and Otto Versand are also gearing themselves up for significant expansion in eastern Europe. K-Mart, the US discount retailer, is likely to invest up to Dollars 100m (Pounds 58.1m) over the next three years developing its profile in Czechoslovakia. In May K-Mart bought a 76 per cent stake in the MAJ department store in the heart of Prague and is negotiating to buy another 11 stores. The CIG report highlights the substantial differences between national markets and suggests that Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland offer the most attractive opportunities - in the short term, at least. The Hungarian retail sector has proved particularly dynamic. Between 1986 and 1991 the number of shops doubled to 112,600, with the private sector's share of retail outlets climbing from 37 per cent to 60 per cent. However, the foreign share of the domestic market is estimated to have grown above 20 per cent - triggering local discontent. Other challenges confronting western retailers in the region include bureaucratic delays, an unpredictable and rapidly changing legal and commercial framework, cultural and linguistic complications, the pervasive influence of the black market, and difficulties in establishing title to properties. Although the risks may appear high, CIG says that retailers entering the region initially face lower levels of local competition than they do when moving into markets in more developed countries. As for the longer term, the report suggests one of the most fascinating features of the eastern European retail scene will be to see how western retailers react as they compete against each other directly for the first time on neutral ground.

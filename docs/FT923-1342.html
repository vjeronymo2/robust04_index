			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Tesco fails to please FIRST-HALF figures from Tesco were below analysts' expectations and the shares were held back by belief that the group will not fare as well as some of its rivals in the second half of the year. Many analysts downgraded the shares, in spite of an increased dividend, a 9 per cent rise in sales, and higher pre-tax profits. Most lowered full-year forecasts by around 5 per cent to the Pounds 560m to Pounds 580m range. Tesco's problem is its perceived comparison with Argyle and J. Sainsbury. Mr Phillip Dorgan at Goldman Sachs said: 'In like-for-like sales, Tesco suffers because its concentration of customers, in the C2 and DE bracket, has suffered more from the recession. While the shares may look cheap at this price, Argyll and Sainsbury do not look expensive.' Nomura took a more positive view. Moving to a buy stance, analyst Mr Andy Hughes said: 'If the economy begins to recover more quickly than forecast a week ago, then Tesco will be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the foods sector. This is not a company that has lost its way overnight.' Tesco shares eased a penny to 224p, Sainsbury climbed 19 to 456p and Argyll rose 9 to 335p. Greycoat shock Troubled property group Greycoat saw its share price more than halve at one stage after announcing that it would not pay its promised final dividend. The company cited its need 'to take a stringently prudent view with regard to preserving the group's cash resources'. Analysts saw it as a sign that the banks, whose credit lines are keeping the company alive, had taken a firm line over the payments. Mr Graham Stanley at County NatWest commented: 'It is a sensible move considering the company could not afford to pay a dividend in the first place. But a lot of investors came into the company on assurances from the board that the dividend would be paid. It will do nothing for the board's credibility.' The shares, which opened at 21p, crumbled to 8p before recovering to close at 14p, a fall of 7 on the day. Queens Moat deal Queens Moat Houses, which started the day at 39p, continued its volatile run following an agency cross by James Capel at 32p. Dealers reported more of the rumours about the financial state of the hotel group which first surfaced last week, when they drove the shares down to 26p. At the beginning of June, they stood at 90p. Mr Mark Finnie at County NatWest said: 'There are a lot of nervous holders of the stock; worries remain about both the level of debt and the direction of the company.' Capel crossed 9m shares, taking the day's volume to 25m and making the stock the second most heavily traded of the day. It finished at 33 1/2 p. Tarmac up sharply The housebuilding/contracting sector provided three out of the market's top four performers, in Tarmac, Wilson (Connolly) and Taylor Woodrow, which jumped 11.4 per cent, 10.9 per cent and 10.2 per cent respectively after the percentage point reduction in UK interest rates. Dealers said the cut, although expected by the market, had 'introduced a note of optimism in a housebuilding sector that has been totally bombed out for more than 18 months'. The sector was already up and running from the outset as news filtered into the market that Tarmac, one of the UK's biggest volume housebuilders, had maintained its interim dividend - against most expectations that it would be sharply reduced - and further cut back capacity in its housebuilding and quarrying businesses. Two weeks ago Tarmac announced a heavy rationalisation of its brickmaking unit. Tarmac strengthened 8 to 78p on the news, amid frantic trading activity which saw more than 27m shares change hands, the most heavily traded stock of the day. An agency cross at 263p a share proved the trigger for a substantial rise in Wilson Bowden, which eventually settled a net 10 higher at 286p. Wilson (Connolly) ended 13 up at 132p and Taylor Woodrow was 6 ahead at 65p. Brewer Whitbread completed its 'beer orders' - the government instructions to reduce its holdings in particular drinks groups - selling Pounds 45m worth of investments and reinvest-ing Pounds 30m in other regional brewers. The Whitbread Investment Company (WIC) reduced its holdings in Boddington, steady at 174p on turnover of 15m, JA Devenish, a penny up at 240p, and Marston Thompson &amp; Evershed, off 3 at 210p. Beneficiaries of the WIC buying spree included Vaux, 2 firmer at 165p, Whitbread 'A', 12 ahead at 436p, and Allied- Lyons, up 12 at 636p. The cut in UK interest rates triggered a surge in the clearing banks, where National Westminster advanced 15 to 349p on 11m shares dealt and Lloyds 15 to 450p on 2.8m. HSBC climbed 13 to 409p. The merchant banking and fund management areas attracted further persistently strong support as equity markets continued to climb. SG Warburg, whose shares have outperformed the rest of the merchant banks and the wider equity market in recent weeks, shot up 14 to 511p amid vague suggestions that the UK's leading merchant banking and fund management group may well be on the receiving end of a merger proposal from one of the top US investment banks. Kleinwort Benson, whose securities business is thought to have performed creditably during the recent turmoil in the markets, rose 14 to 284p. Hambros gained 6 at 244p and Schroders 13 at 1228p. Insurers shared in the general euphoria surrounding the UK equity market. Sun Alliance moved ahead 7 to 287p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 9.7m shares and Royal advanced 12 to 160p, both sustained by hopes that the reduction in interest rates would minimise domestic mortgage indemnity losses. Preliminary profits in excess of the most optimistic forecasts and a higher than expected dividend prompted good buying interest in Lloyd Thompson, the insurance broker, which appreciated 15 to 222p. A series of hefty individual trades towards the close left Willis Corroon 7 better at 192p. Shares in the chemicals sector were among the best performers of the day as investors took stock of the favourable currency movements towards the export-led industry. Hoare Govett yesterday moved from a neutral to an overweight stance on the sector. Among the main movers, BOC surged 24 to 708p, Courtaulds 27 to 517p, ICI 32 to 1187p and Laporte 25 to 556p.

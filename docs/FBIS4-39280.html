			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "Russia, the United States, and </F> China Unanimous in Demands on North Korea"]    [Text] President Bill Clinton has said that the United  States, Russia, and China are unanimous in the opinion that the  armament of North Korea with nuclear missiles must be prevented  and can unite the whole world community around themselves in  imposing economic sanctions on Pyongyang.    This opinion was voiced in an interview which the U.S.  President gave to Tom Brokaw, a leading NBC TV commentator, on  board a U.S. warship off the Normandy coast. Clinton defended  his administration's foreign policy, claiming that it takes a  long time to elaborate a long-term foreign policy because the  world situation since the end of the Cold War is not black and  white and is completely unparalleled.    "The main thing is that we have not gone away, we have  become  involved (in maintaining international peace)," the president  said, speaking about the foreign policy strategy which will soon  be presented to the public.    In Clinton's opinion, the DPRK has no grounds for  considering  an economic blockade an act of war and will not take actions  against South Korea or Japan. In reply to Tom Brokaw's question  on whether the administration's indecision over Bosnia and Haiti  will not have the effect of toughening Pyongyang's position,  Clinton said that he believes that this will not happen because  North Korea "will get a very clear signal" from the group of  states interested in observing the principles of the  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>

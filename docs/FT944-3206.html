			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Veba plans to invest DM30bn in five years Veba, the energy-based conglomerate, will invest DM30bn (Dollars 19bn) over the next five years, under a plan which will see the group reduce its exposure in cyclical businesses such as chemicals and focus on becoming a key player in European telecommunications. About 40 per cent, or DM12.1bn, would be spent on investments in PreussenElektra, the group's biggest division and Germany's second biggest utility. A further DM2.1bn would be spent on telecoms, but the company said that on top of the investment budget another DM8bn was available 'for specific acquisitions or to start up partnerships'. Some of that money could be spent on finding an experienced international partner for Veba's expanding telecoms operation. The company had hoped to find a partner by the end of this year but said that a decision was now likely in January. The group said it would continue to scale down its activities in chemical commodities and concentrate the business more on specialities. As part of its strategy to branch out into telecoms, Veba has already approached ARD and ZDF, the two publicly-owned television stations, with an offer to provide an alternative network which would have an expected turnover of up to DM80m. The company said it hoped Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the minister for post and telecommunications, would approve Veba's application for the venture within the next few months, marking the first time that the two channels would be able to work with a company other than Deutsche Telekom, the monopoly soon to be privatised. However, the ministry said it had told Veba that no decision would be likely in the near future and that a broader decision about how to deal with so-called alternative networks would not be made until the middle of next year.</p>

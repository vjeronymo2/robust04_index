			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On the 50th anniversary of the presentation of the  11 January manifesto demanding independence, the three national  democratic parties--the Socialist Union of Popular Forces,  Istiqlal, and the Organization of Popular Democratic  Action--issued a historic statement demanding that democracy be  strengthened in the country by implementing a series of  political points and reforms. The following is the text of the  historic statement:    In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.    The 50th anniversary of the presentation of the manifesto  demanding independence and democracy falls on 11 January 1994.    It is an occasion on which the three democratic  parties--Istiqlal, the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, and  the Organization of Popular Democratic Action--stand up to  evaluate the conditions that Morocco faces in future years as it  stands on the threshold of the 21st century after a half-century  during which its people have continued the struggle to realize  their goals of liberation, democracy, and social justice in the  full sense.    While recognition of political independence was achieved due  to the struggle of the king and the people in full harmony,  building a free national state in the framework of  constitutional monarchy and on the principles of political,  economic, social, and cultural democracy is still faltering 38  years after the declaration of independence and has not taken a  decisive course toward concrete realization.    Sensing their responsibilities after the crisis through  which  Morocco has been passing, with the tremendous challenges this  has presented, the three democratic parties renew their pledge  to continue the struggle to fulfill the goals of the National  Charter (the manifesto of 11 January 1944) in its spirit and  aspirations, to embark forcefully to save the country from the  dangers that threaten it, and to establish conditions for  democratic change in the framework of a sincere national  agreement that lays the foundation for the elements of a modern  democratic state, embodies the principle of popular sovereignty,  and lays a firm basis for a strong, progressive Morocco.    True democracy can free the country from perversions such as  widespread injustice, corruption, bribery, exploitation of  influence, illegitimate wealth, and plundering of the people's  money, land, and resources.    True democracy can end human rights violations, protect  public and private freedoms, guarantee citizens' rights to free  and fair elections and their right to food, work, education,  medical care, and housing, and provide equal opportunity for all  to raise the physical and spiritual level of their lives under  the aegis of mutual responsibility and social justice.    True democracy can confront the requirements for continued  economic and social development and for enabling Moroccan  society to open up to the requirements of scientific and  cultural development in connection with the changes that the  international community is experiencing in all economic,  geostrategic, technological, and cultural areas. These things  make it imperative for our country to apply democracy as an  absolute necessity for winning the challenges of the future and  responding to the aspirations of coming generations.    Calling to mind the stages of the democratic struggle to  bring about the constitutional and political reforms that the  masses of the Moroccan people have never ceased hoping to  achieve, the three democratic parties declare their fidelity to  their previous demands. They confirm that one of the first  reforms that must be made is continued work to approve new  constitutional changes to guarantee greater balance of powers  and firmly establish executive, legislative, and judicial  structures that satisfy all the conditions for credibility,  effectiveness, and responsibility. Specifically, this requires:    --Electing all members of Parliament by direct, general  election.    --Creating a supreme constitutional body independent of the  government apparatus and having full power to oversee the  election process, regulate all its stages, and guarantee its  freedom and fairness.    --Creating a supreme accounting council to be raised to the  level of a constitutional body with the role of controlling  implementation of the state budget, monitoring the public  sector, and combatting all forms of waste and corruption.    --Founding special constitutional bodies charged with  participating in defining public policy in various fields: such  as the Supreme Council on Culture and Information, the Supreme  Council on Defense, and the Supreme Council on Education, in  addition to the Economic and Social Council whose creation has  been approved in principle.    As they celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 11 January  1944  manifesto with pride and steadfastness, the three democratic  parties proclaim that they will remain devoted to the spirit of  the independence and democracy manifesto and will adhere to  united action as a way to build a democratic, progressive  Morocco. They call on the masses of the Moroccan people and all  its vital forces that believe in democratic change to join  consciously and responsibly in demanding an end to the attempts  at cheating and falsification that were behind our country's  failure to achieve the cultural development we seek and to  realize the ambitions of our successive generations for  modernization and prosperity under a constitutional,  social-democratic monarchy in which Moroccans enjoy freedom,  justice, equality, and a dignified life.     -  Mohamed Boucetta, general secretary, Istiqlal Party    -  Mohamed Yazghi, deputy first secretary, Socialist Union    -  Mohamed Ben Said, general secretary, Organization of [Popular  Democratic] Action</p>

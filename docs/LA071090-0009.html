			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LANDFILL FOES MARCH ON ANTONOVICH'S OFFICE  </P> <P> A small band of north San Fernando Valley residents, carrying bags of garbage,  marched Monday to the office of County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, urging that  he oppose expansion of Sunshine Canyon Landfill above Granada Hills.  </P> <P> Although they had planned to dump their plastic bags of trash at the doorstep  of Antonovich's office, the dozen adults in the group quietly obeyed security  officers who ordered them to leave the bags outside as they entered the County  Hall of Administration to present their demands to Antonovich.  </P> <P> Dawson Oppenheimer, Antonovich's press secretary, told the group that  Antonovich wants to hear the county Regional Planning Commission's  recommendation before reaching a decision on the controversial expansion of the  privately owned landfill.  </P> <P> No date has been set for the commission to rule on a plan by the landfill  owner, Browning-Ferris Industries, to more than double the size of the existing  230-acre landfill north of Granada Hills.  </P> <P> Rona Berger, a Granada Hills resident and leader of the group, said the  homeowners would return July 16 to hear Antonovich's position on the dump.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 14, BNS -- Leaders of the parties in  Estonia's ruling coalition signed a document Tuesday [12 April]  that establishes the principles for working closely between the  five parties in the future. The Liberal Democrats, the Rural  Centrists, the Estonian National Independence Party, the Social  Democratic Party, and the National Assembly Party "Pro Patria"  in the document take the obligation to abstain from making any  statements which could be interpreted as breaking up the  coalition link.    The document stipulates that dissenting opinions by the  parties' factions in the parliament, by the government or the  parties are binding to the coalition, whereas dissenting  opinions by members of the factions and Cabinet members are only  advisory. The same document says that the body presenting a  dissenting opinion of binding character has the right for a veto  of deferment, applicable to one and the same bill only once.    The paper signed on Tuesday is a working document that  concerns above all the parties of the ruling coalition, Prime  Minister Mart Laar said in his comments at today's press  conference. The coalition parties felt that rules for their  relations had to be established in a document, he added.</p>

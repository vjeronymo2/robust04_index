			<p>Financial   Situation   <F P=102> 94CH0225A Budapest PESTI HIRLAP in Hungarian 26-27 Mar 94 p 1 </F> <F P=103> 94CH0225A </F> <F P=104>  Budapest PESTI HIRLAP </F> <F P=105>  Hungarian </F> CSO     [Text] It is common knowledge that the cabinet at its  Thursday meeting considered the requests of the public-service  media for budgetary grants, but decisions on the requests were  deferred. According to the government spokeswoman's news  briefing, the cabinet considered the operations of the media too  expensive because, as she put it, incomprehensibly huge requests  amounting to billions of forints have been presented for several  objectives. We interviewed the media chiefs about the  special-purpose grants.    Gabor Nahlik, vice president of Hungarian Television [MTV]  vested with full presidential authority, said that among the  requests his institution presented there were indeed items  bearing price tags running to billions, but they were for  objectives essential to MTV, in view of parliament's failure to  make provisions for them in this year's budget. These objectives  included: the conversion of color TV broadcasting from the SECAM  system now used, to the PAL system that conforms to the European  standard; compensation for the higher transmission charges due  to public-service TV programs that could not be financed through  sponsors or from revenue generated by commercials; and a  budgetary supplement to the subscription fees that were an  uncertain source of revenue.    Laszlo Csucs, the vice president of Hungarian Radio vested  with full presidential authority, claimed that it could be  safely said his institution was not placing a heavy financial  burden on the government. Even after parliament's failure to  make provisions for Hungarian Radio in this year's budget, the  government had given Hungarian Radio special-purpose grants of  only 104 million forints, whereas Hungarian Radio's operating  budget totaled nearly 6 billion forints. The vice president also  said that it was strange for the government spokeswoman to lump  together in her briefing the financing of Hungarian Radio with  that of MTV and Duna TV respectively. In Hungarian Radio's case  there was no question of incomprehensibly huge requests  amounting to billions; Hungarian Radio had requested merely 346  million forints in all, to support foreign broadcasts and  Hungarian Radio's ensembles. There could be no doubt that the  request was justified, Laszlo Csucs pointed out. Foreign  broadcasts were in the national interest. And the ensembles,  besides serving the radio, also enhanced the nation's prestige  with their world-level performances and augmented the nation's  cultural assets.</p>

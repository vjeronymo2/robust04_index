			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Akio Takahata] </F>   [Text] Washington, 13 Jun -- Concerning the DPRK's  announcement on 13 June of its withdrawal from the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN diplomatic source indicated:  "The act is in line with a carefully-worked out plan for phased  steps to deal with moves of the United States and Europe." The  DPRK's withdrawal from the IAEA will not immediately lead to its  official secession from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  (NPT). Pyongyang's decision to pull out of the IAEA is  considered an act aimed at upgrading its diplomatic cards by  showing the United States and the United Nations its readiness  "to withdraw from the NPT anytime."    The purpose of participating in the IAEA is to promote  exchanges, and to study knowhow and technology for the peaceful  use of nuclear power -- which is a different purpose from  joining the NPT. Also, according to the rules, the DPRK's  withdrawal from the IAEA will not immediately lead to its  departure from the NPT.    In a government statement, North Korea referred to its  "special position" (of holding up a decision to withdraw from  the NPT). It is necessary for Pyongyang to maintain this  special position to continue to reject demands to accept nuclear  inspections in accordance with safeguard arrangements, while  remaining in the NPT.</p>

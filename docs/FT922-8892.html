			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Pilkington to put Pounds 40m into Polish glass plant PILKINGTON, the UK glass group, is preparing to invest Pounds 40m to help build Poland's first float glass plant. The deal would represent one of the largest investments so far by a foreign company in Polish industry. Pilkington and its Polish partner, the state-owned Sandomierz glass maker, started serious negotiations after signing a letter of intent in December 1990. The talks are now close to completion. The UK company expects to take a stake of about 40 per cent in the venture, which is likely to cost Pounds 100m altogether. International development agencies, including the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, will also make a substantial contribution. Pilkington showed its interest in the Polish market last week when it announced a much smaller deal to buy 45 per cent of International Glass Poland, a sales and distribution business. This will enable it to sell float glass imported into Poland from Pilkington plants in western Europe, until the new factory is ready - probably in 1994. Until now the Polish industry has used the antiquated sheet glass manufacturing process, which has been superseded in the west by float glass technology developed by Pilkington in the 1950s. Only float glass achieves the quality required by the western construction and car industries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] South Africa's ambassador to the United States, Mr.  Harry Schwarz, says that although weapons sanctions have been  lifted there are still restrictions on the weapons trade with  Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] and Denel.  Speaking in a radio interview he said that this was because  American legislation did not allow American companies to trade  with companies which had been blacklisted. He said that the two  South African companies have still not been removed from the  weapons blacklist despite the lifting of sanctions. Mr. Schwarz  confirmed that a number of South Africans had been arrested for  drug smuggling in various American cities and were awaiting  trial. It's believed that the suspects were acting as couriers  in the United States and Europe for African drug smugglers.</p>

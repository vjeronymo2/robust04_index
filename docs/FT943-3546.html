			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: SmithKline firm The market decided that SmithKline Beecham had secured a good price for the US over-the-counter arm of its recently acquired Sterling Health business. The shares shrugged off interest rate concern to move up 7 1/2 before closing 4 ahead at 425 1/2 p. SmithKline sold the business to Bayer, of Germany, which some analysts believed had been prepared to pay a premium for the emotional content of the acquisition. The company, which invented aspirin, lost title in the US after the First World War as a result of allied reparation demands. Mr Robin Gilbert of Panmure Gordon had factored in between Dollars 600m and Dollars 700m for the disposal and was surprised that it had achieved Dollars 1bn. He said the move would go a considerable way to dispersing the gloom over SmithKline's gearing, which had leapt to a very high level following the Dollars 2.7bn acquisition of the entire Sterling Health business.</p>

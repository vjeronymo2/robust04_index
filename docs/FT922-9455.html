			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Smithfield site row resolved in court THE High Court yesterday resolved a centuries-old dispute between the Crown and the Corporation of London concerning the Smithfield meat market in favour of the corporation. Mr Justice Hoffmann decided that the corporation owned a plot of land between St Bartholomew's Hospital and the meat market in the north of the City of London, the ownership of which has been contested for at least 350 years. The dispute came to a head with an idea to move the meat market and redevelop the Smithfield site. Moving the outdated market has been supported by many tenants, concerned about the rising costs of remaining in the City, and by alternative sites, such as New Covent Garden, the fruit and vegetable market in Battersea. Nevertheless the Corporation of London is determined to keep the meat market in the City and it recently approved a Pounds 50m refurbishment programme to comply with EC hygiene regulations. The land was given to the City under a charter granted by Henry VI in 1444. The High Court yesterday rejected the Crown's argument that it had retained the ownership of the site under the 1638 charter. The judge said that his reading of the charter was that it had given Smithfield to the City, although for the limited use of holding markets and fairs.</p>

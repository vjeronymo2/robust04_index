			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISCOVERY: WAGNER HOUSE  </P> <P> Have you had enough of mall madness during this holiday season? Are you looking  for a gift that doesn't look as if it came off a production line? Consider  doing your shopping at Wagner House in Placentia, a historic home converted  into a retail outlet and filled with collectibles, books, crafts and flowers.  </P> <P> Visitors wander through the home's 10 theme rooms. One upstairs bedroom offers  the Children's Book Nook, another features Lladro, Hummel and other figurines  in antique armoires, while still another contains homemade Christmas ornaments  and toys. The theme is even carried into the house's upstairs bathroom, where  visitors will find towels and scented soaps for sale.  </P> <P> "They (visitors) are intrigued by the house itself, as well as the unique  offering of gifts and collectibles," said Georgia Klinkers, one of Wagner  House's three owners and managers. "We've tried to find things that are not  available in a mall."  </P> <P> The rambling two-story house was built in 1920 by Charles Wagner. It remained  in the family until the late 1970s, when it was sold to a local church,  according to Klinkers. It was used as a retreat center until last March when  Klinkers and her partners bought it. Wagner House opened for business on July  24.  </P> <P> Lunch and afternoon tea are served in the dining room, which adjoins a small  outdoor patio. A harpist performs every Thursday evening in the dining room  through the end of December.  </P> <P> Hours: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays; 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday. Closed Sunday.  Lunch is served from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and tea is served from 2 to 4 p.m.  Monday through Saturday  </P> <P> Address: 902 E. Yorba Linda Blvd., Placentia  </P> <P> Telephone: (714) 524-7011  </P></p>

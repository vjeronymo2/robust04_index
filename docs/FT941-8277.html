			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Franc fares Air travel in the African franc zone is set to become a lot more expensive. Airlines operating in the zone plan to increase their fares by up to 70 per cent after the January devaluation in the CFA zone. Members of the Francophone Association of Air Transport last week approved a 60 per cent increase in round-trip fares, a 70 per cent rise in one way fares and a 100 per cent increase in freight fares. Air France, Royal Air Maroc, Air Afrique and Cameroon Airlines are among the carriers seeking the rises, which need the approval of their governments.</p>

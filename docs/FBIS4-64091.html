			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mechyslaw Hryb, chairman of the Belarusian </F> Parliament, by Anatoliy Gulyayev; date and place of interview  not stated: "Orientation to the East"]    [Text] The 13th session of the Republic of Belarus Supreme  Soviet ended recently. In addition to the fact that it was the  longest in the entire history of the present corps of deputies  (with intermissions it lasted about five months) it adopted very  important decisions. Our correspondent talks about the results  of the session's work with Mechyslaw Hryb, chairman of the  Belarusian Parliament.    [Gulyayev] The start of this year was marked by the  aggravation of the situation in the republic. As a result the  13th session of the Supreme Soviet dismissed its chairman,  Stanislav Shushkevich, and elected you. Forecasts for the  development of events at the time were very unreassuring.  Various political forces demanded the dissolution of the  Supreme Soviet as being unable to make the decisions the  republic needed. But then suddenly the same Supreme Soviet  adopted the republic's constitution and a whole series of very  important documents. What happened?    [Hryb] What should have happened. The chairman of the  Supreme Soviet, elected to the post through the will of the  majority of deputies, set himself against that majority. In  this situation there could be no systematic, consistent work.  It is absolutely natural that the majority decided to relieve  him of his post.    But after the replacement of the leadership we managed to  set  up normal, consistent work. As a result of which documents were  adopted that were truly fateful for the republic -- primarily  the Republic of Belarus Constitution. The state's system was  defined as a presidential republic and we managed to single out  the priority of citizens' rights over the state.    All this is extraordinarily important! Let's think about it:  After the collapse of the former structures Belarus was left in  fact without a power. The grassroots did not obey the upper  echelons, the upper echelons paid no attention to the  grassroots, mostly resolving their own problems.    But now that there is a new constitution and a law has been  adopted on the presidential elections and their date has been  set -- at any rate we can now see the path along which we must  travel. We will elect the head of state and accept his oath and  approve the makeup of the government.... That is the process of  creating an effective power has begun. Without losing control  of the country.    [Gulyayev] Mechyslaw Ivanovich, can one say today that  understanding has finally been reached between the branches of  power? After all no effectiveness will be achieved otherwise....    [Hryb] I think I can boldly assert that there has been  consolidation. The main thing is that we have common ideas of  the paths for Belarus' development and a common orientation  toward the East. Moreover, the Supreme Soviet has given the  government the powers it has always sought.    Moreover, the Supreme Soviet intends to render real aid to  the government in resolving the most diverse questions. For  instance, there was an opinion that the parliamentarians should  not be involved with the economy. We broke with that tradition  and recently adopted a presidium decree on backing up the sowing  campaign. Perhaps this decree has not worked completely but our  peasants were provided with fuel and seeds this year.... And  virtually all apart from mineral fertilizers were supplied in  the necessary quantity.    The presidium has now examined the question of housing  cooperative construction. The construction workers do not have  the funds to finish what they have begun, nor do people have the  funds to pay for what has been constructed. But we have found  ways of resolving this problem.    That is the situation is as follows: We are trying to  address the problem, not to avoid it. At a time when the former  Supreme Soviet leadership was saying: The economy is not our  business. But after all, people do not care who helps them live  better -- it is just important to help! And in that sense we  are cooperating and are prepared to continue to cooperate with  the executive power. But of course as long as the government  does not avoid its powers or exceed them....    [Gulyayev] You said you are united with the government in  your orientation toward the East. Here you cannot avoid the  popular question of the ruble zone....    [Hryb] In principle I approve this agreement, only I propose  changing the formulation of some articles. Including the fifth  and eights -- changing them so that it is not necessary to make  changes to our constitution which has only just been born. The  Supreme Soviet may not make such changes and there is no need  for it. I talked with Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin at  the conference of heads of state. They agree that it is  possible to elaborate a text acceptable to both sides.    But as a whole, I repeat, I approve and support this very  good and in my view sensible step which apart from anything else  should help to stabilize the situation in the republic.    [Gulyayev] But today it is also influenced by the election  campaign....    [Hryb] Yes, 19 initiative groups from 19 contenders have  already been registered. I do not know whether many of them  will collect the necessary number of votes to register as a  candidate. But I think that we will get into the Guinness Book  of Records for the number of contenders for the top state post.    And a serious struggle is already under way. Among the  candidates there will probably be people who will not use the  most civilized methods. At any rate attempts to set one  category of the population on another already exist. And the  situation could undoubtedly be aggravated. Although in our view  there are no prerequisites for events to assume an  uncontrollable nature.    In conclusion allow me to wish your readers the very best.  May those who have not yet completed it carry out the sowing  campaign successfully. So that later there is something to  harvest from the fields -- in Belarus and in Russia, wherever  the farmer puts seed into the ground. And, most important, I  wish you stability in your life! So that the peasant can  finally do his noble job in peace.</p>

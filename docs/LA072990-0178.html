			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS PROVIDE THE EXTRA EFFORT, 8-7, NOT EXTRA INNINGS  </P> <P> July hadn't been much of a month for Juan Samuel.  </P> <P> He had struggled at the plate, hitting only .238. He spent a few hours in a  Pittsburgh jail after being involved in a bar fight.  </P> <P> And that was after spending some time on the bench last month when he briefly  lost his starting job.  </P> <P> But with one swing Saturday night, Samuel made up for a lot of frustration.  </P> <P> His bases-loaded single in the ninth inning completed a comeback as the Dodgers  rallied for four runs in that final inning to beat the Atlanta Braves, 8-7,  before 38,022 at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> The Dodgers, who needed 12 innings to beat the Braves Friday night, are nine  games behind the division-leading Cincinnati Reds, the closest the Dodgers have  been since June 22.  </P> <P> Would a division title still require an impossible comeback?  </P> <P> No more so than the one the Dodgers fashioned Saturday.  </P> <P> Behind by three runs, down to their last out with only one base runner, the  Dodgers got their first run of the rally on a single to right by Kirk Gibson  against reliever Tony Castillo.  </P> <P> A single by Kal Daniels brought Mark Grant on in relief. He walked Eddie  Murray, loading the bases.  </P> <P> A soft liner to center by Hubie Brooks over the head of shortstop Jeff Blauser  produced two runs, tying the score.  </P> <P> "I was strong enough to fist it over the infield," Brooks said. "I know I just  needed a base hit, so I didn't want to overswing. I think it was a high  changeup."  </P> <P> Then, after an intentional walk to Mike Scioscia, Samuel, down to his last  strike, delivered another soft liner to center.  </P> <P> "It wasn't pretty, but it got the job done," Samuel said.  </P> <P> "It was a hard slider. He was trying to protect the plate on 0 and 2. It was a  good pitch and I was lucky enough to get the bat on the ball."  </P> <P> Mike Hartley (2-1) got the victory; Grant (1-2) took the loss.  </P> <P> "I tell you, there is going to still be a race," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda  said.  </P> <P> "If we can get it down to seven, we've still got August and September to go."  </P> <P> The Braves got to starter Fernando Valenzuela early. They got two hits and two  walks in the first inning, with a run scoring on Dale Murphy's single.  </P> <P> The Dodgers answered in kind in the first, with two hits and two walks, their  run scoring on a sacrifice fly by Brooks.  </P> <P> Something has seemed to happen to Valenzuela in the middle innings of games  this season and Saturday was no exception.  </P> <P> He had retired eight in a row after Murphy's run-scoring single.  </P> <P> But Murphy reignited the offense when he slammed a double to left field in the  fourth. Blauser followed with a run-scoring single to left to push Atlanta back  ahead.  </P> <P> Francisco Cabrera kept the rally alive with a single. With two out, Atlanta  starter John Smoltz doubled into right field. The pitcher was thrown out trying  to stretch it to a triple, but both runners scored.  </P> <P> Valenzuela's ERA this year in the first three innings of games is 2.40. In the  final three innings, it is 1.06. But in the middle three, even before Saturday,  it was 5.98.  </P> <P> The Dodgers kept Valenzuela in the game with two sixth-inning homers. Murray  hit his 16th of the season into the right-field bullpen with Daniels on base.  Scioscia added his ninth into the right-field pavilion to tie the score.  </P> <P> But not for long.  </P> <P> Valenzuela got right back into trouble in the seventh, giving up an infield  single to Smoltz and a double to Lonnie Smith with one out.  </P> <P> Mark Lemke, playing for injured Jeff Treadway, followed with a sinking liner to  left. Daniels made a desperate dive for it.  </P> <P> It was barely beyond his grasp, however, falling for a two-run double that  proved the last gasp for Valenzuela.  </P> <P> Reliever Jim Gott gave up an RBI single to Ron Gant to close out the scoring  for the Braves.  </P> <P> But the Dodgers were only getting started.  </P> <P> "This is the kind of game than can ruin a team," Smoltz said. "This is the kind  of thing that really hurts your confidence. I'm still waiting to wake up."  </P> <P> It took the Dodgers awhile Saturday, but they woke up in the nick of time.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> While rumors continue to circulate that Kirk Gibson will be traded to either  the Oakland Athletics or Detroit Tigers before Tuesday's trading deadline,  Dodger Vice President Fred Claire insists nothing has been decided. "Kirk is  playing as hard as he can," Claire said, "and given everything he has. Things  change. Kirk recognizes he has a contract. He hasn't ruled anything in or out  and we haven't ruled anything in or out. But it is not a done deal." . . .  Maury Wills, the Dodgers' all-time leading base stealer, has been hired as a  minor league instructor, specializing in stealing and bunting. . . . Atlanta  second baseman Jeff Treadway, suffering from a sore right hand, was a late  scratch from the starting lineup. . . . The four-game series will end today  with a 1 p.m. game pitting the Dodgers' Ramon Martinez (12-4) against Atlanta's  Charlie Leibrandt (4-3).  </P></p>

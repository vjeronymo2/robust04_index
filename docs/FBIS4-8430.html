			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 12 (AFP) -- Russian envoy Vitaly  Churkin and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic headed to the  besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde Tuesday [12 April] as Serb  forces pursued their advance on the town in defiance of NATO  warnings. [passage omitted]    General Bertrand de Lapresle, commander of all UN forces in  former Yugoslavia, said the air strikes should not be blown up  in importance and should not "put in question the well advanced  peace process." [passage omitted]    Major Rob Annink, a spokesman for UNPROFOR in Sarajevo, said  Serb forces had "closed up to the river Drina" all along the  southwest of the Gorazde enclave on Monday and were trying to  push southward from the north, coming close to Bosnian army  positions.

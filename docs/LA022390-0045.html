			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATE CHECKS TOXIC WASTE HAULERS  </P> <P> Trucker Jeff Rodriguez was not bothered about being delayed an hour at the  Castaic weigh station as authorities checked to see that his transport papers  were in order and that his truck was equipped to haul the load of hazardous  waste it was carrying.  </P> <P> "You can't get upset," Rodriguez said as state Department of Health Services  officials pored over his transport documents and inspected his truck at the  weigh station on the Golden State Freeway in Castaic. "It's part of the job.  You get used to it."  </P> <P> Rodriguez was one of more than 50 truckers hauling hazardous waste materials  who were pulled over Wednesday and Thursday at the weigh station just north of  Magic Mountain Parkway and checked to see if they were improperly transporting  hazardous waste, said Richard Varenchik, a Department of Health Services  spokesman.  </P> <P> Some of the inspectors donned protective gear before crawling under or on top  of the big rigs to check for leaks and to take samples of the cargo that would  later be tested to determine if there was any mixing of chemicals.  </P> <P> During the two days of inspections, 12 citations were issued, mostly for  expired hauling permits, Varenchik said.  </P> <P> But Paul M. Baranich, a hazardous waste specialist who participated in the  inspections, said the presence of the inspectors was more important than the  number of citations issued.  </P> <P> "The more we're out there, the more visible we are, the more people get the  idea that we are taking enforcement against people who violate" transportation  laws, Baranich said.  </P> <P> Baranich said his agency conducts about six to seven operations a year in Los  Angeles County. He said the California Highway Patrol had recommended the  Castaic weigh station for an inspection stop because it is one of the busiest  in the state, handling more than 7,000 trucks a day.  </P> <P> Like Rodriguez, most of the truckers stopped didn't seem to mind the  inconvenience, even if citations were issued.  </P> <P> "I figure they got a job to do just like I do," said Jim Wellcome, whose  company, Pacific Environmental Management Corp., was issued a $200 fine for an  expired hauling permit.  </P></p>

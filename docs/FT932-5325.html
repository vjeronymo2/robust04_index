			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Global debate to be held in Manchester MANCHESTER yesterday officially took over from Rio de Janeiro as the venue for global debate on how to reconcile industrial development with environmental issues. There will be two events instead of the single marathon run last year at Rio. A government-run conference in September will address the implemention of policies agreed at last year's Earth Summit in Rio, while a wider 10-day Global Forum involving local authorities, industry and commerce, environmental lobby groups and the general public will take place in June next year. It is hoped that Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, will attend the forum. The government will pay for the September event but the Pounds 4m funding of the forum has yet to be finalised.</p>

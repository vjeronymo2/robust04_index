			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wage cost data unsettle nervous share prices - Market Report Renewed weakness in British government bonds, following the latest data on UK economic progress, brought losses in share prices in London yesterday. Selling was not heavy, and equities were influenced by activity in stock index futures ahead of the expiry tomorrow of important futures contracts. The downturn in gilt-edged securities, and in sterling, discouraged London from joining in the generally favourable response in other markets to the reduction in rates at the Bundesbank money market tender, and to the 0.3 per cent rise in the US consumer price index in February. On the UK front, higher earnings and unit wage trends hinted at inflationary pressures ahead, although a dip of 0.5 per cent in February retail sales was seen as increasing the likelihood of an early base rate cut. Equities opened steadily, taking the German repo rate news comfortably, but turned down when UK bonds began to give way as the pound softened. Share prices reacted quickly to bouts of selling of the March FT-SE 100 contract, which expires tomorrow. The Footsie slipped to 3,242.3 before steadying to show a final reading of 3,242.9, a loss of 24.5 on the day. Trading volume increased again, to 625.5m shares; Tuesday's 616m shares brought a retail worth of Pounds 1.41bn. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 12.1 to 3,890.4, but the second-line issues were somewhat overlooked as the futures markets cast their spell over the blue chip issues. Strategists found difficulty in explaining London's weakness in a session in which other global markets held relatively steady in the face of developments in German and US markets. Mr Nick Knight at Nomura Research suggested that the UK stock market might react unfavourably to the base rate cut widely expected soon, since it might be regarded as a move likely to be reversed later in the year. Mr Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon commented: 'The Bank will not be happy if it is forced into a cut while sterling looks fragile.' Attention is likely to focus this morning on the policy meeting at the Bundesbank. Analysts predict that, in the wake of yesterday's modest trimming in repo yields, a reduction in the upper level Lombard rate is possible today, although the key discount rate is not expected to change. However, UK strategists now believe that the expected cut in UK base rates hinges on domestic political factors, including next month's increase in taxes, and the local authority elections in the UK. Technical factors were blamed for the erratic movements in share prices over the past week. The market is believed to have become oversold at the end of last week and has now become over-sensitive to the price gyrations associated with the expiry of derivatives instruments. In their turn, these futures and options have traded through a difficult period which has seen interest rates ease across Europe, and both the US and UK stock markets undergo a significant correction from their post-Christmas peaks. This has left fund managers and securities houses with substantial futures trading positions which must be either rolled over to the next expiry period or sold out. These pressures are expected to increase as the stock market faces further economic statistics from the UK and the US, culminating early next week in the form of trade figures on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Russian shipment fears undermine nickel prices - Market report Fears of increased Russian NICKEL shipments arriving in London Metal Exchange warehouses and re-deliveries of Russian metal taken out earlier by Chinese operators helped undermine prices yesterday. Bearish chart patterns also played a part as the LME three months price slipped Dollars 112.50 to Dollars 5,677.50 a tonne. COPPER traded at the lower end of its expected Dollars 2,400-Dollars 2,450 range throughout the day as prices struggled to overcome rising LME stock levels, which is a normal occurrence during the slow summer period.

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Woolworth moves into the black WOOLWORTH, the US retailer, yesterday reported a small Dollars 17m profit after-tax in the three months to April 25. This compares with a Dollars 100m loss a year earlier, but the 1991 figure was struck after an accounting-related charge of Dollars 100m, writes Nikki Tait in New York. Sales during the first quarter, the least significant of a retailer's year, fell by 1.5 per cent to Dollars 2.01bn. However, the 1992 figure excludes sales from some 900 US stores which are to close. At the operating level, Woolworth's profits improved by 20 per cent to Dollars 59m.</p>

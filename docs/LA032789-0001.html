			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MOUNTAIN MANEUVERS'  </P> <P> Your editorial "Mountain Maneuvers" (March 4) has to give your readers concern  about your views of the proper role that local government should play in the  acquisition of lands for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.  </P> <P> Stripped to its essentials, The Times is advocating that in this case, the  county should have used its zoning powers to restrict the use of private  property so that the National Park Service could buy it more cheaply for the  park. Knowing that this would be both illegal and unethical, and knowing that  county counsel so advised the board, The Times nonetheless argues that we could  have gotten away with it if we tried hard enough. That is outrageous!  </P> <P> Nowhere in the editorial was there any discussion of the merits of the proposed  project. No mention was made that existing zoning originally would have  permitted as many as 2,500 homes. No mention was made that when I took office  in late 1980, the current General Plan would have permitted up to 234 homes on  the property and that in 1981 the board, on my motion, voted to adopt an  Areawide General Plan that further reduced the allowable densities on the  property. No mention was made that the board's action on March 2 simply  corrected this error while retaining the property in a rural classification.  </P> <P> No mention is made that prior to approving the project, we made several changes  to the design, such as requiring the applicant to delete developable lots so  that a continuous and substantial open-space buffer would be provided along the  entire southern border with the park. Nor do you acknowledge that this project  of less than one home per two acres is very similar to other existing  developments in the area.  </P> <P> The bottom line is that when I first took office in 1980, the property could  have been developed to as many as 234 homes. Today it is limited to only 150,  or less than two-thirds of the 1980 allowance.  </P> <P> The Times would better serve its readers if it spoke out on the meager funding  provided by Congress each year to fund the acquisition if it truly was  concerned about the future of the park. I wonder whether The Times would  support the down-zoning of its Tejon Ranch property if it should be sought in  the future as a federal park. I wonder.  </P> <P> MIKE ANTONOVICH  </P> <P> Supervisor, 5th District  </P> <P> Los Angeles County  </P></p>

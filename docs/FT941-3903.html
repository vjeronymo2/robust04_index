			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BP cuts finding costs to Dollars 3.51 per barrel British Petroleum succeeded last year in lowering its finding costs and more than replacing its oil and gas production, according to the company's annual report. Figures show that the company's reserve replacement ratio for oil and gas was more than 125 per cent. Finding costs fell to Dollars 3.51 (Pounds 2.40) per barrel of oil equivalent, compared with Dollars 4.41 in 1992. Anything under Dollars 4 is considered good, according to analysts. Revisions to existing reserves helped to boost the reserve replacement figure. Such revisions are often made after new production fields are brought on stream. The good finding cost figure reflects, in part, the cost controls which have been imposed in BP's exploration and production division, according to Mr Jeremy Hudson, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.</p>

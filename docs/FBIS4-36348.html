			<p>BFN     [Text] Rabat, June 07 (MAP) -- The Central Committee of the  Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP/opposition) discarded  the possibility for the party to participate in the government.  The committee, which held a meeting over the weekend to discuss  the political report presented by the assistant first secretary  of the party Mohamed el-Yazghi, renewed attachment to the stands  it explained in the statement adopted last December saying the  December statement remains the basic platform for the USFP  political action as there are no new data likely to dictate a  change of these stands.    The committee which examined the latest political  developments in light of the appointment of Abdellatif Filali as  prime minister and the latter's consultations with political  parties, took note of some of Filali's laudable commitments and  intentions but saw no sign of a genuine change. The committee  therefore discards the possibility to participate in the  government.    The political report that was run Monday by the USFP daily  'AL ITTIHAD AL ICHTIRAKI' on the other hand stressed the need to  usher in political and constitutional reforms and pointed out  that the credibility of any government is intrinsically linked  to the genuine practice of democracy and the genuine respect of  human rights.    The report also deemed it necessary for the government to  carry on social dialog to reach solutions to pending problems.    The central committee of another opposition party, the Party  for Progress and Socialism (PPS), held an extraordinary meeting  Sunday during which the PPS secretary general informed the  committee members on the consultations held by Filali with  Moroccan political parties.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / World Trade News: Indonesia clears way for Dollars 1.6bn complex INDONESIA cleared the way yesterday for a Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 930m) petrochemical project, six months after the government announced its postponement until after 1995. Go-ahead depends on the plant being 100 per cent foreign-owned, the first time a wholly foreign-owned project has been allowed outside the Batam Island export zone. Officials are studying new rules to permit full foreign ownership of the project, to be in West Java. The government's treatment of the project, an olefins complex to make petrochemicals for domestic plastic and textile industries, as a special case has attracted criticism. Proposed by Mr Prajogo Pangestu and Mr Henry Pribadi, two Indonesian businessmen, in early 1990, it won the backing of the Bimantara Citra Group, an Indonesian conglomerate headed by Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo, President Suharto's second son. Originally estimated to cost Dollars 2.25bn, it was one of four petrochemical projects totalling Dollars 9bn postponed last October. That decision was prompted by concern over a deteriorating current-account deficit due partly to the cost of servicing Indonesia's Dollars 75bn international debt. Site clearance on the project had already begun, and Bank Bumi Daya (BBD), a state-owned bank, had committed Dollars 500m to the venture. Mr Radius Prawiro, economy minister, said the BBD loan would be turned into a short-term bridging loan and the project would have to be financed entirely by foreign equity. This meant any offshore loans arranged by foreign companies would not be counted as Indonesian debt. Dr Adrianus Mooy, central bank governor, said the project's 'impact on the balance of payments was still there, but less serious than before', because of the Dollars 625m cost reduction. Japanese banks will be the main financiers, with Toyo Engineering and Marubeni doing the construction.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Your Dog makes its debut with a chewy treat  -Raymond Snoddy on Emap's latest launch, which is aiming to take Britain's 8m dog owners by storm Last week Emap, the media group, launched its latest magazine, Your Dog, a glossy bi-monthly that came complete with a bone-shaped chewy treat stuck to the cover. The cover picture featured an adorable pooch, designed to catch the eye of Britain's 8m dog owners. It had plenty of what Mr Ian Beacham, publishing director of Emap Pursuit Publishing, described as 'big eyeball contact'. Inside there is plenty of practical advice, including the wisdom of holding a dog's tail with your free hand while taking its temperature. Your Dog was the almost inevitable consequence of the successful debut of Your Cat last year after Emap journalist Ms Sue Parslow, who edited Fishkeeping Answers, pushed for and got permission to launch a new cat publication. With the help of cover gifts that included a plastic cat bowl and special formula cat milk, Your Cat took the cat publishing world by storm with sales of more than 60,000 - yet it probably cost little more than Pounds 50,000 to launch. The latest issue of Your Cat, out this week, will have a tin of catfood attached. Launching new magazines is one side of Emap, a company that in the last 10 years has nearly quadrupled sales to Pounds 362m. Last year's pre-tax profits were a record Pounds 45.7m. Another side is demonstrated by Tuesday's announcement that it was paying Pounds 60m to buy Maclean Hunter European Publishing from Rogers Communications of Toronto. MHEP, with interests in seven European countries, publishes 22 market directories, seven electronic information services and 34 business magazines, including UK Press Gazette and Werbe Woche, the Swiss marketing magazine. During the first half of this financial year Emap spent Pounds 197m on acquisitions, including Pounds 106m on 28 magazines from French publisher Editions Mondiales and a further 10 consumer titles from companies within the Hersant group. Despite the acquisitions - and the latest makes Emap a serious contender in the German market - Mr Robin Miller, chief executive, treasures magazine launches above all else. 'For Emap, growing and launching is more important. New product development fires up all our people. If a journalist comes up with an idea and it stands up, they might get to edit it,' says Mr Miller, a former editor of Motorcycle News, one of Emap's early successes. The return on investment from a successful magazine launch, he adds, is particularly high. Not every Emap magazine launch is a sure-fire hit. Jig Jag, a music magazine for distribution in music stores, was such a 'turkey' that it was killed off after one issue. And Car Week, an ambitious Pounds 5m attack on the lucrative weekly car magazine market, has had a tough time. Launched in newspaper format, it failed to meet its targets and was relaunched this spring as a glossy magazine. It now sells about 60,000 copies compared with the hoped-for 80,000. A rival publisher, while conceding that Emap has done well, nevertheless saw the problems of Car Week as a turning point. 'That was a bit of a watershed and dented their confidence,' he said. Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson, praised Emap's magazine success, but would like to see more excitement in its local and regional newspaper operations to justify a top rating. Emap, which has added commercial radio and exhibitions to its more established newspaper and magazine businesses, also has new launches in mind even when it acquires other companies. The purchase of a car magazine called Practical Classics led to the launch of Popular Classics and Classic Car Weekly. 'Acquisitions give us aircraft carriers to get into new markets, new territories,' says Mr Miller. The company has paid considerable attention to the provision of professional information, often delivered electronically, to back up its business titles. Mr Miller says: 'What we are trying to offer is a broadly based media solution for business, providing the connection from the seller to the buyer.' As a spin-off from its biggest consumer magazines, Emap has started to get involved in moving pictures. It is now producing golf videos to go alongside magazines such as Fore and Today's Golfer. A little further down the line, specialist television channels are possible. One priority for next year, though, is celebrating the 300th anniversary of the founding of one of Emap's local newspapers - The Stamford Mercury, which goes into virtually every home in the Lincolnshire market town. 'We want to continue to be dominant in all these markets, whether it be the market for young women, the local market, or the market for business people interested in fleet cars,' Mr Miller says.</p>

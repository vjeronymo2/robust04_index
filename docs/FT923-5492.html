			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Lufthansa plans to cut 6,000 jobs in two years LUFTHANSA, the German national airline which has sunk deeper into the red in 1992, plans to shed 6,000 jobs in the next two years as part of a programme aimed at annual cost savings of around DM1bn (Pounds 350m). The airline, 51 per cent state-owned, is due to announce the job cuts today, along with a package of other measures such as a slimming down of its route network and fleet reductions. Unions signalled their broad acceptance last night after prolonged and difficult discussions. 'We are going through a difficult time, the most difficult in Lufthansa's history,' said Mr Jurgen Weber, chief executive. The group already has begun to trim operations - capacity on European routes this summer is 11 per cent less than planned - after falling into the red in 1991. Mr Weber said Lufthansa expected an operating loss of DM1.2bn this year, after one of DM800m in 1991. This excludes non-airline activities and aircraft sales. Last year's net loss was DM426m against a profit of DM15m. Seatbelts fastened for a bumpy ride, Page 15</p>

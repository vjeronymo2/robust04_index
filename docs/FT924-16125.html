			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Russia begins big industrial sell-off: Privatisation vouchers distributed to public THE WORLD'S biggest privatisation, the sale of nearly 70 per cent of Russia's productive capacity, officially begins today with the first issue of Rbs10,000 vouchers to the country's 150m men, women and children. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation, said in an interview yesterday that the privatisation 'is unprecedented in the history of Russia and perhaps in the history of the world. There has never been such a campaign to open up our economy, to our people and to foreigners'. He hopes that, by the end of the year, 6,500 large companies will have completed registration as joint stock companies and will have begun offering their shares in auctions to the public for vouchers and cash. The companies must all present their plans to the State Committee for Property, which Mr Chubais heads, by November 1. Auctions are due to begin from December 1. Of the more than 40 per cent of companies which have already finished their privatisation plans, he said, most had chosen options which gave most shares to the workers and managers. One option allows the work collectives to buy 51 per cent of the shares on favourable terms, the other assigns 25 per cent to the collectives free, with a further 10 per cent to workers and 5 per cent to managers on favourable terms - in both cases before the remainder of the shares are offered in public auctions. Foreigners are free to participate in the auction process with Russians, with the exception of some enterprises in the defence and energy sectors. Mr Chubais said that already, foreign companies were assisting the collectives to buy their shares in return for themselves receiving shares in the companies. A campaign is soon to be launched abroad to explain to foreign companies how best to invest. Within Russia itself, an information blitz is to be launched, with posters, advertisements in the newspapers and on television and the start of what Mr Chubais called 'a funny game show' on nation-wide television based on the purchase of companies. Though a secondary market in the vouchers has already started before they are issued, Mr Chubais said that the government opinion polls showed that only 35 per cent of citizens would immediately sell their shares for cash.</p>

Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN  today says:    By "labor-management concord" Kim Yong-sam the puppet means  that the workers must submit to the demands of the employers and  their exploitation and plunder, not fighting to push demands  such as wage hike.    The analyst further says:    In the first days of his office the traitor harshly  suppressed the struggle of workers for such demand as higher pay  by invoking even the "emergency arbitration power."    In reiterating the deceptive doctrine on "labor-management  concord" the reactionary nature of which has been brought into a  glaring light, he hinted that he would force harder toil upon  the workers and not allow labor movement at all.    In the past ten months of the so-called "civilian" rule of  the traitor Kim Yong-sam the South Korean workers have clearly  realized through their experiences that his "commitment" to  building a "society where the laboring people are well-off" is  sham and he is a friend of the exploiters, not of the workers.    If the Kim Yong-sam group tries to block the struggle of the  workers by fascist crackdown, it will only precipitate the  destruction of the "civilian government."</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'VISUAL BLIGHT' IN SOLANA BEACH;  </P> <P> 3-YEAR-OLD CITY WORRIED ABOUT REDEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> The city of Solana Beach, concerned that it is not aging gracefully, has  committed $60,800 to plan a face lift in the form of downtown redevelopment.  </P> <P> The City Council, acting as the city's 2-month-old redevelopment agency,  approved the expenditure at a Monday meeting. Contracts were awarded Monday to  RSG Consulting of San Diego, which will put together a redevelopment plan, and  Cotton Beland Associates of Encinitas, which will prepare a state-mandated  environmental impact report. The reports are expected to be completed in nine  months to a year.  </P> <P> The area pinpointed for the redevelopment study is the corridor along Highway  101 -- now an eclectic potpourri of structures housing everything from families  to law offices, surf shops and health food restaurants. Eden Gardens, a  run-down residential area to the south of town between Highway 101 and  Interstate 5, is not now under consideration for redevelopment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Most Potential  </P> <P> The Highway 101 strip is "not necessarily being singled out because that's the  part that is most exposed to visitors passing through," said City Manager  Michael Huse. "It's just the area that holds the most potential, and the one  that is of the most immediate concern because of development projects that are  taking place there now."  </P> <P> To establish a redevelopment district, the state requires that "blight" exist  in the area. Although downtown Solana Beach may not be exactly economically  disadvantaged, Huse said there is growing community sentiment that "visual  blight" does exist in the nearly 3-year-old city.  </P> <P> An abandoned service station that has been used as both a bicycle repair shop  and a produce stand in recent years is one example of a property that might be  considered "under-utilized," Huse said. Other areas that could use some shoring  up include an abandoned trailer park and some boarded-up buildings, he said.  </P> <P> "There are other businesses that, more than likely over the course of time,  will be recycled to a different use, just because, as the value of the property  escalates, those people in there now will not be able to pay their rents," Huse  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Workshops  </P> <P> The redevelopment effort was helped along by two public workshops in January,  which drew considerable feedback from the community. Although no design or  theme specifics have been decided upon, most felt it was important to establish  some guidelines to preserve the quaint beach-town feel of the area, Huse said.  </P> <P> The redevelopment agency is hoping that private property owners in the  redevelopment area will willingly cooperate by "revitalizing" their own  properties to suit the design plan, Huse said. Loans or grants may be made  available to property owners through the redevelopment plan, to refurbish their  buildings or at least add some cosmetic touches, he said.  </P> <P> The city will concentrate on public improvements such as parking lots, parks,  landscaping and sewer-line upgradings, Huse said.  </P> <P> At this point, the redevelopment agency would prefer not to use powers of  eminent domain to condemn property, he said.  </P></p>

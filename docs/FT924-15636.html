			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (41): Keeping in touch with decision-makers - Facilities management supplier; User view AST Transact likes to keep tabs on the key decision-makers and influential people in some of Britain's largest financial institutions, writes David Tebbutt. The company, majority-owned by the Royal Bank of Canada, is a supplier of facilities management and high value software products. It uses Market-Base to manage both mailshots and the sales process. The company is taking a phased approach to implementation, starting with the facilities management prospect and customer details. The system currently contains 400 to 500 records; in total, the system is expected to reach 1,500 researched prospects. One of the early tasks is to mail a copy of AST's own City FM magazine to senior personnel of companies which use IBM mainframe computers. All recipients will be addressed by name and have a personalised letter included. Before Market-Base, the company used ButtonWare's PC-File. This was restricted to three contacts per company. The company also tried using TeleMagic with one product. Richard Wright, an AST business development manager, looked at a number of sales and marketing systems before settling on Market-Base. He describes it as, 'user-friendly, easy to learn and easy to use.' He also admits that Kensington Marketing Services, its publisher, 'did an extremely good job of selling the product. They were straight, and they answered the questions of the whole department.' He liked the fact that the database was hierarchical and could handle multiple company contacts. He also liked the program's sales forecasting and analysis capabilities, both numerical and textual. The standard reports are not suitable but, using the Clarion report writer, Mr Wright is able to tailor-make reports to the company's needs. Kensington Marketing Systems helped with installing the system on a network and on a portable PC. The supplier also converted the data files from PC File and TeleMagic. At the moment, any three out of the 12 network users can use Market-Base at the same time. The system cost AST Transact Pounds 2,500 for the three-user network version and a single-user copy for a portable computer. Mr Wright's advice to would-be buyers of sales and marketing systems is, 'if you have no experience of databases, use a consultant. Otherwise, the more you look at, the more confused you'll become.' He also suggests: 'Have a clear idea of what you want - some programs will do too much, others will do too little.'</p>

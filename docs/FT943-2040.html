			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bernard Matthews rises 80% to Pounds 8.36m Shares in Bernard Matthews, the poultry and meat producer, bucked the market's downward trend yesterday by rising 6p to 127p, in response to an 80 per cent jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.64m to Pounds 8.36m for the 28 weeks to July 27. Mr Bernard Matthews, chairman, said both profits and turnover had benefited from organic growth and acquisitions. Operating profits swelled to Pounds 9.25m (Pounds 5.09m), with acquisitions adding Pounds 2.82m (nil) to continuing operations, which rose 26 per cent to Pounds 6.43m. Group turnover rose to Pounds 137.1m (Pounds 88.9m), which included Pounds 33m from acquisitions. In the past year, Matthews bought Turners Turkeys from Unigate for about Pounds 12m at the end of 1993 and acquired Advanced Foods, the state-owned New Zealand lamb business for an undisclosed sum in April. Mr Matthews said the acquisitions represented a change of company policy, after years of organic growth. Mr Matthews said that whole turkeys now accounted for less than 10 per cent of the group's business, with Christmas turkeys less than 6 per cent, though he stressed that that side of the business had not shrunk, merely that the contribution from value-added products had grown. Sales of both branded cooked meats and fresh meat products continued to expand though the group was suffering losses in France and Germany - markets it recently entered with four products in each. A Pounds 1.2m advertising campaign in Germany was currently running on TV to introduce consumers to the company as well as to increase volume sales of the products. Earnings rose to 4.54p (2.5p) and the interim dividend is lifted 20 per cent to 1.32p (1.1p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin] </F>   [Text] Zagreb, 20 Mar -- "The U.S. leadership has confirmed  at the highest level its preparedness to cooperate with Russia  in the settlement of the crisis in former Yugoslavia," Vitaliy  Churkin, special envoy of the Russian president, said upon  arrival in the Croatian capital from Washington on Sunday.    "I had talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.S.  Secretary  of State Warren Christopher, and Vice President Albert Gore.  During the talks with Christopher we discussed the main  directions of our joint work and agreed that the United States  and Russia will work with all sides involved in the conflict,"  Churkin said in an interview with ITAR-TASS.    "In Washington, we discussed the most likely date for a  meeting between all Bosnian sides. I believe that this meeting  could be held as early as next week," Churkin said.    "Everyone supports our initiative in holding this meeting  and  hopes that the signing of the cease-fire agreement will be  followed by further productive steps. But now what is mainly  being said is that it is necessary to nudge the sides to the  conclusion of this agreement to conclude the months of talks.  Stressing as I do the strengthening of our cooperation with the  United States, I also invited the U.S. ambassador in Croatia to  take part in the Zagreb meeting," Churkin said.    Vladimir Ivanovskiy, head of the Russian Federation Foreign  Ministry department for the countries of former Yugoslavia, who  is in Zagreb, commenting on Russia's approach to the  Croatian-Serbian settlement process, told the ITAR-TASS  correspondent today that the Croat leadership's talks with the  local Serbs should, judging by everything, take place in three  stages.    The first, if circumstances are favorable, could be  completed  by 22 March with the signing of a cease-fire agreement and end  to hostilities. The draft agreement envisages demarcation of  lines of the Croatian and Serbian forces, withdrawal of heavy  weapons from a 20-km security zone, and a number of other  measures.    After this talks could begin on restoration of economic and  transport links with the territories under Serbian control.    Political questions including the status of the Serb  Krajinas  should, as the most difficult aspect, be left to the third stage  of a settlement, the Russian diplomat said.</p>

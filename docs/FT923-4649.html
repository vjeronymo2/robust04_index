			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Ecuador announces 20 privatisations THE government of President Sixto Duran Ballen of Ecuador announced late on Thursday its long-awaited economic reform measures, which include the privatisation of numerous state-owned enterprises, a cut in public spending, a devaluation of the currency, as well as drastic price increases for petrol and electricity. In a nationally televised speech, the president, who took office less than a month ago, said the measures were aimed at combating persistent inflation, a burgeoning budget deficit and a bloated public sector. 'I am not only applying stabilisation measures, but am also attacking the basic causes of the crisis,' Mr Duran said. Ecuador's annual inflation rate has been hovering near 50 per cent for the past three years. The budget deficit stands at the equivalent of Dollars 800m - 7 per cent of gross domestic product. A key element of the economic reform package is the privatisation of 20 state-owned enterprises, including Ecuadorean Airlines. 'Other state enterprises will be subject to further analysis,' stated Mr Mario Rivadeneira, finance minister. 'If they do not prove to be operating profitably and efficiently, they will be privatised or put into competition with the private sector,' he added. The government also plans to reduce public spending by 4 per cent across the board. The military announced its support of Mr Duran's reform package and agreed to cost-cutting of its own. The president emphasised his government's intention to propose a balanced budget for 1993 and to halt deficit spending. Other measures adopted by the government to halt inflation are the devaluation of the currency (the sucre) by 20 per cent. The US dollar is now worth 2,000 sucres. According to Mr Andre Barreira, energy and mining minister, petrol prices will increase by as much as 300 per cent while electricity rates will go up by as much as 90 per cent, depending on the varying rates of consumption. Following street demonstrations in recent days against austerity measures, Mr Barreira maintained, however, that the heavily used public transport would not become more costly. In an attempt to avoid further popular unrest, the government has announced an increase of 10,000 sucres in the monthly cost-of-living adjustment for employees. Also, Mr Rivadeneira announced an extra bonus equivalent to a month's salary, starting next year.</p>

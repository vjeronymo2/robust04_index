			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Nuclear levy to be held at 10% Nuclear Electric, which operates nuclear power stations in England and Wales, has agreed to postpone revenues from the nuclear levy in order to prevent an increase in the controversial tax on electricity bills. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, announced yesterday that the levy would remain at 10 per cent for another 12 months even though receipts were running Pounds 300m behind plan. Prof Littlechild said the levy should have gone up to 13 per cent next April to make up the shortfall. Nuclear Electric was willing to forgo an increase because it had enough short-term cash. Yesterday's announcement means it is unclear how the shortfall will be recouped. It could foreshadow a much steeper increase in the levy in 1997-98. However, Prof Littlechild said that he hoped an increase would not be necessary.</p>

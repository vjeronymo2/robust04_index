			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jean-Paul Croize report: "Nuclear Explosions Inside </F> Computers"]    [Text] When the military planning law for the period  1995-2000 was presented, it was revealed that between now and  the end of the century more than 10 billion French francs [Fr]  are to be invested in developing a highly-sophisticated system  for simulating nuclear explosions. This is a major scientific  decision since it will enable experts at the French Arms  Delegation (DGA) and the Atomic Energy Commission [AEC] -- who  have been pondering the design of such a system since 1991 in  the framework of the Palen program (for the preparation and  limitation of nuclear testing) -- to devise new methods for  performing heavy-duty studies and experiments. Notable  developments include extremely powerful lasers and  high-performance computers which would also have considerable  benefits for the civil domain.    While it is hard to imagine, the means do exist for  simulating or partially reconstructing the diabolical energy  release that is characterized by the triggering of a  thermonuclear bomb. Better still, while the most complex means  of simulation are still confined to the realms of theory,  certain others already exist in concrete form. In two decades  these resources have reduced the annual number of real nuclear  tests carried out on the Mururoa Atoll in the Pacific Ocean from  a dozen to just five, before the total test ban moratorium was  imposed in April 1992.    The equipment already used in a number of Defense Ministry  research centers make it possible to reconstruct some of the  main mechanical or electromagnetic effects of a nuclear  explosion, such as the blast, the heat wave, and the high-energy  radiation flux that is generated. One of the simplest  simulation tools to design -- but still delicate to use and  particularly impressive to see in action -- is the giant blast  tunnel at Grammat in the Lot region of France. Some 110 mt long  and 12 mt wide, this structure, camouflaged to blend into the  countryside, makes it possible to subject different types of  military equipment to a very violent and instantaneous  pressurization caused by the release in less than one-hundredth  of a second of 300,000 lt of air stored in giant compressors.  This involves generating eight million times the normal  atmospheric pressure, equivalent to the shock wave of a  thermonuclear explosion, which, in the tunnel, sweeps jeeps  aside like mere wisps of straw.    Another, less spectacular example but equipment that is  doubtless even more complex to use, is the "radiation chamber"  that has been built in the Vernon ballistics and aerodynamics  research laboratory. This tool -- the only one of its kind in  Europe -- makes it possible to subject all types of electronic  components to the kind of intense electromagnetic flash  generated by an atomic bomb.    However, scientists have yet to implement the most difficult  type of nuclear simulation: reconstructing the processes that  lie at the heart of the explosion and which, in a few hundredths  of a second, cause matter to change into other, lighter, atomic  elements, generating an enormous amount of energy in the  process. To improve the effectiveness of existing weapons and  to design new ones -- like the famous neutron bombs -- it is  vital to be able to accurately predict the operational  effectiveness of various kinds of architecture and to select one  material in preference to another. As a result it is essential  to have "keys" composed either of real tests or a series of  physical simulations and calculations using codes detailed  enough to accurately determine by "virtual" means the way in  which this energy will be released and then dispersed.    If they are to pinpoint the actual transmutation of elements  during an atomic explosion, scientists in the AEC's military  applications department will have to develop the two tools that  are essential for any nuclear simulation: power lasers and  massively parallel computers. The credits awarded for this task  for the five years covered by the military planning law far  exceed those currently allocated: the decision to invest a sum  of Fr10 billion practically multiplies tenfold the budget for  the Palen program which this year stands at Fr300 million.    On the computing level this will be enough to provide  considerable stimulus for the work being done in France in the  field of so-called "massively parallel" computing: using  machines whose architecture is such that they can perform  simultaneous rather than successive calculations interactively  -- i.e. in parallel. This technology is still in its infancy,  but it appears to be the only way of processing the phenomenal  amount of data (people are talking of several hundred billion  instructions per second) that this type of simulation requires  -- even harder to do, say the experts, than atmospheric modeling.    Mastering such computing power, the experts claim, could  only  benefit the resource-hungry calculations used in weather  forecasting and computer-assisted aircraft design.    In the field of lasers, the Palen program would enable  France  to build tools performing better than Phebus, the most powerful  device currently being used by the AEC in Limeil, near Paris.  Capable of delivering power of almost 10 kilojoules for about a  billionth of a second, this would already be enough to light  veritable miniature suns heating minuscule samples of matter to  over 10 million degrees. The matter would then be converted into  plasma such as is found in the core of a thermonuclear weapon.  A major line of research in future years will consist of  designing a system for amplifying the flashes emitted by such  types of equipment to exceed the performance of the American  "Nova," currently the most powerful laser in the world that can  put out around 50 kilojoules in flashes of light emitted in a  single time period of around one nanosecond.    In the civil domain, tools such as this would make it easier  to examine the technology needed to master continuous fusion,  i.e. generated in reactors that can supply infinitely more  energy than existing atomic power stations. However, if we are  to believe many military experts, several more real nuclear  tests are needed to perfectly calibrate their data with the  processes that occur inside a real bomb.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: US debt and equity issues at record high US COMPANIES issued record amounts of debt and equity during the first half of this year, according to the financial information group Securities Data. Stocks and bonds worth Dollars 530bn were sold in the first six months of 1993, well above the previous record of Dollars 445bn set in the first half of 1992. The continued boom in debt offerings was fuelled by the lowest interest rates in three decades, which encouraged many companies to pay off older, more expensive, debt with new, cheaper debt. This corporate refinancing was accompanied by continued strong demand for equity from companies. A record Dollars 47bn in new shares was sold between January and the end of June, more than half of it in the form of initial public offerings (IPOs), or company flotations. Rising stock prices (the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit an all-time high in May) and heavy demand from investors were the main factors behind the rush into equity. The surge in underwriting business has filled the coffers of Wall Street securities firms, which earned a record Dollars 4.3bn in fees during the first half of the year. Merrill Lynch once again led the field, earning Dollars 878m from domestic underwriting, followed by Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers. Although debt and equity issuance hit a record, the pace of growth is slowing slightly. The amount of new securities sold in the second quarter was down 5 per cent from the first quarter, to Dollars 258bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New Zealand's prime minister, Jim Bolger, says the  strength of Asian economies is helping them resist pressures  from the West on human rights issues. Speaking in Singapore,  Mr. Bolger said Asian countries were now able to say with some  firmness that their approach to human rights was as valid as  that of anybody else. He said countries in Asia were better able  to deal with such issues now that everyone wanted to trade with  them.    Early this week, Mr. Bolger came under criticism in New  Zealand for endorsing Indonesian rule in East Timor despite  Western concerns over human rights there.</p>

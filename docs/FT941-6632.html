			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Arts: Schnittke's broken symphonies - New York Music Two new symphonies by Alfred Schnittke, his Sixth and Seventh, were introduced to New York last month in a sudden succession that mirrored, if it slightly exaggerated, his productivity. Since writing them (the Sixth was finished in 1992, the Seventh last July) he has already completed his Eighth Symphony, and his output of the last five years also includes several other big orchestral scores, chamber pieces, and two full-length operas, of which a long-planned Faust is scheduled for production next year in Hamburg. Quite how to interpret this rate of output is one of the Schnittke conundrums. Are we dealing with a Haydn, composing fluently to order, or with a Hugo Wolf, impelled by creative demons? Much has been made of Schnittke's music as reportage on the speed of events in his native Russia. Much has been made, too, of his physical fragility - and indeed he looked sadly aged well beyond his 59 years as he was assisted onto the platform at each of these concerts. But the music is disinclined - perhaps even unable - to explain itself: its very brokenness makes it mute as to causes. What we hear is the wreckage; how it happened is left for us to wonder, if we wish. Both the new works are broken, wrecked symphonies, but especially the Sixth. It has the usual four movements, with a conventional scale, playing altogether for about half an hour. The contents, though, are weird even by Schnittke's standards. The first movement, for instance, starts and ends with big clusters, but the long interim is thinly scored, and made up of fragments that have no great pretensions: for long periods the stage is held by a few brass instruments in chorales, or by low strings, again often in quasi-liturgical phrases. One remembers that Schnittke's Second and Fourth symphonies were muffled religious ceremonies, but the feeling here is bare and wretched, and the great numbers who piled out of Carnegie Hall after this movement seemed to be making an understandable response. The Sixth Symphony was written for Mstislav Rostropovich and the National Symphony, who gave this performance; the Seventh, a New York Philharmonic commission being heard for the first time, was composed for another conductor with whom Schnittke has had a long association: Kurt Masur. It is a more compact piece than the Sixth, lasting little longer than twenty minutes, and a more continuous one. There are now three movements, and the first two are both so short as to seem preludial, the opening andante being for strings and its successor turning to the wind and percussion. Then in what emerges as the main movement, the horns quite soon introduce a waltz-chorale that appears to satisfy demands for a principal theme. But the new symphony is hardly less bleak than its predecessor. Even its continuity is not so much growth as wandering (in the case of the long opening for solo violin) or idling repetition - or finally both at once, as the slow waltz tune is played three times identically by soloists in the far bass (trombone, contrabassoon, double bass). It is a haunting melody, but not a soothing one, and its insufficiency as a gesture of farewell consolation is perhaps its point. Schnittke, living now in Germany, pays homage to that country by encoding German place-names into the second movement, but ironically the notes he gets from 'Deutschland' come very close to the DSCH cryptogram with which Shostakovich signed several of his works, and it is to Shostakovich's example that this new symphony, like so much of Schnittke's music, most conspicuously appeals. Shostakovich was, of necessity, a master of musical double-talk: of hollow affirmations, of savage glee. Schnittke opens up several further layers of splitting, and leaves us with music whose motivations are endlessly tangled, music whose increasing austerity has only made it ever more uncertain and unsettling.</p>

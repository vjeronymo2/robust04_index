			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): Balm for home-buyers but it's hardly generous - What's new? / Citibank has begun adding two years' free unemployment cover to its mortgages UNCERTAINTY HAS been a noticeable feature of many recent arrivals on the personal finance market. Lacking any single obvious successor to last year's Tessas, companies have had to concentrate on calming the recession-shredded nerves of investors and borrowers. This month, Citibank has begun adding two years' free unemployment cover to all its mortgages taken out by people aged between 21 and 60. The insurance covers the original level of the mortgage instalment, up to a maximum of Pounds 1,000 per month, replacing up to 12 months' payments after a 60-day waiting period from the time the borrower becomes unemployed. The waiting period can be cut to 30 days if the borrower buys additional accident and sickness cover, priced at between Pounds 3 and Pounds 3.50 per Pounds 100 of the monthly payment to be protected. This offer is not particularly generous, bearing in mind Citibank's Pounds 250 arrangement fee, and interest penalties on early redemption of all mortgages. A number of lenders will provide cover against accident and sickness, as well as unemployment, for between Pounds 4.50 and Pounds 5.50 per Pounds 100 of the monthly payment. Housebuilders such as Croudace have also been offering up to three years' free payment protection. ***** LURING CAUTIOUS investors away from building society accounts is a constant goal for investment managers, and Irish Life is the latest to attempt this, by providing a partial guarantee. The company is offering a single-premium insurance bond for a minimum of Pounds 2,000, guaranteeing return of the capital on August 1, 1996, plus any growth achieved. Investors effectively pay for the guarantee, through an initial 5 per cent and an annual 1.25 per cent charge. The guarantee does not apply to bonds cashed in before August 1, 1996. The guaranteed bond is to be linked to Irish Life's managed fund. Over the five years to December 6, 1991, Irish Life Global Managed 3 ranked 34th out of 135 managed funds monitored by Finstat, showing a gain of 35.7 per cent, compared with the 85.7 per cent put on by Family Assurance Concentrated Growth. Over one year to December 6, Irish Life Universal Equity ranked 94th out of 176 UK equity managed funds, gaining 5.2 per cent, compared with Aetna Life Special Opportunities' top gain of 28.9 per cent. If recent trends continue, investors would seem to stand a good chance of better performance from a non-guaranteed bond. ***** SUN LIFE can hardly make reassuring noises about the Pacific Growth Portfolio unit trust it is due to launch at the beginning of February. Concentrating on the main Pacific markets, but excluding Japan, the portfolio will initially include mainly Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia, moving on to Taiwan (when accessible to foreign investors), New Zealand and eventually China. Nick Wells, of Sun Life, uses the traditional 'not for widows and orphans' description of the unit trust, which is to have a minimum lump-sum investment level of Pounds 1,000 and a regular monthly savings plan taking Pounds 25. Charges are to be 5.75 per cent initially and 1 1/2 per cent annually. 'People should have a small part of their portfolio in this area on a longer-term view - five years-plus, but look for a relatively bumpy ride,' said Mr Wells, noting that fund manager Pamela Chan, based in London, would be trying to iron out as many of the jolts as possible. Sun Life is also re-organising money already under management, to make sure that the new fund starts with at least Pounds 20m. 'With the confidence level as it is, certainly in the UK, most investors will probably stick where they are,' said Mr Wells. 'We can't guarantee success in terms of performance, but we can give the fund the opportunity of getting off to a reasonable start, with a size of portfolio you can manage and run.' ***** INVESTORS used to the idea that risks should be spread by diversifying investments may have misgivings about the concept of single-company personal equity plans. But investment managers are finding different ways around such objections. Brokers Henderson Crosthwaite say they see their single-company Pep being taken out only by people who already have a general Pep (with Henderson Crosthwaite). The firm is offering two versions of the plan: self-selected, with a 1 per cent annual charge, and discretionary with a 1 1/4 per cent annual charge. During the launch period, which ends next Friday, January 31, the initial charge on either type of plan is Pounds 15 plus VAT, with a minimum investment of Pounds 1,000 and minimum commission on dealings of Pounds 10. After that date, the minimum investment goes up to Pounds 1,500, the initial charge to Pounds 30 plus VAT, and dealing commission to 1.5 per cent or a minimum of Pounds 25. ***** LLOYDS BANK has three varieties of single-company Pep, with shares to be selected from a list of 100 blue-chip companies based on, but not limited to, the FT-SE 100. Charges on all the plans are an annual fee of Pounds 20 plus VAT. Dealings done on bulk dealing dates selected by Lloyds are charged at 0.2 per cent, but investors who deal at other times pay 1.65 per cent, or a minimum of Pounds 25. The bank also charges an administration fee of Pounds 10 for switches. The cheapest of the three uses one plan continuing over several years. Investors open the plan, either with the full Pounds 3,000 allowed by the Revenue, or with Pounds 300, to which they may add in instalments of at least Pounds 100. In each succeeding year, the investor can then put up to another Pounds 3,000 into the same company's shares, or move the complete holding into another company. Alternatively, the investor can open a separate plan each year, either keeping to the same company each time, or choosing a different company year by year.

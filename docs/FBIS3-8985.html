			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandar Milosevic: "Soldiers Surpassed </F> Politicians"]    [Text] The future Bosniak-Croat federation will have an  integral defense system. That unequivocally follows on the  agreement signed by General Rasim Delic and General Ante Roso on  Saturday [12 March] in Split. Their signatures will, hopefully,  finally bring an end to Muslim-Croat conflicts and disputes. It  is significant that it took less time for the soldiers to reach  an agreement than for the politicians who negotiated in Vienna,  although the agreement between the two generals is in compliance  with the work of the participants at the Vienna talks.    Naturally, it was easy for the soldiers to surpass the  politicians, for they discussed a narrow segment of the broader  mutual relations between the Bosniak Muslims and the Croats, but  the difficult part was to disregard the series of conflicts, the  wounded and the dead, to suppress frustration resulting from  mutual shelling. Geostrategically speaking, the defense system  of the Bosniak-Croat federation will definitely mean a lot for  broad general relations in these parts. The United States was  evidently extremely interested in reaching the agreement and  they almost pushed General Roso and General Delic to end the  negotiations successfully. However, it is also obvious that the  first officers of the two military forces wisely realized that  mutual Muslim-Croat conflicts cannot benefit either nation and  that they directly benefit the third side. Still, considering  the possibility of reaching a lasting political solution on the  territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the signed agreement clearly  says that its defense system does not aim at harming the third  side. Simply, the two nations which will live in the federation  are trying to define clearly the question of defense, which is  an extremely important one for every country, especially for the  one which rises anew from the ashes of the war.    There is no doubt that the United States will insist exactly  on the military-defense plan of the future Bosniak-Croat  federation, for in any option of the future course of events, it  could guarantee a successful resistance to those who want to use  weapons to impose political solutions. Of course, in order to  implement the agreement signed by Generals Delic and Roso, it  will be necessary to suppress the frustration and forget bad  memories, and that will take time, but one can go forward only  if one looks toward the future, not toward the past.</p>

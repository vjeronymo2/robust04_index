			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Judge rules on NY Post row A bankruptcy court judge ruled yesterday that the New York Post will remain in the hands of Mr Abe Hirschfeld, a car parks tycoon at loggerheads with the tabloid newspaper's staff. Judge Francis Conrad said he would not consider offers for the newspaper from other bidders. New York's governor Mario Cuomo, who has been trying to organise an investor group to bid for the paper, will now have to deal directly with Mr Hirschfeld. Mr Steven Hoffenberg, a debt collection entrepreneur who briefly ran the paper before a Securities and Exchange lawsuit froze his assets and prevented him from completing the purchase, was barred from interfering with the sale to Mr Hirschfeld.</p>

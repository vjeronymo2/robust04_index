			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Raitrack chairman criticises RMT over 'scaremongering' Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, last night condemned the RMT transport union for 'irresponsible scaremongering' over safety standards on the rail network during the one-day strikes, Robert Taylor writes. Speaking as the RMT executive met to discuss its planned move to escalate the signalling staff dispute which has shut down most of Britain's rail network over the past five Wednesdays, Mr Horton accused it of 'trying to bring the country to a halt by frightening the public into staying at home'. His remarks follow accusations by the RMT that Railtrack had been compromising safety by using unqualified staff in signal boxes on strike days. Mr Horton said: 'The rumours and allegations that were spreading on Wednesday are desperate attempts to try to prevent the public using the services available.' He emphasised that 'not one train will run on a strike day or any other day unless Railtrack is absolutely satisfied that the service meets the requirements of safety'. The RMT has already decided to call a further one-day strike for next Wednesday.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Risk and Reward: Derivatives industry scrambles to find some kind of infrastructure THE debate in world banking circles over controlling systemic risk from derivative securities trading will intensify when a study group formed by the Group of 30, a Washington-based think tank, releases its report on derivatives later this month. Such studies are popular. Derivatives, in the span of just a few years, have become integral to corporate risk management, with a surprising array of business applications, from swapping long-term debt for short-term debt to hedging foreign exchange or commodities exposure. Regulators are just coming to terms with swaps, swaptions, and hybrid instruments, and are wondering if, and how, such banking exotica should be supervised. The banks which trade the markets are farther along in managing derivatives. The industry has evolved to a point where standardised contracts and other procedures are helping to mitigate credit risks. Now, with the threat of regulatory intervention pending, the derivatives industry is scrambling to adopt an infrastructure of sorts, in order to prove that participating dealers have the growing markets under control. Estimates of annual over-the-counter derivatives turnover range from Dollars 5,000bn to Dollars 7,000bn in terms of notional face value. However, since only the income streams from these securities are swapped, the capital at risk in each trade is smaller than the face value of the securities by at least a factor of 10. Ideas for managing credit exposure while at the same time allowing reasonable market access and a healthy measure of innovation range from a centralised derivatives clearing house to a more sophisticated generation of standardised bilateral swaps contracts. Since credit quality is an important marketing tool for exchange clearing houses, big banks, and the newly-formed AAA credit-enhanced subsidiaries of big investment houses, the debate is coloured by the self-interest. The central clearing house idea has attracted the support of some US banking regulators. A clearing house would guarantee both sides of a swap and limit default risk. With the credit quality of counterparties less of an issue, a central clearing house would, in theory, open up swap market participation to less highly capitalised banks. Chicago's two big futures exchanges would like a slice of the swaps clearing business, and are positioning themselves for a potential bonanza. 'It's something we're considering,' says Mr Jim Slenz, senior director of risk management applications for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The Chicago Board of Trade is making a bid to clear swaps. Late last month, it asked its primary regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to exempt markets traded only by professionals from the constraints of federal oversight. Such an exemption, which has been granted to OTC swaps and off-exchange energy contracts, would allow the CBOT to compete against the OTC markets with its own non-standardised derivatives. However, it would also put the exchange in line to clear swaps and hybrid transactions. The CBOT is a long way from achieving such an exemption. CFTC officials have opposed mingling the derivatives risks of large institutional traders in the same clearing house that protects the investments of small retail futures and options traders. Mr Andrew Coleman, partner in Price Waterhouse's capital markets area, believes a separate 'mega clearing-house' for OTC derivatives could be constructed, but that it would be expensive to establish. He sees drawbacks: the procedures used to clear, or match, highly standardised futures trades in liquid exchange markets do not transfer easily to swaps, which are individually tailored to suit the needs of a single company and are usually difficult to re-sell. The handful of specialist dealers trading swaps would prefer to avoid the expense and standardisation required by a clearing house and negotiate instead a series of bilateral agreements that reduce exposure in the event a partner in a swap defaults. Bilateral agreements allow them to preserve the marketing edge they garner from their AAA credit ratings.</p>

However, applicants state that during the twelve-month period beginning on the first day of January in the year following the date CNGF commences Gas Equipment financing activities pursuant to a Commission order issued in the matter, and for each subsequent calendar year thereafter, the total dollar value of Gas Equipment financing loans made to Financing Customers in the LDC States will exceed the total dollar value of Gas Equipment financing loans made to Financing Customers in all other states.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> CNGF will not act as a representative of any gas equipment manufacturer or supplier but may recommend specific manufacturers or types of gas equipment to end-users. For example, a CNG System LDC marketing representative may recommend to a glass manufacturing company that a new type of gas equipment be installed in a furnace to increase production efficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CNGF will provide Gas Equipment financing to Financing Customers by (1) making short-term loans to cover the period of installation of the Gas Equipment until permanent financing can be obtained by the customer or (2) making long-term loans for a period of time not to exceed the lesser of 10 years or the expected useful life of the equipment. The aggregate amount of Gas Equipment financing loans by CNGF outstanding at any one time will not exceed $25,000,000, with an individual customer financing limit of $5,000,000 at any one time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Loans to Financing Customers may be secured or unsecured and will be made at a spread above the cost of funds from CNG in order to cover CNGF's costs and earn a return on its capital. CNGF does not have any full-time employees, and Applicants expect CNGF to obtain accounting, credit, financial, management, marketing, operating, technical and clerical support, at cost, from CNG Service Company (``Service Company'') pursuant to a written service agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Eurosceptic rebels peer over a cliff: Bill Cash and his followers face an uphill struggle Old-timers will predominate if and when the names of the Tory MPs who have signed a proposed Eurosceptic amendment to the bill increasing the UK's contributions to the European Union are made public. The 30 or so Tory Eurosceptics who voted against the government at crucial junctures of the Maastricht bill's passage through parliament could plausibly have been described as a blend of youth and experience. But most of the young ones appear to have fallen into line with the government. Along with a few more experienced hands, they reason either that Eurosceptics should keep their powder dry until the 1996 European Union inter-governmental conference or that the party needs to be seen to be pulling together if it is to win the next general election, due by April 1997. Mr Bill Cash, the MP for Stafford who is the Eurosceptic ringleader, said yesterday that the amendment he intends to table to the EU finance bill will have the support of at least 15 MPs. Mr Cash, 54, once described as the Tory party's 'white cliff of Dover', has been a formidable adversary for the government throughout the European clashes of the past two and a half years. Since his amendment is unlikely to be voted on, its main effect may be to identify those most determined to block the bill, which Mr John Major has decided to make an issue of confidence. Most Eurosceptics were yesterday tight-lipped. 'I'm shutting up like a clam,' said one. Another confided: 'The more the whips are kept uncertain the better.' But those most likely to add their names to the Cash amendment were thought to include the following: Sir Teddy Taylor, 57, the MP for Southend East, a former Scottish Office minister and an engagingly articulate Thatcherite. He has described the bill as 'a massive embarrassment to everyone' since it will increase public expenditure at a time of huge pressure to cut spending. Mr Tony Marlow, 54, (Northampton North), who astonished colleagues in March by publicly demanding the prime minister's resignation. He is widely seen as a parliamentary bruiser in the mould of Labour's Mr Dennis Skinner. He was chairman of the Commons committee which decided in May that the Pounds 2bn CrossRail project could not be justified. Mr Christopher Gill, 58, (Ludlow), who yesterday told Mr Major he would rather resign the party whip than vote for a bill with which dozens of Tory MPs did not agree and for which there was no popular support. A key organiser throughout the Eurosceptics' Maastricht campaign, he has the air of an old-style English gentleman, but is sometimes known as 'the butcher of Ludlow' in deference to his status as the man behind Gill's sausages. Sir Richard Body, 67, (Holland with Boston), who is thought to have been one of the backbench critics referred to as 'barmy' last year by Mr Major. Shortly afterwards, he met his local party to discuss whether to leave politics, but decided to stay on. Mr Bill Walker, 65, (Tayside North), who has been an outspoken critic of the government on issues other than Europe. Earlier this month he said the situation facing the party after its climbdown on Post Office privatisation was 'desperately serious'. Mr John Wilkinson, 54, (Ruislip-Northwood),an Eton-educated former ministerial aide. Yesterday he said he opposed 'the principle of the legislation'. He added: 'I think it is wholly wrong for the government to seek to commit this country and bind the next parliament to ever-increasing expenditure on the EU.' Other possible rebels are thought to include Mr John Carlisle, the MP for Luton North, Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay), Mr Edward Leigh (Gainsborough and Horncastle), Mr Richard Shepherd (Aldridge Brownhills), Sir Trevor Skeet (Bedfordshire North), Mrs Ann Winterton (Congleton) and Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield). The Maastricht precedent suggests that few, if any, Eurosceptics are likely to oppose the government on a vote of confidence: all fell into line when Mr Major called such a vote after a defeat on the Maastricht bill last July. But some MPs were yesterday insisting that Monday's vote would not fall into that category. Even so, with the government expected to have the support of the nine Ulster Unionists and one Ulster Popular Unionist, a total of 18 Tories would need to vote with the rest of the opposition parties - or 36 to abstain - for Mr Major to be defeated. Last night, that was looking a tall order.</p>

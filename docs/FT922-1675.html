			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Tokyo boosted by hopes of public works package THE JAPANESE stock market rebounded yesterday on hopes that the government might soon boost the economy with a package of public works spending of as much as Y5,000bn-Y8,000bn (Pounds 21bn-Pounds 33bn). The Nikkei market index, which earlier this week had fallen to its lowest level for five years, jumped 474.31 points to 16,519.87 as investors took heart from indications that the government might start serious preparations for a supplementary budget to expand the budget already agreed for the current financial year, which started in April. Investors were particularly interested in indications that the ruling Liberal Democratic party was increasing pressure on the bureaucracy to act before the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Munich early next month. Mr Shin Kanemaru, the LDP's vice president, urged that a secondary budget be prepared soon, in order to prevent the country coming under pressure for extra public spending from the US at a later date. Mr Kanemaru also told a meeting of LDP officials that he wanted a budget of Y8,000bn, substantially more than a proposal of Y5,000bn which had previously been informally discussed by the party. The party officials agreed to prepare specific plans by the end of the month. However, the Ministry of Finance rebuffed Mr Kanemaru's appeal, saying it was still too early to judge the full impact of spending measures approved in March, when public works planned for the second half of the financial year were advanced into the first six months. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, rejected calls to stimulate the economy. He told journalists: 'People suffering from diabetes want to eat a lot but if you give them as much as they want, it will ruin their health.' Despite Mr Hata's protestations, it is widely assumed in Tokyo that there will indeed be a supplementary budget. However, there is a serious debate in the government over its size and timing. Finance Ministry officials would like to see a budget of no more than Y3,000bn or so, and would prefer to wait until September for a decision. LDP leaders, however, want at least an announcement of intent by the end of this month, to be followed by a concrete plan before elections to the upper house of the Diet (parliament) at the end of July.</p>

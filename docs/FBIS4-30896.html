			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 30 (CTK) -- In connection with the  announced visit of Chilean Ground Forces Chief Commander Augusto  Pinochet, President Vaclav Havel believes that it would benefit  Czech-Chilean relations if they were developed by figures  respected in the democratic world, Havel's spokesman Ladislav  Spacek told CTK today.    "The president is convinced that the democratic system in  Chile is lasting and stable. But it would benefit bilateral  relations between the Czech Republic and Chile if they were  developed by personalities who are accepted in the democratic  world without reservations," Spacek said. He said the  Presidential Office had today received letters from journalists  addressed to Havel and denouncing Pinochet's visit. Spacek said  that Havel already spoke critically of the forthcoming visit at  a press conference in Bratislava last Thursday [26 May].    "The visit does not have an official character and neither  the president nor his office has been informed of it in advance.  The Czech Republic is opening its border to all people having  valid travel documents. The president only takes note of the  visit," Spacek said.</p>

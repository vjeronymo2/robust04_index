			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: GWR buys four radio stations for Pounds 15m GWR, the Bristol-based commercial radio group that owns a stake in Classic FM, joined the industry 'premier league' yesterday with a four station deal valued at about Pounds 15m in cash and shares. GWR said yesterday it had conditionally agreed to buy all the shares of Radio Trent, Mercia Sound and Leicester Sound from Capital Radio for Pounds 4.77m in cash and more than 1m GWR shares. At the same time GWR has bought Beacon Broadcasting, the last of the large independent stations, for a total Pounds 3.69m, including debt. The deal, which will take GWR's potential adult audience from 2.9m to 7.1m, including a completely new sphere of influence in the Midlands, will give the company 17 radio licences and an annual turnover of Pounds 18.8m. The acquisitions will be financed partly by raising Pounds 8.72m net through a placing and open offer. Shareholders can acquire shares at 565p in the enlarged group on the basis of 10 shares for every 19 held. Both the Daily Mail and General Trust and Capital Radio will take up their maximum entitlements. Under the deal Daily Mail will hold 20 per cent in the enlarged group and Mr Roger Gilbert will become deputy chairman. Capital will also have a 20 per cent stake. GWR, Capital and Daily Mail are likely consortium partners in a bid for INR 3, the third national commercial radio station. The deal puts GWR in the ranks of the large regional groups such as Clyde in Scotland, Metro in the north, and Capital in London. 'These companies are going to drive the industry towards a greater share of advertising revenue,' Mr Ralph Barnard, chief executive of GWR, said yesterday. Capital decided to sell partly because it recognised GWR's expertise in managing small and medium-sized radio stations. Media Sales Marketing, Capital's advertising sales house, will now sell on behalf of GWR. Capital shares rose from 254p to 281p.</p>

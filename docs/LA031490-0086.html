			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DECEMBER TRAIN CRASH BLAMED ON SPEEDING TRUCKER  </P> <P> An Amtrak passenger train crash that killed three people and injured dozens on  a foggy day last December was caused by the driver of a speeding truck that  smashed through warning gates and hit the train, investigators said Tuesday.  </P> <P> A report by an investigative task force concluded that the driver "was going  too fast for the foggy conditions" at the crash site near Stockton, said  California Highway Patrol spokesman Bob Whitmire.  </P> <P> The truck driver was one of those killed.  </P> <P> The findings contradict a statement by a motorist who was following the  big-rig. The motorist said that warning equipment at the railroad crossing was  not working, Whitmire said.  </P> <P> The driver, David Haskell, 47, was killed instantly as the cab of the big-rig  shattered. The engineer and fireman, who were operating the train within the  speed limit, were burned to death when flames engulfed the derailed engine,  Whitmire said.  </P> <P> The five-car train, carrying more than 140 people, was southbound from Oakland  to Bakersfield when the crash occurred on Dec. 19.  </P></p>

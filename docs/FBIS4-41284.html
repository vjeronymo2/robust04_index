			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin: "Corps of Deputies: We Are </F> Not Stokers or Carpenters, But We Are Continuously at Work"]    [Text] Surprisngly enough, the proposal by the speaker of  parliament's upper chamber, Vladimir Shumeyko, to extend by a  further two years the electoral term of the presidency and  parliament did not provoke a stormy reaction in the lower  chamber.    The Duma members are still in thought. Doctor of Juridical  Sciences M. Mityukov, deputy chairman of the State Duma, did not  conceal the fact: "I need to ponder it. I am not yet ready to  give a response."    Gennadiy Burbulis was more candid: "I support the proposal.  There is no point holding elections for their own sake. Society  needs to develop a good structure over this time."    For whom, in fact, is a consensus at the highest levels an  advantage? For many. For some, because all the possible  nightmares, settling of scores, and squabbles which would  inevitably be unleashed with a sudden change of power, recede  into hazy oblivion. For others, it gives time to resolve their  many personal problems.    There is no doubt that the majority of deputies will be  privately and publicly in favor of extending their term of  office. The only people to be unhappy will be the leaders of  parties and movements who have already publicly stated that they  will put themselves forward as presidential and parliamentary  candidates. Konstantin Borovoy will patently curse. Rutskoy  will stigmatize the proposal. Zhirinovskiy will convene another  news conference, and Baburin has already come out unequivocally  against it: "The deputies are being bought off. The  authorities are evading their responsibility."</p>

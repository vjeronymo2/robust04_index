			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Beating the risks / A look at Norwich Union's record When Thomas Bignold undertook the perilous journey from Kent to Norwich in 1783, no insurance company was prepared to cover him against highway robbers. His indignation led him to found the Norwich Union Association, initially for fire and theft insurance. Later, in 1808, Bignold launched the society's life and pensions business. Today, Norwich Union is the UK's third-largest insurance group and one of the leading providers of personal pensions. Its financial strength is rated as 'adequate' by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, although the society has improved its position since this analysis was made. Norwich Union's solvency margin stands at over Pounds 3.4bn, more than three times the level required by the Department of Trade and Industry, while its free asset ratio - broadly, the ratio between surplus assets and total assets - doubled from 5.95 per cent in 1991 to 10.5 per cent at the end of 1993. The society holds a strong position in the pensions market, where it offers a range of individual plans and group schemes. In a recent survey of personal pensions by Money Management*, Norwich Union was one of only four providers to qualify as a 'best buy' for single premium investments, based on above-average performance and below-average charges. While the society's charges are lower than average for most contracts and investment periods, there is still a front-end loading. This means there is a 40 per cent reduction on each premium paid during the 'initial' period - which can last up to two years on longer-term contracts. These charges cover the society's own costs and payments of commission to the adviser or salesman. Other charges on the unit-linked personal pension plans include the bid/offer spread (the difference in cost between buying and selling units) of 5 per cent; an annual management charge of 0.875 per cent; and a Pounds 3 monthly policy fee. Norwich Union shows greater consistency than many competitors on overall performance. According to Money Management, 70 per cent of the society's results on all funds were above average, with only 10 per cent in the fourth quartile (bottom 25 per cent). The managed unit-linked fund, which invests in the society's range of unit-linked funds, has performed well over the past five years although, for the year to the end of February, returns dropped rather suddenly to the fourth quartile. Philip Scott, Norwich Union's general manager (UK Life), explains: 'The managed fund slipped in the competitor rankings as a result of the less aggressive policy followed in the underlying funds, principally the UK equity fund. This was modestly underweight in the smaller companies' and mid-250 companies' index stocks at the beginning of the year when they experienced strong performance. 'In common with many other funds, the equity fund was underweight in the UK-quoted Hong Kong and Shanghai bank, which performed exceptionally well in the final quarter of 1993.' Several other funds, including international and North American, performed well during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but performance has tailed off since 1992. The international fund, retains an above-average ranking over five years but the North American fund is well below average for this period, particularly on the regular premium contract. Scott says: 'The North American fund performance was adversely impacted in 1993 by the holdings in branded stocks in a year when brand names took something of abattering.' This underperformance also affected the international fund. Elsewhere, Norwich Union's money fund has an excellent short and long term track record, while its with-profits contract is a top performer over all investment periods except five years, where it is slightly below average due to recent cuts in the annual bonus rates. Traditionally, about 90 per cent of the society's individual pensions business has been on the with-profits side but, recently, the split between with-profits and unit-linked has been more even. Transfers of company pension benefits into personal pension plans account for 40,000 out of the society's total sales of more than 500,000 personal pensions. In 1992, Norwich Union - along with two other major providers, Scottish Widows and Standard Life - decided to suspend transfer business from tied agents and direct sales. Scott explains: 'Since July 1992, we have had a team looking at every transfer proposal submitted by our direct sales force or appointed representative channel. The proposal proceeds only when it is clear that good advice has been given.' * Money Management March 1994, Survey of Personal Pensions; FT Magazines, Greystoke Place, Fetter Lane, London EC4A IND.</p>

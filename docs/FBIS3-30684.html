The demonstrators argued that the operation of both parties  involves the danger of a communist rollback.    In a petition to be sent to Speaker of Parliament Gyorgy  Szabad, the 56-ers demand that parliament should dissolve both  parties, freeze their assets, and transfer them to the heroes of  1956 and their relatives.    In the 56-ers' view, as many descendants of the 1956 victims  as possible should be elected members of parliament and the  government, so that the danger of a rollback will diminish.    The petition presses for a coalition with Christian morals  to  be formed after the 1994 elections.    Recent polls show that the socialists have strong voter  support in the country, and the governing coalition sees them as  its strongest rival.    In a simultaneous development, those who suffered a loss in  biohumus production demonstrated on the other side of the square.    Biohumus producers took up loans some years ago. Afterwards,  despite their valid contracts, they failed to sell biohumus and  many of them went bankrupt. The 150 or so demonstrators  gathered in front of parliament to support independent  smallholder deputy Vilmos Bereczky's proposal of writing off  their debts.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 25 (XINHUA) -- GATT  Director-General Peter Sutherland today urged all signatory  countries to ratify the Uruguay Round agreement without delay.    "There will certainly be some governments facing significant  domestic pressures seeking to amend the deal or even to overturn  it altogether", he warned when addressing the 27th international  meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC) here today.    "However, such governments will have to face down those  pressures knowing that the rest of the world is waiting and  watching," he told the plenary session on critical trade issues  under the theme of "Aftermath of the Uruguay Round".    At a press conference later he said about 20 to 30 of the  120  GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) contracting  members have ratified the Uruguay Round of agreement adopted in  Marrakesh this year, paving the way for the formation of the  World Trade Organization on January 1 next year.    There were no reports from major trading nations such as the  United States, the European Union or Japan that they have  ratified the pact.    "it would be incomprehensible for the United States not to  ratify the pact in time," he said.    The Clinton administration has set August 15 as the deadline  for congressional approvals. Sutherland said "it is the  leadership role as signified by President Clinton that the  ratification is made".    On the resumption of China's GATT membership, Sutherland  termed it as a priority for GATT Secretariat. "It is true to say  that a World Trade Organization without China as part of it is  less than a complete organization," he emphasized.    He said the negotiations on the subject have reached a  "decisive phase", as there is "a demanding schedule" for a  protocol to be agreed by the summer time.    Although there is a widespread recognition that significant  (trade) liberalization steps have recently taken place in China,  the contracting parties still "have legitimate and serious  demands which have to be recognized and understood by China", he  said, adding "it will require will and cooperation and  constructive dialogue of everybody".    "We'll give the utmost importance to it and will press  forward the negotiations," he said.</p>

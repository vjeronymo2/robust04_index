			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> SCHOOL GROUPS WIN SALES TAX EXEMPTION  </P> <P> In a victory for schoolchildren and a defeat for the tax man, Gov. George  Deukmejian signed into a law Friday a bill that would exempt school-sponsored  youth groups from having to collect sales tax on items they sell. The measure,  sponsored by Assemblyman Johan Klehs (D-Castro Valley), nullifies a decision by  the State Board of Equalization that required most school groups to collect  sales tax on many items they sell to earn money for after-school activities.  The board made the decision as part of a 3-2 ruling against the Monterey High  School wrestling team, which had been served with a $1,000 bill for sales taxes  officials said it should have collected when it sold fried calamari at a county  fair.  </P></p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / World Trade News: Secret move to end Gatt deadlock EC and US trade negotiators met secretly near London yesterday, trying to find compromises on world farm trade reform. If they succeeded, the way will be clear for President Bush and EC President Jacques Delors, who meet in Washington next week, to end a deadlock in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. Brussels officials would say only that the negotiators were meeting for one day at a hotel near London's Heathrow airport. They refused to disclose if headway was made. Next week's Washington summit, originally a routine meeting between the two leaders, has assumed greater importance as it has become clear it provides one of the last chances for significant progress in winning a Uruguay Round agreement before November's US presidential elections. If it fails, many fear trade conflicts will grow in the months ahead, especially between the US, the EC and Japan  - as international business leaders have indicated in a letter to heads of state and governments of major trading nations.* The US negotiating team was made up of Mr Julius Katz and Mr Richard Crowder from the US Trade Representative's Office. EC negotiators were Mr Guy Legras, director-general for agriculture, and Mr Hugo Paeman, the EC's senior trade negotiator. After months of often acrimonious negotiation between the US and the EC on farm trade reform, differences have been narrowed to: EC demands that income support to farmers should not be defined as trade-distorting; EC demands for the US to restrain exports to Europe of cereal substitutes; US demands for the EC to limit the volume as well as the value of farm exports; EC demands that the US accept a 'peace clause' under which US companies agree not to challenge EC subsidies under US law. Observers in Geneva say differences on these issues are now small, the only thing preventing agreement being a lack of political will. At the fore of those pressing for a farm trade settlement is Mr Jurgen Mollemann, Germany's economics minister, who argued recently that leaders from the Group of Seven industrial countries should call a special summit if next week's Washington talks fail to win a breakthrough. Germans' anxieties focus on a G7 summit being hosted by Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Munich in July. They fear acrimony over the failure to liberalise trade may sour the meeting. But France, the EC's biggest farm exporter, has shown no sign of the flexibility needed for a Gatt deal. French farmers believe the new premier, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, will resist pressure for deep cuts in farm subsidies. * Business leaders' letter, Page 17</p>

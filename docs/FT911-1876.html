			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Observer: Small business It is rare for a general chamber of commerce to become a political hotbed. But that's what has happened in Hong Kong where big-business interests keen to quieten anti-China dissent have squashed the colony's self-styled spokesman for small business, 67-year-old expatriate Jimmy McGregor. A former director of the chamber and its representative on Hong Kong's legislative council since 1988, he has just declared he will not stand in the next council elections. The reason, he claims, is that the big businesses dominating the chamber's general committee have 'stacked the cards' against him, favouring his opponent Paul Cheng. Cheng, an executive director of Inchcape Pacific, already sits on the legislative body as a government nominee. 'It stinks,' says the abrasive McGregor, who defeated an establishment candidate for council membership in 1988, and has called for faster democratic development as well as greater resistance to China than the chamber's big names could stomach. One who has been particularly angered by his stance is Helmut Sohmen, who runs the shipping empire of father-in-law Sir Yue-Kong Pao. Another is the chamber's new chairman Vincent Lo, a construction and property entrepreneur with close China connections. McGregor's predicament is partly self-inflicted because he has gone his own way without trying to build bridges with his critics. But Cheng, who exemplifies Inchcape blandness and government orthodoxy, is a pale replacement. Such machinations, although perhaps making China and big business happy, do little for democracy - especially in a place like Hong Kong where it has hardly begun developing.</p>

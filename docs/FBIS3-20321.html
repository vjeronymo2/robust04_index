The  office manager for the Syrian vice president overmodestly  pretended to be first secretary of the embassy in Prague when he  filled in the immigration card at Budapest Airport. He provided  the following as the purpose of his trip: "tourism."    However, Nabil Sharitah, 44, was aware that he would not  have  any time for the view of the Danube in room 214 of the Forum  Hotel. An envoy of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND)  expected him there for a conspiratorial meeting.    The West German agent forced his partner in the discussion  to  come to Budapest by threatening to disclose various things in  the Syrian's eventful life. There the BND man, who had also  brought an official of the Federal Office of Criminal  Investigation (BKA) with him, sharply interrogated the Arab.    After a nervous breakdown, Sharitah signed a paper: "I  declare that I will fly to Germany of my own free will."    The interest of German authorities in the Syrian diplomat is  understandable. Sharitah, who was arrested in Berlin in January  after he had entered the country, is the key figure in  spectacular proceedings concerning international terrorism in  Berlin. And he is better aware than most people of his  government's cordial relations with a man who is hunted all over  the world: Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, called "Carlos."    Top terrorist Carlos, 44, whose bloody trail leads from the  attack on the Vienna OPEC conference in 1975 (three deaths) to  the bomb attack on the Marseilles central station in 1983 (four  deaths), also pulled the strings for an attack on the French  cultural center Maison de France in Berlin on 25 August 1983.  German Johannes Weinrich, 46, Carlos' right-hand man, had  delivered the material for the bomb, nitropenta plastic  explosive, to East Berlin.    And the gray gentlemen from the Stasi also participated.  First, they took the explosive consignment away from Weinrich,  but they returned it to him after some hesitation. Stasi  Lieutenant Colonel Helmut Voigt, who is today 51 years old and  is charged with aiding and abetting murder by a grand criminal  division of the Berlin Land Court, was responsible for it. Last  week, the public prosecutor demanded four and a half years'  imprisonment; the sentence is expected before Easter.    Shahritah, who was the third secretary of the Syrian Embassy  in East Berlin at that time, also provided assistance for the  terrorist attack. Weinrich first stored his bomb materiel in  Sharitah's workroom. A cache from Carlos' group -- with Italian  submachine guns, electrical fuzes, and 6,100 rounds of  ammunition for 9 mm self-loading weapons -- had been there for  years.    The diplomat had been instructed by a very high official  that  he should be at the service of Carlos' gang. The intelligence  service of the Syrian Air Force had ordered through official  channels via the Foreign Ministry in Damascus that the  desperados "be helped in any way possible."    Embassy Councillor Sharitah's support for Carlos has gotten  him charged with having aided and abetted murder and caused a  bomb explosion. However, more than 10 years after the deed, the  legal assessment of the bloody attack is in danger of being lost  in a tangle of agents' games and diplomatic tactics.    Syria, which has been notorious as a godfather of  international terrorism for years, is playing a key role in the  peaceful solution being pursued in the Middle East. Last week,  during a visit to Bonn, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'  stated ambiguously that German-Syrian relations must not be  clouded by the Berlin lawsuit.    However, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic  Party of Germany) gave the Syrians the brush-off: Lawsuits are  "exclusively the courts' business in the rule-of-law state of  Germany."    It has not yet been finally clarified how and why Sharitah,  for whom a German arrest warrant was issued only in the autumn  of 1993, gave himself up to the Berlin judiciary at all. There  are many indications of dilletantism and questionable forgery  practices by German services during the operation.    According to the most plausible version, an Arab BND member  got in touch with Sharitah by telephone from southern Europe.  It was the BND's priority interest to investigate Carlos and  Weinrich's habitat. The two terrorists were granted asylum in  Damascus. Since October 1992, Bonn has been demanding their  extradition from Syria through verbal note 549.    Now, pressure that is more common in this line of business  was supposed to help. The German security authorities evaluated  comprehensive documents that had been accumulated on Sharitah;  among them were details on possible compromising contacts.    Apparently the material was enough to force Sharitah to  participate in the meeting in Budapest. However, he claims that  he came voluntarily, "for private reasons," to the Hungarian  capital.    As an investigator reported, the Syrian's interrogation,  which took hours, ended in dissent between the police and the  agent. The BKA official wanted to transfer the accused to  Germany, while the BND agent advocated a "professional"  solution: Sharitah should spy for the Germans from Damascus.    According to the investigator, another idea only took shape  when Sharitah had been "completely broken down" in the  interrogation: The Syrian should travel to Germany and give  himself up there.    First of all, however, the papers necessary to do this were  lacking. Sharitah only had a diplomatic visa (15305005) for a  visit to the FRG, which was not yet stamped "invalid," but had  expired on 17 May 1993. In the hotel room the last figure was  removed "with a razor blade" and replaced with a 4, an  investigator reported.    However, the controllers at Budapest Airport became  suspicious. Therefore, the conspiratorial trio did not fly, as  planned, to Berlin right away. Only then, this time with the  help of the local BKA resident responsible for drug searches,  and the embassy, did they procure a regular visa. It was issued  on 7 January 1994.    The BKA refuses to provide any information on that.  However, last Friday [25 March] the Foreign Ministry in Bonn  confirmed to DER SPIEGEL, which has a copy of the relevant visa,  that the visa had actually become invalid in 1993. The Berlin  judiciary is currently holding onto the doctored diplomatic  passport.    Berlin Senior Public Prosecutor Detlev Mehlis ("Nobody  dragged him here in a box") feared that the lives of Sharitah  and his family were in "serious danger." Therefore, seven weeks  ago, the principal witness in the lawsuit dealing with the  attack on the Maison de France was only permitted to give  evidence hidden behind a screen and the courtroom in Moabit  resembled a fortress.    While Sharitah initially feared for his life, a surprising  change -- mysterious Orient -- has now occurred. After a visit  to his cell by the Syrian ambassador, principal witness Sharitah  pretends to know nothing about the Syrians' terrorist  connection. Now he is expressing his latest insight to judges  and public prosecutors: "Syria is combating terrorism." At any  rate, he never saw Carlos and Weinrich again in Damascus, he  said.    This fits in with the official version that the Syrian  foreign minister presented to his Bonn counterpart Kinkel the  week before last. Accordingly, the two terrorists left the  country long ago -- for Aden in Yemen or Tripoli in Libya.    However, according to the BKA files of the investigations,  Carlos and his German companion are still very well-known in  Damascus -- even in the German Embassy.    According to these documents, Weinrich, who has a fleet of  eight Mercedes limousines in the Syrian capital, always tries to  be near his compatriots. In 1991 he still made merry at the  Lufthansa Oktoberfest in the Sheraton and he appeared almost  daily in the hotel's pub.    A Mercedes major account manager also invited Weinrich, who  called himself "Peter Schmidt" at that time, to his home --  diplomats made merry together with them. A witness said: "I  have to proceed on the assumption that Schmidt is also very  well-known to German Embassy personnel."    Reportedly, bon vivant Weinrich, who, according to the  witness, always carries a gun in a "hip holster on his right  side," even presented comrade-in-arms Carlos a Mercedes and  introduced him with the following words: "This is my boss."  German businessmen also spotted the two top terrorists again  and again at the Sheraton bar.    In the summer of 1991, two BKA officers traveled to Damascus  to finally find out for certain. A Mercedes employee was to  procure Weinrich's fingerprints.    The attempt was successful. "In order to comply with my duty  as a citizen," the businessmen recovered an empty pack of Lucky  Strike cigarettes that the terrorist had thrown into the  wastepaper basket. "Peter Schmidt's" fingerprints removed the  last doubts: They were those of Johannes Weinrich.    The evidence on Mr. Schmidt's life is also piling up with  the  Berlin police. Last July, Weinrich was still seen in Damascus.  There he went about his daily business undisturbed, although  Kinkel's Foreign Ministry had briefed the Syrians on the  contents of the BKA reports long ago.    Public Prosecutor Mehlis passed the findings on to the land  court. In his accompanying letter, he announced resignedly  that, in addition, he would make them accessible to the Foreign  Ministry, "in order to gain support for the local request for  Weinrich's deportation" -- "although it seems to me that the  result is a foregone conclusion."</p>

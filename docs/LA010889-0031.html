			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES: A PEACE WALK, 100 HOURS OF FOOTAGE AND A PRIZE FILM  </P> <P> Peace marches have gotten to be a habit with film producer Cathy Zheutlin of  Santa Monica. Zheutlin's film, "Just One Step: The Great Peace March," began a  three-weekend premiere showing here Saturday, one day after she returned from  the Soviet Union and her wedding -- to Russian cameraman Edis Yurchis whom she  met on the Soviet-American Peace Walk in the summer of 1987.  </P> <P> Zheutlin, who received permission to film the 1986 trek across America only 10  days before it was scheduled to leave Los Angeles, shot the march for 300 days,  ending up with more than 100 hours of footage to edit when she returned home.  She got a personal loan to buy a used motor home for the trip.  </P> <P> Although Zheutlin and her film crew received initial funds from Guenette  Productions to begin the walk, she raised additional money to continue it  through mailings, fund-raisers and donations in towns and cities along the  route. In the daytime, she served as film director and a camera operator; at  night, as producer and production manager. To cut production costs, Zheutlin  trained several marchers to work as sound recordists and production assistants.  </P> <P> "The march is really about people acting according to their beliefs," Zheutlin  said of her film. "And documenting their remarkable journey gave me a chance to  live and work according to my own personal values." Zheutlin's mother, Jonnie,  was one of the marchers on the 3,700-mile walk.  </P> <P> "Just One Step" received the first prize for social issues films at the  Anthropos Film Festival, co-sponsored by the American Film Institute and the  Discovery Channel and was given a Cine Golden Eagle Award and a Bronze Apple  Award. It will be shown at 10:15 a.m. today, and on Saturday and next Sunday,  and Jan. 21-22 at the Laemmle Monica Fourplex, 1332 2nd St., Santa Monica. LYNN  SIMROSS  </P></p>

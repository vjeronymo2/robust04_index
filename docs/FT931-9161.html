			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mackay suggests press ombudsman A PRESS ombudsman with the power to award compensation for libel was suggested yesterday by Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, as a means of improving access to justice for ordinary people in defamation cases. The lord chancellor told the Commons national heritage committee inquiry into privacy and media intrusion, that there was no realistic possibility of extending legal aid to cover defamation cases in the immediate future. 'This is not a good time for that. I am already looking at ways of containing the scope of the legal aid budget. Circumstances are not auspicious for opening up legal aid,' he told the MPs. In line with that, Lord Mackay said he was keen to encourage systems for dealing with disputes which did not require going to court. A press ombudsman or a number of press ombudsmen could provide a simpler, cheaper, quicker and more informal way of dealing with defamation claims. Lord Mackay said he envisaged the ombudsman having the power to award compensation and being obliged to publish his findings. Those who used the ombudsman system would not necessarily have to waive their rights to pursue an action through the courts but safeguards would have to be built in to ensure people did not use the ombudsman system as a means of testing the strength of their case before litigating. Limiting the ombudsman's powers to order redress would be a way of encouraging only those interested in a quick and speedy resolution of their dispute to use the ombudsman system. Lord Mackay also said he was prepared to consider extending the 'no-win, no-fee' conditional fee system to defamation cases. He proposed to allow conditional fee arrangements in personal injury cases this year and would consider extending it to libel actions.</p>

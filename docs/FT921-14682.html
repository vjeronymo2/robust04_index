			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Jobs: A good way of demotivating the majority' - Study casts doubt on the usefulness of performance-pay schemes for executives THEY'RE like illicit love affairs . . . or so I'm told, anyway' said Derek Torrington of University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. 'When you're not personally involved in one, you feel you're missing out on something marvellous. When you are involved, you spend most of the time being miserable.' What the UMIST professor was talking about was performance-related pay schemes for higher-ranked staff, which used to be called incentive-pay systems. And by the end of his session at the British Psychological Society's conference the other day, he and his audience had shed light on the reasons for the change of title. For one thing, some 95 per cent of those present felt that, in general, such schemes had more of a disincentive effect than the opposite. Derek Torrington has studied their workings in eight big business groups in Britain. Although he may not name them, they comprise one each in chemicals, oil, specialised lubricants, water-supply, telecommunications, computers, plus a bank and a conglomerate. One of his findings is that the schemes are apt to be inflationary. When the groups decided to instal them, the usual prediction had been that they would add 3 to 3 1/2 per cent to the relevant paybill. As things turned out, the increase ran into double digits in several cases, and in one of them was no less than 27 per cent. The unexpectedly high expense was perhaps the main reason why all the groups remained firmly committed to the schemes as an important part of policy. For the commitment could scarcely be explained by the way they were working. Of the eight, only one could honestly say that its scheme was successful. The professor suspects that whether such devices work hinges decisively on company culture. For instance, the successful one was in the computer group marked by sales-orientation of a strength far more often found in the United States than the United Kingdom. Moreover, the tenet that pay should depend much on performance-measures is a fundamental principle of the company's philosophy. 'If that's what everyone believes, you're maybe OK,' he said. 'But otherwise you can easily raise the spectre of unfairness.' In a real pay-by-performance culture, employees presumably see themselves as resembling market traders. In Britain if not Europe generally, however, most people expect something different from employment. Derek Torrington illustrated the difference by contrasting his efforts as an author of books on management - he has at least partly written 25 of them - with his work as an academic. In his author's role, he would never think it unfair that popular novelists should make so much more money out of the activity. But he might well be aggrieved to find the same was true of his fellow professors. What's more, the bulk of the schemes included so-called performance criteria that certainly did not reduce the risk of raising the spectre of unfairness. The bank was the most eccentric in dishing out the performance pay in advance on estimates of staff's likely achievements over the next 12 months. True, there was machinery for adjustments the following year in the event of shortfall. But the mechanism was apparently not often used. And while the rest waited for results to happen before rewarding them, their measures of what constituted above-average achievement were sometimes questionable to say the least. In the conglomerate, for example, managers in the Pounds 20,000 salary range were receiving performance bonuses for being punctual. So it is perhaps hardly surprising that seven of the eight schemes studied had proved less than a resounding success. Indeed it may even be, as a member of the audience suggested, that with only rare exceptions the effect of performance-pay schemes is to encourage the few at the cost of demotivating the many. NOW to the table below which shows a sample of the international living- costs indicators drawn up by the P-E International management consultancy. Anyone wanting the full survey, which gives data on many more places than the 60 I have room for and costs Pounds 300, should contact Simon McBride of P-E at Park House, Wick Rd, Egham, Surrey TW20 0HW; tel 0784 434411, fax 0784 437828. The cost indices in all cases refer to particular cities as distinct from entire countries, and are based on London prices at 100. Since the survey takes time to compile, its findings are not bang up to date. The actual levels reflected by the indices are those prevailing last October. The currency exchange-rates are those of the same date, but the inflation rates are the latest P-E could obtain from official sources before the survey went to press. Unfortunately, since nobody seems able to devise an internationally consistent gauge of housing costs, no account of them is taken in the indices. Otherwise, they should be a tolerably approximate guide, not least because prices tend to stay fairly stable and so can be updated for currency fluctuations. The adjustment is made by taking the exchange rate shown in the table, dividing it by the latest market rate, and then multiplying the result by the index figure.</p>

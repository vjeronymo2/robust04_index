			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 27, IRNA -- Cuban Ambassador to Tehran  Enrique Trujillo Rapallo in a meeting with Majlis Vice-Speaker  Hojat ol-Eslam Hasan Ruhani here today described Iran-Cuba  relations as excellent.    Emphasizing the significance of expanding political,  economic  and cultural relations between Tehran and Havana, he said that  formation of parliamentary friendship groups will be an  effective step to boost bilateral cooperation.    Ruhani said that Cuba has been friendly to Iran since the  victory of the Islamic revolution and called for enhancement of  mutual relations.    Referring to the plots of the world arrogance led by the  U.S.  against Third World countries, Ruhani said the U.S. was bent on  confronting any country which opposed its hegemony or wanted to  safeguard its independence.    Ruhani expressed the readiness of the Iranian parliament to  set up parliamentary friendship groups between the two  countries.</p>

He said that  during his talks with Environment Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat in  Vienna last Thursday [20 January], Austria's stand was partially  changed and Austria now respected the principle of  non-interference in the internal affairs of the Czech Republic,  including decisions by the Czech Government. It is therefore  possible to complete the construction of two blocks of the south  Bohemian nuclear power plant at Temelin, some 100 kilometers  from the Austrian border, Dlouhy said.    The issue of the construction of a temporary storage  facility  for nuclear waste in Dukovany, south Moravia, was also  negotiated. The Czech side feels that Austrian opinions should  be presented only on the basis of international agreements while  the Czech Republic proposes meetings to be held between experts  from both countries, Dlouhy said.</p>

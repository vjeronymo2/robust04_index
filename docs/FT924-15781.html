			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: CCF 11.4% ahead at halfway CREDIT Commercial de France (CCF), the large French bank, yesterday confirmed it was considering the acquisition of Charterhouse, the UK investment bank, and announced an increase in first-half net profits. Mr Michel Pebereau, chairman, said CCF had achieved its 11.4 per cent increase in net profits to FFr495m (Dollars 103.6m) in the first six months of 1992 from FFr444.1m in the same period last year despite the 'difficult' economic environment. He attributed the bank's progress to 'prudent' provision policies and cost control. The announcement of CCF's profits growth comes at a time when other French banks, notably Credit Lyonnais and Banque Indosuez, have been forced to make steep increases in provisions because of the precarious state of the property market and the rise in business failures. CCF, like the rest of the French banking sector, has been steadily expanding outside France to counter the competitive state of its domestic market. The acquisition of Charterhouse, the investment banking subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, could form part of that. Although Mr Pebereau said yesterday that CCF's deliberations were at a 'preliminary stage'. During the first half, CCF, which has positioned its retail banking operations in France as a service-oriented network, saw net banking income increase by 2.7 per cent to FFr4.05bn. Gross operating profits rose by 6.6 per cent to FFr1.21bn, mainly because the bank managed to restrict the increase in costs to 1.1 per cent, below France's annual inflation rate of 3 per cent. Credit Mutuel, another French bank, expects to produce static profits this year, 3/32 according to Mr Etienne Pflimlin, chairman. In 1991 Credit Mutuel made net profits of FFr1.33bn.</p>

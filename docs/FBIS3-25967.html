Speaking on "responsibilities of the NWS" at the sixth  regional meeting on "Cooperation in the Maintenance of Peace and  Security, and Disarmament", deputy division chief of the  International Organizations and Conferences Department of the  Chinese Foreign Ministry Wang Jun said today that all the NWS  should also enter into early negotiations on the conclusion of  relevant international treaties.    Wang said, "it is our view that conditions for negotiations  on the conclusion of such multilateral treaties are ripe under  the new international situation."    The NWS as the permanent members of the UN Security Council  at the same time, are duty-bound to improve cooperation so as to  better fulfill their special responsibility entrusted by the  charter for the maintenance of international peace and security,  Wang stressed.    Some 47 delegates or observers from 30 countries or agencies  attended the three-day regional meeting which opened here on  Monday [31 January]. The meeting was organized by the UN  Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the  Pacific.</p>

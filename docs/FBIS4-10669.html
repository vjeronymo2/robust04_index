			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cuban Electric Union reported yesterday that the  continuous and lengthy power cuts in the country are caused by  serious generation problems.    Officials from the electric union last night reported that  from a total generation capacity of 3,132 mw throughout the  country, more than half is produced by thermoelectric plants  built in Russia or Czechoslovakia. The thermoelectric plants in  Santa Cruz del Norte and Mariel in the western part of the  country, and Rente in Santiago de Cuba were manufactured by the  Soviet Union, while the Nuevitas thermoelectric plant, which has  a generation capacity of 550 mw, was built in Czechoslovakia.    Electric Union officials said Cuba has not received any  spare  parts for these plants since 1990, and only since May 1993 has  the country has been able to maintain a certain level of spare  parts for programmed maintenance operations and repair of  unexpected breakdowns.    Right now, from that total generation capacity, 570 mw are  affected by the plants' maintenance problems, 821 mw by  breakdowns, and 372 mw by generation limitations -- the  equipment operating at lower capacity.    Some spare parts and other meterials necessary for a  maintenance program are already in the country, while others are  about to be acquired. These spare parts will allow recovery of  the generation capacity of these plants.    Despite our economic limitations, the country has provided  the necessary resources to make this inevitable investment, in  an effort to solve the current problems as soon as possible. The  lengthy power cuts will begin a gradual reduction process  throughout the country, to the extent that the maintenance  programs required by these plants are fulfilled.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Russia 'must accept UK beef' in EC aid RUSSIA will have to accept British beef as part of European Community aid if emergency food deliveries are to continue as planned, European Commission officials said yesterday. One senior official said Russia's rejection of the free UK beef - because of fears it might be contaminated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy or 'mad cow disease' - could have been prompted by rival EC beef producers seeking future orders from the former Soviet republics, which will get EC food credits to pay for them. The Commission's agriculture management committee is to decide tomorrow on new aid deliveries and 'it goes without saying that there will be further consignments of British beef', a senior Commission official said. Britain expressed its irritation at the delays in obtaining Russian clearance for British beef sent as part of EC aid, and a Foreign Office minister hinted that food aid policy to Russia might have to be reconsidered. Mrs Lynda Chalker, overseas development minister, said in a radio interview: 'If they are going to react like this we have lots of other things to do, not only with our beef but with our time.' Brussels is concerned that Russia's initial refusal of a 120 tonnes consignment of UK beef could lead to a disastrous new consumer scare over meat safety. The BSE scare was one of the main contributory factors in last year's near collapse of the EC's saturated market for beef. The British beef came from intervention stockpiles, financed by the EC to keep meat prices up, and had arrived in Murmansk last night where it was due to be canned. It was part of the Ecu200m (Pounds 145m) emergency food aid agreed at last month's Maastricht summit for Moscow and St Petersburg. This programme is in addition to the Ecu250m food aid the EC has been delivering over the past six months, and separate from the Ecu1.25bn in food credits the Community plans for the former Soviet republics, Ecu500m of which was agreed on December 16. Tomorrow's management committee meeting is likely to decide that future consignments of aid should be made of any food deemed safe for trade within the EC. This will include British beef. However, the next delivery was not scheduled to be from the UK, and officials hope this will offer a breathing space to clear any obstacles to future British consignments. Germany yesterday despatched 10 transport and distribution experts to Moscow and St Petersburg, and called for concerted EC supervision of aid distribution, after reports of large-scale diversion of food aid on to the Russian black market. Mr Dieter Vogel, the Bonn government spokesman, said the Russian distribution system could only work 'with western help and support'.</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE / TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> IRVINE'S ALR EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE FIRST DEAL WITH NATIONAL RETAIL CHAIN  </P> <P> Advanced Logic Research, the Irvine-based maker of IBM-compatible computers, is  expected to announce today that it has signed its first agreement with a  national computer retail chain to sell ALR computers.  </P> <P> To date, ALR has sold its PCs primarily through computer resellers.  </P> <P> As a relatively small PC maker in an intensely competitive business, the Irvine  firm has had difficulty gaining space on retailers' shelves as an alternative  to International Business Machines and Compaq Computer.  </P> <P> The development is yet another boost for ALR, which sold stock to the public  for the first time on April 11. Last week, the Irvine firm signed a  distribution agreement with Softsel/Microamerica, a giant PC distributor based  in El Segundo.  </P> <P> ALR expects to report its second-quarter results today.  </P></p>

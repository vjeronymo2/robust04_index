			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS VOTES NO ON PAY RAISE  </P> <P> I am more and more convinced our government could best be improved, not by pay  increases, but with only one elected term of six to eight years, with one-third  or one-fourth of the legislative body replaced every two years. A retiring  representative could choose to run for a Senate seat, or vice versa, accept a  government appointment or otherwise serve, but never run for reelection to the  same office.  </P> <P> We don't need lifetime politicians! We need people who want to serve our  country without concern of "special interest groups" to be reelected. Rather  than 94% of incumbents returning (who really has a chance), new faces with new  ideas could invigorate our governing bodies. Perhaps "crisis" government would  finally end. I would also carry this one-term policy to state, city and county  governments.  </P> <P> RITA SIEMONS  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> QUAYLE BACKS LIMIT ON CONGRESS TERMS  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle on Friday joined the political bandwagon to limit the  terms of officeholders, proposing that members of Congress be forced to retire  after a specific number of terms.  </P> <P> "Everywhere I go, I come across a spirit of real disappointment with  Washington," Quayle said in a speech prepared for delivery in Louisville, Ky.  </P> <P> "The people are restless. Congress' recent budget spectacular has only added  fuel to the feeling of 'Let's get rid of the rascals.' "  </P> <P> Quayle's comments came as the Bush Administration sought to represent Congress  as the roadblock to a budget agreement and deflect criticism heaped on  President Bush in the past few days.  </P> <P> A text of the vice president's speech to the Society of Professional  Journalists was released by his office in Washington.  </P> <P> Quayle, who served 12 years in Congress, said in a TV interview last week that  he has long favored limitations on the terms of officeholders. He did not  propose a specific term limit in his speech Friday, but as a freshman  congressman, he proposed a 12-year limit on both Senate and House members.  </P> <P> "In my view, what is good for the President is good for the Congress," he said  in his speech, referring to the constitutional amendment limiting the President  to two terms.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An Afghan mojahed taken prisoner by the Nagorno  Karabakh Army has vowed to fight on its side if he was not put  to death.    Bakhtiyar Werballah Baberzayid, 20, told INTERFAX he would  take the side of Azerbaijan's disputed Armenian-speaking enclave  because its soldiers were better fighters than Azerbaijanis. He  also said he knew some of Azerbaijan's military secrets, such as  its field works system on some sections of the front, mainly in  the Fizuli sector. He said that, with a platoon of good  soldiers, he would be able to take a whole district in  Azerbaijan.    Baberzayid, who comes from Mazar-e Sharif, said the  Azerbaijani Army has a permanent contingent of between 2,000 and  2,500 Afghan mojahedin. He said that up to 250 of them are  currently fighting in the Fizuli sector alone, where he  commanded a detachment of 20. They are based in the town of  Beilagan, he said.    The prisoner said Azerbaijan had promised him and other  mojahedin a monthly pay of up to 5,000 U.S. dollars. But for  the first two months, a probation period, each of them had been  paid 1,000 Azerbaijani manats a month.    Baberzayid said mojahedin usually serve in infantry and  assault forces, since most of them have rich experience in  mountain warfare and are highly skilled in the use of all types  of mainly Soviet-made firearms.    The Nagorno Karabakh Army, meanwhile, confirmed Azerbaijani  media reports that there are Lezghins, members of one of the  smaller Caucasus ethnic groups, in its ranks. The Army staff  said that up to 20 Lezghin volunteers from northern Azerbaijan  are today fighting on the Nagorno-Karabakh side and quoted one  of them as saying, "What is being decided in Nagorno-Karabakh is  the fate not only of the Armenians but also of the Lezghins,  Talysh and other national minorities, whose territories were  forcibly incorporated into Azerbaijan at the behest of Stalin  and communist authorities."</p>

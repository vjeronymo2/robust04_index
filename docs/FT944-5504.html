			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Student numbers to be capped for four years Student numbers in UK universities will be held at their present level for four years, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, told vice-chancellors yesterday. The decision, taken as part of the Budget, extends the planned period of consolidation from the previously announced three years, and means the proportion of 18-year-olds admitted by universities will not start to rise again until 1998. Mrs Shephard said the total number of new students would drop slightly next year, thanks to a fall in the number of 18-year-olds. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, which represents UK universities, said it was 'very disappointed' by the decision which would make it 'more difficult to achieve the government's targets by the end of the century'. Lecturers responded angrily. The Association of University Teachers said: 'This makes a nonsense of putting more resources into higher education and increasing expectations.' At present the government hopes 33 per cent of 18-year-olds will enter higher education each year by the year 2000. The present figure is around 30 per cent. Mrs Shephard said the government would encourage more part-time and mature students. Ministers also want universities to use the period of consolidation to ensure that their quality assurance systems are effective, following claims of falling standards. To achieve this, Mrs Shephard yesterday called for a reform of the system for quality audit and assessment. At present, the Higher Education Quality Council, a self-regulatory body, carries out audits to ensure standards are uniform, while the Higher Education Funding Council, a government agency, makes quality assessments to determine funding. Mrs Shephard said: 'I recognise that the present separate assessment and audit programmes are seen as heavy-handed.' She added that she sympathised with those who wanted the two programmes brought together 'in the next year or two'. She has asked the funding council to report on a new structure by next spring, and said she hoped any system would be as transparent as possible. The vice-chancellors and principals committee said such a move would 'provide greater value for money, promote genuine quality enhancement and reduce administrative burden', while the quality council agreed the two processes should be brought together.</p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YELTSIN OFFERS TO SHARE POWER IN NEW BID FOR RUSSIAN PRESIDENCY  </P> <P> Populist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin on Monday renewed his bid to become  president of Russia, the Soviet Union's largest republic, and offered  conservatives a share in a coalition government.  </P> <P> Yeltsin failed to muster enough votes in the first two rounds of balloting.  </P> <P> In the latest round on Saturday, he fell 28 votes short of the 531 needed in  the Russian Congress.  </P> <P> On Monday, Yeltsin told the 1,060-member Congress he is willing to form a  coalition with his opponents.  </P> <P> He invited members of the Communist Party bloc and others to "work out a deal  that would please the majority of Russian deputies."  </P> <P> Yeltsin's opponents in today's contest will be the republic's current prime  minister, Alexander V. Vlasov, and Valentin Tsoy, a little-known businessman  from the Soviet Far East.  </P> <P> In a switch to block Yeltsin's candidacy for the Russian presidency, the  Communist Party dropped its support for hard-liner Ivan K. Polozkov and  resurrected Vlasov's candidacy.  </P> <P> Vlasov, the candidate initially picked by Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev, withdrew in apparent disgrace Friday after a lackluster defense of  the Kremlin leader's policies.  </P> <P> But he rejoined the contest Monday, and Polozkov, a party boss from Krasnodar  in southern Russia, pulled out.  </P> <P> Russia, the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics, stretches from the  Baltic to the Pacific and includes Moscow and many major cities. It is home to  more than half the country's population.  </P> <P> Yeltsin called on the deputies to reject the central Soviet government's  program for a transition to a partial market economy, which was announced last  week.  </P> <P> "The Congress must take the citizens of Russia under its defense," he said.  </P> <P> Discontent over the economic program, which will double food prices, has  boosted Yeltsin's chances, his backers say.  </P></p>

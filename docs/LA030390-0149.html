			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE STATE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> THIS TIME, GOLDEN WEST REACHES FINAL GAME  </P> <P> Golden West College made up for a slow start in plenty of time to take a 74-59  victory over Cerritos in the semifinals of state tournament Friday night at  College of the Sequoias.  </P> <P> Golden West scored only 10 points in the first 10 minutes, but point guard Bits  Sirchia broke free for 12 points in the next 10 to spark the Rustlers.  </P> <P> Sirchia and Claudette Jackson led Golden West with 18 points each.  </P> <P> Golden West (36-1) will play College of the Sequoias at 7 tonight for the state  championship.  </P> <P> Golden West has made the state tournament the past four years, but this is the  first time the Rustlers have reached the championship game.  </P> <P> "Bits Sirchia saved us in the first half," Golden West Coach Dave Stricklin  said. "Every time the ball went inside, they sagged off. . . . Once she hit  those, they didn't sag as much."  </P> <P> Cerritos (26-7) slowed the game and built a 16-10 lead, but Golden West led,  34-25, at the half and padded the margin with a 16-2 run to start the second  half.  </P> <P> Jackson grabbed 14 rebounds as did Donna Gondringer, who continued to struggle  offensively with nine points.  </P> <P> Dawn Haag came off the bench to score eight consecutive points for Golden West.  She finished with 10.  </P> <P> Cerritos' Lisa Pounds made six three-point shots and scored 22. BRENDAN HEALEY  </P></p>

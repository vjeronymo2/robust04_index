			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ANXIOUS GROWERS BRACE FOR ANOTHER COLD FRONT;  </P> <P> AGRICULTURE: MOST COUNTY CROPS WERE SPARED MAJOR DAMAGE IN LAST WEEK'S COLD  SNAP. STRAWBERRY PLANTS, HOWEVER, MIGHT NOT PRODUCE AS MUCH FRUIT THIS SEASON.  </P> <P> Al Steindorf gambled when he planted tomatoes, hoping to glean a winter crop  from his Carlsbad fields. It was a farmer's version of a trip to Las Vegas, he  said.  </P> <P> He lost.  </P> <P> Steindorf, an organic vegetable farmer, estimated he ditched about $30,000 in  tomatoes that recently froze on the vine.  </P> <P> "It was going great until this storm, and we had this killer frost," sighed  Steindorf, who also lost about 15,000 young tomato plants growing in his  Carlsbad greenhouse because of the cold.  </P> <P> But most San Diego County growers appear to have been spared major crop damage  from last week's cold front, although strawberry plants have dropped their  blossoms and might not produce as many berries this season, the county  Agriculture Department said Monday.  </P> <P> Steindorf and other farmers are trying to evaluate damage already done and to  figure what the next weeks might hold. According to the National Weather  Service, there will be no immediate relief as temperatures continue to drop at  night and a frost advisory remains in effect. Around Thursday, a cold front  from Alaska is expected to hit Southern California, and another storm is  expected this weekend, said forecaster Harvey Hastrup.  </P> <P> "Normally, Christmas in San Diego is shirt-sleeve weather, but this year, I've  been out in a parka and gloves," said John R. Moore, who runs Zany Acres, a  small El Cajon herb and vegetable farm. "This winter will be tougher on growers  because suddenly, we have to end the growing season."  </P> <P> Last year, many farmers were able to continue harvesting produce until late  December. This winter, however, frosty weather put the kibosh on the growing  season early in the month.  </P> <P> "It's a difference of four weeks. The average person says it's only four weeks,  but four weeks to a farmer is a lot," said Moore, a farmer for 15 years.  </P> <P> So far, however, the destruction from the cold has been minimal. A county  inspector who looked at fields all over the county reported Monday that he had  found little crop damage, said Marilyn Corodemas, chief deputy agriculture  commissioner for the county.  </P> <P> "It did get cold, especially Saturday night, but there was kind of a warm  breeze," said Corodemas. "It was windy, and it wasn't real damp, and that  seemed to have a warming effect on the crops. We were lucky."  </P> <P> But a number of farmers are concerned about whether their luck will hold during  this winter, which has been more severe initially than previous ones. Some  farmers have resorted to using artificially generated heat, an expensive option  that will probably be passed along to the consumer, they say. Others are trying  various oil-based sprays to ward off frost. But organic farmers, like the  Moores, can do little but keep an anxious eye on their crammed greenhouses.  </P> <P> "The frost and cold, wind damage is really hurting," said Jeanne Moore, who  works with her husband on their farm, which supplies a health food store and  three restaurants with fresh produce. "It's getting to the point where it's too  expensive to grow anything."  </P> <P> Many of the small farmers are feeling the sting of the cold. Gary Iles  estimated that he lost about 80% of his harvest from his 2 1/2-acre citrus and  avocado farm in Fallbrook because of the recent cold.  </P> <P> "I got fried," said Iles, who does not depend on his farm for his income.  </P> <P> Farmers, however, worry not only about this year's profits but also about  long-term damage to the plants.  </P> <P> Charley Wolk, an avocado grower and former chairman of the county Farm Bureau,  said his groves are showing some signs of cold stress, but the big chill's  lasting effect won't be so easy to determine.  </P> <P> "It's not only the physical damage that might be done to the fruit, but you  also impact the future production. Sometimes that's more expensive than what  you actually lose," Wolk said.  </P> <P> The cold puts stress on the plants, cutting fruit production. For instance,  after three years of inopportune cold weather, a 2-acre avocado tract that Wolk  farms near Rancho California produced only about 200 pounds of fruit last year  -- a marked decrease from previous years.  </P> <P> Wolk said he feels that the largest agricultural interests in the county,  producers of nursery plants and cut flowers, also often are overlooked when the  public assesses agricultural damage from cold weather.  </P> <P> These growers accounted for $375 million in crops in the county in 1989, nearly  double the next most valuable group of commodities -- fruits and nuts.  </P> <P> But cold weather can hurt flower growers by increasing the cost of heating  greenhouses and by resetting the plants' biological clocks so that they flower  at the wrong time.  </P> <P> "Their energy bills just go skyrocketing," Wolk said. "So cold spells can drive  the growers right up to the point where they're going to operate for a year and  make no profit. They sell their plants, and all they do is pay the energy  bill."  </P> <P> And flowers must be produced at the right time for the two biggest floral  events of the year, Valentine's Day and Mother's Day.  </P> <P> "You can produce a beautiful rose," he said, "but, if that sucker comes off the  plant the Monday after Mother's Day, you might as well throw it in the trash  can."  </P></p>

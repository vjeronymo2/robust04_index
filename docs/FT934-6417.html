			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Banker 'admitted' multi-million fraud A merchant banker confessed to a colleague that he carried out a multi-million pound fraud stretching back years for the 'wonderful chaps' he worked with, the Old Bailey heard yesterday. Mr Michael Hamilton told the court that his partner Mr Wallace Smith owned up to what he had done two days before Wallace Smith Trust Company finally folded in April 1991 with a Pounds 100m 'hole' in its finances. However, Mr Smith had denied syphoning off huge amounts for himself, Mr Hamilton said. Mr Hamilton told the jury the admission followed a confrontation with Mr Smith the previous day. On that occasion he had accused Mr Smith of channelling clients' assets through overseas trusts before feeding them back into the bank to cover salaries and expenses. Mr Hamilton said he asked Smith if he had set up the trusts to carry out the fraud. 'He said he had not . . . He said it just happened; it started, then it grew.' Mr Smith, the 59-year-old founder of Wallace Smith Trust Company, denies fraudulent trading, false accounting, obtaining property by deception and theft. The Crown claimed the once high-living banker 'masterminded' the 'massive and sophisticated' fraud after weaving a bogus web of overseas wealth. Mr Timothy Barnes QC, prosecuting, alleged Smith committed his crimes under the noses of the Bank of England, his auditors and fellow direct-ors. The trial was adjourned until today.</p>

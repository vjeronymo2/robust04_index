At the end of the meeting, [FN  President] Jean-Marie Le Pen made a long speech in which, among  other things, he asked for the resignation of National Education  Minister Francois Bayrou. As for the Falloux Act, he charged  the government with yielding to demonstrators' pressure.    Stating that his party is nearing "the time of a decisive  battle," the extreme-right leader reviewed the various elections  scheduled until the end of 1995, starting with the district  election in March, for which he was to begin on Monday 17  January a tour which will take him to every department of  metropolitan France. Le Pen will not run in this election, but  he will head the FN list for the European election in June and  will, for the third time, run in the presidential election.  "There is still some hope of seeing Francois Mitterrand seek a  third term of office", Le Pen said, adding that he suspected the  head of state of working toward creating the conditions for him  "to die surrounded with the splendor of the republic."    Le Pen said he was convinced that Mr. Mitterrand would  dissolve the National Assembly before the presidential election.  "I would be surprised if the president of the Republic did not  use this weapon in order to considerably cut down the current  majority," to which he gave the following "warning": "Should  government impotence become the norm (...), it is clear that  nature, which abhors a vacuum, will bring forth new forms of  political action."    Le Pen, who has become more strident in his criticisms of  Mr.  Balladur -- whom he accuses of worsening France's standing on  all counts -- considers that "French people must be quite  disappointed with the centrist policies of the UDF [Union for  French Democracy] and RPR [Rally for the Republic]." We shall  do everything we can to take advantage of the historic  opportunity we are being given," warned the extreme-right  leader, stating that "the solutions advocated by the National  Front" are "the sole alternative" leading to "the vast power  changeover" he has been waiting for.</p>

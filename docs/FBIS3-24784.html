The dossier on police, which  was the first point on the agenda on political issues, was  concluded yesterday at the end of [words indistinct]. The two  delegations agreed on the composition of the new corporation and  its judicial facet, as well as the modes of its formation. Now  that the police issue has been concluded, there is hope that  Angola will at last have a police force that serves the people.  When the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA] and the government meet again in Lusaka today, they will  discuss national reconciliation. This very extensive issue may  take some time for a consensus to be reached, but, as stated by  a diplomatic source linked to UNITA, the Angolans will have to  be reconciled. The Angolan peace talks began in November 1993  under the mediation of Malian national Alioune Blondin Beye,  special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola,  and in the presence of the troika of observers, with the United  States and Portugal playing a decisive role. Russia's position  is ambiguous and partial since it is still supplying the Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party with arms for  war. Angolans hope that the sides will reach a general peace  accord as soon as possible so that they may reconstruct their  country.</p>

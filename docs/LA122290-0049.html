			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTIVES NOT ALL SO HIGH-MINDED;  </P> <P> U.N. VOTE IS MONUMENT TO SELECTIVE INDIGNATION  </P> <P> The passage of a U. N. Security Council resolution criticizing Israel's recent  deportation of four Palestinians and demanding that it abide by the provisions  of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the territories it occupies ought to be a  sobering event not only for Israel, but also for the United States, which  supported the censure.  </P> <P> Calling a friend to account for insupportable conduct never is a pleasant  experience, particularly when doing so puts one in dubious company. And no  mistake should be made: That is precisely where the United States stands in the  wake of this resolution, the third vote hostile to Israel taken by the Security  Council since the onset of the gulf crisis. All three resolutions have been  initiated by the Palestine Liberation Organization, which would be satisfied  either to provoke the United States into a veto that might shatter the  anti-Saddam coalition or to drive a wedge between Washington and its ally,  Israel. Those also are the shabby objectives of the majority of these  resolutions' supporters.  </P> <P> Whatever one may say concerning Israel's conduct in the occupied territories,  the U.N.'s interest in it borders on the obsessive, particularly when one  considers the catalogue of human-rights violations with which the U.N. does not  concern itself.  </P> <P> Take, for example, Amnesty International's most recent report on conditions in  the four nations -- Cuba, Colombia, Yemen and Malaysia -- which sponsored this  resolution:  </P> <P>  -- On Cuba: "At least 60 government critics, many of them prisoners of  conscience, were arrested . . . . The majority were sentenced to prison terms  after trials which fell short of international standards of fairness . . . . At  least four prisoners were sentenced to death and executed in 1989."  </P> <P>  -- On Colombia: "Many hundreds of people, including judicial officials  investigating human-rights violations, were extrajudicially executed. Scores of  other people 'disappeared' after detention."  </P> <P>  -- On Yemen: "At least 31 suspected opponents of the government were arrested  and held without charge, including possible prisoners of conscience . . . . The  fate of 16 detainees who 'disappeared' in previous years remained unknown."  </P> <P>  -- On Malaysia: "Allegations of ill treatment in detention continued, and the  national press reported that four people died in police custody. At least 71  death sentences were imposed . . . seven for possession of firearms."  </P> <P> Israel has no death penalty except for Nazi war criminals.  </P> <P> But the continued expression of the U.N.'s hypocrisy is abetted by Israel's  insistence that it can exercise sovereign authority over the people and  territories it occupied while defending itself in 1967. Treatment of their  inhabitants must be governed not by Israeli legality, but by the Geneva  Convention. It forbids the collective punishments and deportations Israel  continues to employ against the Palestinians.  </P> <P> That is one problem; the U.N.'s anti-Israeli obsession is another. Both call to  mind the Latin aphorism, Pax Opus Justitiae. Peace is the work of justice.  </P></p>

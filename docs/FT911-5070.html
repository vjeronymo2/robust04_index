			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Women in NHS seen to be at a disadvantage WOMEN IN the National Health Service lack the same access to training as men because of caring responsibilities, according to Mr Eric Caines, director of personnel management for the NHS and a member of the NHS management executive. Mr Caines, speaking at a conference organised by the Department of Health, based his comment on the results of a recent survey among NHS employees on how staff combine their jobs with the responsibilities of caring for children and the elderly. The survey found that 54 per cent of staff with child care responsibilities found it hard to attend training courses and 59 per cent had difficulties with child care in the past year. Fifty-nine per cent felt it would be difficult to take time off in a crisis and 41 per cent thought their promotional prospects had suffered. Mr Caines said the survey showed that it was 'more acceptable to be ill than to be a mother' and that attitudinal changes were needed.  Managers would have to devise more flexible policies towards career planning and develop strategies to deal with changing employment patterns bringing more women into the work-force. He said employees carers were saving the NHS money and should be supported.</p>

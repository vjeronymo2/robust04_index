			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / The Week Ahead: Results Due GLAXO, reporting full-year results on Thursday, might sound more cheerful about its prospects in the US following President Bill Clinton's more conciliatory message about health care reforms this week. Pre-tax profits for the year ended June are forecast at around Pounds 1.65bn against Pounds 1.43bn a year earlier. Underlying sales growth will be in the low teens but sales of new drugs might be somewhat disappointing. A final dividend of 13p is likely making 20p for the year (17p a year ago). Cadbury Schweppes is expected to deliver results in line with management's bullish assessments of trading in recent months when it reports its first-half figures on Thursday. Many analysts forecast pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 160m, up from Pounds 126m last time. Forecasts for Prudential, reporting on Wednesday, vary widely from Pounds 218m-280m pre-tax against Pounds 249m a year earlier. an increase in dividend to about 4.5p from 4.1p is also forecast. Better life insurance performance will be overshadowed by further heavy losses on re-insurance. Whether George Wimpey, reporting on the same day, returns to an interim pre-tax profit from a loss of Pounds 7.2m a year earlier hangs in the balance. Some analysts forecast a small profit, others a small loss. Its second half will be stronger given the housing pick up. Blue Circle should report on Thursday interim pre-tax profits slightly ahead with the dividend unchanged. AMEC's interim pre-tax profits are likely to be slightly lower on Wednesday than last year's Pounds 10.6m. Following a recent trading statement, Hillsdown Holdings' results tomorrow will be carefully scrutinised. It said it would achieve operating profits of not less than Pounds 80m, but it has its work cut out to improve the profit-ability of its diverse food businesses. Coats Viyella on Thursday is forecast to report a moderate increase in interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 54m from Pounds 46.5m a year earlier.</p>

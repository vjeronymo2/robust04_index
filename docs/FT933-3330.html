			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Individual themes influence continental trading CONTINENTAL markets went their own ways yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was dominated by technical trading as the DAX index rose 11.13 to 1,872.57 in turnover of DM4bn. Reviewing the equity market in its latest briefing Nikko Europe commented that last week's GDP data was taken by some as evidence that the economy had bottomed-out. But, as Nikko noted, 'the main cause of the rise was an increase in inventories as German industry restocks ahead of the upturn. When it fails to materialise there will be an unpleasant unwinding of the inventory position'. The brokers anticipate that the economy will dip in the second half and for equities to weaken. In the market Volkswagen rose DM6.30 to DM360.80 and Daimler, which is due to release first half figures on Friday, DM7 to DM717. There was disappointment in PARIS that the authorities had once again made no movement on lowering the intervention rate; but after falling initially to a day's low of 2,098 the CAC-40 index finally closed 10.69 higher at 2,115.07. Turnover was low at FFr2.5bn. Speculation over the future of UAP's chairman Mr Jean Peyrelevade, rumoured to be moving to head Credit Lyonnais, a report denied by the insurer, boosted activity, and UAP's shares closed FFr5 higher at FFr610. Further takeover speculation surrounding Cap Gemini Sogetti lifted the shares FFr5.20 to FFr215.70, while Lafarge Coppee was FFr1.90 higher at FFr414.00 ahead of today's announcement of details of a capital increase. STOCKHOLM advanced in heavy trading, supported by Ericsson, which closed at an all time high, up SKr15 to SKr409, as the Affarsvarlden general index rose 10.7 to 1,285.6. Interest in the telecommunications group was reported to have largely come from overseas, and particularly from US investors. Turnover was SKr1.5bn from Friday's SKr1.2bn. AMSTERDAM fell slightly, with the CBS Tendency index off 0.2 at 124.3. Royal Dutch closed unchanged at Fl 183.50, but ex a dividend of Fl 3.70. KLM slipped 40 cents to Fl 35.50 on reports that merger talks with other partners of the planned new European aviation group were being delayed. MILAN picked up after an easier start as the lira strengthened against the dollar and the Comit index finished little change, 0.04 higher at 597.55. Rinascente rose L242 or 3.7 to L9,427 amid renewed speculation that it will be sold as part of Fiat's planned disposals in the retail and insurance sectors. Ferruzzi again fell L44.80 or 10 per cent to L403.20 amid renewed speculative activity ahead of the restructuring programme which is due to be announced by creditor banks later this month. ZURICH was closed for a local public holiday but shares continued their recent consolidation in thin Basle and Geneva trading and the SMI index finished 2.0 higher at 2,365.6. MADRID was depressed by profit-taking and the general index shed 3.32 to 285.15. Argentaria, the state-controlled bank, fell Pta270 or 4.8 per cent to Pta5,380 after the cabinet authorised the sale of a further 25 per cent stake. Banesto shed Pta65 or 2.6 per cent to Pta2,465. BRUSSELS was led higher by some late basket buying just before the close of a restrained day's trading and the Bel-20 index finished 3.52 higher at 1,324.17. COPENHAGEN was dragged lower amid uncertainty about the current strength of the krone and the KFX index eased 0.4 to 97.82. Among actively traded issues, GN Store Nord, a leading telecommunications group, edged DKr1 lower at DKr524 in heavy turnover of DKr16m. OSLO picked up as electors went to the polls. The All-share index rose 8.3 to 559.25 with the return of the Labour party widely expected to be announced late last night. VIENNA saw a strong recovery in the price of OMV, the oil group, on a broker's rerating. The shares lifted Sch24 to Sch764 as the ATX index gained 12.53 to 988.3. ATHENS saw the general index shed 4.84 to 791.38 as a measure of stability returned to the market after the gyrations at the end of last week, and as the general election campaign got under way. ISTANBUL was pushed higher on satisfaction over the election at the weekend of a new leader of the Social Democrat populist party which is a junior member of the coalition. According to Carnegie International analysts in London the lection of Mr Murat Karayalchin 'might be expected to cement the place of the party in the government and help remove residual opposition to privatisation'. The composite index advanced 606.1 or 4.7 per cent to 13,555.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- September 13                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes            Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1359.32   1359.11   1355.56   1354.96 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1269.09   1269.27   1269.61   1268.98  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1354.61   1352.67   1351.66   1351.64 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1269.93   1271.80   1274.78   1276.64  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Sep 10    Sep 9     Sep 8     Sep 7     Sep 6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1263.72   1265.95   1266.53   1277.38   1284.01 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1355.64   1362.52   1363.68   1365.81   1371.90  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1359.72; 200 - 1277.08 Low/day: 100 - 1350.85  200 - 1268.57.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

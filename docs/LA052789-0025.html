			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDENT FILMS  </P> <P> A word about Michael Wilmington's May 11 article, "LACC Student Films a Breath  of Fresh Air":  </P> <P> If the reviews are at all reflective of the films, they are anything but fresh,  apparently being the usual imitative mishmash of contemporary nihilism.  </P> <P> In the same issue there is a smaller yet glowing review by Kevin Thomas of the  Robert Snyder film "Michelangelo: Self-Portrait," a genuine work of art about a  genuine artist.  </P> <P> Seems to me you have your editorial priorities reversed.  </P> <P> ARTHUR HERTZBERG  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

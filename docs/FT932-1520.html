			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Soundtracs improves 43% to Pounds 251,000 Soundtracs, the USM-quoted electronic audio equipment maker, announced a 43 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 251,000 for the six months to April 30. Last time the company made Pounds 175,000. Turnover improved to Pounds 2.56m (Pounds 1.72m) with its first acquisition, Spendor Audio Systems, purchased in January, contributing sales of Pounds 314,000 and operating profits of Pounds 21,000. Mr Todd Wells, chairman, said the production problems seen in Scotland last year had been resolved. He added that Soundtracs continued to pursue acquisition opportunities which would meet the 'same stringent criteria achieved with Spendor'. Earnings per share emerged at 1.67p (1.17p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 0.92p (0.85p).</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The U.S. Customs Service passed out $1.4 million in confiscated funds from a  Thailand-connected drug ring to eight law enforcement agencies in San Jose.  "This is an example of the other side of the process," said a delighted John E.  Hensley, assistant Pacific regional commissioner for the agency. The money was  found in bags at a Del Rey Oaks storage locker in November, 1987, and was  packed in neat stacks of $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills. The money was  packaged by drug dealers with Southeast Asia connections, authorities said. It  was the largest distribution of drug assets in Northern California to date.  </P></p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of Italian Industry (6): Interest rates stand sky high - 'Bashing the banks' may start soon UNLIKE in the UK, 'bashing the banks' has not yet entered the vocabulary of most Italian industrialists, in spite of the growing domestic recession. However, the heady climb in interest rates since the Danish 'no' vote on the Maastricht treaty in June, which plunged Europe's financial markets into turmoil, is already taking its toll on the corporate sector; companies complain of much tougher conditions and revising their 1992 earnings forecasts downwards. Interest rates in Italy now stand at astronomical levels, even for a country used to elevated borrowing costs during the high inflation period of the 1970s. One big Milanese bank's 'prime rate' for top-class borrowers has reached at 17 per cent, while riskier creditors have to pay the so-called 'top rate' of 23 per cent. For borrowers exceeding their agreed overdraft limits, the maximum rate is two percentage points higher. Despite such vertiginous figures and the lira's gyrations after leaving the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, there is little sign as yet of a backlash from industry. Nor do many businessmen seem to be accusing the banks of 'profiteering' at their expense. The explanation is partly structural. Many Italian companies, especially those owned privately, rely on retained profits for a large proportion of their financing, compared with the generally much higher levels of gearing seen in the UK and US. The range of companies' banking relationships may also play a part in clarifying why Italian business are not, as yet, complaining of a 'cultural gap' with their bankers. Even a medium-sized Italian company tends to have a much broader choice of banking relationships than a like-sized counterpart in most other European countries. According to the chief economist of one leading commercial bank, the average medium-sized Italian concern has 12 bank relationships. In the case of a multinational like Fiat, Italy's biggest private-sector group, the figure would be between 100 and 200. That has in the past allowed corporate borrowers, even of relatively modest dimensions, to be fairly choosy when it cames to picking banks. Matters have been reinforced by the rules governing overdraft facilities in Italy. 'The fact that the great majority of Italian overdrafts are non-committed - so banks can notionally withdraw them at minimum notice - means no commitment fees are charged. The upshot of that has been to encourage companies to negotiate relatively high overdraft ceilings, which are seldom used. Moreover, such arrangements are made with a number of banks, meaning that companies have had considerable cash at their disposal', says the economist. Until the recent economic downturn, that tended to place relatively liquid corporate borrowers at an advantage over their bankers. 'In some cases, banks would compete with one another by offering bigger credit lines. And in certain instances, borrowers could play one bank off against another to edge down interest rates or gain better conditions', he adds. The 'polarisation' of the market between a powerful group of liquid companies and their bankers on the one hand and the considerably different relationship between weaker companies and the banks on the other probably reached a peak in the middle of this year, before the markets went into disarray and interest rates started to soar. While banks reported heady lending growth to corporate customers, with annual rates of expansion for credits of up to 20 per cent, not all the cash lent was being used for industrial purposes, in a model bearing some similarities to the speculative circle that built up in Japan in the late 1980s. Explains one banker 'From around 1988, the rate of banks' loan growth has been running around twice that of Italy's gross domestic product. While some companies needed the money for their business, more liquid concerns found they could make an attractive spread by reinvesting borrowed funds in a variety of financial instruments'. Italian government bonds were the most popular. Figures from the Bank of Italy show that, at end-91, over L41,000bn in cash from non-financial companies was invested in the bond market. A further L45,700bn was ploughed into foreign shares or bonds. Matters changed sharply after this summer's currency turmoil. 'Now it's become a sellers' market', says one banker. 'Profits are falling, leaving less money to plough back into the business than before. Meanwhile, creditors are taking much longer to pay their invoices. So companies are becoming much less liquid and having to rely more on their banks accordingly'. Bankers admit the rates they charge depend partly on a company's location. At one top Milanese bank, 27 per cent of all corporate loans carry the prime interest rate of 17 per cent, while only around a tenth of the total pay the 23 per cent 'top rate'. But there is a marked geographic split between the rates being paid in the north against those in southern Italy. On average, corporate borrowers in southern italy were charged between 4 per cent and 5 per cent more for their money than their northern counterparts. 'The gap reflects the fact that there are fewer banks in the south, and hence less competition. It also testifies to the greater risk of lending to south Italian companies, which, on average, tend to be less solid financially than their northern colleagues', says the banker. Surprisingly, most banks say they are not yet worried about a major deterioration in the quality of their loans as a result of the recession. Signs of an economic downturn were already visible from the middle of last year, and bankers claim they have been much more cautious since. Moreover, despite this summer's surge in interest rates and the growing domestic recession, many bankers expect the lira's devaluation to help the corporate sector given the high export quotas of many Italian companies. 'The average Italian concern exports 20 per cent of its turnover', says the bank economist. 'Obviously, the precise effect will depend on the exact breakdown of a company's foreign turnover. Those selling to countries like the UK, whose currencies have appreciated relatively little against the lira, will receive less of a boost than those selling to Germany or the US'. According to his calculations, based on a 10 per cent lira devaluation against a basket of currencies and a rise of 5 per cent in domestic costs next year, the lira's slide should lead to an average 20 per cent rise in companies' gross operating profits in 1993. In the circumstances, the relative harmony between companies and their bankers is easier to understand.</p>

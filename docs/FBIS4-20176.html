			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of "exclusive" interview with Turkish Cypriot leader </F> Rauf Denktas by Mehmet Ali Akpinar, general director of  publications of KIBRIS, in Nicosia; date not given]    [Text] [Akpinar] Can a solution be imposed against your  will and the free will of the Turkish Cypriot people? Can you  comment on the consequences of the effort to impose a solution  on Cyprus?    [Denktas] My will depends on how I can successfully  represent  the Turkish Cypriot people. I am trying to conclude an  agreement that will be acceptable to my people. The Republican  Assembly will endorse the agreement that is made. Meanwhile, we  will have to hold a referendum in accordance with our  Constitution. That is because the matter concerns the question  of territory. So, what do those who put pressure on me to say  yes to this or that stand to gain from something that is imposed  on me in one way or another if I fail to have it endorsed by the  Republican Assembly and if I lose in the referendum? In that  case, I will have to disappear. Therefore, those who are  convinced that they can conclude an agreement that conflicts  with the Turkish Cypriot people's will are mistaken. That  cannot be done.    [Akpinar] What do you mean by saying that you will have to  disappear?    [Denktas] I would have to withdraw. If my people do not  support the agreement I conclude, then I would be forced to  disappear from the scene. That would mean that I have been  unsuccessful in representing their will. That is why I wish to  inform the people that that is what I have given, this is what  we have gotten in return, it is substantial, and it belongs to  us. However, they [UN officials] have failed to give a tangible  form to what will be given to us until now. They have failed to  include what we will receive in the package. They have said:  "Sign and then we will see what can be done." They have made a  promise that they "will give." How can that be?    [Akpinar] Statements have been made to the effect that  Turkey  is the country that has suffered most from the no-solution  situation. Can you comment on them?    [Denktas] That is a matter of how one looks at the problem.  It is a fact that the Cyprus problem has constantly gotten in  the way Turkey's contacts with foreign countries. That is why  Turkey sincerely wants to have the problem solved, that is, in  an honorable way. It wants the security of the Turkish Cypriots  to be guaranteed. It also wants the concessions to be  reciprocal. We have moved together with Turkey on those matters  so far. I believe that there has not been a change in that  regard.    [Akpinar] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said: "We are  determined to have the Cyprus problem solved and we stand to  gain most from the solution of that problem." Would a hasty  solution on the basis of territorial concessions, that is, as in  the case of Maras, create a problem that will force the Turkish  Cypriots to make additional concessions on the territorial issue  in the future?    [Denktas] Naturally, it will. We have to foil the designs  that are against us in the talks. For example, I wish to recall  a design related to the documents and maps that were submitted  as non-documents and non-maps. We were asked to agree to  discuss them. Later, however, they were suddenly changed against  us and described as the "UN secretary general's proposals."  They were then submitted to the UN Security Council to be  approved. That is the trick that has to be blocked. The  Turkish Cypriot people must not be a part in it. Nor should  Turkey be involved in such an approach. Otherwise, we do not  stand to gain anything.    [Akpinar] How would you define an honorable, just, and  durable solution to the problem?    [Denktas] An honorable, just, and durable solution must  provide for a bizonal agreement. It must definitely be a  balanced solution, which will provide for political equality and  sovereignty rights for the two sides. We can build upon those  principles, provided they are accepted. If any one of the  concepts of equality, right to sovereignty, balance, and the  maintenance of Turkey's effective guarantee is put aside or  weakened, then the matter will end right there and then. The  Greek Cypriot side's objective is to either remove or  effectively weaken all those concepts by quickly joining the  European Union. They are clearly moving to achieve that plan.  We have to say something against that. We have to declare that  we will break off the talks if the Greek Cypriots pursue that  plan and if the inclination to allow Cyprus to become a member  of the European Union in the light of the conviction that the  Greek Cypriots represent the Cyprus Government is maintained.  That is the point we have arrived at. The pressure that has  been directed at us is forcing us to take further steps. It is  time to show that we will not yield to pressure.</p>

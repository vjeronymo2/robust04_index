			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia still insists that before imposing sanctions  against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK], an  international conference on resolving the nuclear crisis on the  Korean peninsula should be convened. Russian Vice Foreign  Minister Panov reiterated this view in a meeting with the  Chinese ambassador in Moscow on Thursday [9 June]. He had a  similar talk with the DPRK ambassador earlier. The idea of  calling an international conference was proposed by President  Yeltsin, who maintains that North Korea, South Korea, Russia,  the U.S., Japan, and China should participate in the conference.</p>

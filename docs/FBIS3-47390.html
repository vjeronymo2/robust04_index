			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Just before this newscast, Government House  Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa reported on the two major topics  of discussions during the prime minister's visit to Cambodia.  The topics concerned cooperation in establishing national  reconciliation in Cambodia and setting up a mechanism to help  Thai businessmen participate in Cambodia's economic  reconstruction.    [Begin Aphisit recording] The Cambodian side thanked the  Thai  Government for supporting and playing a major role in the  success of the peace process in Cambodia. The Thai side  reiterated its desire and clear policy of supporting the  legitimate Cambodian Government. It will not support any group  that opposes this government. The government has a policy of  not interfering in Cambodia's internal affairs. On this issue,  both sides noted that there have been many claims and reports --  particularly by foreign press agencies -- that have led to  uneasy feelings by both parties. They discussed the fact that  although their objectives and policies are the same,  implementation at the border -- which stretches a long way --  could be inconsistent. Both governments seek direct  coordination with each other to achieve a correct understanding  and avoid having minor events escalate into situations that  might obstruct good overall relations.    On economic issues, the Cambodian side welcomed Thai  businessmen who have played a role in economic development. It  informed the Thai Government that it is in the process of  creating mechanisms, organizations, and laws to govern business  conduct. This will be the framework for future business  functions. Regarding contracts that Thai businessmen have made  with Cambodian parties, the Cambodian Government will not revoke  them; it will honor its commitments. On those projects that are  not supported by contracts, regulations will have to be followed  and contracts will have to be negotiated.    The Thai prime minister informed the Cambodian side that in  addition to existing aid, Thailand will approve imports of  10,000 tons of soybeans from Cambodia in July and will grant 50  scholarships. The prime minister pointed out that Cambodia and  Thai businessmen reap mutual benefits from the activities of the  businessmen. Those who have violated Cambodian law should be  strictly prosecuted, while justice should be ensured for those  who appeared to be involved in dishonest activities but were, in  fact, innocent.    Both sides discussed possible mechanisms to facilitate the  conduct of trade and business, including the promotion of trade  at border crossings so that duties can be collected and the  creation of a mechanism to oversee border problems and ore  exploration in overlapping sea territories. Regarding the  Mekong committee, both sides are pleased that China and Burma  have joined. Both sides want quick implementation on these  issues. [end recording]</p>

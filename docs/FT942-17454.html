			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Import slowdown narrows trade gap Mexico's current account deficit fell to Dollars 23.4bn (Pounds 16bn) last year, after a rapid increase in non-oil exports and slowdown in the growth of imports. The newly independent central bank also disclosed in its annual report that reserves last year rose to Dollars 24.54bn, Dollars 6bn more than at the end of 1992. Foreign investment reached a record Dollars 33.33bn in 1993, of which Dollars 28.43bn was portfolio investment, and the rest direct investment in plant and machinery. The figures were released amidst further weakness in Mexico's stock market and exchange rate, as foreign and domestic investors appeared concerned by the rise in long-term bond rates in the US. The stock market fell by 6 per cent yesterday to a new low for the year, while the peso weakened to 3.36 against the dollar, after opening at 3.35. 'You have a severe correction throughout Latin America in response to higher bond yields in the US and falls in Wall Street,' said Mr Geoffrey Dennis, head of emerging market research at Bear Stearns. While Mexico's current account deficit was slightly less than the Dollars 24.8bn revised deficit for 1992, it accounted for 7 per cent of Mexico's gross domestic product. The slowdown in increase of imports last year is mainly attributed to the weak economy. As growth picks up, the deficit is expected to rise again.</p>

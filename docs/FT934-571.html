			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / German states to help flood victims Several German states yesterday announced emergency financial measures to help property owners flooded by the river Rhine following days of torrential rain. Troops in wading boots stacked sandbags in the basement of parliament to keep the worst Rhine flooding in decades from knocking out its heat and electricity. The Rhine and its tributaries rose to their highest levels since the 1950s, flooding thousands of houses along their banks. Cologne's medieval centre was swamped as the river breached a 5km stretch of bank. By early morning, the river had hit a near-record flood level of 10.39 metres. Four people have died in the floods in Germany and a further two in France and Belgium. The rising rivers have blocked roads and stopped barge traffic on the Rhine, Europe's main north-south artery, ruining Christmas in dozens of towns. Few property owners in Germany are covered for flood damage. Only the southern state of Baden-Wurttemberg has introduced special insurance cover for such damage. 'A few insurance companies have started to offer coverage for floods since early 1992,' said Mr Jorg Knospe, spokesman for the German association of insurance companies. 'Very few households have such policies.' The North Rhine-Westphalia government said it would provide tax concessions for households and businesses suffering flood damage. It is also offering to help families earning under DM2,500 (Pounds 980) a month by replacing furniture. Companies and self-employed people without insurance policies will also be able to ask for credits and financial assistance from their banks, who will receive state aid. 'The funds will be available to companies, especially small ones, who would otherwise go bankrupt and fire their employees,' a spokesman from the North Rhine-Westphalia government said. The state of Saarland, where the usually quiet Mosel river turned into a wild torrent, also said it would provide DM10m (Pounds 3.93m) for families. In the states of Rheinland-Pfalz and Hesse, state officials said they would offer individual amounts to households needing help. Thousands of houses between Koblenz and Dusseldorf were flooded after three days of torrential rain. In Bonn, the Rhine stopped by mid-morning a few centimetres short of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office and the new parliament building.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Argentina 'richest in Latin America' ARGENTINA is the wealthiest country in Latin America, with per capita income of Dollars 6,867 (Pounds 4,352), according to the latest figures from the central bank. Gross domestic product in 1992 rose 8.7 per cent in real terms to Dollars 226.64bn. The figures confirm Argentina's strong growth record since it adopted strict stabilisation policies in 1991. The economy has grown 18.4 per cent in the last two years, with a further 3-5 per cent increase in output forecast for this year. The data was produced according to new statistical methods which re-estimate the economy's structure for the first time since 1970. The figures also include a partial estimate of the black economy. The GDP figures are boosted by a government crackdown on tax evasion, which has forced large parts of the black economy into the open. The new statistics show Argentina's GDP has been grossly underestimated. In 1989, when hyperinflation depressed the value of Argentina's currency, the World Bank said Argentina's GNP was equivalent to only Dollars 53bn, recovering to Dollars 129.6bn in 1991. However, the new data is distorted by a heavily overvalued currency. Argentina remains Latin America's third largest economy, although the difference with its giant neighbour Brazil has narrowed considerably.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Letter: British Gas not barring competitors Sir, You reported ('Regulator defies British Gas', November 17) that our regulator, Sir James McKinnon, had told the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that he had rejected our proposals for a rate of return higher than 4.5 per cent. He also pointed to the difficulties experienced by two companies in their efforts to enter the pipeline market. I must explain, therefore, that British Gas worked hard to find a way for these potential competitors to enter the market by transporting some of our gas. We also took the initiative some six months ago to raise the matter with Sir James in order to find a solution; at that time he took no action to address the situation. The companies' proposals came to naught because their required rate of return to make a success of the proposals was several times higher than the rate of return British Gas was allowed to charge on the transportation business under the regulatory regime. This goes some way to explaining the impasse which led British Gas to seek the present wide-ranging MMC investigation of the UK gas industry.

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MEDICINE / AIDS RESEARCH;  </P> <P> LOWER DOSES OF AZT FOUND EFFECTIVE, LESS TOXIC  </P> <P> Low doses of the expensive AIDS drug AZT appear to be as effective as and less  toxic than standard doses, according to two separate studies involving patients  from California and across the country that are being published in today's New  England Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> Publication of the studies is likely to encourage more AIDS physicians to  recommend doses of AZT -- azidothymidine -- for their patients that are  substantially lower than the doses of 1,200 to 1,500 milligrams a day that were  common several years ago.  </P> <P> Many physicians already recommend lower doses, as the data supporting this  approach has been publicized informally and at medical meetings.  </P> <P> "The standard of practice (today) is to use 500 to 600 milligrams a day," said  Dr. Harry Hollander, the chief AIDS physician at the UC Medical Center in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Hollander, who is not an author of either study, added that the major exception  is for AIDS patients with nervous-system complications. It is not clear that  low doses are effective for such patients.  </P> <P> Currently, Burroughs Wellcome Co., which manufactures AZT, recommends that AIDS  patients be prescribed 200 milligrams of AZT every four hours for four weeks,  and after that 100 milligrams of AZT every four hours. The basis for this  recommendation is one of the New England Journal studies, whose primary author  is Dr. Margaret A. Fischl of the University of Miami.  </P> <P> In a study of 524 patients, Fischl and her colleagues found that this level of  daily doses of AZT "was at least as effective as a higher dose and was less  toxic," but that some patients still developed anemia, a common complication of  the medicine.  </P> <P> The second study included 28 patients who received an even lower daily dose of  AZT -- 50 milligrams every four hours. Most of the patients were treated for  more than 40 weeks.  </P> <P> The research team, headed by Dr. Ann C. Collier of the University of Washington  School of Medicine in Seattle, found that this very low dose had "clinical and  virologic effects" similar to those of higher daily doses. They concluded that  "the minimal effective dose" of AZT "has yet to be determined" and called for  larger studies of the effects of 200 to 300 milligrams of AZT a day.  </P> <P> Hollander said the very low doses of AZT are likely to be most useful for  patients who cannot tolerate 500 to 600 milligrams a day and for patients who  are simultaneously taking experimental AIDS drugs. He cautioned that patients  who receive very low doses of AZT may be at increased risk of developing  drug-resistant strains of the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> The Burroughs Wellcome wholesale price for a 100-milligram capsule of AZT is  $1.20. A 500-milligram daily dosage regimen should cost about $2,200 a year,  the company said.  </P></p>

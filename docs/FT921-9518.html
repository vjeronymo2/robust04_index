			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Indian PM reassures on reform pace INDIA will persist with economic reforms and the opening of the economy to the private sector, according to Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister. In an interview during a visit to Switzerland, Mr Rao dismissed doubts over the pace of reform and said the direction was irreversible. He also brushed aside criticism that he had pulled back from rapid rationalisation and privatisation of the bloated public sector. 'It is a limited problem. We have got over many problems of this kind, and this too will be no exception.' However, he was frustrated that Indian officials and trade unions had been alarmed by aspects of the rapid privatisation process in Pakistan. 'I do not know what privatisation means. If it means that we give full scope for private enterprise to come in, I have no difficulty on that. . . Instead of talking about a word, it is better to talk about substance.' The substance consisted of throwing areas open to the private sector. On security issues, the premier said India held to its rejection of a proposal for five-nation regional talks on nuclear weapons, insisting it was only sensible to talk about nuclear disarmament in a global context. 'We have an action plan from 1988. We adhere to that, and say that with necessary modifications it should be adopted. From one country to another, there may be a difference in the timeframe of bringing down arsenals, but eventually the objective should be absolutely clear that it is to be total and complete disarmament.'</p>

If the command claims service is a separate organization, the command SJA will designate a JA as the chief of the service. Otherwise, the SJA will be the chief of the service. Adequate, qualified claims personnel will be assigned to ensure that claims are promptly investigated and acted upon. With the concurrence of the service may designate area claims offices within its area of operations to carry out claims responsibilities within specified geographic areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Area claims offices.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The area claims office is the principal office for the investigation and adjudication or settlement of claims, and will be staffed with qualified legal personnel under the supervision of the SJA or command JA or Corps of Engineer district or command legal counsel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The full-time responsibility for claims investigations and processing in a portion of the area or for claims related to the activities of a unit or organization within the area may be delegated to another command, unit, or activity by the establishment of a claims processing office at the command, unit or authority. (See &sect;536.7 (d)(4) and (e).) Normally, all claims processing offices will operate under the supervision of the area claims office in whose area the claims processing office is located. Where a proposed claims processing office is not under the command of the parent organization of the area claims office, this designation may be effected by a support agreement or memorandum of understanding between the affected commands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Normally, claims that cannot be settled by an engineer area claims office will be forwarded directly to the Commander, USARCS with notice to the Chief Counsel, COE of such referral. However, the Chief Counsel, as part of his or her responsibility for litigation of suits involving civil works and military construction activities, may require that an engineer area claims office forward claims through engineer channels provided that such requirement does not preclude final action by Commander, USARCS within the time limitations set forth in subparts D and H.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Claims processing offices.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For a chapter 11 claim, if the adjudicated amount of a claim is in excess of the monetary jurisdiction of the head of the claims processing authority, the claim will be approved and paid up to the delegated authority of that office and immediately forwarded to the next higher claims authority for additional payment. (See &sect;536.161(e).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Claims processing offices without approval authority. A claims processing office that has not been granted claims approval authority will provide for the investigation of all potential and actual claims arising within its assigned jurisdiction, either on an area basis or on a command or agency basis. Once the investigation is completed, the claims file will be forwarded to the appropriate area claims office for action. Alternatively, an area claims office may direct that a claims investigation made by a claims processing office without approval authority be forwarded to another claims processing office within the area that has approval authority if the claim is within the jurisdiction of the latter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Claims processing office with approval authority. A claims processing office that has been granted approval authority must provide for the investigation of all potential and actual claims arising within its assigned jurisdiction, either on an area basis or on a command or agency basis, and for the adjudication and payment of all presented claims within its monetary jurisdiction. If the estimated value of a claim, after investigation, is beyond the payment authority of the claims processing office or if disapproval is the appropriate action, the claim file will be forwarded to the area claims office unless otherwise specified in this regulation, or forwarded to USARCS or the command claims service, as appropriate, if directed by such service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

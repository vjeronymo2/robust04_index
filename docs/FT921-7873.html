			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei declines to lowest level since October 1990 POLITICAL disquiet and corporate earnings worries at home, and the setback for President George Bush in the New Hampshire presidential primary, left Japanese equity markets nervous yesterday, and the Nikkei average fell to its lowest level since October 1990, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Small-lot selling by arbitrageurs and companies, in thin trading, took the Nikkei 253.73 lower to 20,618.30 after opening at the day's high of 20,793.77. The index reached the session's low of 20,485.72 in the morning, subsequently recovering some ground on light bargain hunting. A succession of poor earnings results put the market in a sombre mood, along with the domestic parliamentary hearing on the Kyowa bribery scandal and worries that New York could tumble on the New Hampshire primary news. Volume again totalled 200m shares. Declines led advances by 732 to 219, with 151 issues unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks retreated 19.37 to 1,520.62, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.70 to 1,159.90. Some investors fear that a recovery for Japanese companies may be delayed. The yen's decline against the dollar also discouraged market participants. The US currency extended its rally to close Y1.03 higher at Y128.20. The yield on the benchmark bond also rose, as a weaker yen implied higher inflationary pressures. Share prices failed to respond to calls for strong economic stimulus measures, including a cut in the official discount rate, by Mr Tamisuke Watanuki, secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Mr Ross Purdie at SG Warburg said that the Bank of Japan will not lower interest rates as long as pressure from politicians persists. Sony dropped Y160 to Y4,000 on a downward revision of its earnings. It said that its parent company operating result would fall Y20bn into the red for the current year to March. The announcement dragged down other electronics companies, with NEC falling Y40 to Y1,050 and Fujitsu Y12 to Y743. TDK lost Y210 to Y4,080 on reports of a sharp decline in earnings for the current year. Banks lost ground on selling by companies wishing to realise profits ahead of the March year-end book closing. Industrial Bank of Japan receded Y180 to Y2,500 and Bank of Tokyo Y50 to Y1,210. Non-life insurers declined on foreign investor selling. Traders said foreigners had previously bought heavily into the sector, and wanted to lighten their exposure. Yasuda Fire and Marine shed Y17 to Y713. Sega Enterprises was one of the few gainers of the day, climbing Y300 to Y14,000 on prospects of higher earnings for the current year to March, thanks to brisk US sales of its video game. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 201.68 to 22,355.10 in turnover of 116.3m shares. Volume surged on active cross-trading ahead of the year-end book closing. Roundup THE PACIFIC Rim was mixed to easier yesterday, though Kuala Lumpur recorded an eight-month high. KUALA LUMPUR rose to its best level since last June, the composite index adding 11.05, or 1.8 per cent, at 618.72 in volume of 81m shares (65m). Telekom rose 60 cents to MDollars 11.70, with 2.49m shares traded. HONG KONG eased on profit taking, the Hang Seng index losing 21.40 to 4,725.70 in turnover of HKDollars 1.9bn (HKDollars 1.72bn). Banks remained firm ahead of today's results from Hang Seng Bank, a subsidiary of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking, which are forecast to show a 30 per cent increase in profits. Hang Seng put on 25 cents to HKDollars 21.10, while the parent group was unchanged. SINGAPORE firmed in active trade dominated by Malaysian stocks. The Straits Times Industrial index gained 9.42 to 1,511.22 in volume of 86m shares. Analysts said reports of cuts in Malaysian interest rates created demand for Malaysian stocks. SEOUL staged a technical rebound after three days of decline. The composite index ended 9.91 up at 648.13. Electronics issues remained depressed on concern over financial problems affecting the sector. TAIWAN rallied after falls earlier in the week. The weighted index improved 72.51, or 1.5 per cent, to 4,839.42 in turnover of TDollars 24bn. BANGKOK suffered its largest one-day fall in almost three months as the SET index shed 9.99 to 806.51 in turnover of Bt10.52bn. Bangkok Land, Tanayong and Bangkok Bank lost Bt6, Bt12 and Bt24 to Bt200, Bt145 and Bt664 respectively after the Stock Exchange said that buying of these shares could only be done by cash. JAKARTA fell sharply, closing 6.55 down at 280.20 in volume of 5.8m shares. Astra International weakened a further Rp550 to Rp13,050. MANILA's composite index dropped 35.56 to 1,141.01, pulled down by a 4 per cent fall in Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which lost 35 pesos to 835 pesos. Turnover shrank to 41m pesos from 71m pesos. AUSTRALIA succumbed to offshore selling. The All Ordinaries index dipped 4.8 to 1,622.3, but News Corp gained 6 cents at ADollars 18.30. Turnover was moderate at ADollars 234.3m. NEW ZEALAND ended steady after earlier declining about 16 points on the NZSE-40 capital index, which finished a net 0.62 up at 1,473.65.</p>

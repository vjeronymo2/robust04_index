			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH ASSURES ITALY ON U.S. TROOP CUTS  </P> <P> President Bush, indicating he is prepared to offer new arms control proposals  at the NATO summit Monday, assured Italian leaders Saturday that he will not  unilaterally reduce U.S. forces in Europe without consulting with U.S. allies.  </P> <P> Later, in a rare Saturday evening audience with Pope John Paul II, Bush vowed  that "progress must continue" toward "realizing the biblical injunction to turn  our swords into plowshares."  </P> <P> John Paul, for his part, praised Bush for being "deeply committed" to "the  efforts being made to liberate the youth of America from the destructive forces  of drug abuse and to alleviate poverty at home and abroad."  </P> <P> The Pope declared, however, that those problems "are only the symptoms of a  deeper moral crisis" throughout the world. "Truly the hour of international  interdependence has struck," he said. "What is at stake is the common good of  humanity."  </P> <P> At the end of the day, his second in a four-nation European tour, Bush toasted  Italian-American friendship and the contributions of Italian-Americans to the  United States at a dinner hosted by Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita. Bush was  loudly applauded when he announced that he will end the current requirement  that Italians visiting the United States obtain visas.  </P> <P> Currently, only residents of Canada, Britain and Japan are exempt from visa  requirements.  </P> <P> In his meetings with Italian leaders, Bush told De Mita that the latest Soviet  proposal to reduce its forces in Europe had provided openings for the allies to  discuss new arms reduction proposals of their own when they meet at the 40th  annual North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels on Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focus on Poland  </P> <P> Bush also discussed the situation in Eastern Europe, particularly Poland, with  Italian President Francesco Cossiga, who recently visited that country, and  with the Pope, who was archbishop of Krakow before becoming pontiff.  </P> <P> The recent accord between Poland's Communist leaders and the Solidarity-led  opposition "is a tribute to the spirit of the Polish people as well as to the  determination of the Polish church and, indeed, the Holy See," Bush told the  Pope.  </P> <P> After meeting with the pontiff, Bush, accompanied by his wife, Barbara, top  aides and Vatican officials, visited 120 American seminarians studying at the  Vatican. The students broke into applause when Bush entered the room and joined  in a chorus of "God Bless America" after the President concluded his brief  remarks.  </P> <P> "What a neat welcome," Bush said.  </P> <P> Today, Bush will tour an American military cemetery near the site of the World  War II Anzio beachhead. He will then depart for Brussels to prepare for the  opening of the NATO summit.  </P> <P> At the NATO meetings, Bush is expected to put forward a number of proposals,  including one that would reduce NATO's troop levels in Europe and another that  would ease trade sanctions that the United States and its allies imposed  against the Eastern Bloc.  </P> <P> "The President clearly will be discussing a number of ideas -- many of them  have not been presented before -- related to the conventional arms talks and  related to this latest offer by the Soviet Union," White House Press Secretary  Marlin Fitzwater said as he briefed reporters on the closed-door meetings.  </P> <P> The trade sanctions bar exports to Soviet Bloc countries of any item on a  lengthy list of products, ranging from computer software to oil pipelines, that  could be converted to military use.  </P> <P> Before the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the United States and its  allies reviewed such exports on a case-by-case basis. But in 1980, the U.S.  announced a policy of "no exceptions," under which any such exports would be  blocked.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Unilateral Action  </P> <P> Fitzwater stressed that Bush told the Italians -- De Mita, Cossiga and former  Premier Bettino Craxi -- that Washington will not take any unilateral action  but will approach both troop reductions and the trade issue "within the  framework of the consultations in Brussels."  </P> <P> But European nations have long chafed under the no-exceptions trade rule and  would likely welcome a move by Washington to loosen it.  </P> <P> The impetus for the new moves, Fitzwater said, is the latest Soviet arms  control proposal, made May 23 at the Vienna arms talks, which called for  massive reductions in conventional forces. That proposal "goes a long way  toward accepting some of the concepts" of earlier NATO proposals, Fitzwater  said.  </P></p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Japanese plea on textiles Japanese textile associations have asked the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to curb a flood of cheap textile imports battering the domestic industry. The Japan Spinners' Association and Japan Cotton and Staple Fibre Weavers' Association asked Miti to cut imports under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA), an international agreement which lets nations impose restrictions if surging imports cause confusion in the market. Japan is working out detailed guidelines for the application of the MFA. Both associations asked for a curb on imports of poplin and broad textiles from China and Indonesia, used to make sheets and shirts, while the spinners also asked for restraint in 20-count cotton yarn imports from China, Indonesia and South Korea. The yarn is used to make poplin and broad cloth. Last week, China's commercial counsellor in Tokyo was quoted as saying that China might retaliate if Japan imposed unilateral restrictions on textile imports.</p>

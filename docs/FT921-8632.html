			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Construction Contracts: J. Sainsbury superstore WIMPEY SOUTHERN has won contracts together worth a total of more than Pounds 16m from three of the UK's major food suppliers - J Sainsbury, Nurdin &amp; Peacock and British Bakeries. The largest is J Sainsbury's flagship superstore at West Hove, Sussex. With a sales area of 40,000 sq ft and parking for 650 cars, the supermarket will be landscaped to enable it to blend into its green valley surroundings. Elaborate brickwork detailing, clay tiled roofs and glazed walkways will complement the design of the store. Nurdin and Peacock is Wimpey Southern's client on the second of its three awards - a Pounds 3m contract to construct a distrubution warehouse covering 8,900 sq metres in Brighton. The third contract is for the demolition of various buildings and construction of a steel-framed dispatch and ingredients store for British Bakeries in Erith, Kent.</p>

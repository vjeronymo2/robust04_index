			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: FT-SE 100 fall cuts funds at Gartmore Gartmore, the UK-based fund management company 75 per cent owned by Banque Indosuez, yesterday reported a Pounds 1bn drop in funds under management to Pounds 20bn in the first half of the year because of falls in bond and equity markets. It declared its first post-flotation dividend of 1.75p, payable from earnings per share of 5.7p (3.5p). Profit before tax for the six months rose by 55 per cent to Pounds 17.5m, with revenue rising by 39 per cent to Pounds 41.8m. Gartmore attracted net new funds under management of Pounds 1.4bn, of which Pounds 600m came from pension funds. However, funds fell by Pounds 1bn - or 5 per cent - from the end of last year after a 15 per cent decline in the FT-SE 100 Index in the period. Mr Paul Myners, chairman, said he remained confident that Gartmore had the expertise and ambition to achieve progress and grow its profits at a satisfactory rate over the long term 'subject to the impact of movements in markets'. The rate of growth in net new funds was slower than last year, when Gartmore attracted Pounds 4.2bn in funds. Mr Andrew Brown, finance director, said the company had warned then that such an 'exceptional' growth rate was unsustainable. The interim dividend cost Pounds 3.53m of attributable profit of Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 7m). Mr Brown said that this level of cover was not a guide to dividend policy, and Gartmore expected to maintain dividend cover of about two times in the long-term. Its funds came mainly from UK pensions, with Pounds 15.3bn from that source compared with Pounds 16.4bn at the end of 1993. Some Pounds 1.5bn was from unit trusts and offshore funds, Pounds 1bn from investment trusts, and Pounds 2.05bn from overseas clients. Mr Brown said that there had been strong growth in unit trusts and offshore business. He said that, having started by establishing a strong UK business, overseas fund management was becoming 'a very interesting market for us'. Mr Philip Gibbs, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said he estimated that funds under management had now risen to Pounds 22bn, and that management fees were likely to improve in the second half. The shares closed 6p down at 173p. COMMENT Gartmore was bound to slow down after its growth of last year, and the fall in markets made the halt abrupt. Business still appears strong, despite a 32 per cent rise in expenses from taking on staff. Revenue should grow in the second half, but it must fight to keep the momentum in the longer term. With earnings per share of 12p expected for the year, the shares are trading on a multiple of 14.5 - not expensive for a company with a healthy, if short, record of growth.</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAURENCE OLIVIER  </P> <P> In 1979, my husband and I were in New York staying at the Wyndham, a small  hotel catering to people in "show business."  </P> <P> At lunch I glanced at another couple in the almost empty dining room, then  turned to my husband and said, incredulously, "Is that Laurence Olivier?" I was  not prepared to accept that time and illness had aged the "Maxim de Winter" I  had fallen in love with when I was 20.  </P> <P> As we were leaving, I timidly approached the actor. "All these years later, I  have to tell you how I loved you in 'Rebecca,' " I said. He looked at me and  replied softly, "Thank you, thank you, thank you." Then, reaching up he took  both my hands in his and quietly continued, "Forgive me for not leaping to my  feet, but I'm a little frail these days."  </P> <P> I was literally transfixed by the graciousness and gentleness, not to mention  the very presence, of this giant thespian. Need I say the moment is etched in  my heart?  </P> <P> CHARLOTTE BAKER  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P> <P> Olivier died in London on July 11 at 82.  </P> <P> </P></p>

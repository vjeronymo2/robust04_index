			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Joint venture creates 100 jobs A total of 100 jobs will be created in Wolverhampton following the decision by MK Electric of Edmonton, north London, and Merlin Gerin, a French-owned company in Telford, to form joint-venture company Ajax Electrical. Ajax will invest Pounds 5.6m in a new electrical switchgear factory. The investment has been sweetened by Pounds 650,000 of regional selective assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry. Wolverhampton City Challenge provided Pounds 100,000 to refurbish an existing factory of Federal Electric, a Merlin subsidiary, next door to the proposed Ajax plant. This safeguards 84 jobs.</p>

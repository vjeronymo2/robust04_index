			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Summer holiday mood Equities have had an excellent summer. The FTSE-100 index has recovered almost 400 points from the trough in June. Lower than hoped for inflation, better than expected growth and the stabilisation of world bond markets have all played their part. This week's rally has been spurred on by data suggesting that the Federal Reserve's interest rate rises are having the desired effect of preventing US inflation. Those worried about UK inflation can find some backing in this week's CBI survey, which showed a slight increase in the proportion of companies expecting to raise prices. But inflationary signs are weak and the betting remains that base rates will not go up until late in the year. The challenge will be to manage the rise in such a way that consumer demand is damped, but industrialists still have the confidence to step up investment. A further worry for bears is that, while shares have shot ahead, bonds have merely held their own. As a result, the ratio between yields on long gilts and equities has risen from 2.1 to 2.3 since June. It is hard to see the ratio rising much higher, but that does not mean equities must fall. The ratio would also drop if gilts were to rally or dividends were to grow faster than expected. Both are possible. With UK inflation low, gilts should arguably trade on a narrower discount to German and US government bonds. Meanwhile, August's batch of corporate results has boosted dividend expectations. If this is sustained when the reporting season gets into full swing next month, there could be a further rise in equities. The danger will be if dividend hopes are dashed.</p>

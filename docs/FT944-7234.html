			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Widows acts to cut costs Scottish Widows, a life insurer which sells largely through independent advisers, yesterday became the latest company in the sector to move to cut costs, announcing the closure of 12 branch processing offices and the loss of 143 jobs. At the same time, it took a further step in changing its product range, launching a new set of life insurance policies with a choice of how commission is paid to the adviser. More changes to its pension plans are expected early next month. All life companies are facing increased pressure to reduce costs before next year, when new regulations will force them to give customers more information about charges and commission. Widows' job losses mean that the clerical staff supporting its service to independent advisers will be almost halved. It cannot rule out compulsory redundancies, but hopes the target number can be met through voluntary arrangements. The sales force will remain broadly the same size. The company says that operating from six regional processing centres outside Edinburgh will enable it to offer advisers a more efficient and reliable service.</p>

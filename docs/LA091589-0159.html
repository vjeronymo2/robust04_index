			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STYLE: 5 WOMEN SHARE BEST-DRESSED TIPS, FAVORITE DESIGNERS  </P> <P> What does it take to be well-dressed? Money, of course, helps. Connoisseur  magazine claims it costs more than a million dollars per season to make the  fashion industry's annual best-dressed list. And that doesn't include sport  clothes.  </P> <P> Those who don't flinch at pitching $10,000 toward a designer gown several times  a season are usually considered pretty snappy dressers.  </P> <P> But several of Orange County's arbiters of style say more important than money  is developing an individual look and building a wardrobe around one's own  personal style. Even those on a budget stress that by carefully choosing a few  high-quality, versatile pieces, a woman can dress well without millions.  </P> <P> We asked five women from several walks of life -- considered by many to be  among the county's finest dressers -- what makes a woman well-dressed, what  they like to buy and why.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Maria Crutcher  </P> <P> Recently named woman of the year by Orange County Magazine for her volunteer  work (chairing the renowned Angelitos de Oro benefit fashion show three years  in a row, for example), she says versatility is her fashion byword.  </P> <P> But Crutcher, 77, doesn't claim to be on a budget. She readily acknowledges  that she shops almost exclusively at Amen Wardy, the pricey, high-fashion  boutique a stone's throw from her Big Canyon home. She is such a key customer,  in fact, that she is often consulted on fashion by Wardy and has accompanied  him on buying trips.  </P> <P> Versatility is a key element in her fashion scope because it makes dressing  easier. One of her favorite fall outfits is an Oscar de la Renta black-wool  sheath that can be worn with an endless assortment of accessories.  </P> <P> The simple black dress, a good shade for Crutcher's coloring of pink skin tones  and gray hair, can be dressed up with jewels or dressed down with a casual  jacket. Last week, she wore it with half a dozen David Webb jewelry pieces,  setting off the black in a blaze of gold. She owns several short Amen Wardy  jackets that put an entirely different spin on the basic black.  </P> <P> "I think you'll find that women today want to be very versatile in their  clothes and to be able to go through the whole day and into the evening by only  changing a few accessories," she says.  </P> <P> Her favorite designers are Galanos, Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta, Bob Mackie  for evening, Valentino and Odicini, names that crowd her closets. Reaching into  her wardrobe, Crutcher pulls out an armload of Galanos suits, many in black and  white stripes or checks. Amid the Tiffany boxes and Judith Leiber bags are  several Valentino suits, Bill Blass ensembles and Amen Wardy private label  jackets that can be mixed and matched.  </P> <P> So far this fall, she has purchased a two-piece black leather suit with  simulated alligator skirt and silk blouse made in Italy for Amen Wardy, and a  black Oscar de la Renta evening gown of velvet skirt and draped chiffon top for  the upcoming holiday parties.  </P> <P> "My philosophy is to add a few good pieces for every season," she says. "Try to  make your wardrobe so it is flexible for any occasion."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lydia Wang Himes  </P> <P> President of the Historical and Cultural Foundation of Orange County, she calls  herself an eclectic dresser. As a commercial interior designer who grew up in  Hong Kong, Himes prefers clean lines in both her clothes and her work. She  favors unconstructed suits, uncluttered by patterns or accessories.  </P> <P> "I like good details, I'm not into a lot of drippy scarfs and necklaces but  rather well-cut clothes," she says. She will swing from slightly avant-garde to  traditional Chinese dress as long as the look is not overly tailored or severe.  She likes unique, feminine clothes and counts Valentino, Issey Miyake and  Ungaro among her favorite designers.  </P> <P> "Being in my profession, I can get away with a little more freedom," she says.  "I like unusual things that no one else is wearing."  </P> <P> Himes -- a member of the Angels of the Arts and a trustee of South Coast  Repertory, as well as owner-founder of Lydia Wang and Associates in Costa Mesa  -- needs an assortment of comfortable outfits that travel from the drafting  board to the concert hall with ease.  </P> <P> "My philosophy in dress is that you have to be very comfortable with your look  and your body," she says. "You have to dress to please yourself. If you're  comfortable with your look, you'll look good."  </P> <P> This fall, she will be searching for work clothes at her favorite place to  shop, the designer department of Nordstrom, South Coast Plaza. And she says she  has something very special to wear to Saturday night's South Coast Repertory  Annual Gala. She won't say what it is.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rusty Hood  </P> <P> "I never (decide) what I'm wearing until I'm in the shower," says the chairman  of the board of the Phoenix House (Orange County) drug rehabilitation program.  "That's why I like to have things in the closet, so I don't have to plan  ahead."  </P> <P> Hood, like Himes, emphasizes the importance of knowing one's best look and  building a wardrobe around it.  </P> <P> "I choose designers to fit my body," says the 59-year-old resident of Lido  Isle. "I love Anne Klein, but not on someone 5-foot-4."  </P> <P> She says Valentino and Ungaro are good styles for her frame and personality.  She also loves Escada, Mondi and Patrick Kelly. For evening, she prefers  Valentino, Ungaro and Oscar de la Renta, names easily found at her favorite  places to shop, Amen Wardy and Neiman Marcus.  </P> <P> "I will wear anybody. I'm not bound by labels; it's just that these are the  designers I try on first," she explains.  </P> <P> Hood, dressed in a two-piece yellow and white cotton Ungaro luncheon suit,  describes her personal style as tailored and sophisticated ("far-out is not  me"). As a former dress manufacturer, she is always aware of construction,  workmanship and fabric.  </P> <P> "I always look inside a dress to see how it's made," she says. "I guess I'm  what people call an investment dresser. I buy good quality . . . and I keep my  clothes."  </P> <P> For fall, she has bought two new leather suits, a buttery, marigold-colored  Ellen Tracy suede bomber jacket and a vibrant-colored Patrick Kelly wool dress.  She is considering a Gianni Versace two-piece dress with draping around the  waist and an Escada silk blouse and pant outfit. This season's big colors --  greens, rusts and golds -- are perfect for her reddish-gold hair and fair skin,  she adds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Betty R. Moss  </P> <P> "Simplicity is what I go for," says the former model and current executive  director of the nonprofit Orange County Business Committee for the Arts.  </P> <P> "I feel that knowing one's own personality and style is the most important  thing (in dressing well), and understated is the right look for me," says Moss,  who has lived in Santa Ana for 31 years.  </P> <P> Her favorite designers, Anne Klein, Calvin Klein and Adrienne Vittadini, are  chosen for their luxurious fabrics and tailored, neat lines.  </P> <P> "The one I like but can't afford is Chanel, probably the designer I've liked  best since the early '50s."  </P> <P> Moss' philosophy on fashion is to choose classic, understated designs that will  stay in style for years.  </P> <P> "One doesn't have to have a tremendous budget to dress well, if the choices are  classic, basic styles and things of good quality," she says. "Look at women who  can afford the finest classic designer clothes and you see they wear them for  20 or 30 years.  </P> <P> Best colors for Moss, who has blond hair and green eyes, are black, ecru, red  and white, tones chosen as much for their versatility as well as for their  compatibility with her hair and skin.  </P> <P> She just returned from a trip and hasn't had time to shop for fall but says she  will soon be browsing her regular haunts -- South Coast Plaza (especially  Nordstrom), Neiman Marcus and Bullocks Wilshire -- for a new black or red suit  she can wear during the day and into the evening.  </P> <P> "I'm not a Wardy," says Moss, referring to the Fashion Island boutique. "I shop  sales or if I see something I want, I wait until it goes on sale."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Margie Shackelford  </P> <P> Creativity is the key to dressing well, says the director of development and  public relations for the Newport Harbor Art Museum. Shackelford, 56, believes  women should be choosy in selecting what is promoted by the fashion industry.  </P> <P> "The smart woman adapts a new fashion to her own style of dressing, but doesn't  go out and buy THE hot item of the year," she says.  </P> <P> Shackelford likes the sophisticated styles of Donna Karan, Calvin Klein and  Ronaldus Shamask and prefers the neutral tones of black, beige and brown.  </P> <P> "I've never been comfortable with a lot of color," says the 5-foot-5-inch  blonde. "I don't want anything to detract from me as a person and I don't want  my clothes to (outshine) my personality."  </P> <P> The Dana Point resident favors suits for work and evening and this fall has  chosen a two-piece gray Shamask suit with wide-legged pants and jacket in wool  gabardine. It illustrates her style perfectly: sophisticated but not frilly.  </P> <P> Like a lot of busy career women, Shackelford doesn't have much time to shop or  think about fashion.  </P> <P> "I get up very early and don't have time to make a lot of decisions on what I'm  going to wear," she says. "You can always put on a pair of black pants and a  black and white jacket and look terrific. I want to look terrific but I don't  want to have to think about it."  </P></p>

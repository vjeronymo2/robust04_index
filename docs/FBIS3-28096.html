			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa agreed  Thursday [3 February] that the United States and Japan must  continue to try to achieve progress in bilateral trade talks,  the top government spokesman said.    The two were meeting at the premier's official residence,  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news  conference.    "They agreed that it is important for both sides to make  further efforts" ahead to the meeting between U.S. President  Bill Clinton and Hosokawa in Washington on February 11, Takemura  said.    Hosokawa will confer with Clinton to assess progress in the  economic talks being held under a bilateral accord concluded  last July.    Kantor expressed hope the Clinton-Hosokawa meeting will help  the bilateral trade negotiations bear fruit, Takemura said.    The U.S. administration hopes to successfully conclude the  framework talks prior to the summit of the two leaders, who met  twice last year.    Negotiations on automobile and auto parts trade, government  procurement and foreign access to the Japanese insurance market  have been stalemated over a U.S. proposal on setting "objective  criteria" to gauge the openness of Japanese markets.    Tokyo has refused to accept the proposal, saying such  measures would amount to setting aside a specific market share  for foreign goods and services, tantamount to managed trade.    Kantor, who came to Tokyo on Tuesday as Clinton's special  envoy, did not directly voice dissatisfaction with Tokyo's  stance.    On the government's announcement of a 5.3 trillion yen  income  tax cut, Kantor said it was an appropriate decision but did not  elaborate, Takemura said.    Kantor congratulated Hosokawa on his success in getting onto  the statute books a set of political reform bills aimed at  rooting out corruption in Japanese public life, according to the  chief cabinet secretary.    Hosokawa narrowly pushed through his reforms, on which he  had  staked his political fortunes, by his stated deadline of  Saturday, the closing date of the last extraordinary Diet  session.    On his arrival at the premier's official residence, Kantor  told KYODO NEWS SERVICE that he welcomes Tokyo's decision to  slash income tax by 5.3 trillion yen.    "It is a useful step in the right direction," he said.    After emerging from his 40-minute meeting with Hosokawa, the  U.S. trade representative said it was "a very good meeting."    W. Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic  policy, and Takemura were also present at the Kantor-Hosokawa  talks.    Asked if Clinton would move to revive the "Super 301" trade  measure through an executive order, Kantor said only, "We'll  save that conversation for later."    Kantor said last month the Clinton administration may renew  the punitive measure through an executive order in connection  with the deadlocked trade talks between Japan and the United  States.    The super 301, in effect from 1988 to 1990, required the  U.S.  Government to conduct an annual review of trade barriers abroad  and impose trade sanctions if those barriers were not removed  within a year.    On Wednesday, Kantor met with International Trade and  Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai and Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata. He also conferred with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii  earlier Thursday.</p>

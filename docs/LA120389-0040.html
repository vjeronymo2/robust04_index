			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTIQUES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> COLLECTING SNUFF BOXES  </P> <P> THE TAKING OF snuff reached its height in Europe during the 18th Century, when  it was a habit almost universally enjoyed, particularly in elegant and  sophisticated circles. Some indication of its popularity can be seen from the  many delightful snuff boxes available to the collector today.  </P> <P> Snuff got started in the Western world with the North American Indians, and its  introduction to Europe was attributed to the 16th-Century French ambassador to  Portugal, Jean Nicot. Its use quickly spread from one country to another,  reaching England by way of Ireland and Scotland. Indeed, the carved and painted  figure of a costumed Highlander in the act of taking snuff was once the common  sign outside a snuff-seller's shop.  </P> <P> By the 18th Century the habit was an important part of daily life, and snuff  was found everywhere. The ordinary man carried the powder in boxes made of  horn, copper or brass, wood, tortoise-shell, papier-mache and enameled copper.  The aristocracy, on the other hand, had far more elaborate containers:  gem-encrusted gold boxes, silver, ivory or anything equally exotic. The snuff  box became an article of men's jewelry, and it was said of a certain Lord  Petersham that he owned so many of them that he was able to select a different  one for each day of the year, and for his changing moods as well.  </P> <P> The most extravagant boxes were undoubtedly those made by the French during the  eras of Louis XV and Louis XVI. The Paris goldsmiths used colored gold, enamels  and precious stones in which some of the costliest designs are reminiscent of  feminine jewelry of the day. Often, boxes were decorated with miniature  portraits, and some were furnished with false lids concealing erotic subjects.  </P> <P> Snuff boxes come in all shapes and sizes. Generally, lids were decorated, often  painted, and sometimes inset with representations of famous castles ("castle  tops" regularly showed views of Windsor Castle). Some have compartments for  different grades of snuff, and others have watches built into them. Examples  from present-day auctions range from a Scottish silver-mounted cowrie-shell  box, c. 1810 ($175), to a Victorian castle scene, 1838, by Nathaniel Mills  ($700), or a George III silver-gilt fox-mask box, c. 1807 ($4,320).  </P> <P> By the 19th Century it had become traditional for monarchs to present snuff  boxes as marks of honor to distinguished foreign visitors, and the custom  continued long after snuff ceased to be popular. Today a collection of such  boxes adds a charming accent to the top of some 18th-Century or contemporary  table.  </P> <P>  Look for snuff boxes at Richard Gould in Santa Monica; Frances E. Klein in  Beverly Hills; Speidel Antiques in Pacific Palisades; Green Dolphin Street and  Jay's Antiques, both in Pasadena; Snooty Fox in Ventura; Richard Yeakel and  Roberta Gauthey, both in Laguna Beach; Castle Antiques in Costa Mesa, and  Mission Gallery and Hood Antiques, both in San Diego.  </P> <P> </P></p>

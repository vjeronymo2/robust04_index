			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Good quarterlies help extend rally in Dow Wall Street A SERIES of unexpectedly good third quarter earnings reports, and computer program buying lifted US stock markets to solid gains yesterday writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 27.01 at 3,201.42, about ten points below its highs for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 1.84 at 409.28, while the Amex composite put on 0.85 at 366.83 and the Nasdaq composite added 2.60 at 576.44. Turnover on the NYSE was 185m shares, with rises outpacing declines by 1014 to 706. After Monday's gains, which had more to do with the thinness of trading during the Columbus Day unofficial holiday than with any shift in investor sentiment, yesterday's advances were achieved following a genuine improvement in market fundamentals. Investors had approached the third quarter corporate reporting season gingerly, fearing that because of the weaker- than-expected economic growth during the summer, company profits would also come in below forecasts. The first batch of figures, however, have proved as good, and in some cases better, than anticipated. Prices were also aided by program trading, and the continued belief among some investors that the market may have been slightly oversold during last week's substantial correction. Among individual stocks, securities houses were in strong demand following quarterly reports which defied the conventional wisdom that the summer slowdown in investor activity would crimp brokers' profits. Merrill Lynch rose Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 51 1/2 on a 44 per cent jump in net income to Dollars 230.1m, and PaineWebber climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 18 1/2 on a 35 per cent improvement in profits to Dollars 51.7m. Other brokerage stocks firmed in expectation of similar reports, with Morgan Stanley rising Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 47 3/8 , Bear Stearns climbing Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 15 1/8 , Salomon adding Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 37 5/8 , Charles Schwab rising Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 18 and JP Morgan edging Dollars  1/4 higher to Dollars 61 1/4 . Pepsico rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 38 5/8 in heavy trading after the soft-drinks and food group unveiled a 22 per cent increase in third quarter earnings to Dollars 425.7m. Coca-Cola rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 37 3/4 in sympathy. Caterpillar gained Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 51 as analysts suggested that the heavy equipment manufacturer would gain considerably from a Democratic victory in the November presidential elections because of the party's plans to boost spending on the infrastructure if elected. On the Nasdaq market, First Financial rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 17 1/2 on third quarter profits of 65 cents a share, up from 43 cents a share a year earlier. Caere, up Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 32 3/4 , was also buoyed by better-than-expected earnings, as was Lattice Semi, up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 21 1/8 . Canada TORONTO stocks strayed little from Friday's levels, despite a run-up in US share prices. The TSE 300 index was off 3.64 points, or 0.11 per cent, from Friday's close to 3,214.85, as declining issues outpaced advances 281 to 240. Volume was 24.5m shares worth CDollars 183.6m as against 24.5m shares worth CDollars 285.9m on Friday. The market was closed Monday for a holiday. Tuesday's mixed finish came despite two days of gains for US stocks, which usually influence the Canadian market. Mining shares were down slightly, while energy, industrial products, consumer products and financial services were up moderately.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRING BACK THOSE IRA DAYS  </P> <P> Economic growth is underwritten by savings, and Americans haven't been doing at  all well when it comes to providing for future growth. A dismally small  fraction of personal earnings is set aside as savings; for some years now the  rate has stayed below 5%. What can be done to expand the savings pool and so  provide more capital for productive investment? One proposal is to discourage  consumption by putting a special tax on many of the things we buy. An  alternative approach is to reward savings with tax advantages. The government  did that earlier this decade by making Individual Retirement Accounts  tax-deductible for everyone. For many people, though, that advantage  disappeared with the 1986 tax law. Now there's a proposal to again broaden the  tax advantages of IRAs.  </P> <P> At present, the only people eligible for fully tax deductible IRAs are those  with incomes under $25,000 ($40,000 for couples) who aren't covered by company  pension plans. Partial deductibility is allowed for people making up to $35,000  ($50,000 for couples). Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas), chairman of the Finance  Committee, would let all taxpayers, regardless of income or enrollment in a  pension plan, contribute up to $2,000 a year to an IRA and avoid current  taxation on half that sum. In addition, Bentsen would allow penalty-free  withdrawals from IRAs to finance first-time home purchases and college  expenses. The cost to the Treasury, he says, would be $1.2 billion in the first  year of the plan, rising to $4 billion after five years.  </P> <P> That's not a modest loss, but on the other side of the equation offsets could  be expected. If the economy grows more vigorously than expected because more  capital becomes available for investment, then government tax revenues would  rise. If interest rates are nudged down even slightly because the savings pool  has expanded, the government's debt-servicing costs should fall.  </P> <P> Bentsen's IRA proposal was conceived as a Democratic alternative to President  Bush's effort to have capital gains taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.  That idea has attracted some bipartisan support in the House and won narrow  endorsement from the Ways and Means Committee. It has also come under strong  attack because most of the tax benefits would go to the well-off. Bentsen's  plan is, of course, not lacking in political calculation, since its appeal  would be to the broad middle class, but that doesn't disqualify it. The  important question is whether increasing the tax advantages of IRAs would spur  greater savings and so help economic growth. The evidence is that it would.  </P> <P> In 1986, the last year fully deductible IRAs were available to all workers, the  accounts drew $38 billion from 15.5 million couples and individuals. In 1987,  with tax deductibility sharply curtailed, only $14 billion was contributed by  7.4 million taxpayers. A recent study commissioned by Merrill Lynch Consumer  Markets concluded that 80% of IRA contributions were "new" money, meaning money  that wasn't simply transferred from other existing savings. We don't know if  IRAs are necessarily the best way to encourage greater personal savings. But  they do seem to be a proven way, and given the compelling need to increase the  savings rate it seems to us that they're an idea well worth trying again.  </P></p>

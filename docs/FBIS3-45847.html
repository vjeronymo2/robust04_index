			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shanghai, January 20 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai  Municipal Government has decided to strictly restrict land  developers' occupation of vegetable plots in the suburbs of  Shanghai.    The measure is aimed at bringing the soaring prices of  vegetables under control and guarantee vegetable supplies for  Shanghai residents.    According to a circular dispatched by the General Office of  the Shanghai Municipality, only major construction projects and  development zones planned by the municipal government are  eligible to occupy a part of traditional vegetable-growing  lands, with approval of the municipal vegetable leading group as  a prerequisite.    Also stipulated is that after being granted the right, land-  occupants must pay occupation fees ranging from 450,000 to  900,000 yuan per ha. [hectare] in accordance with the varied  grades of plots. The fees will be used for development of new  vegetable- growing lands.    In recent years, rapid urban construction and the economic  boom in Shanghai have cast a shadow over the "vegetable basket"  project suggested by local government aiming to supply residents  with plenty of fresh vegetables and diary products.    The past two years have seen more than 2,666 ha. of  vegetable  plots in the nearer suburbs of the city, which were important  vegetable bases in the past, occupied by major construction  projects and burgeoning township enterprises.    The shrinkage of vegetable growing areas, coupled with the  destruction of irrigation systems in existing vegetable plots,  has affected the normal supply of vegetables to the city and  caused a continuous price hike.</p>

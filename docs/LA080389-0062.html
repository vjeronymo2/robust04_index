The OAS team met separately with opposition leaders and a representative  of strongman Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. Panama has been rocked by a political  crisis since the May 7 presidential elections were annulled by Panama's  Electoral Tribunal after widespread allegations of fraud. Under Panama's  constitution, the election process provides for a transfer of power by Sept. 1.  </P></p>

Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee  and Chinese president, and Li Peng, member of the Standing  Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee  and premier, today delivered important speeches at the meeting,  which was presided over by member of the Standing Committee of  the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and  Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji.    Jiang said that agriculture and the work in rural areas are  very important to manage well the relations between reforms,  development and stability in China.    He noted that this year is an important year for China to  set  up the socialist market economic structure and to carry forward  reforms in the sectors of finance, taxation, investment and  foreign trade.    He said that the smooth implementation of the reform  measures  depends on a sound economic environment and a stable social  environment, especially on stability and development of  agriculture and the rural economy.    He noted that stability in rural areas and a strong  agricultural base will ensure stability in the country, smooth  reforms and continuous, rapid and healthy development.    He pointed out that the general situation in rural areas is  good, but there are some relatively urgent problems, including a  decline in grain output in south China, two consecutive years of  reduction of cotton production, remarkable rises in the prices  of non-staple foods and slow growth of famers' incomes.    Jiang stressed the importance of production and supply of  grain, cotton, edible oil and vegetables.    He said that China has 1.2 billion people and it must be  self- reliant in grain production and supply.    He urged all provinces, autonomous regions and  municipalities  to make investigations and analysis of their grain production  and supply, and to make an overall check on their grain storage.    He said that the reform of the grain sale and purchase  system  should be deepened and macro control of the system be enhanced  so as to ensure state control of necessary grain sources.    He said it is an arduous yet important task to increase farm  income with the development of agricultural production this year.    He said that on the basis of raising grain and cotton  output,  measures should be taken to readjust industrial setups in rural  areas, developing high-efficiency agriculture, a diversified  economy and rural industry.    On maintaining the stability of rural areas, he urged the  leaders at various levels to make a timely disposal of problems  concerning people's interests, including reducing farmers'  burdens, dealing with various crimes, checking unhealthy  tendencies in the party and in society, and aiding the  development of poverty-stricken areas.    On the question of enhancing the party's leadership over  agriculture and rural work, he said that within the whole  economic scheme, whether agriculture is given top priority is a  big issue that concerns setting economic development at the core  of all work.    He said party committees and governments at various levels  should correctly handle the relations between industry and  agriculture, that is, under the precondition of sustained,  steady growth of agriculture, they should establish the  development scale and rate of growth of the national economy and  proportionally arrange investment in the first, second and  tertiary industries.    He stressed that both central departments and local  governments should continue to implement the policies and  measures issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council.    He called on the leaders of provinces, autonomous regions  and  municipalities to conduct investigations in the countryside and  listen to people's opinions and suggestions and make  arrangements for the work in agriculture and rural areas.    Premier Li Peng urged the leading officials at various  levels  to take a sober-minded approach to rural work.    He said that China has 900 million residents in rural areas  and that it is the major factor in China's stability.    He said that the production and supply of agricultural  products has a direct bearing on the stability of prices.    He called on leading officials to assure bumper harvest in  agricultural production, especially in grain and cotton  production.    On the major tasks this year, Premier Li Peng called for  ensuring the growing area for grain, cotton and vegetables. In  northern China, the grain growing area should be on the  increase; in southern China and coastal areas, the grain growing  area should be extended by a large proportion.    He also talked about other measures for rural work including  raising purchase prices of grain and cotton to stimulate  farmers' initiative; ensuring supply of farming production  materials; carrying on reforms of the grain purchase system and  setting up grain risk funds; popularizing science and technology  in farming; state control of ample grain resources; improving of  farming production conditions; increasing of investment into  farming and promoting of the development of rural industry.    He stressed that governors, chairmen and mayors should bear  the responsibility for rural work, and the responsibility system  must also be carried out with governments at various levels.    Other members of the Standing Committee of the Political  Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Liu  Huaqing and Hu Jintao attended the conference.    Among those who attended today's meeting were Ding Guangen,  Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Zou Jiahua, Chen Xitong, Jiang Chunyun  and Qian Qichen.</p>

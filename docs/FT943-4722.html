			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Ahold posts solid profits rise Ahold, the Dutch-based food retailing group, posted a strong 23.5 per cent rise in second-quarter net profit, encouraging it to raise its forecast for full-year earnings. The company, which now expects 1994 results to be 'considerably' higher than in 1993, said net profit rose to Fl 94.2m (Dollars 53.8m) from Fl 76.2m a year earlier. Turnover was up 8.3 per cent at Fl 6.87bn. The quarterly increase takes net profit for the first half to Fl 204.5m, up 18.6 per cent and at the top end of analysts' forecasts. The company's shares rose by 2.3 per cent to close up Fl 1.10 at Fl 48.40. Ahold attributed the sharp rise to higher operating results and a lower tax burden. 'We consider the course of events in the first half, and particularly the second quarter, as highly satisfactory and as indicative of the developments for the entire year,' Mr Cees van der Hoeven, company president, said. Previously, Ahold, which generates about half of its turnover through six supermarket chains in the US, had forecast only that profits would continue to rise in 1994. Ahold's dual-currency interim dividend was raised to Fl 0.19 and Dollars 0.09 per share, from Fl 0.17 and Dollars 0.06 last year. In the US, operating profit rose 15.9 per cent to Dollars 45.1m in the second quarter, outstripping the 9.9 per cent increase in Dutch operating results, to Fl 68.2m. Total operating profit increased by 15.2 per cent to Fl 171.6m. This includes a 37.5 per cent increase in European results, to Fl 20.7m, mainly reflecting buoyant profits in Portugal. Mr van der Hoeven said Ahold's activities in the Czech Republic were gradually approaching break-even. This point should be reached by the end of 1994, he said.</p>

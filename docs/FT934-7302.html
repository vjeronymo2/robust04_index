			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Hurd hints at end to aid for Bosnia MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, yesterday warned the warring factions in Bosnia that they could not expect humanitarian aid to continue indefinitely if there was no progress towards peace. He said in the Commons debate on the Queen's Speech: 'If the present political vacuum and lack of co-operation persists, the parties cannot expect the humanitarian commitment, which many of us undertake, to continue indefinitely. It is unrealistic to suppose that this effort can be expected to go on for ever and ever and ever when it is not receiving local co-operation and there is no progress towards a political settlement.' His remarks were seized upon by the Labour party as a signal that the UK was contemplating the withdrawal of troops from Bosnia. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, described Mr Hurd's 'hint that humanitarian aid might be stopped' as a 'grotesque error' of judgment. Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said he did not believe the signal was particularly helpful. 'British troops should stay in Bosnia as long as their mission is attainable,' he said. Mr Hurd's remarks follow a warning this week from Lord Owen, peace envoy in the former Yugoslavia, that the world community would have to decide how long it could sustain intervention in Bosnia. Lord Owen told the Confederation of British Industry in Harrogate there was a danger that intervening in civil wars only worsened the situation. 'There will come a moment when the world community will have to decide how long we can sustain intervention.' Whitehall officials yesterday played down suggestions that Britain might withdraw in the short term, but warned that the UK may seriously consider pulling out if the fighting continues into next spring.</p>

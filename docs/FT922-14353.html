			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / World Trade News: Czechs start export guarantees The Czechoslovak federal government has set up an Export Guarantee and Insurance Company (EGIP) to provide greater security for exports and promote trade, writes Ariane Genillard in Prague. The agency will offer, on a commercial basis, guarantees on credits linked to exports and insure trade transactions against economic and political risks. Its base capital will initially amount to 1bn Czech crowns (Pounds 19m), with shareholders being public institutions such as the federal government and the Czech and Slovak governments.</p>

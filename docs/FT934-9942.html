			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (4): Windows adds appeal - Online Databases UNTIL recently, many users have rejected online information services as time-consuming to learn and difficult to use. But this is starting to change as suppliers add friendly interfaces to their products, or put them on CD-ROM. In this article, we look at some of the online information services on which investors and analysts rely for their decision making, and their increasing availability through graphical user interfaces and on compact discs: The analyst James Ross, telecoms analyst at stockbrokers Hoare Govett, has access to several online databases from his desktop computer. He uses the Microsoft Windows graphical user interface on his personal computer (PC) and can call up the different services in separate Windows. One of these is Reuter Company Newsyear, a newswire providing real-time news. Stories can be selected, according to categories, such as telecoms. Another is the London Stock Exchange's Topic database which gives the latest share-price movements. Mr Ross also uses Reuter-Textline for background information if he is researching a particular company, such as Cable &amp; Wireless. This database provides articles from 300 titles. He also uses Datastream, which provides share-price information; figures from this can be loaded into a spreadsheet on his PC if he is producing a financial model of a company. However, if he is doing a very detailed search, Mr Ross will probably ask Hoare Govett's library for assistance. They use a number of online databases including, FT Profile, a business information database and online cuttings library owned by the Financial Times, Perfect Information (press cuttings, press releases and company news held as images of the original documents), Dialog (a collection of databases with a US bias) and several CD-ROM databases covering company financials. The investor Neil Sargent, an investment analyst at Sun Alliance, helps to manage funds worth billions. He uses Topic and Reuter databases and the company's fund management system takes feeds, such as Exshare securities and corporate action data from Extel Financial. The company library also provides access to a variety of other information sources. Merchant banker Peter Kohl (son of German chancellor Helmut) works in corporate finance at Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB), specialising in deals which involve German companies. He uses the Hoppenstedt CD-ROM database which provides information on all the large and medium-sized German companies which are relevant to his work. Mr Kohl says: 'You can do a print out which gives you the company name, products they make, subsidiaries and sales. The discs are updated four times a year and east German companies are also covered. Lots of people here use it.' CSFB's library also uses a wide range of other online and CD-ROM databases including Kompass (for company information). Janet Matthews of database consultancy Janet Matthews Information Services, believes that 'as younger executives move up the organisation, the number of end-users (as opposed to librarians) using online databases, will improve. This is partly because better interfaces to online databases are starting to appear and partly because younger executives are used to computers.' Windows interfaces New Windows-based interfaces to online databases include Dow Vision on Demand, the latest version of FT Profile Freeway, Reuters on demand and Reuter Business Briefing. These products are designed to simplify the process of connecting to a remote computer (which hosts the online database); selecting publications, constructing searches; saving information; transferring information into spreadsheet/WP files; and, in some cases, repeating previously-used searches and monitoring and controlling costs. Janet Matthews says: 'One of their main benefits is that they help users find the right sources, often by giving them a choice of subject areas. Without such guidance, users tend to go for the sources they know, which aren't always the best ones for what they want to find out.' Databases on CD-ROM A growing number of sources are now available on CD- ROM discs (like those used for music) because of their vast storage capacity. These include company financial information such as CD Europa, Lotus One Source, Disclosure (information on US companies, SEC registrations, and so on) and IDD Mergers &amp; Acquisitions. CD-ROM titles have both advantages and drawbacks over linking up to an online database hosted on a remote computer. One advantage is that you don't have to dial up and spend money on the telephone call - or rent a leased line if you use the database a lot. Another advantage is that once you've paid for the discs, you can look up information as often as you like without paying extra. You will, however, need to add a CD-ROM drive to your PC to display the information. The main drawback is that the information is not current. However, it is possible to design a search using McCarthy (press cuttings), the FT, The Economist, The Telegraph or The Independent on CD-ROM and automatically transfer to FT Profile for the very latest information. Another limitation is the difficulty of searching several publications at once, although technology is starting to make this possible. Despite the advent of the CD-ROM database and the graphical user interface, Janet Matthews thinks database suppliers will still find it hard to win over very busy people who haven't had to search through vast quantities of data before. These people won't be willing to take the time out or be forever dialing into online databases. In the future there will be less call for dialing up databases, she believes. People will log regular information requests with database providers (eg 'send me everything on AT&amp;T and acquisitions') and use the information that is downloaded to their PCs automatically to update archival information. Already companies, such as Individual Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, use special 'relevance feedback' software to sift through mountains of articles, delivering (by fax or electronic mail) only those which are of interest to the user - 'in the end, the answer has to be in delivery rather than interfaces,' says Janet Matthews.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic by </F> 'AQIDATI correspondent Jamal Salim, during the former's visit  to Cairo "last week"]    [Text] [Salim] What are the latest developments on the  battlefield?    [Ganic] Praise be to God, the Muslim fighters are standing  fast against the Serbo-Croatian aggression and the international  plot against us. More than 100,000 Muslims are fighting with  small-caliber weapons and few large-caliber weapons that they  seized from the Serbs and Croats. The international plot  continues. The arms embargo continues against us while arms  supplies continue to reach the enemies before the eyes and ears  of the whole world. It's an embargo imposed on the victim while  the aggressor continues to receive arms to complete the plot and  uproot Islam from Europe because Islam represents the thorn in  Europe's side. Accordingly, the Europeans seek to obstruct the  establishment of a European Islamic state in modern history,  even if this would mean the annihilation of the entire Muslim  people.    We have become hostages on our own land, because the UN  forces cannot protect us or even protect themselves. The UN  forces cannot carry out the task that they have been entrusted  with and they also cannot protect the humanitarian relief  convoys. Furthermore, it was recently revealed to the world  that these forces have harassed Bosnian women. Nevertheless,  the Muslims have scored various victories on several fronts.  But the Western media have purposely concealed these victories  so that the Muslims would feel that the Bosnian cause is dead.    [Salim] What are the most significant attacks to which the  Muslims have so far been exposed?    [Ganic] No doubt the principal objective behind all the  attacks is to wipe out Islam regardless of the price. The rape  of women and children falls within this context. There is also  an attempt to obliterate the Islamic identity by deliberately  killing Muslim ulema, burning Islamic books and schools, and  destroying more than 800 mosques. Muslim towns and villages  have been devastated as a result of the mass annihilation  campaign. Nonetheless, we continue to cling to our Islamic  ethics when we deal with the Serbian and Croatian prisoners. We  have never tortured any prisoner. This was very much  appreciated by some prisoners, who converted to Islam in view of  its tolerance and its care of human dignity despite their  atrocities and annihilation campaign.    [Salim] What about the partition plan and the ongoing peace  negotiations?    [Ganic] The international plot is clear through the share of  the land earmarked for the Muslims. We have rejected the share  because it is not proportional with the percentage of our  population, which is 45 percent. We will only accept a just  peace that would safeguard our usurped rights regardless of the  sacrifices and losses.    I believe that the protracted peace negotiations are a waste  of time because the Serbs and Croats continue to ignore the  repeated appeals to stop the fighting. The negotiations aim to  impose fait accompli because the international negotiators and  mediators are wasting time. The proposed partition plan will  lead to the displacement of 60 percent of Muslims.    [Salim] How have you prepared for the freezing winter under  the difficult conditions that the Bosnian Muslim fighters and  refugees are going through?    [Ganic] Actually, the tragedy is much greater than the  resources available, something that has led to the martyrdom of  hundreds of elderly people, children, and wounded people because  of a shortage of relief supplies and medical aid. The Muslims  are torn between the shelling and the freezing winter on the one  hand and the shortage of supplies as a result of the repeated  Serbian and Croatian attacks on the other hand. So what can we  do in these conditions that are too tough for anybody to endure?  The time has come for the Islamic countries to coordinate and  cooperate among themselves to come to our rescue. All the  Islamic states are responsible before God for their shortcomings  toward us. Thus, I appeal to Islamic states to employ their  financial and human resources as well as their diplomatic  relations to put an end to the shedding of Muslim blood in  Europe before we are all annihilated. This is because in such a  case, Islam would never rise again in Europe and would be lost  the way Islamic Spain was lost before. Faced with the current  situation, there is nothing we could do other than hold on to  God's words: "No soul but God can lay it bare" and "Verily God  will defend from ill those who believe."    [Salim] What about your visit to Egypt?    [Ganic] I came to Egypt because it represents a great source  of momentum in defense of our cause, in view of its good  relations with the major states that have the power to adopt  international resolutions. Egypt has a major role to play as a  torchbearer of Islam, the home country of al-Azhar, and the  country where every Muslim who suffers from injustice and  oppression takes refuge. We hope that in the near future  Egypt's good relations with the major states will bear fruit and  the conspiracy against the Bosnian Muslims will cease.    [Salim] The media has reported divisions among the Muslims  of  Bosnia. How true is this?    [Ganic] These were just some differences in views, but they  are over, thank God. All Muslims are now united in the face of  aggression, because the deluge will not spare any Muslim. Thus,  we are now united, thank God, under a single leadership and  there are no divisions as the Western media have reported.  These media have exaggerated the matter as if it were an  inter-Muslim war. I warn Muslims all over the world that the  conspiracy against Bosnia is not the end of the conspiracy  against Islam in Europe, but rather the first one that will be  followed by others in the future.</p>

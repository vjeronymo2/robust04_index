			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / EC and weather hit agrochemicals POOR WEATHER and the reforms of the EC's common agricultural policy that oblige cereal farmers to set aside 15 per cent of their land led to a decline in west Europe's agrochemicals market in 1992. The market, the world's largest, fell 2 per cent to Dollars 7.29bn (Pounds 5.13bn), according a report* prepared by Allan Woodburn Associates, the specialist market research group. However, the drop was worse - at about 5 per cent - in local currencies. In real terms, including inflation, the fall was between 9 per cent and 10 per cent. The decline was mostly weather-related, said Mr Allan Woodburn, director. In the summer it was too dry in southern Europe, and too wet in northern Europe last autumn. He warned that the full impact of the CAP reforms would only be seen during 1993. The report estimated the reforms would eventually lead to a decline in the European market of between 15 and 20 per cent by 1996. Last week Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, Rhone-Poulenc's chief executive, said the fall could be up to 30 per cent. Fungicide manufacturers are likely to be most affected, according to the report. Herbicide demand is expected to be less severely hit. The European insecticides market is small and more likely to be hit by the weather than by CAP reforms. The groups most affected by the downturn are those with the highest proportion of turnover in Europe, according to Mr Woodburn. These include Schering of Germany (60 per cent of sales in the region); Rhone-Poulenc of France (51 per cent); Hoechst of Germany (42 per cent); and Bayer of Germany (37 per cent). The report said Ciba-Geigy remained the world market-leader. Zeneca (turnover Dollars 1.97bn) has been overtaken for the second spot by Bayer (Dollars 2.05bn), almost entirely because of exchange rates. *Agrochemicals executive review.

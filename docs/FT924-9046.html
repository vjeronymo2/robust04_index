			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Tomkins buys up RHM THE DECISION by Hanson to withdraw its bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall (RHM) yesterday prompted the biggest daily turnover in shares of the food group for at least 10 years as Tomkins, which appears to have won through with its Pounds 935m counter offer, piled into the market. Dealers said that BZW, which has been acting for Tomkins, was crossing RHM shares between institutions and the group at 260p. This compared with a market bid price of 257p. Most of the business was done early in the day and resulted in closing turnover of more than 67m shares. It is estimated that the buying will have taken Tomkins stake in RHM to around 10 per cent ahead of the issue of the two-for-one rights issue offer document on Monday. Tomkins expects to raise Pounds 672m in one of the biggest ever cash calls in the UK. By the close, RHM had eased 4 1/4 to 257 3/4 p and Tomkins had fallen 2 to 226p on turnover of 8.2m. Meanwhile, Hanson closed 2 1/2 lower at 229 1/2 p with 12m shares traded. Unilever upset Food and household products firm Unilever fell 29 to 1080p after third-quarter figures that came at the bottom of the market's expectations inspired analysts to cut forecasts. Some analysts were particularly disappointed at the small increase in the sterling dividend payment, up only 3 per cent to 5.2p. Mr Carl Short shaved his full-year forecast by Pounds 33m to Pounds 2,005m and his 1993 figure by Pounds 25m to Pounds 2,385m. However, BZW, which had had the lowest forecast, was pleasantly surprised and upgraded its 1993 figure to take account of improved currency rates. Reckitt &amp; Colman lost 10 to 625p in sympathy. Spring Ram sold Building supplies group Spring Ram had a rough ride in the market for two reasons. First, the stock came under pressure after Spring Ram was confirmed as the bidder for Stag Furniture; secondly, the group said it had identified financial irregularities at its Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary which will cause Spring Ram to take an exceptional charge of up to Pounds 3.5m in its current-year figures. Spring Ram dropped sharply as the news filtered into the market. At their worst, the shares touched 112p before closing 43 off at 113p. Turnover reached 19m shares. Specialists were surprised at the level of selling. One said news of a probable extraordinary charge had been in the market for some time and had driven the shares down to a low of 104p during the early part of September. Stag Furniture shares shot up 39 to 158p Shares in Calor Group saw more heavy activity and dipped 5 to 240p after a reported denial by SHV, the privately-owned Dutch company which already has a 46 per cent stake in Calor, that it would bid for the rest of the stock. There was evidence in the market that a big buyer had been operating. A series of big trades were revealed by the Seaq ticker, including blocks of 425,000 at 240p, 408,000 shares at 235p, 350,000 at 237 1/2 p, 1.1m at 240 1/2 p and 900,000 at 240p. Turnover in Calor shares was the heaviest for at least two and a half years and led oil sector specialists to take the view that SHV had been operating in the market to increase its shareholding to around 48 per cent. Hints that one of the big institutions had been switching out of Racal Electronics and into Chubb produced some exceptionally heavy trading in the two stocks. Racal dipped 2 to 154p on turnover of 5.3m while Chubb edged up 3 to 197p on 5.7m traded. BICC rose 3 more to 266p after a visit and subsequent positive recommendation made by Smith New Court, the securities house. Talk of a dawn raid on Monday surrounded international conglomerate Lonrho late in the afternoon and the shares jumped 5 to 77p. The Seaq electronic trading system gave conflicting information but one page revealed a block of 5m shares dealt at 77p. This number of shares would be more than the total average daily turnover. One suggestion was that 7.26 per cent stake holder Genting, one of Malaysia's biggest companies, might be paving the way for a bid. Royal Insurance moved up a further 3 to 237p, with continued strong support from one broking house said to be the major influence in the shares' recent big rise. Suggestions that CE Heath, the insurance broking firm, may cut its interim dividend when it announces results on November 19, triggered a 19 fall in the shares to 291p. Fisons was knocked in early trade with the market focusing on a report in an on-line specialist magazine saying that eye treatment Opticrom would not get re-approval in the US this year. However, analysts said the information was not new and Fisons recovered from to close only 6 lower at 216p. Food retailer Argyll moved up 9 to 361p on heavy turnover of 10m shares as investors were said to be looking for a home for their funds after moving out of Sainsbury on the announcement of interim figures on Wednesday. Sainsbury eased 2 to 489p. Northern Foods rose 10 to 285p as some analysts argued that the stock was on an undeservedly low rating. Fears of a US trade war prompted Guinness to fall 10 to 516p and Allied-Lyons to slip 10 to 640p. Both have heavy exposure to the US and Lehman Brothers said that Allied had risen too far. Reports that a group of executives had left Virgin Music, acquired by Thorn EMI last March, worried some investors. Combined with profit taking, the shares fell 16 to 817p, in trade of 2m shares. Chemicals company Leigh Interests jumped 17 to 158p on revived interest and talk of speculative buying. SG Warburg has the stock on its buy list and believes the shares are cheap below 150p. Strong two-way business in Vickers prompted turnover of 5.4m with the shares losing 5 to 80p, as profit-takers gained the upper hand. A BZW recommendation was reported in Howden Group, helping the shares firm 5 to 56p. Office and photographic equipment distributor Gestetner jumped 18 to 156p, making it the day's biggest rise in the market in percentage terms, on speculation that it would soon receive a bid from Inchcape, 2 better at 499p. Coats Viyella held firm on the eve of an analysts visit to Carolina to discuss prospects for the company, the shares hardening a penny at 207p. City of London chop house Simpsons rose 2 to 34p in early trading after leisure, property and printing group Baldwin made an agreed offer for the group valuing its ordinary share capital at Pounds 1.68m. Baldwin eased a penny to 74p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (137).

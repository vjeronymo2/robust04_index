			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PARLIAMENT NAMES GORBACHEV AFTER HOT WORDS FLY IN DEBATE  </P> <P> The first competitively elected Soviet Parliament convened today and chose  Mikhail S. Gorbachev as the sole candidate for president after rejecting  demands that he first report on his accomplishments and failures.  </P> <P> Maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin withdrew his nomination bid. A little-known  Leningrad deputy, Alexander Obolensky, offered himself as an alternative to  Gorbachev, but two-thirds of the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies  rejected him.  </P> <P> Obolensky, who is not a member of the ruling Communist Party, said he knew that  he had little chance of winning the nomination but wanted to "set a precedent  of an alternative."  </P> <P> Yeltsin, whose anti-Establishment campaign for Parliament garnered 90% of the  vote in an election in Moscow, took himself out of the running, saying simply,  "I'm withdrawing myself." He said that as a member of the Communist Party's  Central Committee, he was bound by the committee's decision to support  Gorbachev for reelection.  </P> <P> Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov said he would not take part in the  secret balloting for the presidency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Votes Against Him  </P> <P> "We can't let these elections just be a formality," the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize  winner said. Sakharov was one of four deputies who abstained when the congress  voted to place Gorbachev's name on the ballot.  </P> <P> No one voted against Gorbachev's nomination.  </P> <P> Estonian activist Marju Lauristen offered Gorbachev her vote on condition that  he answer some tough questions first. For instance, she wanted to know who in  the ruling Politburo knew of plans to use troops to break up a pro-independence  demonstration in Soviet Georgia, and how soon Gorbachev learned of the plans.  </P> <P> Nineteen people died in the ensuing clash.  </P> <P> Others demanded explanations of privileges enjoyed by Soviet leaders and of a  decree banning statements that discredit authorities.  </P> <P> As the inaugural session opened, the congress plunged into spirited debate over  its agenda and powers. The lack of parliamentary experience showed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pledge Not to Abuse Power  </P> <P> Gorbachev led the proceedings, sitting behind two microphones with a giant  statue of Vladimir I. Lenin at his back. He arbitrarily called for votes on  some procedural issues while ignoring others. Only a few deputies objected.  </P> <P> At one point, the Soviet president took the microphone for 20 minutes, and in  one of his most impassioned political speeches, pledged not to abuse power if  reelected.  </P> <P> One of the first deputies to take the floor was Sakharov, who was banished from  Moscow until December, 1986, for human rights activities.  </P> <P> Sakharov praised Gorbachev for changing the face of Soviet society and said he  should be reelected president but demanded that Gorbachev first give the  congress an account of the mistakes and achievements of his reform efforts.  </P></p>

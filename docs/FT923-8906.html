			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Fairway static at Pounds 655,000 Fairway Group, the USM-quoted distributor of business and computer stationery, maintained its pre-tax profit at Pounds 656,000 in the opening half of 1992, against Pounds 655,000 last time. That came from doubled turnover of Pounds 14m (Pounds 6.76m), as GLS Fairway and Tonbridge Trade Binders were included throughout the period. Although GLS achieved a pre-tax profit of Pounds 138,000 in June, it incurred a loss of Pounds 10,000 for the six months; last year only June was included for which there was a profit of Pounds 109,000. The directors said it seemed likely that significant profits would now be made by GLS in the second half and orders for July supported that. Earnings per share fell to 1.49p on increased capital (2.68p) and the interim dividend is again 1p.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER WISHES, WINTER DREAM: CRANBERRY SHORTCAKE FOR THE HOLIDAYS  </P> <P> If you're thinking about holiday desserts and wishing it were summer so you  could serve strawberry shortcake, here's an interesting thought: Why not make  cranberry shortcakes?  </P> <P> The cranberry filling is a simple preparation -- fresh cranberries cooked only  with sugar, cinnamon and orange peel. The shortbreads, made with toasted  chopped pecans, are light and airy inside with slightly crusty exteriors.  Dusted with powdered sugar and filled with the glistening cranberry mixture,  they look stunning.  </P> <P> Even better, the cranberry filling can be assembled up to two days ahead and  the shortcakes baked early on the day needed. This is a truly stellar ending to  a holiday fete.  </P> <P> CRANBERRY  </P> <P> SHORTCAKES  </P> <P> 2 1/2 cups granulated sugar  </P> <P> 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons water  </P> <P> 2 (12-ounce) packages cranberries  </P> <P> 4 teaspoons very thin julienne-cut orange zest  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons cornstarch  </P> <P> Several branches long-needled pine, optional  </P> <P> Shortcakes  </P> <P> Powdered sugar  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups whipping cream, whipped until just firm  </P> <P> Combine granulated sugar with 1 cup water in large, heavy saucepan. Cook over  medium heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add 6 cups cranberries, orange zest  and cinnamon. Cook, stirring, 5 to 6 minutes or until berries pop. Remove pan  from heat.  </P> <P> Combine cornstarch with remaining 3 tablespoons water and stir mixture along  with remaining 2 cups cranberries into cooked berries. Cook, stirring, until  mixture has thickened, 2 to 3 minutes or longer. Remove from heat and let cool  to room temperature. (Cranberry mixture can be prepared up to 2 days ahead.  When cool, cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.)  </P> <P> Arrange pine sprigs on 10 dessert plates. For each serving, split 2 Shortcakes  and place bottoms on plate. Ladle cranberry mixture over each half and place  tops on slightly askew. Dust tops with powdered sugar. Serve immediately. Pass  whipped cream separately in bowl. Makes 10 servings of 2 shortcakes each.  </P> <P> Note: To toast pecans, place coarsely chopped nuts on rimmed baking sheet and  bake at 350 degrees until crisp, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove and cool.  </P> <P> Shortcakes  </P> <P> 2 cups flour  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons sugar  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon baking powder  </P> <P> 1/3 cup shortening, well-chilled and cut into 1/2-inch chunks  </P> <P> 3/4 cup milk  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and still warm  </P> <P> 3/4 cup toasted chopped pecans  </P> <P> Combine flour, sugar and baking powder in large mixing bowl. With pastry  blender or 2 dinner knives, cut shortening into dry ingredients until mixture  resembles oats. Make well in center and pour in milk and butter, stirring with  fork until dough just holds together. Stir in pecans and mix well.  </P> <P> Place dough on lightly floured work surface and knead 7 to 8 times until dough  is smooth and no longer sticky. Reflour surface, then roll dough into 1/2-inch  thick circle. Using 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter, cut out 20 shortcakes and place  on ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees on center shelf until golden and  puffed, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Shortcakes can be baked  several hours ahead and kept loosely covered with foil at room temperature.  </P></p>

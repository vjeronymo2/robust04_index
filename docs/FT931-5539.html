			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Letter: NHS reform and the role of private financing Sir, John Willman's review ('Just what the doctor ordered', March 1) of the recently published OECD report on the convergence of healthcare systems in seven countries of the European Community describes clearly the benefits accruing from operating a mixture of public-sector and private-sector provision and financing within the framework of a managed market. Mr Willman's article points out that the British health service is held up by the OECD report as one of the two services most advanced in their reforms. It is a pity then that the article did not try to explore the role that the private healthcare sector might be called upon to play as part of the new health service now taking shape in Britain. The issue of private-sector financing in particular could have been fruitfully examined by doing a comparison with the Dutch service - which the review describes in some detail (although it is easy to understand how the topic might need to form the subject of a completely separate article).

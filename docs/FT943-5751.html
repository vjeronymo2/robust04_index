			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Northern Ireland: Sinn Fein voice ban may soon be lifted - Media curbs There were growing signs at Westminster yesterday that the government could sanction an early lifting of the broadcasting ban on the voices of Sinn Fein representatives if it was convinced the IRA had ended violence for good. As both leading opposition parties said they would welcome the lifting of restrictions, Mr Michael Mates, a former Northern Ireland minister, indicated that he too thought an ending of the ban would be helpful. Mr Mates, Tory MP for Hampshire East, said he thought the move would be 'high on the list' after the announcement of a permanent cessation of IRA violence. The only reason the voices of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, were banned from the airwaves was because they supported violence, Mr Mates said. 'If there is no violence, that stricture goes away.' Removing the ban was 'a relatively simple thing the government could do relatively soon - but I think we will want one or two signs yet.' Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, is one of a number of cabinet ministers known to favour an end to the ban on the grounds that it has become counterproductive and tends to expose the government to criticism. But there are fears that such a move, if not handled sensitively, could provoke anger among unionists and unionist sympathisers on the Tory back benches. One prominent unionist supporter said yesterday that he did not think lifting the ban would provoke a strong reaction under the circumstances now prevailing. But Mr David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, indicated that he did not think the time for lifting the ban had yet arrived.</p>

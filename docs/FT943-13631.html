			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Move to start cable TV in Ulster The Independent Television Commission plans to try again to bring cable television to Northern Ireland, more than 10 years after the first experimental licence was awarded. The ITC is expected to advertise a licence or licences in the autumn and has not ruled out the possibility of advertising a single licence covering all of Northern Ireland - and not just Belfast and its surrounding area. If a single licence is advertised covering the more than 500,000 homes in the province it would be one of the largest cable television franchises in the UK - on a par with franchises such as the west Midlands. A cable franchise for the Belfast area was one of the first 11 experimental franchises to be offered in 1983 but the consortium, including British Telecom, STC and Ulster Television, did not make any progress. The lack of movement led to the licences being revoked in 1991. In March Mr Desmond Smyth, chief executive of Ulster Television, said he believed the time was now right for cable in Northern Ireland and admitted the company was in preliminary talks with Mercury Communications. Mr Jon Davey, director of cable at the ITC, said yesterday: 'I don't think cable is out of the woods yet but the environment is very different from even three years ago.' Unlike the franchises awarded by the old Cable Authority, the new 'local delivery franchises' go to the highest bidder. The signs are that there will be more than one potential operator interested in Northern Ireland, one of the largest uncabled areas of the UK and a region where there is a high interest in television choice and, almost certainly, in competing telecommunications services. The ITC has already advertised this year four of the new local franchises - the latest last Friday for southern East Anglia covering Thetford, Diss, Bury St Edmunds, Sudbury, Clacton and surrounding areas. This involves about 250,000 homes. The first of the new franchises, which allow over-the-air broadcast of channels using microwave frequencies as well as cable, attracted the surprisingly high annual bid of Pounds 1.6m when advertised in west Kent. The franchise went to Eurobell, a cable operator with franchises in the Crawley area of West Sussex and in Devon. The new franchise areas often include semi-rural areas that are of interest to cable operators in nearby large cities. Last month the ITC announced that Cable Communications Fylde and Wyre had won the new licence for Blackpool and Fylde with a cash bid of Pounds 762,000. The ITC also advertised a licence covering Chesterfield, Bolsover, Matlock, Belper and the surrounding area. Cable television is now available to about 3m homes in the UK with more than 650,000 of them subscribing to modern networks increasingly offering telephone services as well as television channels.</p>

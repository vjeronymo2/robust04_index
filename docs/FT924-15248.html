			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Heritage ministry warns on TV deals THE National Heritage Department has warned the Office of Fair Trading against taking too purist a view of competition in the television industry. The department, which is responsible for broadcasting, said: 'For viewers, competition is not an end in itself; a range of quality viewing is.' It was responding to an OFT consultative paper on the future ITV network system. The OFT has made clear that it regards as matters for review ITV plans to buy rights to programmes made by independent producers for 15 years, and the degree of direct access for independents to the central network director, responsible for ITV commissioning and scheduling. Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, the OFT must ensure that ITV networking arrangements are fair. The heritage department emphasises that the government's broadcasting policy 'includes, but is not driven by, the need to ensure fair competition across the broadcasting industry'. The submission argues that it would not be in viewers' interests for the networking arrangements 'to be the tool which emasculated the ITV companies in the name of competition'. On programme rights, the department warns of the experience in foreign markets where derivative channels based on repeats can suck out advertising revenue without adding to the production base. It is also concerned that the Independent Television Commission should be clearly able to use its powers and that the individual ITV companies should be accountable for what is broadcast. The submission to the OFT also points out the importance of maintaining healthy regional production centres, especially in the independent sector.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Gold price rise lifts Manila and Australia ARBITRAGE selling erased early gains and pushed equities into negative territory for the fourth consecutive session, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 82.42 to 20,474.15, up 0.7 per cent on the week, after reaching a day's high of 20,670.52 and a low of 20,401.67. The Topix index of all first section issues lost 5.35 to 1,605.71 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.47 to 1,241.80. Volume was estimated at 550m shares traded compared to 559m the previous day. Declines led advances by 620 to 402, with 165 issues unchanged. Turnover on the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange should decrease in the coming week, with investors becoming cautious as more companies release their results for the year to March. Some brokers said that prices are likely to consolidate further on profit-taking and on the use of futures contracts as a hedge against major discrepancies between company forecasts and their pre-tax profit results. Real estate shares lost ground in reaction to below-average earnings results. Mitsubishi Estate, a leading housing company, dropped Y20 to Y1,120, after recently announcing a 21.7 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for the year to March. Mitsui Fudosan shed Y20 to Y1,380. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 98.11 lower at 22,790.47, in volume of 26.7m shares. Roundup THERE were mixed performances from the regions markets yesterday. MANILA gained ground as mining shares were lifted by the stronger world gold price. The composite index ended 8.54 higher at 1,604.73, but down 3 per cent on the week. Combined turnover rose to 556m pesos from 471m pesos. Manila Electric's B shares gained 2.50 pesos to 322.50 pesos in turnover of 28m pesos. AUSTRALIA was also supported by the rise in gold with the All Ordinaries index up 4.1 at 1,698.5, a week's improvement of 0.7 per cent, in turnover of ADollars 358.6m. . The gold index soared 103.6 to 1752.0. Among the miners Placer Pacific rose 30 cents to ADollars 2.57, Newcrest Mining jumped 23 cents to ADollars 3.55 and North Flinders Mines soared 38 cents to ADollars 9.78. ANZ shares fell 5 cents to ADollars 3.60 after it announced slightly lower than expected net profit figures. HONG KONG was sharply lower on profit-taking and pre-weekend position squaring following a three-day rally. The Hang Seng index tumbled 103.47 to 7,005.29, a week's rise of 3 per cent. Turnover eased to HKDollars 3bn from Thursday's HKDollars 7.5bn. Property stocks were among the biggest fallers with Hongkong Land down 30 cents to HKDollars 15.20.

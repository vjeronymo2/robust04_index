			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Police shake-up likely in S Africa AT least 10 South African police generals are expected to be forced to retire soon in a police shake-up aimed at countering widespread criticism of the role of security forces in township violence. According to the Star, the Johannesburg daily newspaper, police generals who have failed to adapt to the new political situation brought about by government reform will be retired. A police spokesman would not confirm the report, but said the minister of law and order, Mr Hernus Kriel, would make a statement on the issue. Such a move, involving about a fifth of the force's generals, would represent one of the most important steps yet taken by President FW de Klerk to tackle the problem of poor policing, which has contributed significantly to township violence. Some 7,000 people have died in such fighting since 1990. The move could also help smooth the way for resuming talks on a post-apartheid constitution, suspended two months ago by the African National Congress, which alleged police involvement in the massacre of over 40 people at the Boipatong squatter camp near Johannesburg. The ANC is demanding government moves to tackle violence before it will resume the talks. A report by British investigators last month found no evidence of direct police complicity in the Boipatong incident, but portrayed the police as incompetent. The investigators said that the South African police force 'suffers serious organisational problems', and lacked 'adequate mechanisms for internal and external accountability, since they seem unable or unwilling to establish what action was taken by whom with what result'. In an attempt to improve the credibility of the force, which is widely distrusted by blacks, three black police generals are to be appointed, one of them as chief of 'community policing', according to the Star's report. For years the police fought a political battle against government opponents, especially the ANC, in the townships. Retirements at the level of general will not improve police attitudes overnight, but they will send an important signal to more junior officers. On its own such a move is unlikely to break the deadlock over constitutional talks, but it would demonstrate a willingness by Mr de Klerk to face up to the problem of police partiality. However, he would still be left with the task of tackling the issue of military involvement in political murders.</p>

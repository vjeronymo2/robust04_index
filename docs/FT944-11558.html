			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Wm Cook up 6% as interest falls Lower interest costs helped to lift pre-tax profits 6 per cent at William Cook, the Sheffield-based steel castings group, in the six months to October 1. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 3.35m to Pounds 3.54m as net interest fell from Pounds 551,000 to Pounds 410,000. Operating profit remained almost unchanged at Pounds 3.95m (Pounds 3.91m) on turnover which rose 8 per cent to Pounds 51.9m (Pounds 48m). Mr Andrew Cook, chairman, said margins had come under pressure as competitors lowered prices. He claimed that 50 per cent of the company's continental competitors were trading 'in a state of both legal and actual bankruptcy'. Raw material prices have also risen between 50 and 100 per cent in the last three months. 'In this environment, our own large-scale modernisation and investment programmes have the effect more of limiting margin erosion rather than increasing margins,' Mr Cook said. The company's strategy would be to reduce debt, which stood at Pounds 8m at the interim stage, while reducing costs and improving efficiency. The group's capital expenditure was about Pounds 2.5m in the first half as it completed modernisation programmes at two of its seven plants. However, it faces difficulties in its overseas market as the weak dollar affects 75 per cent of its export sales. Earnings per share rose 0.53p to 10.8p and the board declared a maintained interim dividend of 2.5p. Shares closed at 266p, down 4p.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: A different future for Renfrew - Babcock decision to axe 420 jobs provokes Scottish despondency The announcement this week of 420 job cuts at Babcock International's Renfrew plant has provoked despondency in Scotland that the remains of the country's base in heavy engineering is disappearing before people's eyes. The Babcock boiler plant is one of the few remaining examples of the type of heavy industry on which Scotland built its prosperity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is the type of plant which Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, must have had in mind when he said recently that manufacturing was 'riveted into the Scottish soul.' For years, the plant was the centre of Babcock's problem-strewn energy division. But under its new strategy, outlined on Thursday by Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr Nick Salmon, managing director, Renfrew could account for only 5 per cent of group business by 1996-97 - as its role, and that of Babcock's energy division, is reduced. The plant, which occupies a 134 acre site in this industrial town to the west of Glasgow, was opened in 1897 by the then Babcock &amp; Wilcox, whose British arm eventually became bigger than its US counterpart. As recently as 1984 it was employing some 5,000 people, but the story since then has been one of repeated cuts as Babcock's order book both from the UK and abroad weakened. By 1986 the plant's labour force had been cut to only 2,570 employees; by the end of the following year it was down to about 1,600. Last year, in what the workforce understood was a final retrenchment that would see the plant through the next five years, the labour force was cut by a further 25 per cent to 1,150. Now another 420 jobs are to go, of which 230 are those of manual workers. Mr John Quigley, an official of the AEEU engineering union, calls the scale of the latest cutback 'quite devastating. It puts a question mark over the viability of the whole site. I don't see how there can be enough work coming through to meet the overheads of the non-manufacturing side of the operation here.' Mr Quigley says the steady stream of government orders used to underpin Babcock and make it easier to lodge competitive bids for overseas contracts. 'That has now gone, and foreign countries now want to manufacture the lower technology parts themselves - the work which generated the most employment here.' Like other union representatives and local Labour MPs Mr Quigley puts the blame squarely on the government's energy policy, 'or the lack of it.' Mr Jim Stevens, a lecturer at the Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University, agrees, saying that since the mid-1980s 'the symbiotic relationship between the electricity generators and the power generation industry has been destroyed.' The job cuts at Renfrew were part of a big announcement by Babcock International on Thursday setting out the future strategy for the engineering contracting and materials handling company. It included a four-for-seven rights issue, priced at 27p per share to raise about Pounds 78.6m. Mr Salmon stresses that the Renfrew plant and the division does have a future. The 160-strong Technology Centre at the site is unaffected by the cuts and Babcock still wants to participate in big power plant projects worldwide. But it will be a different future - one that recognises, as Mr Salmon puts it, that 'two thirds of the market is on the other side of the world' and that, to be an effective player in the Far East, Babcock has to recognise that much of the region's power equipment needs will be manufactured locally. As if to emphasise this point, the division yesterday said it had won a technology and design contract for two new coal-fired power station boilers to be built at Ligang in China by the Wuhan Boiler Works. It will bring about 50,000 man-hours of design work to Babcock Energy, but at its Crawley base. The order was the first since a partnership deal was signed with Wuhan last year to enhance Babcock's ability to win coal-fired boiler contracts in China and give it access to low cost manufacturing capacity. Far from destroying Renfrew, Mr Salmon says the cuts will reduce the plant's capacity to a sustainable core. The more volatile proportion of its work, new plant business, will fall as a proportion of the total, and other non-profitable work will be cut out. Babcock now sees its energy division falling from a historical level of more than 40 per cent of group sales to about 25 per cent over the next three years, as the balance of the group shifts towards the materials handling and process divisions - and towards Asia. The energy division, and Renfrew, now has three ways forward, says Mr Salmon: it could go it alone, be sold, or form a joint venture, possibly with a boilermaker whose technology and marketing strengths complemented those of Babcock. Whichever way it goes, Babcock's first priority is to get it into shape.</p>

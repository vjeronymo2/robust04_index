			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] An Amnesty International delegation on Friday  expressed concern about the deterioration of human rights in  Venezuela, particularly about the questionable activities of  security forces on the border with Colombia.    The delegation led by Mexican Javier Zuniga released the  results of an extensive investigation of (?prisons), places of  detention, and torture in general, where flaws in the judicial  and public security system were evident. The mission also issued  an alert about the aggressive actions of the Metropolitan Police  in the application of the vagrants law and about the  government's proposal to permit citizens to be armed for their  defense in view of the increasing crime rate.</p>

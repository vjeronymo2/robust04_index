According to some information,  Yuriy Baturin, the Russian president's national security  adviser, has reported in detail to Boris Yeltsin the  circumstances of the criminal case against the scientist who had  allegedly revealed a state secret about the development in  Russia of new types of chemical weapons, and the president  "adequately reacted to the prosecution's being  unconstitutional." Yuriy Baturin explained that a criminal case  under Article 6 of the Criminal Procedure Code may be dismissed  in connection with changed circumstances. He regards as such  "changed circumstances" the adoption of the new Russian  Federation Constitution under which "everyone has the right to  freely look for, receive, pass on, produce, and distribute  information by any legal means. The list of information  constituting a state secret is determined by a federal law."  Since no open list of information about state secrets has been  published, this circumstance may be cause for dismissing the  case against the scientist, something Russian human rights  activists and the liberal press insist on.</p>

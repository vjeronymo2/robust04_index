International sanctions against the Stalinist state would  heighten tensions on the Korean peninsula, the main opposition  party concluded at the meeting attended by supreme councilors  and lawmakers belonging to the National Assembly's Defense and  Foreign Affairs-National Unification Committees.    The letter will be delivered to Clinton, via Secretary of  State Warren Christopher, by Rep. Chong Tae-chol when he visits  Washington later this week.    The party also agreed that if sanctions become inevitable  after the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of  Governors meeting slated for Feb. 21, they should be taken on a  step-by-step basis.    Spokesman Pak Chi-won said the letter would convey to  President Clinton the party's hope for fresh efforts to seek a  peaceful way out, such as a package solution, by calming down  U.S. hard-liners warning of the danger of war on the Korean  peninsula.</p>

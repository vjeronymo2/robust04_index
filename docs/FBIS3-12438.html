			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ze'ev Schiff: "On Appointments to the Next </F> General Staff"]    [Text] The military advocate general's report on the  Ze'elim B accident freed the bottleneck on appointments in the  IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] top ranks. The reason, in fact  the excuse, for artificially holding up appointments of new  generals to the General Staff has been removed. But things are  not as simple as they may appear to outsiders. When the cabinet  approved extending the chief of staff's term by another year,  Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq announced that he intends to  complete his term on 1 January, 1995, which leaves him another  10 months in office.    That means that Baraq is about to decide months prior to his  retirement on the appointment of most of the generals in the  General Staff of his successor, who is already waiting for the  job. Had that been done a year or two ago, it could have  passed. The general practice is that the chief of staff is  allowed to chose some of the generals he wants on his team.  This time, the next chief of staff will not be given the  opportunity to influence many key appointments. The makeup of  his General Staff will be decided now for many years to come.    The next chief of staff will most likely by Major General  Amnon Shahaq, who is currently the preferred candidate of  Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister. Shahaq  should have no less impact on the character of the future IDF  top brass than Baraq. The defense minister should hold  consultations on that also with the person who will be chief of  staff in another 10 months.    The extended delay in making the appointments due to the  Ze'elim accident was superfluous. The more prolonged the  military advocate general's investigation became the more  deferring the round of appointments became a burden. The  mistake was not in the extended terms of the current generals,  but in the link Baraq and Rabin formed between the Ze'elim  accident and the appointment of new generals who have nothing to  do with the accident. The problem is that even now that link  has not been totally severed.    The chief of staff was right in not appointing Major General  'Amiram Levin to a senior post immediately after receiving an  administrative reprimand. That was why it was suggested that in  the first stage there would only be a small round of  appointments. But there could have been "a small round" a long  time ago, before the military advocate general's findings were  presented. The current round will apparently include  appointments to the Central Command, the National Defense  College, and field commands. If Baraq wants to appoint 'Amiram  Levin to the Central Command he has to put off the change of  guard at that command. The significance of the "small round" is  that once again there will be a hold up in appointments and once  again officers who had nothing to do with the Ze'elim affair  have been affected.    Shortening the chief of staff's final year ends the chances  that a different senior officer will become deputy chief of  staff before a decision is made on who will succeed Baraq. In  recent weeks, Baraq tried to persuade Shahaq to take a year off  for rest or study, thereby enabling another officer to be tried  out in the post. Shahaq was not excited about the suggestion but  left it up to the defense minister to decide. The latter,  however, does not tend to make drastic decisions on such  personal issues, and since Shahaq did not request taking time  off for studies, the situation has remained unchanged.    That plan has now been removed from the agenda since there  is  no point in appointing a chief of the Operations Branch and  deputy chief of staff for only nine months. Appointment of a  Operations Branch chief must be made for several years,  especially since that general will also be the next deputy chief  of staff.    Chief of Staff Baraq has not had too much luck with  appointments. Several senior appointments during his term were  made without his approval (such as the appointment of Yitzhaq  Mordekhay as commander of the Northern Command). Other  appointments are not considered a success.    In the coming 10 months not only will the next chief of  staff  be appointed, but the three regional commanders, the deputy  chief of staff, head of the Intelligence Branch, and possibly  other senior officers will be decided. Two veteran generals  will necessarily be disappointed. Waiting on the sidelines is a  new generation of brigadier generals, some very good and some  less so.    The next General Staff must have not only talented, highly  professional officers with a strategic-political outlook; we  must also make sure it is truly balanced. Reserve General  Yisra'el Tal, who has been claiming for some time that we must  make doubly sure that the IDF top echelon should always include  commanders with experience in managing complex formations, who  would naturally come from the Armored Corps, is right. The  person who has to supervise that balancing act is the defense  minister, who must consider the overall appointments picture.</p>

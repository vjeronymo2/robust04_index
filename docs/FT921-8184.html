			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / BR may relaunch promotion for east coast line BRITISH RAIL is considering a marketing relaunch of its showpiece east coast main line to Scotland in an effort to tempt back customers irritated by the problems which have dogged the route since its Pounds 500m electrification was completed last summer. Vandalism and technical difficulties have affected the performance of the line - which links London with York, Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh - since it became fully electrified in July. This has frustrated BR's hopes that faster journey times would allow it to compete more effectively for the business and leisure markets. The line's high-speed trains were the centrepiece of InterCity's promotion last autumn. The marketing drive was backed by a promotion, billed as the world's biggest travel offer, in which InterCity offered free travel worth about Pounds 50m in exchange for vouchers given to shoppers at Boots stores. Allied to this was extensive publicity in northern England and Scotland. But yesterday Mr Philip Benham, BR's customer service and retail manager for the InterCity east coast line, said BR was considering a campaign to persuade potential customers that the line's difficulties had been surmounted. 'We're thinking quite seriously at the moment about how to relaunch our marketing effort and how best to target it,' said Mr Benham. 'We have quite a task on our hands to regain confidence.' BR is today running one of its Q-trains, a special anti-vandal train manned by British Transport Police, in Teesside. A similar Q-train, the first on the east coast line since electrification, travelled around Tyneside last week. The purpose of the train is partly to catch vandals and partly to impress on the public that BR is tackling the problem. Mr Benham said the line's difficulties had been caused partly by 'teething problems' as staff became used to new technology. There had also been serious vandalism including repeated damage to the fibre-optic cable which controls signalling and points and carries BR's internal telecommunication links.</p>

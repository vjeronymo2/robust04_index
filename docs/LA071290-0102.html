			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> KIDS IN WORKPLACE  </P> <P> If I wasn't able to bring my boy here, I would have to find someone to care for  him. My husband starts work at 3 (p.m.) and my daughter starts her job at 4  (p.m.), so there is no one at home to take care of him for that period at the  end of the day.  </P> <P> You can afford to pay for your living arrangements and other things you need,  but it is hard to squeeze in that money for child care, usually its $50 or $60  a week.  </P> <P> People do complain. Sometimes the owner complains, because kids get into  things. But I think all jobs should have a place where kids can be. A lot of  mothers and fathers and single people just can't afford child care.  </P> <P> I don't think an office should be turned into a nursery: (a landlord who has  complained about children in an Orange County law office) is right in a way.  But mostly he's wrong because (those women) are doing what they have to do. If  they can't do it that way, how can they make a living to take care of the  child?  </P></p>

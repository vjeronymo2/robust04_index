			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo January 13 TASS -- The first Russo-Japanese  consultations on the problem of the two countries' cooperation  in the field of environmental protection are due to be held in  Tokyo on January 26-27, an official representative of the  Japanese Government told journalists today.    At the consultations both sides plan to discuss such issues  as the prevention by joint efforts of dumping liquid nuclear  waste in seas of the world ocean by Russia, cooperation in the  struggle against pollution of air space, and in ecological  protection of tracts of forests in Siberia which have essential  influence of the planet's climate.    The consultations are called upon to become the first step  towards working out concrete programs of cooperation between  Russia and Japan in the sphere of environmental protection.    The forthcoming talks will be held for the first time since  April 1991 when Japan and the former Soviet Union concluded an  agreement on bilateral cooperation in the field of environmental  protection.    One of the major results of this cooperation is that Russia  will stop dumping nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan, according  to an official from the ecology department of the Russia Defense  Ministry.    So far Russia has had two tankers being used to store liquid  nuclear waste which are now full to the capacity. Japan is  reported to have offered its storage tanker to save the  situation.    Japan shows a particular interest in the settlement of this  problem because Russia allegedly dumped 900 tons of liquid  nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan in October 1993. This aroused  a storm of protests in Japan which is making great efforts to  protect environment. At that time Russia explained the incident  by the absence of storage space for nuclear waste and financial  difficulties.</p>

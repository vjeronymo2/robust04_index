			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Insurers told to cut storm cover INSURERS could come under pressure to reduce cover for storm damage to homes, a conference on global warming and catastrophic weather losses was told yesterday. Mr Jeremy Hindle, a senior underwriter with Swiss Re, the world's second largest reinsurance company, said that the excess (the amount a policyholder pays of any claim) on household buildings policies 'must be raised to Pounds 250 immediately, with a move to Pounds 1,000 being the target.' Swiss Re is one of a number of reinsurers providing cover to UK insurers. Insurers have introduced higher excesses for subsidence but for most claims householders pay a compulsory excess of about Pounds 50. Some insurers offer lower premiums for customers who choose to take a higher excess. Household insurance premiums have risen in recent years, partly reflecting steep rises in rates charged by reinsurers to insurance companies. Mr Hindle told the conference, organised by environmental pressure group Greenpeace, that changes in terms and conditions of buildings policies were needed to reduce exposure to storm damage. Reinsurers have put the UK in the list of five international regions most exposed to catastrophic weather or earthquake risk, after two of the costliest storms on record in the past six years. But he said reinsurers could also press for further changes. Insurers could restrict coverage to a percentage of the sum insured in some areas or follow the example of insurers in the Virgin Islands - badly hit by hurricane Hugo in 1989 - where excesses are a percentage of the property's value. AA Insurance, one of the UK's biggest brokers, criticised the move to raise excesses. Mr Noel Privett, AA head of information, said such it would represent 'a huge overreaction. A more creative solution is called for'.</p>

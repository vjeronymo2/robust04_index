			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["B.A.P."-signed interview with Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of </F> the Independent Smallholders' Party; place and date not given:  "Jozsef Torgyan on National Cooperation -- The FKgP Would Defeat  Communism"]    [Text] We continue our series in which the list leaders of  parties give interviews, with the views of Jozsef Torgyan,  chairman of the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKgP].    [PESTI HIRLAP] When the Hungarian Way Circles were formed,  you published a communique in your periodical, the HO NAP, that  these are the FKgP's own children. However, now you will not  participate in the event organized by Istvan Csurka [cochairman  of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party, MIEP] which is to  foster national cohesion. Why?    [Torgyan] The term Hungarian Way is the newspaper name of  the  FKgP's extended arm, the Hungarian Community. This community had  such outstanding leaders as Balint Arany, who was an organizing  secretary of our party. They fought against Nazism and later  the Soviet Union. This is the reason I could not call the  Hungarian Way Circles anything other than the FKgP's own  children. At the same time, when the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF] was planned, the intention was to establish a substitute  for the popular front. I am convinced that the whole peaceful  process was preceded by an international agreement drawn up by  the central committees of the given countries' communist  parties, with the assistance of the KGB. In this structure, the  role originally designed for the popular front was given to the  Democratic Forum. After all this, Csurka talks about the MDF as  the biggest force of national cohesion. In addition, he also  invited parties like the Unified Smallholders' Party that had  been sliced off from the FKgP.    [PESTI HIRLAP] You mean the United Smallholders Party?    [Torgyan] It does not make any difference, its name will be  forgotten after 8 May anyway. Csurka invited the forces that  are trying to divide the right wing. I think that this step can  only nominally serve the goal of uniting the right wing. In  real terms, it serves to draw away the FKgP's forces. It  clearly has to be seen that, today, only the FKgP is able to  defeat communism.    [PESTI HIRLAP] At the same time, according to the interior  minister, Gyula Thurmer, the main domestic representative of  communism, strengthened you.    [Torgyan] Please write it down in bold letters: The  interior minister lied. If you do not print this then I will  not let you print anything at all.    [PESTI HIRLAP] According to a view published in a newspaper,  your role is to attack the MDF and the communists at the same  time, thus opening the way for the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ].    [Torgyan] Every day I mention in my speeches that God save  us from the hissing parties. The SZDSZ is a pseudo-opposition  party because their main task is to preserve communism. A  popular figure was placed at the SZDSZ's head to deceive people  and to hide the party's real character. At the same time, we  can also see clearly that Gabor Kuncze who was put there to  deceive the public will soon be replaced by Gabor Fodor, who was  brought in as a second man. I have to point out that they have  lost their support in the provinces so, in addition to the MDF,  the SZDSZ will be the other big loser of these elections. The  FKgP was the only party that had the audacity to say that,  rather than a change of the regime, a communist preservation had  taken place in Hungary. The pseudo-democracy operated as a  multiparty dictatorship. It is precisely the MDF that serves  the purpose of making people learn to hate democracy.</p>

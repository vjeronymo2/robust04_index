			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLANS FOR SCHOOL ON SITE OF AMBASSADOR  ADVANCE  </P> <P> Despite competition from developer Donald Trump, the Los Angeles Unified School  District announced Monday that it intends to go forward with plans to construct  a high school on the site of the former Ambassador Hotel.  </P> <P> District officials are scheduled to appear before the State Allocation Board in  Sacramento on Wednesday to seek $120 million to begin construction of a  2,500-student school on the 24-acre site.  </P> <P> Trump wants to build the world's tallest high-rise on the land and has  suggested two alternate sites for the school. But both have been rejected by  district officials because they are in heavy traffic areas and would require  homes to be torn down.  </P> <P> At a news conference Monday, school board President Jackie Goldberg accused  Trump of showing "blatant disregard for the needs of the community." She said  more than 4,000 students are bused each day from overcrowded schools  surrounding the Ambassador site to campuses up to an hour away.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>   [Excerpts] The United States has given us a useless  condemnation, and dissociated holy Jerusalem from the  Palestinian territories occupied since 1967. This is the best  international reward for Israeli aggressors because the victims  have accepted an international resolution that will join the  archives of hundreds of similar resolutions that have been left  unheeded at the world body. Consequently, this resolution  reflects their own position. It is not supportive of our  grievances.    After two weeks of U.S. procrastination, we have seen a  "lame" UN Security Council [UNSC] resolution condemning the holy  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. This resolution has failed to  firmly handle the main causes of the massacre; namely, the  continued occupation, settlement activities, and the terrorism  of settlers.    This is the gist of statements made by four Palestinian  officials in reaction to UNSC Resolution 904, and the shock the  Clinton Administration has delivered to the Arab and Islamic  nations with regard to Jerusalem.    For his part, PLO Executive Committee member Sulayman  al-Najjab said that the resolution is not commensurate with the  Hebron massacre and the ensuing massacres committed by the  Israeli Army. This resolution has failed to ensure the  nonrecurrence of similar massacres. It has failed to provide  protection for the Palestinian people. Likewise, it has evaded  any talk of settlements, and the conduct of settlers, although  the settlements constitute time bombs that will jeopardize the  security of the Palestinian people and the entire peace process,  as well, al-Najjab argued.    Al-Najjab added that the U.S. conduct, which obstructed the  passage of this resolution for three weeks and rendered its  passage a difficult task, will be maintained. Consequently, it  will undermine any positive aspects that could be found in this  resolution. Given all this, one can say that the said  resolution marks a qualitative leap in the United States'  efforts to wriggle out of its commitment to the content of  Resolution 242, the invitation to the Madrid conference, and  even the letter of assurances delivered to the Palestinians,  particularly since the United States has defied the world by  refusing to acknowledge that Jerusalem is occupied territory.    Al-Najjab went on to say: The U.S. position has torpedoed  the very foundations of the peace process, because it reflects  full support for the Israeli position. Besides, this U.S.  position will nurture Israeli intransigence and provide Israel  with greater elbow room to interpret the Declaration of  Principles as it wishes.    Al-Najjab believes that the resolution does not provide any  justifications for the Tunis-headquartered Palestinian  leadership to return to the negotiating table. Before any  return to the negotiations, the Palestinian people's unanimous  demands for effective international protection, evicting the  settlers in Hebron, Gaza, Jericho, and other areas where there  is room for friction between the Palestinians and settlers, and  placing the issue of settlements at the top of the interim  period talks agenda must be met, especially since these demands  have enjoyed extensive support from the Arabs and the world in  general.    Al-Najjab added: With regard to Jerusalem, the U.S. position  toward it requires urgent consultations and moves by all Arab  sides that adhere to the Arab identity of Jerusalem. The Arab  sides must reply to this Israeli [as published] position, and  take the necessary practical measures to safeguard the Arab  identity of Jerusalem, and confront the persistent Israeli  scheme to consecrate its annexation to Israel.    The PLO Executive Committee member said: This is the  responsibility of all honorable people in the world. Unified  positions can make the U.S. Administration reconsider its  positions, which are hostile to Jerusalem, and which do not  support a peace agreement grounded in the implementation of the  relevant international legitimacy resolutions.    For his part, Taysir Qub'ah, deputy speaker of the  Palestine National Council [PNC], said: The effects of the U.S.  pressures and dictates are clear, not only in the obstruction of  the UNSC deliberations on the Hebron massacre, but also in the  text, terms of reference, and contents of Resolution 904, not to  mention the mechanism of voting on said resolution. [passage  omitted] Qub'ah added: Now that the [U.S.] positions have been  exposed, and given the current dangerous state of affairs, I  demand the continued suspension of the negotiations. I also  believe that the Palestinian leadership must not succumb to U.S.  and Israeli blackmail. I strongly believe that we should no  longer deem the United States an honest sponsor or broker, given  U.S. practices, the last of which has been rewarding Israel for  its massacre by granting it our Jerusalem, the holiest of all  holy places, as well as our holy land, the land of prophets and  messengers. This U.S. position is the height of bias toward  Israel. It constitutes a flagrant retreat from the positions of  successive U.S. Administrations since the occupation of the holy  city, a violation of the letter of assurances, and a scuttling  of the negotiating process, particularly since the sponsor of  the peace talks has shown a blatant bias toward Israeli demands  regarding Jerusalem.    Qub'ah went on to say: This U.S. position has killed the  erroneous wagers some have entertained. It has also shown  flagrant deception. Hence, it requires a reconsideration of the  bases, terms of reference, and mechanisms of the peace process,  beginning with the Madrid conference terms of reference, and  ending with the Washington and Cairo agreements, which have  produced unfair, unscrupulous, and inequitable agreements--the  agreements signed in Oslo and Cairo.    As for Taysir Khalid, member of the Political Bureau of the  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, he has  condemned the statements made by the U.S. delegate to the United  Nations, as well as her determination to deny the Palestinian  people their right to sovereignty over their territory, and to  deem the West Bank, Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip disputed  territories. He also condemned the U.S. position on several  paragraphs of the said resolution, particularly those regarding  Jerusalem and settlements. He denounced the U.S.  Administration's determination to rule out the dispatch of  international troops to the occupied territories to provide the  Palestinians of the occupied territories with international  protection. He added that this reflects this administration's  disavowal of international legitimacy and international  legitimacy resolutions, including those the previous U.S.  Administrations endorsed.    Khalid urged the authoritarian Tunis-headquartered  Palestinian leadership to denounce this U.S. position and halt  the negotiations until the U.S. Administration and the Israeli  Government commit themselves to disarming settlers, dismantling  settlements, ensuring true and effective international  protection for the Palestinian people, and rebuilding the  negotiating process on the relevant international legitimacy  resolutions, including UNSC Resolutions 242 and 338, and the  refugees' right to repatriation on the basis of Resolution 194,  as well as the principle of trading land for peace.    Khalid went on to say: This leadership must respect the free  will of the Palestinian people, who are demanding a halt to the  negotiations. Or else, it must tender its resignation and call  for an extraordinary PNC session to elect a new Palestinian  leadership that could shoulder its responsibilities toward its  people, defend their rights and interests, comply with PNC  resolutions, and lead the Palestinian people's struggle to  regain their national rights to repatriation,  self-determination, and national independence.    Dr. Labin Qamhawi, a well-known intellectual, said that the  U.S. handling of the draft resolution condemning the Zionist  crime against Palestinian worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  reflects the true U.S. position, which, first and foremost, aims  to boost the Israeli position. Previous developments have also  shown the U.S. bias toward Israel. For the U.S. condemnation of  any operation carried out by the strugglers or mujahidin against  the occupation has always been prompt. [passage omitted]</p>

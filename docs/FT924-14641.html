			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Sharp rise in German payment defaults STRONG EVIDENCE of the deepening difficulties faced by German industry came yesterday from Britain's leading private export credit agency, which reported a 68 per cent increase in payment defaults by German importers of UK products. A survey by NCM Credit Insurance, which took over the short-term export finance arm of Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department early this year, shows an increase of 26 per cent in the number of overdue accounts reported by its 6,000 UK customers. It blames the rise on deepening recession in many of Britain's leading export markets. Problems are 'particularly worrying' in Germany, the study says. The 68 per cent rise in overdue accounts, comparing the first eight months of 1991 with the same period this year, compares with a 53 per cent increase in France, 52 per cent in Sweden, 35 per cent in Spain and 34 per cent in Italy. About 40 per cent of overdue accounts eventually become full defaults, but NCM said yesterday that the trend for defaults was identical to that for overdue accounts. An official at the BDI, Germany's leading business body, said German companies were being squeezed hard by high interest rates and the collapse of the market in the east of Germany, as well as economic troubles in leading export markets such as Britain, the US and France. According to Mr John Price, one of the authors of the NCM study, most defaults in Germany are being reported in the small electrical machinery sector. By contrast, the textile sector is giving greatest problems in Spain, Italy and Sweden, with clothing sector showing the most severe problems in France. The study argues that the recent devaluation will provide only a modest fillip to UK exporters. 'Devaluation may help British exporters in terms of price, but as the worldwide recession continues, it increases the risk of non-payment by importers who find their own domestic economies suffering,' the study says. The NCM analysis shows that over the past five years annual losses reported by British exporters because of payment default have risen by 170 per cent. Worst experiences have been in Spain and Italy.</p>

			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> SANTA ANA POLICE CONTINUE HUNT FOR GUNMAN WHO KILLED 3 MEN  </P> <P> Police today continued to search for the gunman who shot and killed three men  and injured a fourth late Monday outside an apartment complex in a neighborhood  beset by drug-related crime.  </P> <P> Santa Ana police also released the names of the victims.  </P> <P> Killed in the shooting were Angel Brito Guadarama, 16; Mario David Mora, 23,  and Noel Hererra Arroyo, 20, all of Santa Ana, according to Lt. Robert Helton.  </P> <P> Miguel Angel Toledo Soto, 22, of Santa Ana is at UCI Medical Center in Orange  in serious condition with several bullet fragments still lodged in his head, a  medical center spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The spokeswoman said that although Soto's doctors describe him as  "disoriented," he has shown signs of responding favorably to treatment.  </P> <P> Helton said the gunman -- described as in his mid-20s and wearing dark clothing  -- walked through the Fairview Villas apartment complex and opened fire on four  men standing next to a bank of public telephones. Two of the victims fell to  the ground and died immediately, while a third ran about 25 yards to an  apartment, where he died.  </P> <P> The suspect then fired two rounds through the front windshield of a passing  car, with one of the rounds hitting Soto in the head. There was no indication  that Soto, a passenger in the car, had any involvement with the other victims,  Helton said.  </P> <P> The fourth man at the telephones was uninjured, and police are searching for  him.  </P> <P> "There's no evidence that would indicate it's gang-related. None whatsoever,"  Helton said.  </P></p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Swedes foil plan to kidnap magnate SWEDISH police said yesterday they had arrested three Russians and a Swede, armed with pistols and a hand grenade, on suspicion of planning to kidnap Mr Peter Wallenberg, senior member of the powerful Wallenberg industrial dynasty, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm. Police said the men were seized outside the gates of Mr Wallenberg's mansion on the forested island of Varmdo, near Stockholm, on Monday evening. Officials said they believed the men intended kidnapping Mr Wallenberg, 67, for ransom. They did not get close to the industrialist. High-profile Swedes, previously relaxed about security, have tightened precautions since the assassination by a still unknown gunman in 1986 of the former prime minister, Mr Olaf Palme. Mr Wallenberg heads a family which founded much of Sweden's industrial base and holds large shareholdings in leading companies such as Ericsson, the telecommunications group, Astra, the pharmaceuticals giant, Stora, Europe's biggest forestry products company, and Saab-Scania, the vehicle and aircraft maker. He is a relative of the wartime diplomatic hero, Raoul Wallenberg, who died in prison in Moscow in 1947.</p>

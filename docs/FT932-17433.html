			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / VAT 'most resented tax' VALUE added tax imposes the most resented tax burden on small businesses, according to research for Barclays Bank. The burden of VAT lies not so much in its financial cost but in its impact on a business's cashflow and time taken in administration, the research showed. Sixty per cent of the 200 small businesses surveyed said VAT was the main cause of cashflow management problems, while 62 per cent said it required more administration than any other tax.</p>

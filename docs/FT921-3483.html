			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Edmond declines to 'creditable' Pounds 1.73m Edmond Holdings, the housebuilder operating in Hull, east Yorkshire, the Midlands, East Anglia and South Wales, saw pre-tax profits decline from Pounds 3m to 'a creditable' Pounds 1.73m in the year to December 31. Mr Andrew Naish, chairman, said that house prices had continued to fall throughout the period, despite the interest rate reductions. Against this background, he was pleased with the profits figure which was achieved on turnover down at Pounds 17.3m (Pounds 19m). Earnings dropped to 2.41p (4.13p) but the directors have recommended maintaining the final dividend at 1.2p for an unchanged total of 1.85p. Total house completions were 329 (323) units at an average price of Pounds 52,500 (Pounds 58,800). Gearing was reduced to 41 (66) per cent and the landbank increased to 1,850 (1,300) plots.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Thomas Chorherr: "Austrian Lessons for the </F> White House"]    [Text] Bill Clinton represents a twofold change, this paper  wrote on 5 November 1992, the day after the election of the  governor of Arkansas as President of the United States. We  stressed that he not only stands for change but that he also  represents a bill on the future. "History will show whether it  will be honored, and whether it is covered." Earlier than  expected it has become clear that the bill was drawn on an  uncovered account. "The Europeans may remain skeptical for the  time being," the editorial concluded at the time. According to  the U.S. media, Bill Clinton simply does not understand what is  going on in the Balkans, particularly in Bosnia. For him foreign  policy is at best an aspect of domestic policy, which has turned  out to be difficult enough for him. Thus, foreign policy is a  nuisance for the U.S. President. The political course of the  current Administration reflects this fact.    If Chancellor Franz Vranitzky meets with Bill Clinton today,  he can claim to represent a small country but one that is  familiar with the geographic, geopolitical, and historic  background to the situation in Bosnia and Serbia. Thus,  Vranitzky can be something like a teacher. He need not act as a  supplicant but can walk with his head up. Quite the contrary,  it would be advisable for the President to modify an American  motto: "When the Austrians talk, we listen."    This is not megalomania but realism. Just like Clinton,  Vranitzky knows that the United Nations is currently going  through its worst crisis since its founding, as Foreign Minister  Alois Mock put it pertinently. It has completely lost  credibility, and the world body does just as the Serbs please.  At the same time, NATO and the United States have also lost  everything that was still left of its superpower status. The  hesitation of the United States to use its military strength to  defend the alleged ideals of freedom, human dignity, human  rights, and self-determination is to blame for that.    Vranitzky will have to explain to the President today and to  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali tomorrow that only  comprehensive and determined air strikes can prevent the Serbs  from creating a new empire at the costs of the neighboring  peoples. He will also have to make it clear to the White House  that the West should by no means again make the mistake it  committed between 1933 and 1939. If there had been military  intervention after the occupation of the Rhineland by the  Germans, World War II would probably never have happened.    Bill Clinton still believes that a negotiated solution in  the  Balkans is still possible. At least until yesterday he was not  willing to accept more than half-hearted selective air strikes  that are doomed to failure from the very beginning. Vranitzky  will have to convince officials in Washington that a hesitant  attitude is not useful. Moreover, he will also have to warn  them against an all too gullible attitude vis-a-vis the  Russians. Even though Moscow's special envoy Churkin is  apparently desperate because of the uncompromising position of  the Serbs, the Russians know that, because of Washington's  weakness, they have again become a second major partner in the  world political game from which they seemed excluded until  recently. In other words: Moscow believes that it can play a  major role again -- supported by a Washington that proudly  broadcast a short time ago that it is the only remaining  superpower.    Only when all these lessons are understood will Vranitzky be  able to present his justified proposal to make Vienna the center  of Bosnia's reconstruction. First he should try to find out  whether Washington is really ready to accept as partners the men  whom it placed on the list of war criminals among great approval  a short time ago. Yet this may be the U.S. interpretation of  realpolitik.</p>

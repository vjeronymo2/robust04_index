			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WHAT NBC NEEDS IS RETURN OF GARAGIOLA  </P> <P> Bring back Joe G.  </P> <P> NBC coverage of the All-Star game (Anaheim '89) was excellent. Scully, as  usual, was superb. However, "Dutch" (to be expected) has lost his touch with  sports announcing as well as bucking broncos. And Seaver was difficult to  understand due to poor enunciation (mumbling) . . . bring back the bald-headed  guy.  </P> <P> CHET LARSON  </P> <P> Solana Beach  </P></p>

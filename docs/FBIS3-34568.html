			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Above the Red Line" column: "Negative Effects of the Trade </F> Ministry's Food Price List" by Faruq Jasim al-'Azzawi]    [Text] The Trade Ministry has a struggling role in the  present economic conditions to meet the people's ration card  requirements despite all economic obstacles, no matter how  justifiable, and the fluctuations in food prices due to the rise  or fall of the dollar exchange rate. No doubt, the ministry's  economic activity is scientific and enlightened, taking into  consideration all factors affecting the stability of the market.  The ministry's operations room is also doing an excellent job.  However, those in charge of the food price list have failed so  far to examine market conditions and the movements and stability  of prices before rushing in an unstudied manner to fix the new  food prices. This has led to grave results, such as  destabilizing the market and causing anxiety to the citizen who  has to shoulder new prices which are beyond his means. This is  in addition to their effect on hiking the dollar exchange rate.  I do not want to go into detail on the Trade Ministry's  numerous measures and guidelines to explain their serious  economic effects on what I have just mentioned. I will simply  discuss one item, ghee, to prove the erroneous method used by  the Trade Ministry in fixing the prices of ghee and other items  in the food price list.    More than one month ago, the Trade Ministry fixed the price  of one kg of ghee at 82 dinars; or 1,225 dinars per one can  weighing 15 kg. The dollar exchange rate at the time ranged  from 130-135 dinars. Yet, the world price of ghee was $9 per  can, including freight charges to Baghdad. In some cases, the  price went up to $10 for the good quality ghee. In the  meantime, the local market continued to be stable as far as the  dollar exchange rate was concerned. Suddenly, the Trade  Ministry issued an amended price list for motives and reasons  which we do not know. It fixed the sale price of one kg of ghee  at 98 dinars; or 100 dinars to the consumer. Thus the price of  one can of ghee weighing 15 kg became 1,480 dinars and the  merchant sold this can to the consumer for 1,520 dinars; an  increase of 255 dinars over the price of ghee on the previous  list. What has happened to justify this increase? Has there  been an increase in world prices -- to our knowledge the world  price has stabilized at $9 per per can -- or was the Ministry  trying to absorb the currency surplus, and this also is not  correct? The Trade Ministry pays the merchants 28-35 million  dinars daily [in subsidy]. The effects of the Trade Ministry's  list are clear to everyone from the big jump in the dollar  exchange rate. The dollar exchange rate jumped from 135 to 180  dinars after the new list. The merchants fought one another to  get dollars at any price in order to quickly benefit from the  large profit embedded in the Trade Ministry's new list. This  has resulted in a tangible increase in food prices, thereby  affecting the citizen's purchasing power and adding more burdens  that are beyond his means. Whose interest is being served by  this price list; and under what consideration has this list been  produced? The price spiral must be borne by the Trade Ministry  and its devastating food price list, since this list includes  basic items in the ration card, such as sugar, rice, ghee, oil,  flour, and tea.    The new price list lacked objectivity by not viewing current  conditions within their wider perspective and considering the  numerous burdens on the citizen. The price list has come bare  of any deep sense of responsibility toward the citizen. In  fact, it is a time bomb threatening the market. The market has  been disturbed and the dollar exchange rate market is active  again. The Trade Ministry has contributed to the new spiral of  the dollar exchange rate. All this has taken place thanks to  the Trade Ministry's food price list.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Who says the classics aren't popular? Telephone sales began Sunday for Sir  Peter Hall's Broadway production of "The Merchant of Venice," opening Dec. 19,  and the day's take was $295,380. Monday's (to 5 p.m.) was more than $119,000.  That's almost half a million dollars in two days for a 400-year-old play. It  could have something to do with the actor playing Shylock -- Dustin Hoffman.  ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Letter to editor from Nie Zhenbang (5119 2182 6721) and Yao </F> Changtian (1202 2490 1815) of the State Planning Commission's  Office of Agricultural Economy]    [Text] Comrade Editor: Our state operated forestry areas  consist primarily of the forests in the Northeast and Inner  Mongolia, the southwest forests and small parcels of forest in  the northwest. The combined state run forests employ over 1.5  million people, have a total population of some 4 million  people, and fixed assets of over 16 billion yuan. Since the  founding of the PRC, state forests have produced for the nation  some 1 billion cubic meters of lumber to ensure the needs of  energy, railroads, disaster relief, major national construction  projects and so forth, and continue to be responsible for the  whole task of providing wood products under the state plan.    However, because forestry districts have not truly  implemented the guidelines of the forestry operations as a basic  policy, because investment in the forestry industry has been  woefully inadequate, and product and industrial structure remain  irrational, the pace of economic development in the state  forestry regions has been slow. At present the following  problems beset the state forestry regions.    1. There is a crisis in harvestable timber resources. For  example, in the Northeast and Inner Mongolian State Forests the  total area of harvestable mature and over-mature timber has  decreased sharply. The area of harvestable mature and  over-mature timber has fallen from a high of 12 million hectares  at the time of Liberation to the present 5 million hectares, a  drop of 53 percent. The reserves of harvestable mature and  over-mature timber have been drastically reduced, from a high of  2 billion cubic meters at Liberation to the present 470 million  cubic meters, a reduction of 76.5 percent. The quality of timber  has also fallen. In the Heilongjiang forest districts, for  instance, the average amount of reserves per hectare has fallen  from a Liberation high of 143.2 cubic meters to the present 90  cubic meter level, a decline of 37.2 percent. The maturity  structure of forests has also declined, middle and young growth  now constitute almost 80 percent of total timber reserves.    At present, the resources of mature and over-mature  timber which can be felled in all of the state run forests  nationwide are quickly being depleted, and continued lumber  production is becoming difficult.    2. Forestry enterprises are in an economic crunch. With  the reduction in harvestable timber resources, lumber production  has fallen year by year, and with other cost increases, in 1990  for the first time the state forests as a whole ran at a loss.  After two increases in the price of lumber, by 1992 some 30.3  percent of the state forest regions were still losing money,  losses amounted to 510 million yuan, definitely an economic  problem. In 1992, some 42 percent of the enterprises in the  state forest regions in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia were  suffering losses to the tune of 400 million yuan. It was very  common for enterprises to withhold and delay the payment of  workers' wages. The Heilongjiang forestry system was some 440  million yuan in arrears for workers' wages; in the Mudanjiang  forest region the average was five months in arrears, with some  enterprises reaching seven months. There was no way for  enterprises to purchase the coal, fuel oils, steel and other  materials needed for production and construction. Work stoppages  and visits to higher authorities occurred.    3. The social burden of enterprises is great. In the past  several years nonoperational expenditures have skyrocketed;  totalling some 1.55 billion yuan in 1992 for the state forest  regions, accounting for 96.9 percent of the year's sales  profits. The Heilongjiang Forestry Industry Main Bureau was a  prime example, with nonoperational expenditures for its  enterprises reaching 760 million yuan, 138 percent of that  year's sales profit. The enterprises historical burden is  extremely heavy. As of 1992 forestry enterprises in the state  forestry regions were in arrears to their welfare funds in the  amount of 1.06 billion yuan.    4. Enterprises have fallen far behind in building production  and social facilities. For example, of the 82 forestry bureaus  established in the Northeast and Inner Mongolian State Forest  Regions, although all have general plans, only two bureaus have  completed construction; all of the others, to one degree or  another, are putting individual phases into production as they  are completed, and have no comprehensive production  capabilities. At present that forest region has 156 final phase  lumber mills which have not been constructed, and almost 90,000  kilometers of road which should be but are not yet built. Living  quarters for the workers are on the average less than four  square meters, and most is unsophisticated housing built in the  1950s and 1960s.    To stimulate economic growth in state forestry regions, we  suggest:    1. Continue reforms; create the conditions in structure and  mechanisms to get the state forestry regions' industrial sector  on the market economy track. In the near future we first must  promote construction and completion of the four lumber industry  conglomerates in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia; then use this  reform as the starting point for comprehensive enhancement of  the forestry industrial sector's overall strength, put to actual  use the sector's internal superiority of mutual support, and the  rational flow and allotment of funds, assets, resources and  labor and other elements of production, which quite possibly  might put life back into the entire sector. Second, we should  comprehensively institute asset management of the state forestry  resources among the Northeast and Inner Mongolian regions'  enterprises, making a true division between their rights of  ownership and their rights of use, and assure recompense for  managing state forests. This will not only solve the problem  of "one big rice bowl" in the state forests, but also possibly  guarantee the continued existence of the forests.    2. Taking the market as the guide, efficiency as the  heart, adjust the industrial structure and the product structure  of the state forest regions. In adjusting these, we must turn to  the international and domestic markets, but do it in light of  the actual conditions in the state forest regions. First we must  set our goals, seek new growth potential for economic expansion.  While not exacerbating the consumption of forest resources,  concentrate investment appropriately, disposing it according to  sector policies and industrial plans, arrange for the  construction of a number of artificial board and paper mills.  Regarding the newly established or expanded forestry regions  responsible for developing forests, we should set up, in  synchronization with these undertakings, timbering and  transportation and in appropriate scale, forestry byproducts and  pulp and paper and related industries. As regards forestry  timbering and transportation facilities being built which  already have the necessary conditions, we can try to restructure  their industrial structure while they are still in the process  of being built.    3. The state must increase investment in forestry  enterprises. This includes increases in potable water in forest  regions, medical facilities, rehabilitation of condemned  buildings, and other noneconomic operational investments;  increases in operational type investments in developing  artificial board plants, paper mills and other large and medium  construction projects. Increase investment in forestry  management, to include use of World Bank loans and other  international financial institutions to speed up the nurturing  of forestry resources.    In addition, funds in the state budget and societal funds  including foreign funds invested in the forestry sector must all  be used for sectorial development. The state should continue to  implement the relevant preferential treatment policies; and  state regulated prices for wood products from the state forest  regions should be deregulated as soon as possible.</p>

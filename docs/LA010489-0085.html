			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Actor David Keith will take on the role of the ultimate Marine -- Oliver North  -- in a TV miniseries scheduled to start next week. Keith, who has played  military-minded characters in "The Lords of Discipline" and "An Officer and a  Gentleman," had to convince producers that he could lose his Tennessee accent  to get the part. The miniseries is based on the biography "Guts and Glory" by  Boston Globe reporter Ben Bradlee Jr. It follows North from his training at the  Naval Academy until his retirement last year in the midst the Iran-Contra  affair. North goes on trial Jan. 31 for his role in the scandal. And how does  Keith view North? "A brave man, a real cowboy," says the actor. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

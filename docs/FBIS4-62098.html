			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Artemenko report from Smolensk: "Smolensk `Electric </F> Bulb' in Belarus Homes"]    [Text] It is a pleasant and rare occasion considering the  days we live in -- a five-year treaty of cooperation between the  Smolensk AES [Atomic Electric Power Station) and the Belorussian  [Belarus] Energy Ministry has been signed.    The document envisions mutually advantageous terms of  technical and material assistance, and the provision of  scientific and technical information.    This event was preceded by another, no less important event  -- a 750-kilovolt power transmission line originating at the  "Belorusskaya" substation at the Smolensk AES was put in  operation.    The 750-kilovolt power transmission line was constructed  jointly by builders and operation personnel of Smolensk's  Desnogorsk and of Belorussia. A large group of builders and  operation personnel of the Smolensk AES were awarded  certificates of honor of Belorussia's Supreme Soviet and the  Ministry of Power Engineering for this successful work.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Oilseed row costly for UK group LAST YEAR'S oilseeds dispute between the US and the EC cost Allied-Lyons, the UK food and drinks group, between Dollars 2m and Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.3m-Pounds 1.96m) in lost profits, the company said yesterday, writes Peter Montagnon. This represents the expense of building up and storing stocks in the US as a precaution against the imposition of sanctions, it said when announcing its results. Among Allied-Lyons' products that would have been hit was Courvoisier cognac. 'Resolution of the Gatt agreement is important to us,' said Mr Michael Jackaman, chairman. Allied-Lyons also hoped that European governments would stop penalising spirits when setting duties on alcohol.</p>

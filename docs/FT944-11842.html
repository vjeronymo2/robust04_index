			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / ANC changes its tune on state sell-offs The African National Congress has been forced into several policy reversals since becoming the leading partner in South Africa's government of national unity, but few of its conversions have been more dramatic than its recent decision to embrace privatisation as a means of generating funds for social development. Only a month after the country's April election, President Nelson Mandela was vowing he would never support a programme that would merely channel more wealth into the hands of the country's white minority. As recently as August, Mr Jay Naidoo, minister in charge of implementing the government's centrepiece reconstruction and development programme, condemned privatisation as a method of 'sacrificing long-term assets for a short-term benefit'. By October, however, in a white paper on the RDP, the government had warmed to the idea of selling 'unproductive state assets' to raise funds for the programme, and last weekend Mr Thabo Mbeki, deputy president, for the first time endorsed privatisation as an integral part of government policy. So far, little attention has been paid to exactly what the government is likely to sell off, what the means of privatisation might be, and just how much revenue is likely to be raised. State assets amount to several hundred billion rands, but likely proceeds from privatisation will only be a small fraction of that. Of the state companies that could be sold off, the net value of those under the authority of the ministry of public enterprises - including electricity utility Eskom, transport conglomerate Transnet, and arms and technology manufacturer Denel - were recently assessed at about R30bn (Pounds 5.3bn) by the government. Adding the state-run telecommunications company Telkom, vast tracts of state-owned land and forest, the post office, public broadcaster SABC and concerns such as the Industrial Development Corporation and state abattoir Abacor, the total realisable assets are probably closer to R50bn. Practical obstacles to readying state companies for privatisation are smaller than expected. The National party government of the late 1980s was also strongly in favour of privatisation; it sold off two companies  - Iscor, the country's largest iron and steel concern, and National Sorghum Breweries, the state brewer of maize-based beers for the black community - before stopping the process in 1991 under pressure from the ANC. Both companies are now regarded as successes. Although Iscor went through a rocky few years shortly after its launch in 1989, it is today the most widely traded share on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and has recently reported excellent results. NSB, meanwhile, which was sold privately to a consortium of black businessmen comprising largely the company's employees and distributors, became the first high-profile, black-owned business in the country. But while it stopped its privatisation programme, the previous government placed nearly all other public companies, such as Telkom, Denel, and Transnet on a commercial footing, making them fully accountable and under the control of appointed boards of directors. 'Unlike most of eastern Europe, where many state companies suffered from poor management and it was almost impossible to assess their assets, this is not a problem here,' observes Mr Mark Katzenellenbogen, of merchant bankers S G Warburg. Just as attractive for the government as raising money is the possibility of increasing the general stock of black wealth in the country by ensuring that some of the benefits of privatisation accrue to the black community. The government is almost certain to utilise a variant of the voucher schemes employed in eastern Europe or parts of Latin America, whereby citizens are allocated shares in privatised companies which they can either hold as investments or use as collateral. But although the markets may be hoping that privatisation will begin with a bang, preferably by putting a big corporation on the block and using the share offering to raise South Africa's profile in international markets, many in the ANC are still concerned that this would jeopardise the RDP's aims of developing poorer areas. As a result, the early offerings will probably be relatively small and are unlikely to garner significant international interest. The first sizeable operations to be sold off will probably be Denel and the domestic operations of South African Airways, now part of Transnet. Neither are seen as politically critical to the RDP and both already operate on a sound commercial footing. But even if giants like Eskom and Telkom do not come on the market immediately, most analysts are convinced it is just a question of when, not if, the ANC-led administration will give ground. As one observer says: 'The simple fact is the government needs the money.'</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ISSUES IN NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOL BOARD ELECTION  </P> <P> Tuesday's contest for the Newport-Mesa Board of Education has ignited a flame  of fear in me, for at issue is the smoldering threat of "censorship" promised  by a group of extremist-minded candidates supported by groups whose sponsoring  names belie their motives: Traditional Values Coalition, Citizens for  Excellence in Education and Eagle Forum, to name a few.  </P> <P> Keep in mind that the sole purpose of these organizations is to foist on the  majority their minority views within the classroom in an attempt to mold  children, all children, in their image.  </P> <P> The tactic is classic censorship via the political process. All of us parents  should be mortified at the prospect that the narrow convictions of a relatively  few politically active (and well-financed) fundamentalists may predominate at  the policy-setting level of our public schools.  </P> <P> If the challengers fear information, information that has been professionally  and sensitively proffered in our science and social studies classrooms, then  they have no business making the policy decisions that will affect the future  of my child.  </P> <P> Information is power, the power to grow, to become educated, to make cogent  decisions, to function. Censorship is insidious, undermining, retarding.  </P> <P> RICHARD V. SIMON  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

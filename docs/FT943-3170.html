			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy Yesterday's UK inflation and unemployment data prompted the initial conclusion that Monday's base rate rise was not a pre-emptive strike after all. A closer look, though, reveals scant evidence that inflation is already taking off. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices is still lower than it was in June. The increase in average manufacturing earnings is decelerating and unit labour costs are falling. Retailers may be trying again to move away from discounting, but against the background of softening consumer confidence it is difficult to be sure that higher prices of clothing and footwear will stick. The markets thus have no obvious ground to conclude that a first base rate rise need be quickly followed by a second. That is small consolation for the equity market which was looking over-valued after its summer rally. It must now adjust to a more modest earnings prospect for 1995, because higher base rates will ensure a slowdown in demand if the recovery does not falter of its own accord. Where yesterday's reaction does look overdone, at least from a purely domestic perspective, is in the gilts market. The snag is that gilts remain coupled to the international trend. Yesterday's fall of more than one point at the long end was also a reflection of fresh worries about the interest rate trend in Germany. In this uncertain climate, there is not much scope for the yield gap between the two markets to narrow much beyond its present 150 basis points. But it will compound the problem for equities if gilts slip further as a result of developments on the continent.</p>

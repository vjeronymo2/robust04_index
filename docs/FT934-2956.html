			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Exploration pays golden dividend for Ashanti Ghana's Ashanti Goldfields, after more than 100 years of operation during which it has produced in excess 21m troy ounces of gold, is poised for a substantial expansion, according to Mr Sam Jonah, the company's managing director. He says that this probably makes Ashanti unique in the gold mining world and that 'there is no reason why this mine should not go on producing 1m ounces a year for the next 50 years, particularly now we have an aggressive exploration programme for the first time in our history'. The company's USDollars 300m, four-year expansion programme is already ahead of schedule to take annual output - which dwindled to only 220,000 ounces in 1987 but rebounded to a record 765,250 ounces in 1992-93 - to more than 1m ounces by 1996. That would place Ashanti among the world's top ten gold producers. The recent boost to exploration efforts has paid off handsomely. A number of new and promising gold deposits have been located within the company's concession area, about 180 miles north of Accra, the capital, including one called Bekansi that already has an identified potential resource of some 32,000 ounces of gold but continues across the western border of the company's concession of 200,000 square kilometres. Ashanti has applied to the Mining Ministry for a licence to extend its operations on to the adjoining concession - which would add another 169,000 square kilometres for it to explore. The company is hopeful that the licence will be granted in the middle of next month, just ahead of its flotation on the London and Ghana stock exchanges early next year. Mr Joe Amanor, Ashanti's chief geologist, suggests that, as well as having about 21m ounces of gold in reserves of various categories, Ashanti's potential resources are at least 31m ounces and possibly as much as 50m. Since 1969 Ashanti has been jointly owned by the Ghanaian government, with a 55 per cent stake, and Lonrho, the London-based conglomerate that also manages the mine. The government hopes to raise about USDollars 250m by selling 25 per cent of Ashanti. Lonrho says, however, that as mining is one of its core businesses it has no intention of selling a single share. Mr Jonah makes it clear that, once Ashanti gains more financial flexibility via the flotation, it intends to become much more like a traditional mining house by developing operations both elsewhere in Ghana and also beyond its borders. Its ownership has forced Ashanti to raise loans for expansion - a banking consortium lead by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, put up Dollars 140m towards the present programme - and Mr Jonah suggests that this has 'shackled' the company financially. 'Banks are not very willing to grant loans against assets on which other banks have prior charges,' he explains. Nevertheless, Ashanti is sitting on one of the richest and highest-grade gold deposits in the world and this has enabled it to remain highly profitable and to pay dividends. The 1992-93 profit is still be audited and adjusted for the flotation by auditors Price Waterhouse, but the trend is clear. Accounts drawn up for the year to September on the same basis as those for the previous 12 months would show a net profit of about 65bn cedis (Dollars 109m) against 27.2bn cedis the previous year. Mr Jonah points out that the expansion programme is allowing Ashanti to mine ore of a lower grade (rock with less gold per tonne in it). 'We are concentrating on volume and on keeping the cost per tonne down.' Consequently, even though Ashanti is mining lower-grade ore, its cash costs, which were above Dollars 200 an ounce before the expansion started, should average Dollars 175 for the next few years, placing the company among the world's lowest-cost gold miners.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Hopes rise for Mideast talks PALESTINIANS indicated yesterday that they were close to a decision on resuming Middle East peace talks in Washington. Mr Faisal al-Husseini, who is likely to head the Palestinian delegation, said in Cairo that he expected to receive shortly a further statement from the US and Israel which would permit the talks to go ahead, probably on April 27. The Palestinian delegation had earlier refused to accept the US invitation to return to the negotiating table today, because the response to its demands had been 'ambiguous'. Mr Husseini said that some of its requests had been answered clearly, 'but others were answered in an ambiguous way and on others it was not clear if they were real answers or were just an attempt to calm us down'. Mr Farouk al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, said on Sunday that the other three Arab delegations would not attend negotiations with Israel until Palestinian objections had been resolved. The issues centre on Israel's unwillingness to accelerate the return of nearly 400 Palestinians expelled to south Lebanon in mid-December, and restrictions placed on workers crossing into Israel from the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Saudi Arabia yesterday also sought to encourage a positive Palestinian decision by offering to resume the financial support to the Palestine Liberation Organisation which was cut off during the Gulf war.</p>

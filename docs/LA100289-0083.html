			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME GRAPE CROPS IN STATE DAMAGED BY HEAVY RAINS  </P> <P> The wine grape harvest in California's north coast is either a disaster or one  of the best on record, depending on where the winery is located or the grape  variety.  </P> <P> Until mid-September, a long, cool growing season -- which roughly lasts from  spring to fall -- had led agricultural experts to estimate that grapes on the  vine would be 40% to 50% higher in tonnage than last year with exceptionally  high quality. But heavy rains, which water down the grapes' flavor and rot the  fruit on the vine, fell in three small waves in the last half of September,  leaving grape vines in some areas extremely damaged with rot but others  essentially unscathed.  </P> <P> The first rain, on Sept. 15, delayed the maturing of the grapes. Rain hit on  the same date in 1986, but that year the rain stopped for the next month and  the harvest proceeded on schedule. But this year, two additional storms dumped  more than 2 inches of rain on the region and accelerated the rot problem.  </P> <P> Andy Beckstoffer, one of the north coast's largest growers, said damage from  rot depends on the region and the grape variety.  </P> <P> In the Napa Valley, from St. Helena south through the Carneros region that  butts up against San Pablo Bay, he said, the Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc  varieties were hardest hit.  </P> <P> Richard Arrowood, wine maker at Chateau St. Jean in Sonoma Valley, said the  Alexander Valley in northern Sonoma County suffered, but there was much less  damage in the Sonoma Valley to the south.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hard to Estimate  </P> <P> However, wine makers in some regions -- notably those whose vineyards are  planted on mountainsides -- experienced far fewer problems. "For me, it was one  of the best vintages we've ever had," Stu Smith, owner of Smith-Madrone Winery  on Spring Mountain overlooking the Napa Valley, said. He said his Cabernet  Sauvignon grapes needed some rain, and "we have good drainage, so we actually  benefited from it."  </P> <P> The rains have created delays but few losses so far for grape growers in the  central valley who were a little farther along in harvesting their grapes.  Robert Cabral of Escalon said he is a week to 10 days behind because of the  rains. "I still have half of mine to go. We'll finish up this week. The quality  of black grapes is holding up pretty good. We're not worried too much," he said  Sunday.  </P> <P> Other growers, such as Bruce A. Mettler of Lodi, beat the rains. Mike Henry of  the California Farm Bureau said central valley grape growers are not likely to  sustain "major losses" as are their counterparts, particularly in Medocino and  Sonoma.  </P> <P> It's hard to fix a dollar loss for the 1989 harvest, experts say. If the grape  crop had been significantly larger than last year, spot prices for grapes would  have dropped. With the crop now expected not to be much larger than last year,  prices may not drop, reflecting the smaller amount of grapes available.  </P> <P> One estimate that the net loss to growers in Sonoma and Mendocino counties  could reach $30 million was questioned by Beckstoffer, who said his ranches in  the Mendocino County area were mostly picked before the second -- and most  damaging -- rain fell in the third week of September.  </P> <P> "We came out of it very well," he said. "When the rain hit in Mendocino, our  grapes had already reached the right sugar, so we could pick. But some folks in  Napa had to wait, and there will be some losses there."  </P> <P> By this past weekend, most of the Cabernet in the Napa Valley was still on the  vine, "and most of it looks beautiful," Beckstoffer said. "Some vineyards were  helped by the rain."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Less Than Expected  </P> <P> He said his company was supposed to deliver 3,000 tons of Chardonnay, "which is  significantly up from last year, and we will deliver 2,700 tons, which is still  well above last year."  </P> <P> The biggest disappointment for growers, said Beckstoffer, is simply that a  month ago they anticipated a huge crop worth a lot of money. "Now it's only  going to be a good-sized crop, so the big surplus that we anticipated is over."  </P> <P> In Lake County, most vineyards were harvested before the rains hit, according  to Derek Holstein, wine maker for Guenoc Winery. And south of San Francisco, in  Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties, little rain fell, and  crop size and quality were reported high.  </P></p>

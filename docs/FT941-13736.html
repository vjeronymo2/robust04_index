			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / International Company News: Kellogg lifts fourth-quarter earnings Kellogg, the US maker of ready-to-eat cereals, overcame the competitive threat from unbranded rivals and increased net profits by 17 per cent to Dollars 149.9m in its fourth quarter. Earnings per share rose by 22 per cent to 66 cents. However, the quarter's performance outshone the full year's. Net income of Dollars 680.7m in 1993 was slightly below the previous year's Dollars 682.8m (the latter figure excluding the effect of accounting changes). But Kellogg said that if all unusual gains and losses were excluded from the figures, net income would have been 6 per cent ahead. Mr Arnold Langbo, chairman and chief executive, said the results had been achieved amid unprecedented competitive activity, difficult recessionary conditions in several important markets, and unfavourable currency exchange rates. Sales volumes of ready-to-eat cereals continued to grow during the year, particularly during the fourth quarter, Mr Langbo said. But he warned that the growth pattern shown in the fourth quarter was not necessarily a good guide to long-term performance. 'Our advertising and promotion investment rose during the fourth quarter due to extremely competitive conditions in the US and a high level of marketing activity internationally,' he explained. 'We see no let-up in competitive intensity in 1994. We are committed to meeting all competitive challenges, but hope to moderate promotional spending in the US.' In the fourth quarter Kellogg authorised further share buy-backs of Dollars 300m this year.</p>

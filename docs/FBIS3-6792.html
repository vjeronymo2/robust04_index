			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 22 (YONHAP) -- A North Korean Army  sergeant who defected to the South last week said on Tuesday  that the People's Army has bio-chemical weapons so toxic that  they may kill or paralyze the whole 40 million South Korean  people in the event of war.    Sfc. Yi Chung-kuk formerly of a North Korean CBR (chemical,  biological and radiological warfare) unit told a press  conference in Seoul that North Korea mass-produced bio-chemical  weapons developed by the medical school of Kim Il-song  University and People's Army Medical College.    "I heard laboratories tested newly developed bio-chemical  weapons on living bodies of political prisoners," Yi said.    "It was also said that in an area near Chagang Province  where  a chemical plant is located, many nearby people suffered serious  headache and pregnant women gave birth to deformed babies due to  the leak of toxic substance in June last year."    He said high North Korean military officers used to  encourage  soldiers by saying that they had nothing to fear because the  People's Army possesses nuclear arms.    Yi said he learned that North Korean officers trained at  Soviet military academies cannot be promoted to general since a  coup attempt by those taught at military academies in the former  USSR was uncovered in October 1992.    About his defection, Yi said he left his home in Pyongyang  on  last Nov. 9 and smuggled himself to Yanji in northeastern China.  He could come to South Korea through a third country with the  help of ethnic Koreans in Yanji, he said.    Yi said that in the People's Army he served as a calculator  at the "counter-nuclear and -atomic analysis center" of nuclear  and chemical defense bureau of the People's Army General Staff.    The duty of the analysis center is to assess a contaminated  area, wind direction and other data in case CBR weapons are used  in war and distribute the data obtained to all People's Army  units, he said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the basis of a collection by Wilhelm Hillebrand, C.B. Clarke (1883) described  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra polyantha, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  choosing the specific epithet to refer to the many-flowered clusters (St. John 1966). A description of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. triflora <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by Hillebrand (1888) is believed to be, in part, a description of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. polyantha <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra polyantha, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a member of the African violet family, is an unbranched or few-branched shrub 3 to 10 ft (1 to 3 m) in height. Its leathery, elliptic, unequal leaves are 2 to 6.3 in (5 to 16 cm) long and 0.7 to 2 in (1.8 to 5.2 cm) wide and attached oppositely along the stems. The upper surface of the leaves is conspicuously wrinkled and usually hairless, with the lower surface moderately to densely covered with pale brown hairs. Seven to 12 flowers are grouped in branched clusters in the leaf axils. The white petals, fused to form a cylindrical tube about 0.5 in (12 mm) long, emerge from a radially symmetrical calyx, 0.2 in (5 mm) long, that is cleft from one-half to two-thirds its length. Each calyx lobe, narrowly triangular in shape, is sparsely hairy on the outside and hairless within. The fruits are white oval berries about 0.6 in (1.6 cm) long that contain many seeds about 0.02 in (0.5 mm) long.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra polyantha <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is distinguished from other species in the genus by the texture and hairiness of the leaf surfaces and the length, shape, and degree of cleft of the calyx. This species differs from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. crenata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by the lack of short-stalked glands and by its leathery leaves, opposite leaf arrangement, and radially symmetrical calyx (Clarke 1883, St. John 1966, Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra polyantha <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was known from the Kalihi region and from Kulepiamoa Ridge above Niu Valley on the leeward (southwest) side of the southern Koolau Mountains (HHP 1991d2, 1991d3; St. John 1966). Two populations, located farther south on Kuliouou summit ridge and at the northwest head of Hahaione Valley (HHP 1991d1, 1991d4), are approximately 1 mi (1.6 km) apart on private and State land. One of the populations has not been visited within the past 50 years; it is not known how many individuals remain. The most recently observed population, last seen in 1953, consists of one individual. The total number of extant individuals is not known, although only a few are believed to remain on ridges of disturbed mesic valleys in 'ohi'a forests at elevations between 1,600 to 2,000 ft (490 and 610 m) (HHP 1991d1, 1991d2, 1991d4).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra polyantha <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  probably grows in association with 'uki, uluhe,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Broussaisia arguta <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (kanawao),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coprosma foliosa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (pilo), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Psychotria <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (kopiko), taxa commonly found in the  <!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;ohi <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;a-dominated forests of the Koolau Mountains (S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). The primary threat to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. polyantha <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of remaining individuals and their restricted distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eugenia koolauensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was first described by Otto Degener (1932b) from a specimen that he and K.K. Park collected from Kaipapau Valley in the Koolau Mountains; it is named after its type locality. In 1957, Kenneth Wilson and Joseph Rock described a new species,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. molokaiensis, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  based upon a collection made by Rock in 1918 from Maunaloa on the island of Molokai (Wilson 1957). Current classification synonymizes the two species (Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eugenia koolauensis, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a member of the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), is a small tree or shrub between 7 and 23 ft (2 and 7 m) tall with branch tips covered with dense brown hairs. The leathery, oval or elliptic leaves, 0.8 to 2 in (2 to 5 cm) long and 0.4 to 1.3 in (1 to 3.3 cm) wide, are densely hairy on the lower surface and have margins that curve under the leaves. One or two flowers grow from the leaf axils on stalks 0.04 to 0.3 in (1 to 8 mm) long. The hypanthium (basal portion of the flower) is cone-shaped, about 0.1 in (3 mm) long, and hairy. The four sepals of unequal length that comprise the hypanthium are attached to a circular nectary disk (fleshy, nectar-producing structure). The four white petals, which are oval or elliptic and 0.2 to 0.3 in (4 to 8 mm) long, enclose numerous white stamens and are also attached to the nectary disk. The fruits are fleshy, yellow to red, oval berries, 0.3 to 0.8 in (0.8 to 2 cm) long, that usually contain one round seed.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eugenia koolauensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is one of two species in the genus that are native to Hawaii. It differs from the other species in having leaves that are densely hairy on the lower surface and leaf margins that curve under the leaves (Degener 1932b, Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990, Wilson 1957).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

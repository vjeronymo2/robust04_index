			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: No fat, cosy system protecting banking sector in the UK Sir, Robert Peston's article on the Bank of England's aid to UK banks was most interesting ('Silent launch of the lifeboat', October 19). However, I found his conclusion perplexing. He argues that, although system stability has been maintained, it came at a heavy cost, in terms both of the bail-outs he mentioned and of market inefficiencies caused by perpetuating the widespread belief that the Bank prefers to support banks rather than allow the market to sort the weak from the strong. I doubt it is true that the moral hazard cost has been a high one, but it is virtually impossible to prove either way. However, the idea that we have a fat, cosy system where the incompetent are protected is simply not true. In the past few years we have seen numerous banks closing, being forced out of the market and, in the case of BCCI, collapsing with enormous creditor losses. We have seen runs on deposits at building societies, financial institutions being forced to merge and volumes of loan losses at both big and small banks never before experienced. Apart from setting the tumbrils rolling though the City of London depositing (no pun intended) bankers at Traitors' Gate, I cannot see what further could demonstrate a competitive system with at times systemic risk. Even if it were true that the cost of moral hazard were high, I cannot see how setting up a separate supervisory institution would solve the problem. It would he expensive and, because the new institution would find it difficult to attract personnel of the same quality as the current Bank of England intake, would result in a decline in the efficacy of supervision. Losing the dignity bestowed by the Old Lady, the supervisors would join the ranks of yet another industry 'watchdog'. (What about Ofbalance to join the ranks of Oftel and Ofgas?) I note that those who recommend such a change and cite other countries where a dual system exists rarely mention the Nordic countries. I do not claim there is a direct connection, but the staggering losses suffered by banks in Norway, Sweden and Finland, and the huge sums the governments have had to provide to support these banks, do not a priori make a strong case for converting to such a system. Indeed, these countries now, in effect, have a triple system; they have had to create a third agency to monitor the doling out of the money. While splitting off the supervisory side would make the life of the governor easier, it has little merit, and commentators should concentrate on the issue of safeguarding the independence of the Bank of England, which is a much more serious matter.

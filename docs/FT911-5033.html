			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Hawker wins significant work for new Boeing HAWKER SIDDELEY, the diversified engineering group, has become the second British company to win a significant order to manufacture components for the Boeing 777 wide bodied aircraft. HS will today announce it has won an order worth about Pounds 90m to manufacture flaps for the tail section of the 777, which is due to come into service from 1995. This follows the announcement last week that Smiths Industries, the aerospace and medical equipment group, had won orders worth about Pounds 337m for computer systems to manage the aircraft's fuel and electrical power systems. The Boeing order comes as HS is beset by rumours that it may become a candidate for a take-over bid from either BTR or Hanson, the industrial conglomerates. HS last month reported a 30 per cent fall in pre-tax profits after exceptional items. The elevator flaps will be manufactured by HS's Australian aerospace subsidiary, Hawker de Havilland, which is a long-standing supplier of wing flaps to Boeing. The deal is an important boost for the HS aerospace division, which last year increased profits by 20 per cent to Pounds 22m, on a 10 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 297m, about 14 per cent of the HS group sales.</p>

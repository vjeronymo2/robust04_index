			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Turner Broadcasting will appeal the $9.75 million awarded to actor Timothy  Hutton by a jury that decided MGM deceived him about the cancellation of the  1983 film "Roadshow." The MGM film library is now owned by Turner Broadcasting  and Turner is responsible for certain liabilities associated with past MGM film  projects, including Hutton's, said Turner attorney Anne Grupp. Turner officials  "are extremely surprised and disappointed in the verdict," Steve Korn, vice  president and general counsel at Turner Broadcasting in Atlanta said in a  prepared statement. "We think it is unjustified and will be overturned in  future legal proceedings in the case." Hutton's attorney James Tierney said,  "They have a legal right to appeal," but added that he had not received any  official notification of an appeal but was confident that the case could  withstand a challenge in a higher court. "The jury found, as a fact, that Mr.  Hutton was defrauded by MGM and questions of fact are rarely overturned."  Hutton, an Oscar-winning actor for the 1980 film "Ordinary People," was awarded  $2.25 million in compensatory damages and $7.5 million in punitive damages  Friday by a Superior Court jury that found MGM committed fraud and breach of  contract. Hutton also claimed MGM deprived him of other possible roles by  failing to tell him of its decision for several months. The suit charged that  studio executives told Hutton the modern-day Western was being terminated  because film director, Richard Brooks, had suffered a heart attack. But the  actor contended that MGM lost interest in the movie after a change of  management. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ESCALANTE WILL STILL STAND AND DELIVER AT GARFIELD  </P> <P> Famous calculus instructor Jaime Escalante has changed his mind about leaving  Garfield High School and will continue teaching there for at least two more  years.  </P> <P> Escalante, who said three weeks ago he would resign from the school, possibly  as early as June, said Friday he had a change of heart after meeting with  school district officials and receiving more than 500 letters and calls from  former students and concerned community members.  </P> <P> "Everything is cool now," the 59-year-old Escalante said in an interview. "For  the time being, I will stay here. This is where I belong and the kids  appreciate what I do."  </P> <P> Escalante, whose success at teaching calculus to inner-city Latino students at  the East Los Angeles school inspired the 1988 movie "Stand and Deliver," had  announced he would leave Garfield because of frustration with parents who do  not value academic achievement, as well as lack of recognition from other  teachers and inadequate administrative support.  </P> <P> "All those things accumulated, and I decided it was time to pack my bags and be  on my way," said Escalante, who has taught in the Los Angeles Unified School  District for 16 years.  </P> <P> Garfield Principal Maria Elena Tostado said she is "happy he is staying."  </P> <P> A key factor in his decision to stay at Garfield, Escalante said, was his  supervision of a National Science Foundation program at East Los Angeles  College, which draws about 1,000 students every year. The program teaches  mainly low-income Latino students accelerated mathematics, science and English,  and also trains teachers in Escalante's methods.  </P> <P> "If I left, I couldn't do the program," he said, adding that 85% of its  students "are from East L.A., mainly from Garfield. If I left the school, I  would loose my recruitment network and I would have to give preference to my  new job."  </P> <P> The Bolivian-born educator is finishing the first year of a three-year contract  for the program at the college and said he does not feel it is right to leave  now. "But I cannot predict what will happen" once that commitment is fulfilled,  he said.  </P> <P> Escalante said he had received a number of job offers in the past three weeks,  including teaching positions at USC and Pasadena City College, as well as  several offers from private businesses. President Bush and Gov. George  Deukmejian also offered him unspecified federal or state jobs involved with  education, he said.  </P></p>

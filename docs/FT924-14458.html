			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses extend recovery BOURSES extended their recovery from Monday's setback, the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index ending less than 1 per cent below last Friday's level, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN ended broadly higher in active trading as hopes that the capital gains tax might be abolished for at least a year prompted a wave of buying. The Comit index rose 12.54 or 3.4 per cent to 382.47 in turnover estimated at more than Wednesday's L131bn. The market was cheered by news in the morning that the Senate finance committee had approved a measure that would abolish the capital gains tax until September next year. The measure still needs the approval of the full Senate. Among blue chips, Fiat jumped 2.5 per cent or L95 to L3,850 while Generali added 3.6 per cent or L950 to L27,350. Trading in Italcementi and Italmobiliare resumed after Wednesday's suspension. Italcementi rose L790 from Tuesday's close to L7,180 while Italmobiliare added L1,500 to L31,500. PARIS continued to rise on bargain-hunting but turnover was considerably lower at FFr1.98bn. The CAC-40 index added 19.71 or 1.2 per cent to 1,673.86. Trading was dominated by Hachette, Printemps and Michelin. Hachette jumped FFr16.80 or 11.8 per cent to FFr158.70 on speculation that rival media group Havas was building a stake. Michelin dropped FFr6.30 to FFr175.50 on reports that Morgan Stanley had cut its earnings estimates. Paribas steadied after Wednesday's fall, closing 80 centimes better at FFr279.10 but Ciments Francais B shares dropped FFr45 or 13.2 per cent to FFr295 on worries about the losses at the cement company. FRANKFURT extended its recovery as the DAX index rose 15.07 to 1,451.12. Dealers gave carmakers some respite after their recent downgrading and, relatively speaking, reserved judgment instead on the big three chemical stocks. The German chemicals association said yesterday that corporate earnings have dropped more than 30 per cent in the year to date and added that no end to the downturn is in sight. Bayer fell DM1.40 to DM253, although BASF rose DM1 to DM208.50 and Hoechst DM2.20 to DM221.40. Volkswagen led a carmakers' recovery with a rise of DM6.40 to DM259.30. Hoare Govett put VW among its principal buy recommendations this week, saying that recent downgradings had been extreme and that it was holding to earnings forecasts for VW of DM37 in 1992 and DM38 in 1993 against DM36 last year. AMSTERDAM saw buying in Heineken inspired by a newspaper report, denied by the brewer, that Philip Morris of the US was interested in taking over the group. The shares rose Fl 4.10 or 2.4 per cent to Fl 171.70 as the CBS Tendency index advanced 0.7 to 108.5. Nijverdal-Ten Cate, the plastics and textile manufacturer, dropped Fl 9.50 to Fl 86.50 after forecasting unchanged 1992 earnings, having said in August that profits would rise by some 10 per cent. Elsevier closed down Fl 1.90 at Fl 105.70 but off the day's low of Fl 102.0 on reports, later denied, that it had reduced its growth forecasts for academic publishing. ZURICH transferred its attentions to industrials, as banks eased on profit-taking. The SMI index put on 12.1 to 1,870.3, chemicals led the industrial sector higher with Ciba bearers SFr7 firmer at SFr632 and UBS bearers, SFr1 easier at SFr789, topped the active list. MADRID added another 5.91 points in the general index to 192.71. Mr Victor Galliano of Baring Securities said that buyers were being tempted back into the market by the low share prices following the peseta devaluation and the imposition of currency controls. STOCKHOLM saw continued weakness in Volvo, partly because of the effects of weaker currencies in some of its European markets. The Affarsvarlden index lost 2.4 to 653.1 in light turnover of SKr387m. Volvo B declined SKr6 to SKr204. SKF B gained SKr2 to SKr72.50 on news that the roller bearing group is selling an 80 per cent stake in a tool manufacturer to Sandvik Coromant.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - OCT 8  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Hourly changes   Open   11.30am   12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     4 pm     close  983.87   986.93   986.51   985.15   985.87   986.26   985.85   986.33  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High  987.29            Day's Low  983.87  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      Oct 7         Oct 6        Oct 5         Oct 2         Oct 1     971.05        954.29       937.42        993.56        1006.01  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

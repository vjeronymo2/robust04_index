			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Amnesty in rights call for indigenes INDIGENOUS people suffer grave human rights abuses including massacre and torture in more than 70 countries, Amnesty International said yesterday, Reuter reports. 'They have been massacred and terrorised, forced from their ancestral lands, caught up in bitter civil conflicts, and left without redress for the abuses they suffer,' the London-based human rights organisation said. The United Nations has designated this year as International Year of the World's Indigenous People, and will hold a UN conference on human rights in Vienna in June. But for the 300m indigenes from Vietnam to the US threatened by rights abuses, this may not be enough, the Amnesty report said. 'Unless the international community acts urgently there is a danger the UN's International Year will. . . pass without significant progress towards protecting indigenous people,' it said. These people are often caught up in the crossfire between government troops and armed opposition groups, the group said. In Peru, indigenous people have suffered torture and killing on a massive scale. Security forces killed villagers from several small communities in September 1990 because they refused to join civil defence patrols. 'Cases like this, where those guilty of killing, abducting and torturing indigenous peoples are shielded from justice, are common in many countries around the world,' Amnesty said. Human rights abuses in Bangladesh, India and Sudan were also cited in the report. In Brazil, an Indian leader was shot dead last December because he opposed logging operations inside indigenous areas. His killer was identified but not arrested. Last April scores of tribal villagers in Bangladesh were reportedly shot dead by armed civilians and paramilitaries who had set fire to their homes. Babies were snatched from their mothers' arms and thrown into the flames, Amnesty said. Indigenous people were tortured or killed by hired gunmen for their lands and this was often done with the tacit support of the authorities, the report said. But it was not only third world countries which were criticised in the report. Aborigines in Australia were arrested at a rate 29 times higher than that of other Australians, and reports of police harassment were widespread.</p>

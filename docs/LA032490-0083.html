			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EBY NEEDS NO ADVICE TO COMPLETE 6-2 WIN OVER THOUSAND OAKS  </P> <P> Don't bother Mike Eby when he's on the mound. Just let him pitch.  </P> <P> Eby, a senior left-hander for Westlake High, didn't appreciate Coach Rich  Herrera's visit in the bottom of the seventh inning of a Marmonte League game  at Thousand Oaks on Friday.  </P> <P> And Herrera didn't appreciate his 6-foot-2 pitcher not appreciating it.  </P> <P> Without anyone's advice, Eby had coasted for six innings as Westlake built a  four-run lead. But when Eby walked Bryan Corey on five pitches to begin the  seventh, Herrera went to the mound and an exchange of clearly audible  expletives ensued.  </P> <P> Eby, in effect, told Herrera to beat it. Herrera, not in so many four-letter  words, told Eby to shut up and throw strikes.  </P> <P> Eby did. Six pitches later, after a double play and a game-ending popup, Eby  (3-0) had what he wanted: his third complete-game victory as Westlake (9-0, 3-0  in league play) moved into sole possession of first place with a 6-2 win.  </P> <P> Shuffling a changeup and curve, Eby dealt Thousand Oaks (5-1, 2-1) its first  loss with a three-hitter. He worked rapidly, making only 86 pitches. He struck  out three and walked three.  </P> <P> "I wasn't trying to give (Herrera) lip," Eby said. "I just wanted to tell him  that I know what my job is and I'm going to throw strikes. I was throwing  strikes for six innings. I must have been doing something right."  </P> <P> Said Herrera: "He didn't want me out there. It's like he gets in a groove and I  might have gotten in his way."  </P> <P> Eight times Eby needed only one pitch to retire a batter. His only mistake was  a high fastball to Lance Martin, who drove it over the center-field fence in  the second for his second homer of the year.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks scored its other run in the third on a throwing error by Westlake  second baseman Rick Wolters that allowed Brian Capella to dash home from  second.  </P> <P> "He has great control of his pitches," said Martin, who was one for two with a  walk. "He had control of everything he threw."  </P> <P> Westlake tagged three Thousand Oaks pitchers for 11 hits, including six off  starter Scott Barkman (2-1), who gave up four runs.  </P> <P> Westlake scored a run in the first on a leadoff triple by Rob Neal and a single  by Tim Falsken. Run-scoring singles by Sean Howard and Keenan McAluney keyed a  three-run fourth inning. In the fifth, Keith Hess hit a two-run home run off  reliever Mike Lee.  </P></p>

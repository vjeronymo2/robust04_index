			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRETZKY SCORES TWICE, BUT OILERS COME BACK TO GAIN A 6-5 VICTORY  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky had two of the Kings' goals as they played even-up through two  periods, but his former teammates, the Edmonton Oilers, typically jumped on  every opportunity down the stretch to come away with a 6-5 victory before a  sellout crowd of 16,005 at the Forum Saturday night.  </P> <P> It was a spirited game between teams that played to a standoff in their eight  Smythe Division games last season and then battled to the end before the Kings  eliminated the then Stanley Cup defending champions from the playoffs, winning  an emotional come-from-behind seven-game series.  </P> <P> Edmonton Coach John Muckler said: "I thought L.A. played pretty well. It was  like a playoff game. I don't think L.A. can play any harder."  </P> <P> The Oilers played hard, too, paying no special heed to Gretzky or his pursuit  of the National Hockey League's all-time scoring record.  </P> <P> The emotion of the big trade is starting to fade.  </P> <P> "If anything, they're worrying less about me," Gretzky said. "I'm worrying less  about them, too. Both of us are more and more comfortable. We're just playing  the game."  </P> <P> Gretzky had trouble scoring a goal against his former teammates last season,  not getting his first goal against the Oilers until the sixth game the teams  played, in March.  </P> <P> Not so Saturday night. He got into the spirit of his record chase, those orange  and blue sweaters giving him no pause.  </P> <P> Gretzky's two goals against the Oilers were his first two of the season, adding  two more points to his career total -- which is now 11 from being the all-time  record in the National Hockey League.  </P> <P> Gretzky has a total of 1,840 points and is closing fast on the total of 1,850  that Gordie Howe set during 25 years in the NHL.  </P> <P> Luc Robitaille, who had a goal and two assists Saturday night, said the team is  not distracted by the knowledge that everyone is watching and counting  Gretzky's points.  </P> <P> "There would be more pressure if it was at the end of the season and he had 92  goals or if he was trying to keep one of his big scoring streaks alive,"  Robitaille said. "Then you would have to want him to have the goals. But 11  points? He's going to get those points. The only question is when."  </P> <P> Robitialle assisted on Gretzky's first goal, making the pass for the shot that  scooted under the stick of Oiler goalie Bill Ranford, who has replaced Grant  Fuhr since his emergency appendectomy.  </P> <P> That first goal, midway through the first period, gave the Kings a brief lead.  </P> <P> Only 31 seconds later, Kevin McClelland stole the puck from Marty McSorley and  carried the puck back toward the Kings' goal. Kelly Hrudey came out to meet  him, but McClelland fired the puck right past him to tie the score.  </P> <P> Gretzky scored his second goal 1 minute 7 seconds into the second period,  taking advantage of the power play with Oiler defenseman Kevin Lowe still in  the penalty box for a holding penalty at the end of the first period.  </P> <P> The Oilers were about to clear the puck out of their zone when Bob Kudelski  dived to the ice as if he were trying to cover a fumbled football. His body  deflected the puck out to John Tonelli, who sent it across the ice to where  Gretzky was waiting near the left post. Gretzky stopped the pass on his  backhand side, turned, took aim and put a forehand shot past Ranford.  </P> <P> Craig MacTavish tied it for the Oilers again at 4:33 of the second, racing up  the left side, passing across to Jari Kurri and then getting the puck back from  Kurri for the shot.  </P> <P> Bernie Nicholls put the Kings back on top, 3-2, with his first goal of the  season, scoring on a power play off a centering pass from Robitaille, who  waited until the split second before he crossed the goal line to make the pass,  letting Ranford think he was going around behind the net before making the  perfect pass back to Nicholls.  </P> <P> Soon after that, momentum took a turn toward Edmonton.  </P> <P> Sixteen seconds before the Kings could get out of the second period with the  lead, Mark Messier beat Hrudey to the puck and poked it into the net. Hrudey  had gone to his knees to stop a long shot by Lowe. The puck was sitting in a  dangerous spot on the rebound, so Hrudey was scrambling to push it away when  Messier pounced on it to tie the score at 3-3.  </P> <P> Gretzky's linemate in his Oiler days, Kurri, got the goal that put the Oilers  up, 4-3, early in the third period, scoring only nine seconds into a two-man  advantage.  </P> <P> Then a flurry of three goals in less than a minute left the Kings trailing by  two.  </P> <P> It was a bad stretch for the Kings, starting with a bad decision by Ken  Baumgartner.  </P> <P> At 9:29, Baumgartner decided to pull up near center ice to check MacTavish into  the boards. He took MacTavish out of the play, but he also took himself out,  leaving McSorley facing a two-on-one against Esa Tikkanen and Kurri that ended  with Tikkanen's goal.  </P> <P> At 9:50, Nicholls' second goal of the game, a strong shot from the right  circle, put the Kings within one.  </P> <P> But at 10:20, Glenn Anderson flipped the puck past Hrudey as Anderson was  falling to the ice with defenseman Larry Robinson on top of him. Both Anderson  and Robinson piled into Hrudey, and they all followed the puck into the net.  </P> <P> With 51 seconds left, Robitaille scored his second goal of the night on a power  play.  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> After missing all exhibition games and the first two games of the regular  season with a pinched nerve in his neck, Dave Taylor plans to play tonight  against Detroit. . . . King center Hubie McDonough was not at the game Saturday  night. He had returned to New Haven, Conn., where his wife, Amy, was soon to  give birth to their first child. . . . Saturday night's game was delayed on  account of snow. Between the second and third periods malfunctioning  ice-resurfacing machines dumped three snowbanks on the ice, causing the fans to  boo and cheer as two machines appeared and disappeared, taking turns trying to  get the ice cleaned. Finally, one of the machines came to life to clean the  ice. The game was delayed about 20 minutes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GRETZKY'S COUNTDOWN TO 1,851 POINTS  </P> <P> Gordie Howe's all-time regular-season scoring record (points and assists) is  1,850. Through Saturday night's game, the Kings' Wayne Gretzky is 11 points  away from breaking that record.  </P> <P> </P> <P> POINT NO.: 1,838  </P> <P> GORDIE HOWE IN 1980  </P> <P> Feb. 15: Winnipeg at Hartford  </P> <P> Scores unassisted goal in the first period.  </P> <P> Goaltender: Markus Mattsson.  </P> <P> </P> <P> POINT NO.: 1,838  </P> <P> WAYNE GRETZKY IN 1989  </P> <P> Oct. 5: Toronto vs. Kings at Forum  </P> <P> Gets an assist on goal scored by Hubie McDonough in the second period.  </P> <P> Goaltender: Allan Bester.  </P> <P> </P> <P> POINT NO.: 1,839  </P> <P> GORDIE HOWE IN 1980  </P> <P> Feb. 16: Hartford at Toronto  </P> <P> Gets an assist in third period on goal by Jordy Douglas  </P> <P> Goaltender: Jiri Crha.  </P> <P> </P> <P> POINT NO.: 1,839  </P> <P> WAYNE GRETZKY IN 1989  </P> <P> Oct. 7: Edmonton vs. Kings at Forum  </P> <P> Scores goal at 10:53 of first period Assists to Luc Robitaille and Bob  Kudelski.  </P> <P> Goaltender: Bill Ranford.  </P> <P> </P> <P> POINT NO.: 1,840  </P> <P> GORDIE HOWE IN 1980  </P> <P> Feb. 26: Hartford at Quebec  </P> <P> Gets an assist in third period on goal by Tim Sheehy.  </P> <P> Goaltender: Michel Dion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> POINT NO.: 1,840  </P> <P> WAYNE GRETZKY IN 1989  </P> <P> Oct. 7: Edmonton vs. Kings at Forum  </P> <P> Scores goal at 1:07 of second period Assist to John Tonelli.  </P> <P> Goaltender: Bill Ranford.  </P></p>

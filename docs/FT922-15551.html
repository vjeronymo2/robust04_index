			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / France says its growth will better rest of EC FRANCE is poised for higher growth than most of its European partners this year and next year and should be in a good position to benefit from any upturn in the world economy, according to Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister. Mr Beregovoy, who has been mooted as candidate to succeed Mrs Edith Cresson as prime minister, said yesterday at a meeting of the Commission des Comptes de la Nation that continuing his policy of imposing tight control on inflation and public spending would be critical to France's growth. The official forecast for French growth this year is 2 per cent, followed by 2.6 per cent in 1993. This, said Mr Beregovoy, would be 0.3 per cent higher than the average growth forecast for the European economies in each of those years. However, private sector economists are predicting slightly lower growth rates for France this year. Last week economists at Paribas, one of the larger Paris investment banks, forecast that growth for 1992 would be 1.8 per cent. Mr Beregovoy said he expected French inflation to remain relatively low over the next two years. He forecast inflation of 2.8 per cent for both 1992 and 1993, beneath the present annual rate of 3 per cent.</p>

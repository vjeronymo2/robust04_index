			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELEBRITY ADVOCATES FOR POLITICAL CAUSES  </P> <P> Regarding Howard Rosenberg's Nov. 5 column, "Celebrity Advocates: Is It Their  Role?": What a silly piece about celebrities involving themselves in the  political process.  </P> <P> Rosenberg asks whether viewers are listening to Michael Landon or Jonathan  Smith the angel (of TV's "Highway to Heaven"). I don't know -- who are we  listening to when newspapers say vote "No" on Prop. 128? Is it someone  brilliant? Is it you, Howard?  </P> <P> Golly, we don't know who it is, do you? It couldn't be the people who own these  newspapers and also large blocks of stock in the oil and chemical companies. No  . . . it couldn't be . . . could it, Howard?  </P> <P> MICHAEL LANDON  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

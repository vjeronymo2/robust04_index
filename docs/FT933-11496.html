			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / People: Board shuffle at Evered Bardon James Murray, board member and managing director of the UK division of Evered Bardon, the aggregates group, has resigned after a management reshuffle in which three managing directors previously reporting to him now report directly to group chief executive Peter Tom. 'This is part of the tidying up process (after the merger of Evered and Bardon in 1991),' says finance director William McGrath. 'We are not that big or complicated a company that we needed that extra layer.' Hence George Plant at Bardon Roadstone, John Hume at John Fyfe and Donald McKerraker at Tractor Shovels will report to Tom. Murray, who is 52, came from the Evered side - while Tom was chairman and chief executive of Bardon. Murray had run Tractor Shovels, and then added John Fyfe when the latter was acquired by Evered. After the merger, he took on responsibility for Bardon Roadstone, the core business of Bardon. 'He is leaving amicably,' says McGrath, who adds that Murray was on a three-year contract but is 'getting his contractual entitlements, not vast sums of money at all'.</p>

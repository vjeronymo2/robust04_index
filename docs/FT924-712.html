			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / French electricity generator to renew UK sales ELECTRICITE DE FRANCE, the French state-owned utility, intends to go ahead with new contracts to sell electricity to the UK next year in the face of claims that French power is damaging the British coal industry. Clarification of France's intentions came yesterday as Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, rejected pressure to reverse his pit closure programme following the High Court ruling that it had been conducted unlawfully. Mr Jean-Pierre Guery, the head of European sales, said EdF would seek to renew its membership of the UK electricity pool, the market for bulk electricity, when it expired next April. It has already begun to negotiate contracts with individual electricity companies. EdF currently sells about 16.5tWh of electricity a year to the UK through a cross-Channel link. This is equivalent to 5-6 per cent of electricity sales in England and Wales. But British Coal claims that these sales are reducing the potential market for UK-mined coal by 6m-7m tonnes a year, and costing more than 6,000 miners' jobs. The future of the 10-year-old cross-Channel link is one of the issues being examined by Mr Heseltine in his energy review. Some MPs have called for the link to be severed, or for changes to enable exports of UK electricity to France. Mr Guery questioned whether under EC rules the UK could block electricity imports. Although EdF was willing to consider imports of UK electricity, he doubted that there was any early prospect of this because UK prices were too high. EdF has been arguing in evidence to the UK government and the select committee of MPs who are looking into the coal crisis that severance of the link would damage consumers' interests by driving up prices. It also claims that a cut in imports would not enlarge the market for coal. This is because EdF's power supplies the south of England which is served mainly by oil-fired power stations. EdF has also rejected charges that it is subsidised. Though state-owned, it says it is a free-standing commercial company which is expected to make a profit, and provide in full for its liabilities. In London, Mr Heseltine said that mining would not restart at the 10 pits which the High Court ruled must be subjected to independent review before they are closed. 'What the court was concerned about was the independence of the consultation process that is under way, which is the subject of the 90-day procedure,' he said on BBC radio. Labour presented 14 sackloads of petitions to 10 Downing Street demanding that the original plan to close 31 pits be reversed. Cross-Channel power, Page 4 Pit restart calls rebuffed, Page 4</p>

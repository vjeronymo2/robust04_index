			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Hongkong Land has 20.1% of Trafalgar HONGKONG LAND, the Jardine Matheson-controlled property company, confirmed yesterday that it had exercised its option to acquire 36m shares in Trafalgar House, lifting its stake in the UK-based construction, engineering and shipping group to 20.1 per cent. Hongkong Land acquired a 14.9 per cent stake in Trafalgar House in October and launched an abortive tender offer in an attempt to lift its stake to 29.9 per cent. The following month it revealed that it had entered into an option arrangement to buy the shares. As part of the option deal, Hongkong Land may also be obliged to buy a further 67m shares by May 3. In both cases, it is paying no more than the 85p per share or 82p per A share it offered in the tender. In practice it is only likely to be forced to buy another 67m shares if the share price falls well below 85p. By taking its stake above 20 per cent Hongkong Land will be able to equity-account its holding, enabling it to book a share of Trafalgar's profits. Trafalgar's ordinary and A shares yesterday closed down 1 1/2 p at 92p and down 1p at 90p respectively. Trafalgar has already appointed Mr Rodney Leach, a director of Hongkong Land, to its board, but has been less enthusiastic about a request to appoint a second director from Hongkong Land, Sir Charles Powell. Yesterday, however, both companies emphasised their 'good relationship,' and Mr Leach said the two companies were 'working very closely together.' He said he felt that Trafalgar was looking at the request for extra board representation with 'increasing sympathy.' Meanwhile, in the market, rumours resurfaced yesterday about a possible Trafalgar House rights issue. The company said only that a rights issue 'had not been ruled in or out.' Hongkong Land reversed almost a decade of consolidation last year, by selling an office block in central Hong Kong for HKDollars 3.8bn and making its raid on Trafalgar House. That supported the widely-held assertion that the company wants to cash in Hong Kong assets and reinvest the proceeds in Britain. The company, Hong Kong's largest owner of prime office property, has formed a consortium which has won the right to develop Hong Kong's ninth container terminal. It has also expressed an interest in developing a new office complex to be built on top of the terminus for the proposed airport rail link. However, the current political impasse between Hong Kong and China over airport financing, has put this project on hold. The raid on Trafalgar House is regarded as largely opportunistic, but it does present some opportunities for synergy with the Jardine Matheson group.</p>

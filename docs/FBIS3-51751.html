Although apparently contradictory, it is necessary to go  slow  but as fast as circumstances permit, Rodriguez said during a  government meeting in Pinar del Rio Province, according to a  National News Agency [AIN] press dispatch.    A fiscal deficit of 4.2 billion pesos -- the peso is on a  par  with the U.S. dollar -- and circulating cash in excess of 10  billion pesos are some of the most important obstacles to a  revival of the local economy.    Most of the budget deficit is comprised of subsidies.  Agriculture, and the sugar industry alone, constituted more than  7 billion pesos in subsidies in the past three years. Rodriguez  said that subsidies to cover losses in managerial activities  constitute one of the country's most serious problems. In this  regard, he underlined the importance of increasing revenue,  revising prices, and making other decisions that might help the  situation, according to AIN.    The Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] last week began a process  of consultations between deputies and the rank and file  regarding measures to solve the financial situation. In the  early meetings, the CTC members favored reducing subsidies for  some products and state services and charging for services  formerly given for free. In some plants, the workers even  proposed creating a "bonus for the homeland" at very low or no  interest.    Rodriguez has not yet mentioned any specific measures. He  said that a number of urgent situations must be corrected but in  an orderly manner and after talking with the people. He said  that such decisions are necessary, require the people's support,  and entail a certain degree of sacrifice.    The National Assembly of the People's Government, which  debated the matter for the first time in late December, plans to  hold a special session to discuss financial reorganization.  Ricardo Alarcon, president of the parliament, said on Sunday  that the debate will be held as soon as possible, although the  date has not yet been determined.</p>

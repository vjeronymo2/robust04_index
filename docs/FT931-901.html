			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Mining equipment sector fears loss of 9,000 jobs 40 per cent of its workforce - because of the government's plans for the future of the coal industry, the Association of British Mining Equipment Companies said yesterday. The cutting of a world-leading industry's base could cause foreign buyers to lose confidence in its ability to maintain capacity, the association warned. A 'disappointing' white paper offered little prospect of increased demand for coal, it added. Mr William Morrell, association director-general, warned that equipment manufacturers with overseas factories could also transfer work to countries where there is an active coalfield. The UK leads the world equipment market for longwall mining - the UK system of extracting coal in a continuous run of 200 metres to 300 metres. Exports have risen significantly over the past five years, accounting for about Pounds 400m of total production worth about Pounds 900m a year. The association warned that a sizeable and stable home market was essential for continuing international marketing success. This was needed to finance spending on research and development and application technology. British Coal has traditionally been the equipment industry's principal customer. The association said its members' state-of-the-art technology had been a significant contributor to British Coal's 160 per cent increase in productivity since 1986. The recent decline in the UK coal industry had taken its toll on equipment suppliers. The association said the closure of 70 per cent of UK mines from end-1987 to end-1991 had reduced the direct workforce by 50,000 to 22,000. The association said yesterday that, by taking 18 pits out of production, the government would remove one third of the suppliers' domestic market, giving no time for companies to adapt. The association said many companies will not be able to sustain the research and development necessary for continued export success, adding: 'Perhaps most importantly, the government still does not have a long-term energy policy which makes it impossible for our industry to plan what demand is likely to be for its products.'</p>

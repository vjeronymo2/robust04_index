			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Decision by the Constitutional Court rejecting an appeal </F> for the annulment of the 5 December 1993 presidential elections  and confirming the election of incumbent President Omar Bongo;  read by Marie Madeleine Boransouo, Constitutional Court  president--live or recorded]    [Text] Considering that all appeals for annulment were  filed against the same adversary for the same motive and subject  and that there is the need to consider them to make a unique  decision on them; considering that the plaintiffs referred the  matter to the Constitutional Court mainly to have it declare the  annulment of the 5 December 1993 election and consequently the  announcement made on 9 December in this regard by the minister  of territorial administration and that, to back their appeals,  they mentioned the violation of Articles 18, 21, 60, 73, 91, 96,  98, and 99 of the electoral laws;    Considering--in the case of (Assa Ovono)--that the last  paragraph of Article 84 of the [words indistinct] Constitution  that the Constitutional Court is referred to in case of  rejection of the validity of an election by any voter,  candidate, political party, or a government's delegate in the  conditions provided for by an organic law, that Law 9/91 of 26  September 1991 concerning the Constitutional Court states in its  Article 67, paragraph 2, that a voter can only appeal for the  annulment of the electoral operations of the polling station  where he is supposed to vote. (?In this regard), as a simple  voter, (Assa Ovono) cannot appeal for the annulment of the  entire 5 December 1993 poll.    Considering--in the case of the other plaintiffs--that  Article 2 of the Constitution sanctions the principle of  indivisibility of the Republic and that Article 3 reaffirms that  the national sovereignty belongs to the people and that they  exercise it directly through referendum or election in  accordance with the principle of multiparty democracy and  indirectly through the constitutional institutions, while  Article 7 warns that any act threatening the Republic entity,  unity, secularity of the state, sovereignty, and independence  constitute a high treason crime punished by the law; considering  that following the announcement of the results of the 5 December  1993 by the minister of territorial administration, Paul Mba  Abessole self-proclaimed president of the Gabonese Republic,  that on the same day he appointed a prime minister, namely  Pierre Andre Kombila, and that they deliberately placed  themselves in illegality, thus ignoring the existence of the  Constitution and therefore the institutions legally put in  place; and considering that as a result of their belonging to  these so-called Republican institutions, the plaintiffs have  incessantly, ostensibly, and on a daily basis carried out acts  that make a section of the people consider them as legitimate  authorities, and that these acts threaten the unity of the state  and national sovereign, there is reason to reject their appeals.    We therefore decide:    Article 1. The appeal for annulment of the results of the 5  December 1993 poll filed by (Assa Ovono) is not receivable.    Article 2. Also declared nonreceivable are the appeals  filed at the same time by Paul Mba Abessole, Pierre Louis  Agondjo-Okawe, Peierre-Claver Maganga-Oussavou, Jean-Pierre  Lemboumba Lepandou, Jules Aristide Bourdes Ogoulinguende,  Alexandre Sambat, Leon Boyendou, Marc Saturnin Ma-Nguema, (Simon  Oyono Aba), Leon Mebiane Mba, and (Divoungui)    Article 3. The results of the 5 December 1993 poll  proclaimed on 13 December 1993 by the Constitutional Court have  been confirmed.</p>

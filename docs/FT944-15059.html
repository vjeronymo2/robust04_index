			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Police quell riot outside Commons Police guarding the House of Commons were bombarded with bottles, sticks and fire crackers last night as they quelled a riot by opponents of the criminal justice and public order bill, Ivor Owen writes. The rioters tried to storm the main gates used by ministers and MPs and police were forced to use batons to disperse them. All the entrances to the Commons and the Lords were closed. MPs and officials were prevented from leaving for more than an hour. Before the riot reached its full intensity the government bowed to the view of the Lords and strengthened the safeguards for defendants who exercise the modified right to silence - one of the most significant changes introduced by the bill. It was one of the few amendments made to the bill by peers which the government agreed to accept. Under pressure from law lords and other peers Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, accepted the need for a revised caution emphasising that juries would be entitled to draw inferences from a defendant's refusal to respond to police questioning. The proposed version reads: 'You do not have to say anything. But if you do not mention now something which you later use in your defence, the court may decide that your failure to mention it now strengthens the case against you. A record will be made of anything you say and it may be given in evidence if you are brought to court.'</p>

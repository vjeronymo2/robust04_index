			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTIAL HOUSING FOR PRISONERS IS OPPOSED;  </P> <P> STUDIO CITY: ELDERLY TENANTS OF A RETIREMENT COMPLEX WOULD BE REPLACED BY  NONVIOLENT LAWBREAKERS IN A WORK-FURLOUGH PROGRAM. BUT A PLANNING OFFICIAL SAYS  THE LOCATION IS WRONG.  </P> <P> A controversial plan to convert a Studio City retirement home into a residence  for prisoners participating in a work-furlough program has been rejected by a  city planning official, who found the proposed Ventura Boulevard site  ill-suited to a neighborhood with nearby houses.  </P> <P> "Although the proposed facility would serve a beneficial purpose to the public  at large, such purpose could be served as well or better in a nonresidential  setting," hearing examiner Richard M. Takase wrote in a recommendation to the  Los Angeles City Planning Commission.  </P> <P> The commission is scheduled to vote on the issue Thursday at the Van Nuys  Woman's Club.  </P> <P> Takase's recommendation was based on an Aug. 20 hearing during which about 20  Studio City residents and business owners voiced concern about convicted  criminals in their neighborhood.  </P> <P> Carl E. Curtis, Los Angeles County's work-furlough director, said Tuesday that  he would still urge the commission to approve the Studio City program, which  would be run by a private, Long Beach firm called Working Alternatives. The  facility, part of an effort to ease crowding in the County Jail, would be the  second of its kind if approved.  </P> <P> "I think their fears are unfounded," Curtis said. "We carefully screen the  individuals who get into work furlough. They are not dangerous individuals."  </P> <P> Under the proposal, elderly residents of the Ventura Retirement Villa at 11201  Ventura Blvd. would be replaced by nonviolent lawbreakers.  </P> <P> The program would allow the participants, mostly convicted of misdemeanors, to  continue working while serving their sentences, and make jail cells available  for more serious offenders.  </P> <P> Participants would be screened by the county Probation Department and approved  by a judge. They would be allowed to leave the facility only for their jobs and  would be closely monitored by staff and routinely tested for drugs or alcohol.  </P> <P> However, they would not be under lock and key, Curtis said.  </P> <P> Takase, in issuing his recommendation against the plan, noted the fears of area  residents and the fact that an estimated 63 participants -- most of them  convicted drunk drivers who have lost their licenses -- would have contact with  the public at neighborhood bus stops.  </P> <P> Takase also found that the 146-bed retirement home lacked adequate parking for  a work-furlough program.  </P> <P> The home has 49 parking spaces -- not enough for an estimated 70 driving  participants plus work-furlough staff, he said.  </P> <P> Takase added that the county's first privately run work-furlough program,  opened early this year at 89th and Main streets in South Los Angeles, had been  a drug-rehabilitation center and halfway house for paroled inmates for 12  years. Its conversion to a more restrictive work-furlough program, in which  residents' freedom to come and go is limited, was welcomed by the neighborhood  as an improvement, he wrote.  </P> <P> Polly Ward, president of the Studio City Residents Assn., welcomed his  conclusions.  </P> <P> "The problem with the program is not the program itself, but they wanted to  place it in an inappropriate location," Ward said. "I'm very pleased."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] In leading the great mission of our nation's  socialist modernization, reform and opening up, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping has consistently stressed tasks related to the working  class and the labor unions. The various major statements he has  made concerning total reliance on the working class, giving full  play to the role of the labor unions and similar topics are a  scientific summation of the workers' movement and the work of  the labor unions in our country, are the most formidable  ideological weapon for the promotion of the healthy development  of the labor movement and labor union work in our nation, and  have become a major and integral part of the theory of  establishing socialism with Chinese characteristics.    The earnest study and penetrating research into Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's thoughts on the working class and the labor unions is  of extremely vital and immediate significance and profound  historical significance as regards gaining a deep understanding  of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, as regards the fundamental guiding principles  of comprehensively carrying out the Party's basic line and  wholeheartedly relying on the working class, as regards actively  seeking out the new paths for the work of the labor unions which  are imbued with Chinese socialism, and diligently creating new  situations in labor union work, to come together and mobilize  the billion workers to more closely unite around the party  center with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, to fight the hard  fight, and win the great victory of the cause of socialism with  Chinese characteristics.    The book Deng Xiaoping on The Working Class and Labor  Unions, edited and published by the All-China Federation of  Trade Unions (ACFTU), is one of the major foundations of trade  union theory, and with major support and help from Central  Document Research Office, the Central Archives and the news  media, Deng Xiaoping on The Working Class and Labor  Unions, is presented today to the reading public. This  book is a selection of expositions made in various historical  periods by Comrade Deng Xiaoping on the subject of the working  class and trade unions, a total of 55 major pieces. Using the  "Speech Delivered at the Ninth National Convention of the ACFTU"  as the introduction to the entire work, the remainder is  arranged according to historical periods, and incorporates 32  works written since the 3rd Plenum of the 11th Central  Committee, 19 works from the period between the founding of the  nation and the 3rd Plenum, and three works from the period  before liberation.    Of the 55 works included, 40 were taken from the first three  volumes of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, three  from Deng Xiaoping on Building the Party; four items  appeared in the PEOPLES DAILY and the CHINA WOMENS DAILY  newspapers; six of the works were published by the ACFTU; two  works, "Outline of the Report Given at the Southwest Sector  Cities Work Meeting" and "On the Correct Relationship of the  Party with Mass Organizations" are here published for the first  time.    The introductory speech was given by comrade Deng Xiaoping  as  representative of the Party Center and the State Council at the  Ninth Plenum of the ACFTU on 11 October 1978 when, with the bold  vision of a proletarian strategist he revealed the great  continent of China was about to enter the historical era of  reform and opening up, and incisively pointed out that reform  was "a great revolution" and clearly set forth the historical  mission of the working class and the workers' movement,  penetratingly explained that the work of the trade unions in the  new era must be to educate and mobilize the workers to make  contributions to the "four modernizations," that the trade  unions must speak for and accomplish things for the workers,  must struggle for the democratic rights of the workers, and lay  an important theoretical foundation for opening up a new path  for our nation's workers movement and for the work of the trade  unions, which became the program of action for the workers  movement and the trade union's work in the new period.    Clearly one of the main themes running through Deng  Xiaoping on The Working Class and Labor Unions is the  ideology of completely relying upon the working class. The  speech "Outline of the Report Given at the Southwest Sector  Cities Work Meeting" published here for the first time, is the  outline of a report personally scribed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping  in 1950 for the first cities work conference convened in the  southwest sector. In this report outline, Comrade Xiaoping  thoroughly explains how to rely on the working class. He says:  first, from an ideological viewpoint one must realize the role  of the working class, that if one does not rely on the working  class, industrial production will be impossible and no  advancement to socialism can be made. Secondly, we must organize  the majority of the workers into the trade unions. If we neglect  trade union work, our reliance on the working class will be  without substance. Thirdly, be zealous in our concern for every  aspect of the working class; take care of all their political,  cultural, living and material benefits' requirements; do not  lightly dismiss the "small matters" which are of benefit to the  workers.    Be on guard against the erroneous viewpoint of those  comrades  who rely upon them in times of difficulty but not when things  are going well, who rely when they need them, and do not rely on  them when they do not need them, who talk about relying on them  but do not really think they must rely on them at all. Such  errors must be corrected. Fourthly, relying on the working class  must become the guiding ideology of the Party; it must pervade  each and every department; it cannot be considered the  responsibility of only the trade unions and the factories. These  vitally important thoughts expressed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping  still have very real and practical applications, major  theoretical implications and continuing historical significance  under the new situation of reform and opening up.    Wholeheartedly relying upon the working class has been  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's consistent thinking. As early as 1956  in his report given on the revision of the Party Constitution at  the Eighth Party Congress he elucidated the party's mass line.  Speaking from the level of historical materialism, he pointed  out: "Marxism has always held that, in the final analysis,  history is created by the popular masses. The working class must  rely upon the mass power of its own class and the mass power of  the entire body of working people: only then can it fulfill its  own historical mission." Since the 3rd Plenum of the 11th  Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has frequently spoke  about the historical position and role of the working class,  reiterating that "Through a long series of trials the working  class of our nation has proved itself to be a revolutionary  leading class steadfast in its stand." He has clearly pointed  out that: "the working class is reliable."    Deng Xiaoping on The Working Class and Labor  Unions repeatedly emphasizes the relationship between  strengthening the party's leadership and the labor unions  carrying out their work in an independent and self sustaining  manner. On the one hand he emphasizes that the mass organs  should lay out their work in accordance with the overall work of  the party, respect the party's leadership, and absolutely never  support a work goal which is in opposition to party goals. On  the other hand, he also emphasizes that the party committees  should honor the independent nature of the mass organs, and  should not run the union's show as they please without  consulting them. We must not only avoid the tendency of the mass  organs breaking away from the party's political leadership, but  must also avoid the tendency of the party running everything.  The present volume for the first time publishes the summation  he gave at a meeting of high level cadre of the Taxing sub  bureau on 20 February 1942 wherein he clearly stated that one of  the major criteria for trade union work is "the question of the  correct relations between the party and the mass organization."    Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always paid close attention to the  problem of democratic control of enterprises. In his "Outline of  the Report Given at the Southwest Sector Cities Work Meeting"  given in 1950, he specifically brings up the question about  enterprises carrying out the "democratization of management" He  is of the opinion that the democratization of management must  take place within "reliance upon a union of workers and staff"  especially it should come about in a form embodying the trade  union, the workers management committee and the staff  representative committee. If it is not done this way there can  be no talk of democratization, since there would be no  democratic content to it. In 1957 at the 3rd Plenum of the  Eighth Party Congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that  "the congress of staff and worker representatives expands the  democratic nature of the enterprise, is an ideal form which  brings in the staff and the workers to join in management of the  enterprise, staves off bureaucracy, and is one of the effective  methods of handling contradictions among the people." In 1978 in  his speech at the ACFTU's Ninth Congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping  reiterated: "All enterprises, without exception, must implement  democratic management," "each enterprise's trade union should  become a working organ composed of the staff and workers  representative committee and the staff and workers congress."  Since the Third Plenum of the 11th Committee, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping has taken as the order of the day the democratization  of enterprise management as being one of the major components of  reform of the enterprise management system. He has repeatedly  emphasized one of the three major components of the reform of  the political system is to "stimulate the enthusiasm of the  lower levels, the workers, peasants and intellectuals to  participate in management, so that the democratization of  management can be realized."    The nature of the socialist country and the basic socialist  system determine that, no matter what changes take place in the  enterprise system, we must always carry through with the thought  of Deng Xiaoping, support and perfect the system of staff-worker  congresses, and give full play to the role of the trade unions  and democratic management rights of the staff and workers.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on the working class and the  trade unions is large on content, incisive in exposition.  Beginning with the inherent characteristics and historical  mission, he reiterates the idea that the working class is the  leading class of the revolution and calls upon the working class  to display its glorious tradition of struggle and hard work and  make its contribution to the realization of the four  modernizations. He calls upon the working class to strive to  grasp modern technological knowledge and management techniques,  to act as vanguard role models in the reforms, emphasizing that  the model workers and exemplary revolutionaries who appear among  the masses of staff and workers are the models we study and the  core about which we unite. He also puts forward the views that  the intellectuals are one of the parts of the working class; and  the working class in our country should strengthen its ties with  workers across the world, and so forth. On the basis of a  summary of the historical experiences of our nation's trade  union work, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly points out that the  trade unions are not something that we can do as well with as  without, it should be an organization the workers can believe  in, that speaks for the workers and does things for the workers,  so that the broad masses of workers all feel that the trade  union is indeed the workers' own organization.    He believes that implementation of the four modernizations  is  the basic task of the trade unions in the new era and the  quality of the work of the trade unions will influence the  workers in the performance of their rights as masters of their  house. He emphasized that the trade union organizations must  keep closely linked to the masses, and must themselves be models  of democracy. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speeches on the work of  the trade unions clearly point out the path we are to follow,  and are a formidable ideological tool for accomplishing trade  union work in the new era.    Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics strive to find  new paths for trade union work in the new era, and earnestly  strive to create a new situation in trade union work.</p>

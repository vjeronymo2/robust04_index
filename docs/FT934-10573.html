			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Asia Pacific Breweries buys rest of DB Group ASIA PACIFIC Breweries, whose main shareholders are Heineken of the Netherlands and Fraser and Neave of Singapore, is to take control of New Zealand's second-biggest brewer, DB Group. Until now DB Group has been controlled by a consortium of Asia Pacific Breweries and Brierley Investments, but APB said it plans to buy Brierley's 27 per cent stake in the financially troubled group for NZDollars 115m (USDollars 64m) Asia Pacific also said it was selling its 25 per cent shareholding in Australian hotel group Austotel to Brierley for NZDollars 38.33m. Brierley will then buy a further 50 per cent of Austotel, now held by DB Group, for NZDollars 76.6m. DB Group, formerly Magnum Corporation, has run up substantial losses in recent years, mainly due to its investment in Austotel and in Wilson Neill, owner of the Tasmanian brewery Cascade Group. Brierley's chief executive, Mr Paul Collins, said Asia Pacific Breweries would bring to DB Group Heineken's expertise in brewing to further increase its quality, while Brierley's expertise would help rebuild Austotel to an 'acceptable level of profitability.'</p>

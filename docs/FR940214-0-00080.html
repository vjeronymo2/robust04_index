			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The standard provides that the parking brake grade holding requirements must be met with ``any'' single leakage-type failure of certain parts, including service brake diaphragms. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that a driver can safely park a vehicle in the event of a leakage-type failure in the service brake system. The standard specifies ``any'' failure because leakage-type failures of many types, sizes, and locations can occur in vehicle brake systems. To ensure that a vehicle has adequate grade holding performance regardless of the specific nature or extent of a leakage-type failure, the agency intentionally did not limit the size or location of such failures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, NHTSA explained that most brake systems are designed with two diaphragms, one for the service brake function and one for the parking brake function. Further, most brake systems incorporate a spring brake for parking. These brake systems can easily meet the parking brake holding requirements with a failure in the service brake diaphragm, because a failure in that diaphragm does not adversely affect parking brake performance. In contrast, the ITI air-applied, mechanically held brake system has only one diaphragm that provides both the parking brake and service brake functions. A hole in that diaphragm can therefore affect both parking brake and service brake performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to ITI, it is inappropriate to require vehicles to meet grade holding requirements with ``any'' failure in the common diaphragm of its brake system, because its system is designed so that a hole in the diaphragm with not get any larger than 1/8 inch during real-world use. ITI further stated that a vehicle equipped with its brake system will hold on a 20 percent grade and can never be driven with a failure larger than 1/8 inch. This is because, according to ITI, diaphragm failures begin as very small holes, develop very slowly, and its brakes will not release once the hole gets larger than 1/8 inch. Thus, once a hole gets that large and the driver parks the vehicle at the end of the day, it will not be possible to drive the vehicle without repairing the brakes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained in the NPRM, NHTSA evaluated the issues raised by ITI through tests of the air-applied, mechanically held system conducted at the agency's Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC). (See, Evaluation of Mini-Max Parking Forces with Chamber Diaphragm Failures, December 17, 1992, which has been placed in Docket No. 93&hyph;17, Notice 1.) That testing confirmed that vehicles equipped with the ITI system could not be unparked in the presence of a relatively small failure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, NHTSA sought comment on two primary issues related to air-applied, mechanically held brake systems: (1) Whether the current requirement is appropriate for an air-applied, mechanically held brake system like ITI's system and (2) whether it is possible to develop a test procedure that will identify the ``worst case'' diaphragm failure that might be experienced in the real world. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Diaphragm Failure Modes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA discussed whether air-applied, mechanically held brake systems only experience small, gradual failures or whether they can experience catastrophic failures. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  If diaphragms do in fact experience catastrophic failures, then the proposed requirement would not ensure the safety of air-braked vehicles. However, based on information provided by ITI and the agency's analysis of that information, NHTSA assumed, for purposes of this rulemaking, that diaphragm failures begin small and develop very slowly. Accordingly, the proposed test procedure was designed to evaluate the small, gradual leakage-type failures that, according to ITI, occur with its system. Notwithstanding NHTSA's decision to propose requirements that would be appropriate only if diaphragms only experience small, gradual leakage-type failures, the agency sought comment about whether catastrophic diaphragm failures occur in the real world. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> By ``catastrophic failure,'' the agency means one in which a service brake application is made and the diaphragm fails, for any reason, to an extent that the brake chamber will not generate sufficient torque to add significantly to the vehicle's braking. Types of catastrophic failures include puncturing the diaphragm with a broken spring, pulling the diaphragm loose from the air brake chamber clamp ring, or blowing a large hole in the diaphragm. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The paper quoted a senior Russian fleet official as saying  that the contract was concluded at secret instructions from the  Naval Headquarters in Moscow and that he couldn't disclose the  price of the 2,500-ton submarines.    The official added that ostensibly North Korea is buying the  vessels for use as scraps.    Another fleet official said, however, that North Korea could  update the submarines and create a new submarine flotilla or  dismantle them to salvage parts for use in repairing those they  already have.    The four submarines were built in the 1960s. The Russian  Navy is known to possess 38 Fox-Trot-type conventional attack  submarines.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jorge Antonio Barros] </F>   [Text] The Federal Police wants to plug one of the biggest  holes in the "Swiss cheese" that has made the international  airport of Rio de Janeiro notorious for permitting weapons  smuggled from Miami, in the United States, to enter this  country. Chief Edson Antonio de Oliveira, superintendent of the  Federal Police in Rio, revealed that for the first time he has  won a commitment from the Federal Revenue Secretariat to  cooperate and facilitate registration of the weapons seized, or  merely retained, at the airport. In six months, the revenue  authorities have retained about 100 weapons, out of a total of  almost a ton of equipment and ammunition.    With the cooperation of the revenue authorities, the Federal  Police will be able to add new information to a dossier that, in  two years, has already listed more than 150 individuals involved  with weapons smuggling in Rio. A good many of these are  policemen, such as detective Luiz Eduardo Sato, who was arrested  last month on Andarai Hill in possession of 22 kg of cocaine  paste and ammunition for the AR-15, an American rifle that has  become the weapon of choice for Rio bandits. Arrested along with  informant Luiz Alexandre Etiene Ferreira, Sato was supplying  ammunition to the enemies of his coworkers. He was assigned to  the 37th precinct (Governor's Island). Proximity to the airport  makes the neighborhood one of the main gateways for weapons  entering Rio.  <H5>  Miami </H5>   According to police findings, Sato was a trusted lieutenant  of trafficker Romildo de Souza da Costa, aka  Miltinho, of Dende Hill--also on Governor's  Island--who became known as one of the biggest suppliers of  weapons to Rio traffickers. Sato is thought to also have had  connections to dollar-trader Oto Gomes de Miranda, who was  arrested along with four other Brazilians in Miami in April 1991  and accused of smuggling weapons to Rio.    The arrest of the Brazilians--who had used a Miami house to  store 400 weapons for smuggling--led the superintendent of the  Federal Police in Rio to begin, two years ago, an exchange with  the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), an agency of  the U.S. Department of the Treasury. On that occasion, the  Bureau estimated at more than 50 buyers the number of weapons  smugglers working the Miami-Rio-Medellin route. They take  advantage of Florida laws, which do not restrict the sale of  firearms.  <H5>  Investigation </H5>   After making contact with the ATF, Edson de Oliveira  realized  that only gradually, by patient investigatory work, could he  deal a blow to the contraband in weapons in Rio. Not only were  police and people with access to the air freight terminal  involved--which hampered the investigation--but the business is  extremely profitable and attracts people who are even willing to  kill potential witnesses. For example, an AR-15 rifle costs  about $700 in the United States, while in Brazil it can command  the princely sum of $5,000.    Just as the contraband is carried out in an "ant-like"  procession, as Edson de Oliveira described it, the files on the  illegal trade in weapons also require a meticulous search. The  leading smugglers stroll through the airport baggage areas  weekly, while they divert weapons through the Teca (Air Cargo  Terminal) at Galeao. That is why Edson asked for help from the  Federal Revenue Service, whose inspectors never bothered to  notify the police when they seized weapons. They look at the  problem as one of tax evasion.    It seems simple. The revenue inspectors and technicians work  with the federal police in the same space--the restricted  section of the airport--but the communications links between  them were never very strong. Revenue Inspector Sylvio Jose  Barros de Sa Freire, assigned to the Rio international airport,  admits that the inspectors took the initiative only to report  criminal facts to the Office of Prosecutor of the Ministry of  Finance, as the law requires. The inspectors claim the area is a  "primary zone" in which only revenue officers can act.  Therefore, the information on the individual carrying the weapon  got lost in the desk drawers of the bureaucracy.  <H5>  Customs Has Few Inspectors </H5>   Inspector Sa Freire admits that 200 inspectors are not  enough  to control the customs service at the airport. He says the  number should be doubled, at least. With 30 years of service but  only eight months in this section, Sa Freire reports that the  Federal Revenue Secretariat has a plan to come to the aid of the  customs officers, revenue watchmen who have police powers.    Despite the shortage of personnel, the federal revenue  inspectors at the airport have almost quintupled the sums  collected at that post. In eight months, they have seized a  total of $30 million in goods, including weapons. The latter  usually rust away at Revenue Secretariat warehouses. Even so, Sa  Freire admits that the service has been significantly dismantled  in the past 10 years because of administrative policies leading  to a relaxation in that sector.    That is why he advocates stricter laws on the entry of  weapons into Brazil. "Even the Army, which regulates weapons,  ought to issue authorizations in advance," Sa Freire pointed  out. Any weapon can be brought into Brazil without prior  authorization, provided the Ministry of the Army [subsequently]  authorizes its entry. When caught with concealed weapons, the  smugglers almost always claim to be collectors. Even so,  according to the Federal Police, the air cargo terminal is still  one of the key points of entry for weapons that are then shipped  elsewhere in boats that ply Guanabara Bay.    Sa Freire also announced measures that have been put into  effect since he took the assignment in July, with a view to  plugging the holes in the "Swiss cheese."    Using 36 cameras that operate 24 hours a day to transmit and  record movements in strategic sectors, the airport revenue  inspectors plan to achieve the following goals: eliminate the  selection of baggage on flights considered high-risk (those from  Miami, New York, and Latin countries where there is a high  incidence of drug traffic), containerize the freight beginning  right at the door of the airplane hold to sort of "suck out" the  goods; and link computers with European and American airline  systems in order to check the freight manifests.</p>

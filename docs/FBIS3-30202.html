			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vladimir Wolfovich Zhirinovskiy, leader of the  Russian Liberal Democratic Party, who is staying on a private  visit in Slovenia, held a news conference in Bled this  afternoon. Tomaz Gerden reports:    [Begin Gerden recording] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, of course,  attracts great attention wherever he goes. This was also the  case in Bled were approximately 100 foreign and domestic  journalists and cameramen have gathered. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  who was invited here by the National-Social Alliance, in the  introduction praised Slovenia, which he is visiting for the  second time. He was here for the first time in November 1990 at  the congress of the Liberal Party.    I view the Slovene nation, which has chosen its own fate,  with respect. Zhirinovskiy also said that he knew that our  country was highly developed and cultured and handled its  affairs into which he would not meddle by itself. An avalanche  of reporters' questions ensued:    Zhirinovskiy answered fiercely. Occasionally he had problems  with the translation. He gave preference to Slavic journalists  over western journalists, who are obviously getting on his  nerves. For example, he accused them of creating a false  impression that he favored war. The leader of the Russian  Liberal Democrats assured them that he has always favored peace  and was opposed to the use of force.    All foreign troops, including the blue berets, should  withdraw from Bosnia-Herzegovina. Only then will there be  peace. He also spoke in favor of not changing borders and of  freezing the situation in Europe as it was in 1945 after World  War II.    Asked what are his alleged connections with the former KGB,  he categorically assured: I have no connections with the former  or the present KGB. I would gladly have had connections with  the KGB as this was the most powerful political police in the  world. Had I been connected with the KGB, I would be sitting in  the Moscow Kremlin now and not in this small town on the shore  of a lake.    Mr. Zhirinovskiy then distributed his book among the  journalists, again threatened Western, corrupt journalists, and  said that he would meet any Slovene politician who might wish to  do so. For example, he had received Mr. Jelincic yesterday.    Finally, it is worthwhile noting that the news conference,  despite sporadic outbursts, was carried out in perfect order.  Mr. Zhirinovskiy, who will soon leave for Serbia, repeated on  several occasions that he favored peace and only peace and that  his former militant statements were misrepresented.

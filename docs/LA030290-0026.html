			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL PREVIEWS;  </P> <P> CHANNEL LEAGUE  </P> <P> Rio Mesa  </P> <P> COACH: Rich Duran, 4th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 14-10-1; 2nd place in league at 10-3-1  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Rio Mesa lost key players from last year's team that lost to  Santa Maria, 6-0, in the first round of the 4-A Division playoffs. Gone are  pitcher John Rust (9-2, 2.52 earned-run average), who is playing for UC Irvine,  and All-Southern Section second baseman David Frazier (.457).  </P> <P> But Rio Mesa still has its best player, Dmitri Young, and three other returning  starters. Young hit .500 last year (38 for 76) and was Cal-Hi Sports Magazine's  Sophomore Player of the Year. He was the magazine's freshman of the year the  season before. Young has moved from third base to shortstop, and Carlos Rios  has moved from first to left field. "We're going to have new people all up the  middle, and there's a concern there," Duran said. Sam Garcia must replace Soliz  at catcher. David Soliz, a senior right-hander, is the No. 1 starter. "Dave has  made great strides," Duran said. Henry Wilson, another right-hander, was 5-3  last year with a 3.80 ERA. Junior right-handers Mike Tinoco and Frank Tinoco,  unrelated, provide Rio Mesa with pitching depth. Rio Mesa has a quick center  fielder in Jamie Liddell. Junior Mike Mitchell and sophomores Jeff Flores,  Jason Guzman and Jon McMullin also will contribute.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: "We lost some key people, but I feel pretty good about the kids coming  up from the JV team," Duran said. He should. The squad was 19-1 last year and  won the league title. Rio Mesa will be young, but Duran expects the Spartans to  contend in the always-strong Channel League. "I think we have the personnel, we  just need to execute," Duran said.  </P></p>

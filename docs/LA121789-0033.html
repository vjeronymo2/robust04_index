			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HAVEN FOR GAY TEENS  </P> <P> So many thanks for the insightful and positive article on Dr. Virginia Uribe  and her Project 10 ("Haven for Gay Teens," Dec. 7). As usual, the balance of  pro and con made the article worth reading. It is just amazing to me that there  are people like the Rev. Lou Sheldon who profess to believe in humanity as a  whole and yet would deny these gay kids their rightful place in school and  society. How can these right-wingers justify the amount of pain and death they  so casually hand down to kids who are as worthy as anyone else of a solid  education?  </P> <P> The attacks by the Republicans in the state Assembly and Senate have been  neutralized largely because their approach is demonstrably unworkable. Bigotry,  "cures" and isolation have not worked in making these kids "straight."  </P> <P> This deliberate attempt to maintain a status quo that hurts real people is  forever being shown up as unacceptable to the majority of the populace.  </P> <P> DALE REYNOLDS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

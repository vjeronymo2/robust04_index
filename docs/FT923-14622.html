			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (6): Big savings for steel maker  -Case Study / Vallourec / Software boosts quality control and production flexibility IT WAS ALMOST inevitable that French steel maker Vallourec would choose Cap Sesa to develop its process monitoring and quality control system, writes John Kavanagh. After all, when invited to bid, it showed that the requested system was far bigger than Vallourec needed and proceeded to cut the contract-cost by 75 per cent by producing a much simpler system requirement. This then formed the basis of a new invitation to tender. The system was needed at Vallourec's plant in Saint-Saulve, near Valenciennes, in northern France. The company is one of the world leaders in making seamless steel tubes. Four moulds sit side by side and the plant can produce tubes of four different diameters at the same time. The tubes go to three other Vallourec plants, which prepare them for use in industries ranging from car manufacturing to oil exploration. Vallourec's need for close production monitoring and flexible operating is shown by the fact that the Saint-Saulve plant makes 300 grades of steel from scrap and turns the steel into tubes in any of 15 diameters. The plant was opened in 1975 with the aim of producing 150,000 tons of steel a year. Improvements such as boosting the power of the furnace have increased that to 480,000 tons. But the company also wanted to improve the productivity of the pipe making. 'One problem, for example, is that speed can affect quality,' says the Saint-Saulve plant manager, Mr Pierre Boussard. 'Quality is important in a competitive market: it would be impossible today to sell the steel we were making even 10 years ago. 'However, with our large number of possible combinations of grades and tube diameters, operators cannot ensure quality and adapt all the parameters, such as temperature and speed, easily and quickly. So it was absolutely necessary to improve process supervision with an automated system.' Vallourec called in consultants to help specify the system. This was costed at between FFr22m and FFr33m by companies which were invited to bid. Enter Cap Sesa. The company is the French operation of the French-owned group Cap Gemini Sogeti, the biggest computing services group in Europe and the fourth biggest in the world after US companies EDS, IBM and Computer Sciences. 'We felt there were superfluous elements in the system requirement,' says Cap Sesa project manager Mr Xavier Roy. 'For example, it said process data would have to be held for a year; we said it would only need to be held for four days, enough to cover production over a bank holiday weekend so that it could be examined by the relevant people when they returned to work. In addition, the original plan was to develop a totally integrated system which included not only supervision and quality control but also business activities, such as sales order processing. We pointed out that Saint-Saulve already had business systems and all it needed was a link from those into the new system.' The new requirement went to eight systems companies, large and small: their bids ranged from FFr4m to FFr8m somewhat less than the FFr22-33m demanded by the original plan. Cap Sesa had in effect cut the value of the contract for all the bidders, including itself. But Mr Roy says, 'The supplier's job should not be to get the biggest contract but to look at the customer's real needs and aims and make a suitable proposal.' Vallourec gave Cap Sesa what it calls a token FFr50,000 for its work but the real reward came in the form of the main contract. Cap Sesa found itself on a shortlist with computer industry leader IBM and Syseca, part of the French engineering giant, Thomson. IBM, which put in one of the most expensive bids, was then eliminated and Vallourec opened detailed negotiations with Cap Sesa and Syseca. The contract went to Cap Sesa, which costed its bid at FFr7m, by no means the lowest and certainly more expensive than Syseca's. In addition, although Cap Sesa says it knows the steel industry and has 50 people in this field in northern France alone, it had not led a project of this kind before. It was also the first time that the company had worked on a fixed-price contract involving networked equipment and software: its previous fixed-price experience was in software development alone. Vallourec says it chose Cap Sesa because of its use of Fast Tools, a set of so-called computer-aided systems engineering (CASE) products which helps develop systems quickly. However, as one project insider puts it, 'Cap Sesa would probably have won anyway because of the work it did on reviewing the requirement.' This was the first time Cap Sesa had used the Fast Tools products, developed by Netherlands software company, HCS, for this kind of technical system project. Cap Sesa's satisfaction with Fast Tools has led its Cap Gemini Sogeti parent company to take on the product range for world-wide use. The Saint-Saulve team used the Merise systems development and project management method during the selection process. A formal method imposes discipline on the way a project is run and this enabled the team to evaluate and compare the different offerings in a standard way against the same 20 criteria, according to Mr Herve Bouchez, the Vallourec project manager. He is a computing specialist who works in the Saint-Saulve plant's own computing section. This has four staff running largely commercial systems, such as order processing, on a local minicomputer from US supplier Concurrent Computer (formerly Perkin Elmer). One option the Saint-Saulve works did not look at was to use Vallourec's own central computing department, which has 100 specialists and a mainframe computer from French supplier, Bull, at a centre near the plant. 'Eight years ago they tried to help on a technical system project but could not match our need, partly because they only work a five-day week and could not give us maintenance support over the weekend,' says plant manager Pierre Boussard. 'We have a good relationship with the computing centre on commercial systems but our earlier experience meant we did not consider them this time.' Mr Bouchez and his three-man internal project team started work in January 1990. The final shortlist of suppliers was drawn up in June. During the summer, Vallourec negotiated with the shortlisted companies and meanwhile determined which factors would need to be monitored. The result was that 400 sensors would be needed to monitor 10,000 variables relating to temperature, rotation speed, molten steel levels, cooling rate and so on. The system had to show operators these variables virtually instantaneously within two seconds. And if the variables strayed outside specified levels the system had to alert the operators and suggest corrective action, basing its suggestion on an analysis of other related variables and a list of possible faults associated with the combination of all this data. An operator has to acknowledge the alarm: if he fails to respond to the third warning the system automatically takes appropriate action and makes the necessary adjustments to the production process, such as increasing the cooling rate, or cutting the speed. Given the demands for speed of response by the system, Mr Roy and his Cap Sesa team found Microvax computers from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), the second biggest US computer manufacturer, to be the most suitable. In 99 per cent of cases, the system response is 1.2 secs. and in the other one per cent it is up to 1.5 secs. The operator workstations are from Sun Microsystems. They were chosen for their graphics facilities and their price. The basic network was delivered in January 1991 and the monitoring system was ready for testing by April. Workstations were built and staff tried them out and made suggestions which were acted on. Design of the colour screens with their graphic and tabulated information was done largely by the very operators who would be using them. By August, the equipment and workstations were all ready and the bulk production data was keyed in over the next six weeks or so. The system was formally accepted in September, 1991 two months ahead of target date. Mr Boussard, says the main benefit of the system has been the improved consistency of quality: 'Previously, it was all a bit like cooking: each shift would produce slightly different results. We now have precise data on the history of each tube. We know precisely which alarms have been set off for each tube and why. We know precisely which tubes are likely to be faulty and we can localise a defect to a 50cm length. We can react much more quickly to problems, so there is less waste. 'We expect to be able to cut bar inspection time by 30 per cent and to have fewer production stoppages, fewer defects and improved output of tubes for despatch. All these improvements mean the plant can now look to increase production from 480,000 tons to 600,000 tons next year, enough to meet all the needs of the three tube finishing plants, which currently buy some tubes from outside Vallourec. In addition, the information and suggested corrective action provided by the system allow the whole process to be run by less experienced people. 'You normally need 10 years' experience for continuous casting but with this system people can learn much more quickly and can do it with one year's experience,' says Mr Boussard. Cap Sesa retains the copyright to the software, as is usual in software development contracts. It hopes to use at least some of the software in other projects and is already adapting parts of it for an oil platform system for Elf. In addition, Cap Sesa is promoting the total system to other steelworks with the help of Vallourec under a separate, confidential, commercial arrangement.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Profit from choice - Richard Fairman finds it difficult to keep up with the quantity and range of classical music on offer THIS has certainly been a year when the record industry has made the news, though not always for the recordings it was producing. It seems record company managers spend most of their time in court or even - for a few memorable sessions - in the House of Commons Committee rooms. The most most memorable image of 1993 was Gerald Kaufmann and the industry Chairman at loggerheads across the table, each doing his best to shout down the other on the question of CD prices. Meanwhile, a European court delivered judgment in a test case regarding bootleg recordings of Elton John; and, in London, George Michael is still in court trying to extricate himself from his contract with his record company, Sony. On the question of pricing, the industry argument has always been that the profit on successful CDs funds risk-taking elsewhere. I do not know whether that is the logic behind the flood of new classical recordings that continues to pour on to the market-place, but it is difficult to keep up with the quantity and range of CDs being offered to consumers. Gerald Kaufmann and David Mellor are on opposite sides of the CD pricing debate, but it became clear in the reporting of the House of Commons enquiry that both have a partiality to the recordings of the middle-sized British company, Hyperion. I share that enthusiasm and particularly admire the company's growing number of imaginative song records. The CD of Margaret Price singing with grand and mature beauty in Schumann (CDA 66596) may not be to all tastes, but it is very special and definitely to mine. Probably the most newsworthy event in artistic terms has been the launch of Decca's series entitled 'Entartete Musik'. This is devoted to music destroyed or banned by dictatorial political regimes and its first two issues were of operas from Nazi Germany - Krenek's Jonny spielt auf and Korngold's Der Wunder der Heliane. Both are admirably well performed and recorded. The Krenek (436 631-2) is the more original opera, a strange blend of art at its most popular and its most dense; the Korngold (436 636-2), an old-fashioned romantic spectacular, is the safer bet. For an example of the technical art of recording at its most advanced the best choice is Debussy's Le Martyre de Saint Sebastien (Sony SK 48240), a mystical orchestral pageant with speech and song. The sound quality transports the listener away to an other-worldly ambience, in which Debussy's music sounds even more ravishing than usual. Michael Tilson Thomas conducts the London Symphony Orchestra and exemplary vocal soloists. Another London orchestra - the Royal Philharmonic under Vladimir Ashkenazy - gave an excellent account of itself in a CD of Walton's two symphonies (Decca 433 703-2). The performance of the First might have kept the symphony more single-mindedly on the path to its Hollywood-like final curtain; but the Second is beautifully done, lyrical, sensuous, glowing with Mediterranean colours, another splendid recording. In the year of the Maastricht showdown I cannot resist the temptation of selecting Elgar's often memorable early cantata Caractacus. The new recording by the LSO under Richard Hickox (Chandos CHAN 9156/7) has many strengths and the work's unashamedly patriotic text has taken on a delightful topicality. The final chorus could be the Eurosceptics' rallying-cry: 'On though the world desert you, on so your cause be right; Britons alert] and fear not'. To move further afield, the opening-up of contacts in Russia continues to bring the country's cultural glories to a wider audience. An agreement between Philips and the Kirov Opera of St. Petersburg is well into its stride and has scored its most notable success so far with a highly recommendable version of Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades (438 141-2). The cast features leading lights from the new generation of Russian singers, who have been causing such a stir in opera-houses worldwide. Unfortunately, we said farewell this year to one of the most eminent of post-war singers: Boris Christoff, who died in June. His art was far from exhaustively documented on record, but the recordings that we do have capture his larger-than-life personality as vividly as could be. EMI's reissue of the 1955 set of Verdi's Don Carlos (CMS 7 64642-2) in which he sings an unforgettable King Philip proved well-timed. Finally, an absolute winner. It almost seems a cliche to include a CD which has already won the Gramophone 'Record of the Year' award, but Anne Sofie von Otter's recital of Grieg songs (DG 437 521-2) cannot be neglected. This is marvellously spontaneous singing, which raises the stature of Grieg's songs to an altogether higher level: a splendid tribute to the composer in his 150th anniversary year.</p>

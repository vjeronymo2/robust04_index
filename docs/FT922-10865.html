			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Shareholders express preference - The Battle for Midland A BIDDING war for Midland between Lloyds Bank and Hongkong Bank would almost certainly be won by the UK clearer, according to shareholders of the banks and analysts yesterday. It also became clear that many Midland shareholders, most of whom are based in the UK, would prefer a Lloyds offer than one from Hongkong Bank. 'If there were two solid bids on the table, Lloyds would win hands down,' said one Scottish fund manager, summing up the attitude of Midland shareholders around the country. Lloyds said its projected offer, worth 447p a share last night, could be justified economically on projections of profits from Midlands' operations, together with projected annual savings of Pounds 700m within four years from combining the two businesses. Its shareholders could expect further potential gains from any increase in income following a takeover, for instance from selling insurance policies to Midland customers. Further income could also come from the sale of some branches, one of the plans to make the takeover more acceptable to the competition authorities. Both leave more room for Lloyds to increase its offer if need be. 'Midland is worth considerably more to Lloyds' shareholders than to Hongkong Bank's,' one Lloyds adviser commented. However, the extent to which the extra profits would find their way to Lloyds' shareholders is unclear. 'Those benefits won't just flow to shareholders,' said Mr Colin Wilks, Lloyds' chief finance officer. Customers would also benefit from the savings, he added - an argument which is key to Lloyds' ability to convince the competition authorities to accept its plans. Yesterday, the bank would provide no further details of expected future income the merged bank could create, or how much of that would be ploughed back in investment. Midland shareholders yesterday expressed a preference both for the price which Lloyds plans to offer, and for Lloyds as an enlarged group. HKB, some said, was seeking Midland precisely because it would like to reduce its own exposure to Hong Kong and move into other markets. Meanwhile, a higher offer from Hongkong Bank would initially please neither Hong Kong's stock market nor the Chinese, both of which, for different reasons, would regard it as a mistake. China has had a largely positive reaction so far to Hongkong Bank's move on Midland. But underlying its comments has been the view that the bank is paying enough by offering 378p a share. A higher offer from Hongkong Bank, which would almost certainly be in the form of more equity and not cash, would probably be criticised by mainland Chinese interest in the colony. It is unclear, however, if such criticism would be turned into action which could prejudice the bank's operations in Hong Kong. The announcement of Lloyds bid had the immediate effect of adding around HKDollars 2.50 to Hongkong Bank's share price. The strength of its share price - which closed yesterday at Dollars HK42.75 - has added some Pounds 300m to the theoretical value of its bid. However, it remains Pounds 300m less than the putative Lloyds offer.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rise as investors await money supply data US TREASURY prices extended their gains yesterday afternoon, shrugging off signs of further improvement in the US labour market, but turnover was light as investors awaited the late afternoon release of weekly money supply figures. In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up  1/2 at 101 19/32 , yielding 7.854 per cent. Intermediate issues posted similar gains, while at the short end the two-year note was  1/8 higher for a yield of 5.192 per cent. Bond prices initially slipped on the back of a decline in jobless claims in the week ended May 16. The number of claims fell 4,000 to 403,000 when the market had expected them to rise by about 3,000. But the lower prices encouraged some retail buying. The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange four-day repurchase agree ments. Analysts said the Fed was facing a large requirement for additional funds and the Fed's operation, which adds liquidity to the banking system, was widely expected. Fed funds, the rate at which banks lend to each other, were chang ing hands at about 7 7/8 per cent at the time of the Fed's action. The perceived target for the rate is 3 3/4 per cent. UK long-dated government bonds rose up to a quarter of a percentage point in dull trade yesterday, but gains at the short end of the yield curve were held in check now that hopes of another cut in the base rate have faded. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 climbed from 118 1/8 to end the day at 118 13/32 . News that the latest Pounds 150m tranche of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2020 was exhausted yesterday afternoon helped to buoy up the index-linked sector of the market, traders said. The tranche was one of two Pounds 150m taps of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock announced on May 20. The other tranche, due 2013, was exhausted on May 21. However, a Pounds 800m issue of 9 per cent conversion stock due 2000 is still overhanging the market, and dealers expect the Bank to set the date for another gilt auction fairly soon. JAPANESE government bonds ended the day firmer, helped by the slightly stronger yen and a rebound in US Treasury bond prices early in the day. The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened at 5.59 per cent, corresponding to the low price of the day, and ended at 5.555 per cent. Volumes were low, with only Y233bn traded in the benchmark No 129 JGB. The September futures contract moved from its opening of 101.35 to a high of 101.44 before closing at 101.42. The dollar traded above Y130 overnight at 130.20, but the Bank of Japan intervened yesterday morning to support the yen, which ended trading at around 129.75. POSITIVE economic data pushed Australian government bond yields higher yesterday, particularly among the short-dated issues. Company profits jumped 13 per cent in the March quarter, whereas analysts had expected an increase of only 10 per cent. The news prompted a sell-off in the bond market. 'The stronger figures were taken as an indication that the recession is bottoming out which makes the chances of another easing in interest rates less likely now,' said one dealer. April 1995 Commonwealth bonds closed weaker, yielding 7.97 per cent against Wednesday's close of 7.82 per cent. The benchmark November 2001 Commonwealth bond yield also rose, finishing the day at 9.19 per cent, compared with 9.12 per cent the previous day. THE EUROPEAN government bond markets saw little activity yesterday as many were closed for the Ascension Day holiday, and traders expect activity to be lacklustre today as well. German government bond futures edged up in London trading as dealers covered their short positions. Italian bonds eased lower with cash and futures prices moving down in thin trading. Operators attributed the losses to covering ploys ahead of the expiry of the Liffe June futures contract. The cash market had been awaiting the results of the Treasury auction for L3,000bn June 1, 1999, CCTs. The price of 97.75, announced after the close, was in line with forecasts. It is the first of three issues for a total of L10,000bn, with L3,000bn of fixed-rate 10-year bonds (BTP) being auctioned today.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Detroit car makers avoid collision - Nancy Dunne sees US anti-dumping cases dropped THE Big Three US car makers yesterday backed away from their threat to file dumping cases against Japanese car companies but said they would continue to 'monitor the situation'. While Detroit was announcing this decision, the Association of International Automobile Dealers was interviewing lawyers to explore legal options to counter the threat of protectionist moves against the US industry. However, Mr Philip Hutchinson, association president, said the industry group, which represents 17 foreign producers, would probably now defer its own legal action. 'There is a silver lining in all this - particularly for the consumer,' Mr Hutchinson said. Chrysler, Ford and General Motors issued a formal statement saying they wanted to 'give the Clinton administration the opportunity to develop its position on trade and jobs'. This would 'bring broader results in the near term than proceeding with a dumping suit at this time'. Meanwhile they will share 'the compelling data we have developed in our analysis of dumping with senior members of the administration'. The Big Three had several reasons to refrain from filing dumping cases. The administration is believed to have discouraged the complaints; it is already battling a protectionist image, incurred by the imposition of duties on the steel cases and proposed sanctions against the EC in a government procurement dispute. There are widespread fears in the industry that after the disastrous Big Three trade mission to Japan last January with President George Bush, the dumping action would just bring more bad publicity. The companies could find themselves denigrated as 'wimps' or poor losers by their critics and the public alike. This would come at a time when Detroit's reputation for quality is improving and it is benefiting from the end of the recession and growing demand. Rebates, given as a lure to car shoppers, have begun to decline, and Chrysler has had a profitable year and General Motors could have its first for several years. US trade officials say there was no certainty that the Big Three could prove dumping had occurred and had injured the US industry. While US car companies have been slashing their prices to gain market share, Japanese car prices have been rising. All the companies are so linked internationally that the US manufacturers may well be shooting themselves in the foot if they seek government action against their rivals. After all, one out of 10 car imports is now brought into the US by Detroit. GM has supply and technology arrangements with Honda and Isuzu, a joint venture with Nissan, market distribution arrangements with Renault and Saab and a manufacturing and assembly relationship with Volvo. 'The question is: 'Who is the US industry?'' said Mr Michael Coursey, a Washington trade lawyer. 'Toyota? Nissan? Honda? At the end of the day, it might not matter.' US trade lawyers say the foreign manufacturers in the US have a number of legal options against the dumping cases. They can bring an anti-trust action if they can prove the American industry is acting in collusion to raise prices. Foreign-owned companies which manufacture in the US could seek legal standing as US producers in order to file dumping cases against the cars brought in by the Big Three.  -------------------------------------------------               US CAR MARKET - 1992  ------------------------------------------------- Total market                    8,211,236 of which imports                1,994,748  ------------------------------------------------- Japanese car makers:  ------------------------------------------------- Toyota/Lexus                      418,661 Honda/Aeura                       293,127 Nissan/Infiniti                   269,379 Mazda                             169,007 Mitsubishi                         90,988 Subanu                             49,687 Suzuki                              6,098 Isuzu                               7,823 Daihatsu                            5,026  ------------------------------------------------- European:  ------------------------------------------------- Alfa Romeo                          2,828 Aston Martin                           60 Volkswagen/Audi                    87,950 BMW                                65,691 Ferrari                               960 Jaguar                              8,681 Lamborghini                           156 Lotus                                 375 Maserati                              240 Mercedes-Benz                      63,312 Peugeot                               335 Porsche                             4,115 Rolls-Royce/Bentley                   392 Saab                               26,377 Volvo                              67,916 Yugo                                1,412  ------------------------------------------------- Korean:  ------------------------------------------------- Hyundai                           108,549  ------------------------------------------------- American:  ------------------------------------------------- General Motors                     93,917 Chrysler                           62,174 Ford                               89,512  ------------------------------------------------- *This excludes light trucks (including minivans), sales of which totalled 4.68m in 1992  ------------------------------------------------- Source: Automotive News  -------------------------------------------------</p>

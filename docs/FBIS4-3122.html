			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Mao Jing (3029 0079): "The Aviation Industry </F> of China and the Beijing Municipal Government Jointly Manage  Beijing Aeronautical and Astronautical University"]    [Excerpts] On the afternoon of 1 April at the Great Hall of  the People, the Aviation Industry of China and the Beijing  Municipal People's Government held a ceremony to sign the  agreement on jointly managing Beijing Aeronautical and  Astronautical University. Zhu Yuli, general manager of the  aviation industry of China; and Li Qiyan, mayor of the  municipality, signed the agreement.    Beijing Aeronautical and Astronautical University is a  famous  university in our country. Over the past 40 years or so since  its founding, the university has cultivated more than 40,000  skilled persons for our country's aeronautical and astronautical  industries and some other economic spheres. This university has  rich teaching forces, many branches of learning, 36  undergraduate specialized courses, 60 master courses, 20  doctorate courses, 3 academicians of Chinese Academy of  Sciences, 82 teachers for the students engaged in the study of  doctorate, and nearly 10,000 students. The joint management of  this university between the Aviation Industry of China and the  Beijing Municipal government is a result from the mutual  cooperation to promote educational reform and development and is  to create conditions for further bringing into play the  university's advantages and potentials of cultivating  high-layered and high- quality skilled persons, making  high-scientific and high- technological research, participating  in the "211" project, and developing itself into the first-grade  university.    According to the agreement, the university should jointly be  managed by the both sides. The university will still be  administratively subordinate to the Aviation Industry of China  and its investment system and outlay channels will not be  changed. The university will continue to cultivate skilled  persons to meet the needs of the aeronautical industry and  undertake and also fulfill the tasks assigned by the aviation  industry of China. The Beijing Municipal Government will  support the university's reform and development, bring the  university into line with the municipal plan for higher  educational and scientific and technological development, and  support the university to conduct educational reform on a trial  basis. The municipal government will put the university's new  area project and campus reconstruction project as well as some  of its key projects, including the projects built with the funds  invested and donated by foreign firms, including Ruina Group,  into the list of the municipal key construction projects. The  aviation industry of China will support the university to  positively help the university upgrade its teachers' quality and  cultivate urgently-needed higher- level skilled persons and to  serve the municipality's scientific and technological progress,  economic construction, and urban development. Through  consultation, both sides will cooperatively organize the  university leading group and jointly study and solve the key  problems cropping up in the course of joint management.    Cheng Xitong extended greetings to the signing of the  agreement. He said that going into real action is better than  outlines. I hope that the agreement will not become a mere  scrap of paper. He urged that we should actually fulfill the  agreement, do solid work, and realize the agreement. [passage  omitted]    Xie Guang, chairman of the scientific work committee under  the Ministry of National Defense; and Zhang Xiaowen, vice  chairman of the state education commission, made speeches at the  ceremony. They expressed their support to the joint management  of the university and believed that the university would make  progress.    Present at the signing ceremony were leaders of state  departments and commissions concerned and Beijing Municipality,  including Lin Zongtang, Gan Ziyu, Zhu Lilan, Gao Zhenning, Xu  Boling, Zhang Yanzhong, Li Zhijian, Tao Xiping, Hu Zhaoguang,  Chen Dabai, and Fan Yuanmo.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Advertiser calls Mirror 'sleazy and stupid' A NUMBER of Daily Mirror advertisers yesterday reacted sharply to the paper's publication of surreptitious gym pictures of the Princess of Wales. Britannia Building Society, which had an advertisement in yesterday's Mirror, described the paper's actions as 'sleazy and incredibly stupid', and said it would review its advertising policy when its present series came to an end. The Royal Automobile Club, which was dismayed to find its advertisement yesterday opposite a picture of the Princess in a leotard, was the first to cancel advertising. Mr Jeffrey Rose, RAC chairman, said: 'The RAC does not condone, much less support, this unwarranted intrusion, and, in consequence, advertising with Mirror Group Newspapers has been discontinued.' The action was in line with advice given yesterday by Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission. Partly because the PCC has no power other than the power of censure Lord McGregor suggested that the Daily Mirror and the Sunday Mirror should be regarded as 'outlaws' and treated accordingly by readers and advertisers. Autoglass, the windscreen replacement company, said it would be dropping advertisements from the Mirror 'for the foreseeable future'. It added: 'It is important for our ads to be carried in papers that people respect and admire.' But WH Smith said it would be 'taking things to extremes to consider withdrawing advertising', and HMV and Vauxhall said they did not take advertising decisions based on the editorial policy of newspapers. At the LA Fitness Club in Isleworth, west London, where the pictures were taken, none of the 1,000 Pounds 500-a-year members had resigned, according to Mr Max Clifford, the public relations consultant. 'There have been a couple of irate phone calls but nobody has resigned,' said Mr Clifford, who is acting for Mr Bryce Taylor, the 39-year-old New Zealander who owns a majority stake in the club. Mr Taylor admits setting up the concealed camera which took the pictures, for which he is believed to have received Pounds 100,000 from the Sunday and Daily Mirror. 'With my contacts these pictures will sell for Pounds 1m worldwide,' said Mr Clifford. The decision to publish the pictures in yesterday's Daily Mirror did not pass unchallenged by the newspaper's management. On Sunday, after the first batch of photographs was published in the Sunday Mirror, and the condemnations were starting to come in, Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of Mirror Group Newspapers, asked Mr David Banks if he had any doubts about publishing. The Daily Mirror editor replied he had none - at MGN the editor's word is final while he is editor. As the Daily Mirror put it yesterday: 'Our motto always was: Publish and be damned.' Last night it seemed everyone, from the Princess to the rest of the British press - which now fears legislation - was ready to oblige.</p>

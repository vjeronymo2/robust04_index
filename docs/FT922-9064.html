			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Sport: Sweet Sandy swings back - Golf THE sounds of approval that greeted the victory by Sandy Lyle in the Italian Open last Sunday could be heard from Land's End to John O'Groats. Lyle may be the most popular professional golfer on the European tour, One who does what he says he will do, never forgets a friend though a face might sometimes escape him. He remains impressively consistent, whether in victory or in defeat. Lyle is more than just the most popular of men. He may be the most naturally gifted player, more so than Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer, even than Ian Woosnam. He was an infant prodigy who was making sweet music with his golf clubs at an extraordinarily early age. At three, when he could comfortably pass underneath the handle of a trolley, he was able to hit a golf ball 100 yards or so with his teeny-weeny clubs. Alexander Walter Barr Lyle is a Shropshire lad who was born in Shrewsbury and grew up in the picture postcard village of Weston-under- Penyard. It is a forgotten area, which time seems to have passed by, down just off the Whitchurch-Shrewsbury road. There were trees to climb, caves to explore, a church with a lych gate. Mostly, though, he played golf. He was fat as a child and his nickname was Podge. Therein lies the root of his erratic and ungainly backswing. It was the only way he could get the club around his stomach. In his early teens he contracted German measles and retired to bed for three weeks. While in bed he grew three inches and lost two stone. Although he was no longer a fat boy, he retained his eccentric backswing. There are many stories about Lyle. My own favourite tells you something about him. I am sure it is apocryphal but if you promise not to tell anyone, then I will repeat it. In 1988 on the night of the third round of the US Masters, a couple of mischievous journalists came upon Sandy's enormous shoes in the clubhouse at Augusta. One of the journalists scribbled a note on a piece of paper and slipped in to Lyle's shoe. 'This is your left shoe, Sandy,' it said. The next day Lyle marched to victory, a victory that was marked by his fantastic bunker shot on the 18th. At the end of the round he removed his left shoe, found the piece of paper inside it and said: 'I wondered what that was.' In 1985 Lyle became the first Briton since Tony Jacklin in 1969 to win the Open. It is typical of him that the next day a marquee was erected in the garden of his home at Wentworth and friends and journalists were invited round. Sandy washed the dishes in the kitchen. That is Sandy Lyle for you: Open champion one day, kitchen skivvy the next. In 1987 I began to write a book with Dave Musgrove, Lyle's caddie. The idea had been suggested several years earlier but Christine Lyle, who was Sandy's wife, put her foot down. By 1987, Lyle's marriage had ended and all barriers to our book had therefore been withdrawn. I started work immediately. It was a memorable experience for two reasons. The first was that it allowed me to get to know Musgrove better. A man with a saying for every day of the month, he became a friend, a guide through the sometimes superficial world of professional golf. While writing the book I gained an insight in to the core of the professional tour. And I lost count of the number of flattering comments Dave made about his boss, and the perks that came Musgrove's way, courtesy of Lyle, from first-class air flights to five-star accommodation. 'Sandy is the best bloke in the world to caddie for' Musgrove said at the time. 'My wages must be the best on tour and when I stay at his home at Wentworth he brings me tea in the morning.' In 1989 Lyle returned to Augusta to defend his US Masters title. With him was his father Alex and his mother Agnes. Walking around watching an obviously out-of-form Sandy was taxing for Lyle senior. He could not make out what was wrong. One minute Lyle would whistle out an enormous drive and fluff the second shot, the next he would three-putt. 'You know what pleases me most, more than seeing Sandy win championships?' asked Alex. 'It is seeing the respect Sandy is held in by his fellow professionals. Every one has a word for him. That makes me very proud.' No more than the the rest of the golf world is of his son. Welcome back Sandy.</p>

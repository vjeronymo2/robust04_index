			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BEING A 'CONSERVATIVE' DOESN'T MEAN LACK OF FEELING OR CARING  </P> <P> I must take issue with Costa Mesa City Councilman Orville Amburgey's recent  characterization of my decision to allow charities and social services funded  by Community Development Block Grants to continue their vital work of trying to  help people in our communities as "not conservative."  </P> <P> Conservative, in my view, is not a synonym for lack of feeling or caring, nor  should conservative be anti-immigrant or anti-human rights.  </P> <P> Quite the contrary, I believe a philosophical conservative can work for  progress, change, reform and helping people help themselves in the tradition of  Jefferson, Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> As President Bush reminds us, a "kinder, gentler" America is not inconsistent  with working on policies -- such as the free trade zone agreement with  President Oscar Salinas de Gortari -- which will benefit both Mexico and  California -- indeed, all of America.  </P> <P> Immigrants do not come to America for welfare, they come here to seek  opportunity and a better life for themselves and their children. While a  country has a right -- and a duty -- to control immigration at its borders, it  would be a sorry commentary on our society if we started dividing people in our  own communities into "us" versus "them" in order to deny "them" even necessary  emergency services, shelter or food. Such an approach can lead only to racial  stereotyping and discrimination.  </P> <P> Social service agencies are granted federal funds to deliver community  services. They need to spend their time helping people, not turning themselves  into mini-bureaucracies or immigration departments.  </P> <P> I would also like to point out to Mr. Amburgey that names like San Diego, Los  Angeles and Costa Mesa should serve as powerful reminders that newcomers to  Southern California have always come from the south, not just the east. Those  who have been blessed by this land should attempt to be a blessing to others.  </P> <P> JACK KEMP  </P> <P> Secretary  </P> <P> U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  </P></p>

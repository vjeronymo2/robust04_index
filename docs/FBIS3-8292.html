Monika Olejnik spoke to the professor,  who is now working for the UN European Economic Commission in  Geneva:    [Begin Rosati recording] I would like to have a sufficient  degree of autonomy and independence in managing economic  affairs, which would ensure the effectiveness of the economic  policy. To put it briefly, the aim would be that the government  should speak with one voice on economic affairs.    Second, I would like to have the approval of the prime  minister and of those who will decide that it is I who should be  looking after finances and economic affairs--an approval with  respect to the general directions of economic policy--not just  for three months but perhaps for a medium-term period. [end  recording]    The coalition partners will discuss Prof. Rosati's candidacy  on 8 March.    The president will decide whether to approve Prof. Rosati's  nomination after his return to Poland, Andrzej Drzycimski, the  president's spokesman, told PAP. Lech Walesa is returning to  Poland tomorrow. Drzycimski said that the coalition should make  decisions that are acceptable to the president. However, as to  the question of whether the decision on Prof. Rosati's candidacy  was acceptable to Walesa, Drzycimski only said: I do not know.  Some time ago, the president said that he would not accept  Rakowski [Poland's former communist prime minister].</p>

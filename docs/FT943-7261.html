			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Societies caution on housing growth Benefits from sharp falls in provisions against bad and doubtful debts were reflected in increased pre-tax profits for the first half of this year reported yesterday by two of the UK's larger building societies. However, both societies expressed caution about future growth in the housing market, saying that they expected only slow and gradual recovery. Bradford &amp; Bingley, the seventh largest society, recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 79.2m in the six months to the end of June - a 35 per cent rise on last time's Pounds 58.8m. Provisions fell steeply to Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 28.3m), and assets rose to Pounds 14.1bn (Pounds 13.3bn). Pre-tax profits at Bristol &amp; West, the 10th largest society, rose to Pounds 26m (Pounds 20.4m), after Pounds 7m restructuring costs had been taken into account. Provisions fell to Pounds 21.1m (Pounds 33.1m), while assets rose slightly to Pounds 8.2bn (Pounds 8bn). Mr John Burke, B&amp;W chief executive, said that the society planned to securitise some Pounds 150m of its commercial lending, as a way of demonstrating the high quality of the loan book and releasing resources which could then be used in other lending. Securitisation allows lenders to take loans off their balance sheet. They place the assets in a special-purpose vehicle which then raises money by selling the debt securities to investors. Interest on the so-called 'mortgage-backed' securities is funded by the loan repayments. Mr Burke said that the society had cut the proportion of funding it was raising on the wholesale money markets to 22.8 per cent at the end of June, compared with 25.1 per cent at the end of 1993. As a further element in strengthening B&amp;W's operations as it recovers from a period in which it had high provisions and costs, the society is restructuring its estate agency business under the Hamptons brand name. B&amp;W's cost/income ratio was 52 per cent (53 per cent) for the group, while that for the society alone was 42 per cent (43 per cent). Mr John Smith, Bradford &amp; Bingley's finance director, said that B&amp;B's cost/income ratio had risen slightly from 46 per cent to 47 per cent. This was partly because intensifying competition was putting pressure on income through narrower margins, he said.</p>

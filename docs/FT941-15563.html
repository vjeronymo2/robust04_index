			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (8): Remarkably few problems - Materials handling system One of the best ways to grasp the scale of the FGD project at Drax is to consider some of the statistics generated by the materials handling facility which has been built over the past three years by Birtley Engineering, part of Taylor Woodrow. Going round the facility is a varied experience. In part it is a mountain walk - through a store 210m long by 38m wide that can hold as much as 60,000 tonnes of gypsum. Elsewhere, it turns into a stiff climb up one of the steeper of the 3.2km of conveyors. En route, visitors pass through the dedicated rail handling building, which can unload 1,500 tonnes of limestone from a train in 60 minutes, and load 1,000 tonnes of gypsum in 100 minutes. The system is the most visible part of the 'common plant' that supports all three pairs of FGD units being built by Babcock Energy. It is a panoply of hoppers, conveyors, drag-link feeders, scraper reclaim machines, belt weighers, trash screens, magnetic separators and other materials handling equipment. Individually, all the equipment is of a kind tried and tested in other material handling applications. 'There are no prototypes here,' says Mr Ivan Harris, Birtley's engineering director. What is new is the collective use to which the components have been put. No other FGD projects approach Drax in the scale of the materials handling challenge. Counterparts in Europe are much smaller and rely on road transport for delivering limestone and ferrying away the gypsum. At Drax, National Power has to use rail for the bulk of its transport needs, so in that respect it had to start designing the handling system from scratch. In other respects, the system's designers could look around at other FGD plants and draw on the considerable materials handling knowledge already within National Power and its antecedent, the Central Electricity Generating Board. The Drax power station alone handles 10m tonnes of coal a year and 500,000 tonnes of ash byproducts. Just as with the main FGD process itself, engineers had various alternatives to examine when working out how to design a system that, when fully operational, will typically handle 600,000 tonnes of limestone a year and 800,000 to 1m tonnes of gypsum byproduct. There were, for example, three main ways that the gypsum could be moved round the system, says Mr Alan Myers, a National Power project engineer who has worked on the Drax FGD materials handling project since 1988: pneumatic conveying through pipes, slurrifying it, and conveying it as a powder. The first two would have required drying equipment and big tanks respectively, and using conveyors was the preferred method in Germany, Japan and the US. Similarly, in discussions with several equipment suppliers and users, it decided that a batch loading system in the rail handling building would work better than a silo system. Batch loading would be more economical for an FGD operation of Drax's scale. The end result was a system that is conservative in design, with considerable duplication of equipment such as hoppers, reclaim machines and conveyor belts to ensure security of supply, along with proven individual plant. Mr Paul Chapman, National Power's project manager at Drax, says this was partly because the CEGB was inherently conservative in its design methods. 'But it was probably right to be so in this case, given the size of the project,' he adds. It was also a design that casts National Power and its predecessor in the role of 'informed customer,' as Mr Chapman puts it. As well as laying down the performance criteria of the system - which is as far as many utilities go nowadays in designing power stations or related projects - it was also quite specific about the type of plant to be used. However, if the end result bears a striking resemblance to the original CEGB specification, much of the detailed design work was carried out by Mr Harris and his team at Birtley, which in 1989 won a closely-fought contest for the contract, worth Pounds 24m-25m currently. Birtley specialises in such contracts, and was responsible for purchasing all the plant from subcontractors, apart from sampling equipment which it makes itself. The project is essentially in two halves, each of which has a store in the middle. The first begins with the limestone being dropped from the rail wagons into hoppers and taken via conveyors to the limestone store, which can hold about 45,000 tonnes - about 14 days' supply depending on the type of coal used. It is then reclaimed from the store, passed through trash screens - giant sieves - and magnetic separators before ending up in the process plant bunkers, which represents the start of the Babcock contract. At the other end, the gypsum material handling route begins as it leaves Babcock's dewatering plant building, from where it is taken to the gypsum store. From there it is reclaimed and conveyed directly to the rail loading facility, or the road facility for shorter journeys. Because gypsum is tacky, and still damp from the FGD process, it was important to avoid any bunkers between the store and the rail building, says Mr Harris. The feature of both stores is the reclaim equipment - in each case, two portal scraper reclaim machines which move along the store automatically and pick up the material with chain scrapers suspended from a portal frame. The equipment, made by PWH in Germany and incorporating Hungarian steel fabrications, is the only non UK-sourced plant in the materials handling project. Designers of the materials handling system have had to bear a number of factors in mind. First, they have had to ensure it does not conflict with the normal operation of the plant and its transport arrangements. In particular, the rail link has involved nearly 5km of extra track and has been designed with two spur lines to avoid snarling up traffic on the Aire Valley rail network, which is vital for delivery of coal trains to Drax. Secondly, the design has had to take the environment into account. The stores and conveyor belts are covered, and dust control equipment has been installed at each limestone conveyor transfer point. Not least, though, the design has had to keep running costs at a minimum and give station operators as much flexibility as possible. Mr Tim Clarke, production manager at Drax, says the materials handling system would be unmanned to all intents and purposes, apart from two men to handle the loading and unloading of the trains. The system will be monitored by closed-circuit television. Final proof of how the system works will not come until 1996 when the FGD project is completed. So far, however, it has come together with remarkably few problems - National Power for example, wants adjustments made to the gypsum store reclaimers to ensure batch loads are consistent, and other hitches have been minor. The success of the project is due partly to a good initial design and to a rigorous risk assessment exercise at Birtley, which had only recently been taken over by Taylor Woodrow when it won the contract and needed to prove itself to its new parent.</p>

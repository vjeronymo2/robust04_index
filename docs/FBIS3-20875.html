Jerzy Milewski currently holds in his hands  three functions: deputy minister of national defense; chief of  the National Security Office (BBN), which comes under the  Belweder's jurisdiction; and secretary of the National Defense  Committee.    Defense Minister Kolodziejczyk's expansion of Milewski's  duties in MON [Ministry of National Defense] is seen by the  coalition government as an attempt to prevent the coalition from  gaining access and influence in that ministry. Jerzy  Szmajdzinski of the SLD (Democratic Left Alliance), chairman of  the Sejm Commission on National Defense, is demanding that the  prime minister explicitly state the scope of Milewski's  authority. Lech Falandysz, the Belweder secretary of state, does  not think that Milewski's being dismissed from his position  comes into play because "the prime minister would have to take  into account that, following Milewski's dismissal, the MON chief  does not intend to propose anyone else, and, without his  recommendation, the prime minister cannot appoint anyone else."    Jerzy Milewski was born in 1935 in Lopuchowek. He completed  his studies at the Gdansk Polytechnic [Institute of Technology],  followed by a doctorate in 1966. He continued his scientific  career at the Institute of Flow Mechanics Machinery of PAN  (State Academy of Sciences) in Gdansk, at the University of  Illinois in Chicago, at Stanford University in California, and  at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was in charge  of the Coordination Office of NSZZ Solidarity [Independent  Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity"] in Brussels. Following  his return to Poland, he aligned himself with the presidential  center of power--he has headed the BBN since January 1991.    Milewski is divorced and has two children. In his free time,  he enjoys mountain climbing.</p>

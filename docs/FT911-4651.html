			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (4): Equities back in favour - A look at the typical exposure of UK managers SINCE the start of this year, the UK equities market has been characterised by strong upward movement, with progress to record levels apparently unhindered by a string of rights issues. Funds which last year backed the view that the market was historically cheap have reaped the rewards, but the average exposure to UK equities is as steady as ever. In recent weeks, the institutions appear to have been calling the shots as companies with urgent needs to strengthen their balance sheets have asked for cash. But there have been exceptions. Tesco, for example, timed its Pounds 572m cash call to perfection, and provided a coherent explanation of what the money was to be used for. Since January, its shares have performed in line with the rising market. Even weak stories have had a sympathetic reception. The market was not convinced by the explanation from Bass of how its Pounds 558m cash would be spent, but it took up its rights issue just the same. Distress calls, such as that from Costain, actually sent the company's share price higher. Cash calls and dividends have focused attention on the old question of short-termism. Institutional calls for dividends to be maintained through the recession have captured plenty of headlines, but the case is hard to fault if it is applied to the market as a whole. It is already obvious that dividend growth in the 1990s will be at a lower rate than the astonishing advances seen in the 1980s. Long-term growth should be a function of inflation plus growth in gross national product. Now that the UK is in the ERM, inflation should stabilise at a level well below that of recent years, so dividend growth might become more a function of GNP. Put another way, lower inflation will make real dividend growth easier to achieve. A quiet 1991 could be followed by a pick-up in economic activity next year as corporate profitability bounces back from the recession. In addition, the growing utilities sector, with built-in dividend growth from the privatised electricity and water companies, is helping to prop up the market's average dividend. Taking up their rights might be a convenient use of the institutions' cash and a cheap way of getting it into a rising market, but they are perhaps demonstrating a degree of humbug when they claim that industry was short-termist in running down its financial strength. Steady dividend growth may be the price companies have to pay for institutional loyalty. Recent figures from Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps) showed that the median UK pension fund had a UK equities exposure of between 54.9 and 56.7 per cent last year. The data was based on returns from 83 per cent of the full sample of 1,500 funds, but it seems clear that funds were making marginal increases to their exposure towards the year-end. Whether they changed their asset allocation in time to benefit substantially from the unexpected strength of the market so far this year remains to be seen. After an uninspiring January, the All-Share index powered ahead and managed a total return of 16.5 per cent in the first quarter, with smaller non-FT-SE stocks outperforming the biggest shares after a long period of underperformance. As for performance in 1990, the median UK equities fund returned a 9.3 per cent loss. That was much better than the 27 per cent negative return on overseas equities, but interestingly it was worse than the return on property assets. However, it seems there is little change in prospect for the dominance of UK equities as the favoured asset class. 1990 was a year in which it was possible for fund managers to claim significant outperformance of the UK market, simply by virtue of missing out on such corporate casualties as Polly Peck and British &amp; Commonwealth. Mr John Emly, Robert Fleming's investment director, beat the median performance by 2 per cent, returning -7.3 per cent. Fleming not only avoided the key disasters, but also scored by taking big positions in specific leading stocks. Mr Tom Crombie, who runs equities portfolios for Scottish Equitable, thinks that pension funds have too much exposure to UK equities and not enough diversification in overseas markets. He uses the analogy of the private investor - just as a stockbroker would advise a sensible spread of assets, so funds should have assets across a spread of markets. The bunching of UK funds' asset allocations is certainly remarkable - over 20 years, there has been little change in the 55-60 per cent held in UK equities, yet the returns have been variable. Few managers now doubt that pension funds should hold equities as the most sensible long-term asset class, but Scottish Equitable, for example, has half of its 90 per cent equity exposure overseas. According to Mr Crombie, Scottish Equitable actually managed to outperform the international indices. But its expertise overseas has been built up over a number of years. Funds going abroad for the first time can come unstuck. Last year Scottish Equitable's mix was very different, with 20 per cent cash, 10-15 per cent gilts and only 60-65 per cent in equities. 'The big asset allocation decision is the vital one, but too many UK funds flunk it,' says Mr Crombie. Mr Emly takes a rather different line. Robert Fleming is prepared to take weightings significantly different from the median depending on the client's tolerance for risk. The asset allocation decision is based on the customer's comfort level, but when there is clear value in UK equities - as there was, for example, when the yield ratio fell as low as 1.9 - the case for increasing exposure is strong. However, Fleming also believes that UK equities are the natural asset base for domestic funds with their sterling currency base. Equities give the appropriate emphasis to real assets, but fund managers can make tactical deviations into cash and bonds when the conditions are right.</p>

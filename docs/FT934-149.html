			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): More highs in region as Nikkei extends revival Japanese equities extended the recovery which they began in Tuesday's trading, as buying from arbitrageurs and investment trusts lifted the market, in volatile trading, on the final full day of activity in this calendar year, writes Wayne Lionel Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei-225 average rose 140.82 to settle at 17,272.03, after fluctuating between an intraday low of 17,036.30 and a high of 17,342.13. The Topix index of all first section issues ended 2.08 higher at 1,429.27. Japanese equity trading will end today after the morning session today. Turnover was estimated at 220m, compared with Tuesday's final 202m. Advances outpaced declines by 578 to 373, with 183 issues unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.93 to 1,182.9. In spite of the lack of trading volume, brokers said that the day's market sentiment reflected a lift in mood generally expected during this time of the month. Investors had widely hoped for a grand finale. The year-end finish was far from grand, but did result in positive territory, and moderately above the year-end finish of 1992, which was 16,924.95. Pressed and crisp, traders on the Tokyo Stock Exchange followed the tradition of applauding on the final day of stock transactions, but clearly there was scant reason for celebration. The Nikkei-225 average's overall performance for the year was lacklustre at best, and the key barometer still remains more than 50 per cent below its all-time peak of 38,915.87 posted in late 1989. On the trading floor, the automobile sector received a boost on reports of a proposed consumption tax cut for car purchases. Toyota ended Y30 higher at Y1,780, Honda advanced Y20 to Y1,500 and Isuzu Motors, which was one the most actively traded issues of the session, gained Y9 to Y344. Some consumer electronic issues were bought actively. Pioneer Electronic climbed Y110 to Y2,770, Sony rose Y30 to Y5,510 and Victor moved Y5 higher to Y835. The session's gains failed to push banking shares into positive territory. The Bank of Tokyo ended Y20 lower to Y1,470, Industrial Bank ended Y10 lower to Y2,800 and Sumitomo Bank fell Y30 to Y1,900. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 121.08 higher to 19,085.47, in volume of 29.8m shares. Roundup New highs were the rule in Asia, the exception being Hong Kong which saw profit taking. Seoul and Bombay were closed for holidays. SINGAPORE hit a new closing high for the third day this week in record volume, the Straits Times Industrial index ending 34.48 higher at 2,426.85 in 855m shares. Retail investors provided the impetus, with international fund managers divided over 1994 prospects. MANILA peaked on the last trading day of 1993 amid forecasts of another strong year in 1994. The composite index rose 30.43 to 3,196.08, lifted by Philippine Long Distance Telephone and Philippine National Bank which rose 10 pesos to 2,290 and 45 to 615 respectively. Combined turnover at Manila and Makati rose from 3.07bn pesos to 4.26bn. TAIWAN closed at a 29-month high as the market repeated Tuesday's pattern, with financials strong but most industrials down on profit-taking. The weighed index closed 36.32 up at 5,538.07 in turnover of TDollars 83.04bn. Heavy speculation was seen in financials and brokers worried that the mood, illogically, might have developed following the finance ministry's reimposition of a stock capital gains tax, of which details are expected by the end of this week. JAKARTA professionals thought that window-dressing might have helped the official index up another 15.32 to a new high of 587.88. KARACHI saw active buying by local institutions and foreign funds as the KSE-100 index rose 42.21 to another new peak of 2,143.41. AUSTRALIA closed just fractionally short of the post-1987 crash high of 2,132.4 reached on November 1, the All Ordinaries index rising 37.7 to 2,126.9 as it caught up after the Christmas break. Blue chips were almost all firmer, with BHP up 50 cents to ADollars 16.90 and News Corp up five to ADollars 9.75. NEW ZEALAND, also catching up with the US market, sent the NZSE-40 index up 46.79 to a nine-week high of 2,155.12. Brokers said that the steep fall in wholesale interest rates before Christmas was also a factor. HONG KONG dealers talked comfortably of consolidation as the Hang Seng index closed down 120.45, or 1 per cent at 11,449.77. Turnover remained strong, close to Tuesday's final HKDollars 9.61bn.</p>

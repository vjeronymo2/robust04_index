			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Gordeyev] </F>   [Text] Donetsk, 31 March TASS -- Ukraine's major industrial  area of Donbass (the Donetsk coal-mining basin) prefers speaking  Russian and joining the Commonwealth of Independent States,  according to the results of the consultative opinion polls held  last Sunday in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions.    The results published on Thursday indicated that out of 4.5  million voters casting their ballots in the local plebiscites,  over 3.6 million would like the Russian language to become that  of work, record-keeping, education and science in the area,  mainly populated by ethnic Russians.    The same 90 per cent of the voters agreed that the Russian  language should be granted the status of a second state language  throughout the Republic, which is to be sealed by the Ukrainian  Constitution.    The overwhelming majority of the voters also spoke in favour  of Ukraine's signing the CIS charter and joining, as a  full-fledged member, the economic union and the CIS  interparliamentary assembly.    Thus, Donbass has voiced its opinion. Time will show whether  it will be taken into consideration by Ukrainian authorities.  The Republican prosecutor general's office intends to press for  the resolution by the Donetsk regional council to be declared  null and void. But even if the court annuls the decisions of  the two regional councils, what can be done about the opinion  voiced by one seventh of Ukrainian citizens?</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Scottish Ballet dancers in ballot Forty dancers with Scottish Ballet are to hold a ballot on industrial action, up to and including strike action, over payment for daily training routines. Equity, their union, said the dispute was over whether the 75-minute class time at the start of the day should be treated as paid working time. It said the Royal Ballet and the Birmingham Royal Ballet both recognised class as working time, but Scottish Ballet refused to do so.</p>

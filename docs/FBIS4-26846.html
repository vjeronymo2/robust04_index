			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>   [Text] Beijing, June 26 (AFP) -- Prime Minister Li Peng  will be looking to reinforce China's economic miracle and win  back control of the country's foreign policy when he goes to  Europe this week. Li starts the two-week tour when he heads for  Austria on Tuesday. From there he will go on to Germany for a  week and then on to China's former main European ally, Romania.  Because of his serious heart problems, this will only be the  65-year-old prime minister's second trip abroad in two and a  half years.    President Jiang Zemin has instead taken the lead in foreign  affairs. In the past year, Jiang has been building up air miles  on foreign travel. The president, a rival to Li in any battle  for power in the post-Deng Xiaoping era, has earned political  prestige from appearences with world leaders, such as his  meeting with President Bill Clinton at last year's Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation forum.    "Li Peng is determined to retake control of foreign policy  that he lost in 1993 and match the good image Jiang Zemin has in  the West," said one European diplomat in Beijing.    Li will be concentrating diplomatic efforts on Germany,  China's main trading partner in Europe, where he will arrive on  Sunday. Zhao Ziyang, the man replaced as premier, was the last  head of government to visit Germany, back in 1985. Relations  between the two countries are good, even though Beijing  protested the visit last month to Germany by Tibetan spritual  leader the Dalai Lama. It was also unhappy at German Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel's meeting with Chinese dissident Wang  Juntao. According to German figures, two-way trade is growing.  Chinese exports grew 18.25 percent and German exports 67 percent  over the previous year. German firms are very active in China  and Chancellor Helmut Kohl harvested an impressive array of new  contracts on a visit to Beijing last November. Talks will  concentrate on economic issues, according to German sources in  Beijing. To help him, Li will be accompanied by 150 trade  experts and senior Chinese business leaders. Several contracts  are to be signed, some first discussed when Kohl was in Beijing.    The first stage of the tour in Austria will also concentrate  on trade. But in Romania, where Li will be from July 9 to July  12, he will renew an old friendship. When Nicolae Ceausescu was  president of Romania he made his country China's number one ally  in communist eastern Europe.    Li would have liked to visit France on the tour, following  the normalisation of ties between the two countries when Edouard  Balladur, the French premier, was in Beijing in April, analysts  said. But he was not invited. President Jiang Zemin, however,  was asked by President Francois Mitterrand and should go to  France in September. "Li Peng considers that to be an affront,"  a Chinese diplomat said. "Each time the problem is discussed it  makes him angry."    Britain is also not on the list. But a visit there is  unlikely while the dispute continues on how Hong Kong should be  run after the return to Chinese rule in 1997.</p>

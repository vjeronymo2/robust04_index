			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Goode and bad Sir, There have been two letters recently (October 2 and 4) expressing the view that the Goode committee's proposals do not have any negative implications for pension funds' exposure to equities. It is asserted that derivative instruments can be used to 'avoid a substantial shift away from equities' while giving sufficient protection against a fall in the market leading to a failure to satisfy minimum solvency standards. We agree that derivatives will play an important part in providing this protection, but disagree that their use does not alter equity exposure. Derivative instruments used in this context simply provide a less transparent means to reduce equity exposure. This is clear when one considers that investors on the other side of the put option contracts involved would be selling equities. Roger Urwin, R. Watson and Sons, Watson House, London Road, Reigate, Surrey RH2 9PQ</p>

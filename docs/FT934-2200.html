			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Jobs: Unreal dreams . . . and other sacrifices - Two contrasting viewpoints on the failure of theorists to chart the route to social progress One thing the Jobs column has marvelled at these past 20 years is that people as busy as you readers find time to glance through it at all. So it is probably tempting fate to start its last appearance before January by recommending books for you to pore over in the meantime. But, even at the risk of seeming bumptious to boot, that is what it is going to do. The reason is that the scarcely credible changes which have lately overtaken the world we work in are still far from fully appreciated, and the two tomes in question go a fair way towards driving them home. Take for example the demise of planned economies. Their failure to match up to the market-driven kind seems to strike most people as clear disproof of the socialist theory that co-operation could triumph over competitive human nature. But few of us apparently recognise that the same human foible is just as much an obstacle to the theory of free trade. One of the rare exceptions is the American author Edward Luttwak. His latest book argues that, while the break up of the Soviet Union may have ruled out military war between top nations, they are sure to go on battling with each other for industrial dominance, and it is only those armed with effective industrial policies that will be able to provide worthwhile jobs for large chunks of their population. Companies from the winning nations will buy up the losers' best outfits, transferring senior posts to their own home lands. Elsewhere, the highest hope for most natives will be a middle-management job in a group run colonial-style from abroad. Moreover, although the book's title is The Endangered American Dream1, Dr Luttwak makes clear that the danger he fears is not confined to the US. Indeed the country he holds up as a warning is Britain, which he thinks has already sacrificed much of its hope of prosperity to theoretical dreams of free trade. But the onslaught on such theories is taken still farther by the other book called Shame and Nececessity2 which, despite being less immediately relevant to workaday issues, is at least as good a read. Its author is the philosopher Bernard Williams, and his focus is the really ancient Greeks - those who lived before the heyday of Socrates in the fifth century BC. - who he thinks offer us important lessons, not least because their very different ideas of morality were by no means inferior to ours. Among other things, they were less reluctant to face the fact that might is often in effect the same thing as right, and were better at persuading holders of power that obligations go with it. For example, those seen to have misused their power did not expect to get away by keeping their admissions to the minimum feasible, and adopting a lower profile. The accepted penalty was a public display, not of mere guilt, but of shame which in the extreme case demanded suicide. In short, the oldest Greeks believed that the tolerable running of a society is dependent on the will of individual citizens to act morally - a view which has since been superseded by theories that social progress depends on suprahuman forces, such as Marx's dynamics of history and Adam Smith's invisible hand. Professor Williams argues that the theories have failed to serve as an adequate substitute for the personal moral code of the pre-Socratic Greeks. But his belief that we have much to learn from them doesn't extend to advising us to re-adopt their principles entirely, which the Jobs column thinks is in some ways a pity. Misuses of power strike me as on the increase, and if it takes shamings to curb them, so be it. Certainly I'd prefer to stop short of obliging offenders to shed their blood. But that would at least make for a more dignified mode of exit than the quiet acceptance of a few thousands from tax-payers' funds, with which sacked British ministers apparently soften their downfall nowadays. Finally this year to the more seasonal topic represented by the table to the right, which gives a guide to the cost of acquiring and trying to escape from a hang-over in 18 international centres. The figures have again been not just supplied, but double checked, by the Runzheimer consultancy of Rochester, Wisconsin. First comes the acquisition stage: the local prices of a litre apiece of particular although undisclosed brands of whisky and of vodka, followed by the average price of both as the 'on-cost'. The next four columns cover the attempt to escape: 100 branded aspirin, 36 Alka Seltzer (except in Tokyo and Cairo where they are apparently not on sale), and half a pound of instant coffee, which are also averaged out as the 'off-cost'. The final column lumps the on and the off together to give the total damage . . . to the pocket at any rate. Which said, I wish you all the compliments of the season, and hope to meet you again in the first week of January. 1 Simon &amp; Schuster.

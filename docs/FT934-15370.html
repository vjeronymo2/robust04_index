			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Frank Gates rises to Pounds 1.15m FRANK G Gates, the Ford distributor, reported profits of Pounds 1.15m before tax for the six months to June 30, but hit out at the motor manufacturer for adversely affecting margins on sales of new cars. The outcome, a sharp improvement on the depressed comparable figure of Pounds 216,000, came on turnover ahead 34 per cent to Pounds 34.6m (Pounds 25.8m). The east London-based group achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 886,000 for the full 1992 year. Earnings per share were 3.6p, against 0.68p at the same stage of last year and 3.65p for the full year. Profits on new cars were more than doubled, but Mr Edward Gates, chairman, sounded a cautious note stating: 'With hindsight, the way in which the reduction in new car discount was introduced by Ford has had a disastrous effect on new car margins, the extent of which may not be evident to some for a few more months.' In spite of increased volumes, new car departmental profits by the end of August had fallen to a level similar to August 1992. 'In my opinion the present difference in profits between new and used cars is exceptionally distorted,' Mr Gates said.</p>

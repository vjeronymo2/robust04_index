			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading The expiry of the August index options was the main feature in an otherwise lacklustre session in the derivatives, writes Joel Kibazo. The mid-morning expiry was without incident and total volume in the sector came to 34,232, of which 16,679 was done in the FT-SE 100 option and 7,923 in the Euro FT-SE option. Dixons was the busiest stock option with a total of 1,334 lots dealt. In futures, volume in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 was 10,415 lots as it ended the session at 3,208, up 9 on its previous close.</p>

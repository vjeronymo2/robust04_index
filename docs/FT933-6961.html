			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / New draft of S African constitution THE latest draft of South Africa's post-apartheid constitution, published yesterday, provides details for the first time of how executive power will be shared in the first government, proposing an effective white veto over areas such as the budget and national security. The issue of sharing power within the first post-apartheid cabinet has been the subject of months of bilateral negotiations between the African National Congress and the government. Yesterday's draft constitution effectively proposes that Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the ANC, should be South Africa's president and Mr FW de Klerk, the current president, the vice or deputy president. It stipulates that decisions within the cabinet should be taken by a special majority - yet to be set - and that in matters of budget, finance and national security, both the president and vice-president would have to agree. This would give the ruling National party, whose support is expected to be overwhelmingly white, an effective veto in these matters. Debate on the draft is due to begin tomorrow. The draft proposes that parties gain cabinet representation in proportion to their share of the vote in elections to parliament. It is understood Mr de Klerk opposes the idea of a deputy presidency, insisting on a more equal relationship between the leader of the majority party and others within the coalition. He is also understood to consider the powers granted to the deputy president insufficient. The draft constitution also sets out powers for regional governments, with only very limited areas reserved exclusively for the regions - including markets and pounds, town planning, roads and public transport  - with powers over regional taxation, education, health, and policing to be exercised concurrently with central government. Parties which favour federalism argue that this gives central government ultimate control over most important regional functions.</p>

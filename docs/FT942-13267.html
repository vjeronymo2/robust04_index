			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Arts: Spectral Acykbourn proves rather insubstantial / Review of 'Haunting Julia' at the Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough The joke shop boasts 'Turds all sizes', its window full of the artefacts that are the British seaside equivalent of the corn-dollies and beads of less richly endowed cultures. A few doors up an Italian restaurant advertises bologneseburgers and funghiburgers. This is Scarborough, Alan Ayckbourn country; English eccentricity concealing the dark side of social dysfunction, the ordinary honed into cheerful surrealism, normality distilled into the painful pretences with which we cheerfully blunder through the non-communication of normal life. Down on the Front a comedian called Mark Shakespeare is announced for April 23: a graceful tribute to the national poet's birthday from the world of stand-up or an amazing coincidence? Also advertised is a funny man called Kevin Bloody Wilson. Up at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in the Round we have Alan Noddy Ayckbourn. Noddy as in nodding; nodding as in Homer. For those of us who revere this bleakly funny playwright, his latest work, Haunting Julia, marks a sad falling-off. There have been intimations of the supernatural in Ayckbourn's work before, usually in the materialisation of evil (that red-lit presence in Woman in Mind, for instance); an uncompromising acknowledgement of eternally sullied human nature and our adversary the devil that walketh about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour, even in privet-hedged suburbia. But the latest play, a shortish three-hander, no interval, is an unequivocal ghost story. Joe, a doting father has bought the student digs where his brilliant composer daughter Julia killed herself at the age of 19. Twelve years later he has made the premises into a centre devoted to her memory. At its heart is the bedsit where she lived and died, roped off like the salon in a stately home, complete with audio guide on which an actress's voice speaks Julia's words in the first person. This takes a certain amount of swallowing to begin with, as does the fame of the premature late genius herself. The recent BBC Young Musician of the Year competition prompted interesting reminders of the strain put on young artists, the burn-out or depression that can result from premature pressures; but it seems unlikely that a composer, as opposed to a performer, would enjoy popular media adulation as 'Little Miss Mozart' in childhood. Not even Britten. Not even Andrew Lloyd Webber. Julia's student boyfriend is now married (his brusque wife, never seen but brilliantly delineated with a few spare brush-strokes of comment, shows Ayckbourn's gift for characterisation at its oblique best). He has been invited round by the obsessed father for some mysterious purpose that becomes chillingly clear when they are joined by a psychic. This is Ken, a chirpy little Ayckbournian of the sort that can reveal hidden depths, but whose initial appearance ('a bit of a dead-end job,' he guffaws of his job as a mortuary attendant) promises little. Attempts to communicate with the dead girl are attended by inexplicable happenings: the mysterious cold within the roped-off area of her room, dimming lights, music coming from a bricked-up door, a strange voice on the audio-tape. The portrait emerges of a child at cross-purposes with fond but inadequate parents, especially with her overpoweringly possessive father. Joe has the makings of an Ayckbourn bully: his casual description of haranguing his wife who 'just sat quietly and let it flow over her' evokes many such marriages in this writer's work. Ultimately it is all - notably the revelations from Ken - too improbable. Ghost stories should at least suspend disbelief while you watch them; this one nags you with its inconsistencies. In the author's own production, the climax is intriguing rather than frightening, reminding me of the much anthologised WW Jacobs story The Monkey's Paw, where the wished-for return from the grave of a loved child is averted just in time to avoid the horror of seeing what he has become. Adrian McLoughlin's Ken provides the dominating performance, the weed with more to him than at first suspected. As the desperately questing Joe, Ian Hogg does not quite reconcile the prosaic with the obsessional, let alone clarify Joe's motives, and Damien Goodwin as the boyfriend is over-emphatic with the slightly uncomprehending vehemence associated with Radio 4 drama. Come to think of it, that would perhaps be the best place for this disappointingly insubstantial essay into the spectral.</p>

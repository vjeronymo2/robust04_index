			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STAGE PARENTS' GUIDE TO HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: BARBARA SCHIFFMAN GIVES ADVICE TO THOSE WHO THINK THEIR CHILDREN  OUGHT TO BE IN PICTURES.  </P> <P> Four years ago, Risa Schiffman told her parents that she wanted to be on  television.  </P> <P> Her mother, Barbara Schiffman, secretly hoped her now 10-year-old daughter's  desire was simply a whim. After working in the entertainment industry for 16  years, Schiffman had firsthand experience with the pitfalls of Hollywood --  endless auditions, massive rejection and callous adults. But when Risa  persisted and finally embarked on an acting career, Schiffman became a screen  parent.  </P> <P> The mother soon learned that there were many things she didn't know and  resources seemed practically non-existent. Where should her daughter go for  acting classes? How could she find an agent? Should she get a portfolio of  photographs made? Many parents who were in the same situation seemed equally  perplexed.  </P> <P> Schiffman's research eventually resulted in the founding in 1988 of the  Hollywood Screen Parents Assn.  </P> <P> Working out of her Burbank house, she established an organization that serves  as a support network for parents of young performers and a clearinghouse for  information about the entertainment industry. Currently, the group's membership  numbers about 125 parents, most from Southern California, with a few from out  of state.  </P> <P> For an annual fee of $30, members receive three newsletters and an additional  pamphlet on classes and other relevant information. Members are also able to  borrow books about show business from a lending library Schiffman operates from  her house.  </P> <P> The association also has a casting liaison service in which Schiffman keeps  photographs of members' acting children on file for casting directors and  others in search of juvenile performers.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of Schiffman's association is its  advice and research service available to members and non-members. Anyone can  leave a question regarding show business on Schiffman's answering machine and,  within a few days, receive an answer.  </P> <P> Audrey Berkovitz of Sherman Oaks, mother of 10-year-old fraternal twins Dustin  and Lindsay, said Hollywood Screen Parents has worked for her. For the past  five years, her son Dustin has been carving out his own niche with television  roles in TV movies such as "Brat Patrol" and commercials for Log Cabin and  Kraft Touch of Butter.  </P> <P> However, her daughter Lindsay, who has cerebral palsy, also wanted to act.  </P> <P> "I had looked for an agent off and on for her for a few years," Berkovitz said,  noting that she had little success, "I suppose because most people didn't want  to be bothered with a child with special needs."  </P> <P> But after contacting Schiffman last year, the situation changed. Schiffman gave  her a few leads and Berkovitz finally found an agent. As a result, Lindsay  landed a job on a McDonald's commercial.  </P> <P> Karen Guzek of Anaheim tells a similar story. Her son Christian, 13, has been  in show business for the past five years, doing voice-overs on a Fox Television  cartoon series, "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes," as well as appearing  periodically as Jake Bitterman on the ABC-TV sitcom "Full House." But when  Christian wasn't working, it never occurred to Guzek to file for the state  unemployment benefits available to her son -- until she contacted Schiffman.  </P> <P> Under Screen Actors Guild regulations, union production companies must  contribute to the state unemployment tax fund for each actor they employ. When  a performer is not working, he or she may be eligible for state unemployment  benefits.  </P> <P> "I can't say enough good things about Barbara," Guzek said. "She's really  helpful. She explores avenues in her newsletter that screen parents would be  interested in. She always researches everything very thoroughly and comes up  with the right answer."  </P> <P> In her newsletter, Schiffman, 40, offers information on taxes, labor laws,  unions, audition strategies and acting classes.  </P> <P> "Barbara's certainly not making money," said Beverly Hills talent agent Joan  Mangum, who has known Schiffman for two years. "She's not making much of  anything except a good impression on the people she's involved with."  </P> <P> "She provides a lot of information," said Dick Woody, a talent agent with Terry  Lichtman Co. in Studio City who met Schiffman at industry speaker forums. "For  parents who want further knowledge about show business, the Hollywood Screen  Parents Assn. is a central way to obtain information. Barbara really knows the  business."  </P> <P> One of the most common questions from parents, Schiffman said, is: "How can I  find an agent for my child?"  </P> <P> However, there are more difficult issues, she said, such as dealing with a  child's rejection and finding the time and money to invest in a child's career.  Schiffman estimates that a child will have to audition 50 times to land a  single job. This, she said, is due in part to the scarcity of jobs and the  abundance of child actors.  </P> <P> Of the 73,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild nationwide, 6,000 are age 18  and younger, and one-quarter of them are age 9 and younger. According to guild  statistics, last year 3,200 child actors were employed at least once. However,  Schiffman said, only about 100 to 200 child actors work regularly.  </P> <P> The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists does not keep age  statistics on its membership.  </P> <P> To cope with all the rejection, Schiffman encourages parents to keep everything  in perspective. "Kids need to stay involved in other activities," she said.  </P> <P> "We try to keep Risa doing kid things," said Glenn Schiffman, Barbara's  screenwriter husband. "She plays soccer, goes to camp every summer. And she has  a lot of other interests. That's always been crucial. Make sure your child  stays a child. Don't make being a star more important than anything else."  </P> <P> Barbara Schiffman said she also stresses the importance of attitude, and  stresses to her daughter that frequently a person is often cast because a  particular physical appearance is required for the role.  </P> <P> "We love her no matter what happens," Glenn Schiffman said. "We tell her how we  feel about her has nothing to do with the parts she gets or doesn't get."  </P> <P> Another aspect of the business that parents need to consider is the financial  risk, she said. Especially during the first year, Barbara Schiffman advises  parents not to expect their children to earn much. And once they do begin  making money, a good deal of the income will go to agents (usually 10%),  managers (15%), taxes (25%), plus many other expenses such as initial union  dues ($800) and photographs ($200 to $400). And screen parents must have a lot  of free time to take their children to auditions and callbacks.  </P> <P> For Risa's career, the Schiffmans often rearrange their schedules to  accommodate the demands of their daughter's, whose credits include the parts of  Jennifer Baxter in the film "It Nearly Wasn't Christmas" with actor Charles  Durning, and Scrapper in the pilot for the television series "The New Our  Gang." Risa is currently in the play "Accompanied by Adults" at the Science of  Mind Church in Burbank.  </P> <P> When Risa's career began to take off, Schiffman decided to leave her full-time  job as development assistant for producer Dan Petrie Jr. at Disney Studios.  Alternatively, she pursued free-lance assignments such as writing, script  reading and script consulting.  </P> <P> Nearly 20 years ago, when Schiffman worked as assistant to the president at  Wakeford-Orloff, a large commercial production company in Los Angeles, she  couldn't imagine herself as a screen parent. After witnessing so many stage  parents primping their children in the waiting room, she said she had silently  vowed, "I will never do that.  </P> <P> "Years later, I found myself doing the same thing," she said with a laugh.  </P> <P> Actively participating in a child's show business career invariably creates  stress for screen parents, Barbara Schiffman said. Isolation and negative  reactions from casting directors, agents and directors are common.  </P> <P> "They treated me like they just wanted me to sit in the corner and shut up,"  she said.  </P> <P> Berkovitz has had similar experiences. "Once your child gets the job and you're  sitting there on the set, you feel like an ant," she said. "You know you're not  wanted or needed. I've even heard negative comments about stage moms right on  the set."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, despite the obvious drawbacks, children -- and their parents --  continue to strive for success in show business. Some are lured by the  lucrative pay, said Barbara Schiffman, who added that minimum guild pay for a  television feature is $431 a day and $1,498 a week. Others view the business as  an opportunity for their children to develop self-confidence and have fun in  the process.  </P> <P> But whatever the reason, Schiffman reminds parents not to forget they are  involved in a business.  </P> <P> "If I was just beginning and met Schiffman, I would have gone through a lot  less suffering and headaches," Berkovitz said.  </P> <P> Information about membership in Hollywood Screen Parents Assn. may be obtained  by writing 4720 N.

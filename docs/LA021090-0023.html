			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN LOSES HOME OPENER, 6-3  </P> <P> Tony Mortensen left a scholarship behind when he transferred from Division I  power Fresno State to Cal State Stanislaus for his final season of eligibility.  </P> <P> Stanislaus, which moved from the Division III to the Division II level this  season, does not award athletic grants.  </P> <P> But Mortensen was happy to pay his own way.  </P> <P> "I wanted to spend my senior year somewhere I would enjoy playing," Mortensen  said. "It's turned out well so far."  </P> <P> In his first start for Stanislaus -- and his first appearance since undergoing  knee surgery in the spring of 1988 -- Mortensen pitched a complete game in the  Warriors' 6-3 win over Northridge on Friday at Matador Field.  </P> <P> The left-hander from Rexburg, Ida., scattered six hits and struck out seven as  Stanislaus shook off Thursday's 13-2 season-opening drubbing by Cal State Los  Angeles and spoiled the Matadors' (2-3) home opener.  </P> <P> Stanislaus collected 17 hits off starter Vale Lopez (1-1), who pitched 6 2/3  innings, and reliever Todd Denhart. Shortstop Rich Ortega led the Warrior  offense with three hits, including a fifth-inning triple that scored two runs  and a solo home run in the ninth that sealed the victory.  </P> <P> Stanislaus took a 1-0 lead in the second on Tim Kassel's homer, but the  Matadors came back with two runs in the third on a run-scoring double by Denny  Vigo and a run-scoring single by Eric Johnson.  </P> <P> The Warriors, however, regained the lead with a three-run fifth. Brad Roznovsky  keyed the rally with a fly ball to left that Craig Clayton misplayed into a  run-scoring double.  </P> <P> "(That play) probably ended up being the difference," Northridge Coach Bill  Kernen said.  </P></p>

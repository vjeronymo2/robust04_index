Maryasov: "A Landslide Reduction in </F> Fertility"]    [Text] Russian fields expect a landslide reduction in  fertility in the next few years, unless the state takes over the  financing of agrochemical work.    Not long ago I had occasion to attend an All-Russian seminar  conference of agrochemical workers. The speakers said with alarm  that the erosion of nutrients from the soil had increased  considerably (Table No 1). We are taking all the sap from the  land, and giving it nothing in return. This can have only a  deplorable ending. In two or three years such a landslide  reduction in the production of agricultural products will set in  that no loans and no infusions from the West will help.    Table 1.

Ivanova, director of the Velikiye Luki Chemization  Station  in Pskov Oblast, was one of the first to speak at the seminar.    "The conditions for agricultural development in the oblast  are very difficult," said Valentina Fedorovna. "Poor soil, lack  of roads, depopulated villages -- these are the characteristic  features of our region. Hopes that we would have a normal life  appeared in 1981-1982, when road construction and land  improvement were firmly undertaken. In these years, the  intensity of agrochemical service picked up. For example, high  rates of liming made it possible to reduce the soil acidity from  60 to 30 percent. One could say that the land took a deep  breath. The best farms began to obtain 20 quintals of grain from  each hectare, and 200 quintals of potatoes. This did not last  long, unfortunately. Gradually, all the good beginnings began to  be reduced to nothing. In the last year or two, the Pskov rural  area, I can say without exaggeration, has been approaching the  critical line.    "You know, everything begins with the land, but our land has  found itself neglected. The placement of mineral fertilizers has  dropped by a factor of eight, as compared with the 1980's, of  organic fertilizers -- by a factor of three, and four-fold fewer  fields are being limed. Things are coming to the point where  soon a nutritive element such as potassium will not remain in  the soil.    "The amount of acidic soil is increasing. We can go back to  the days when the acidity was such that no crops grew: barley  would sprout and immediately die. Now we are approaching the  same point: what we accumulated by granules for 30 years we ran  off in two to three years.    "The Pskov farmers obtained a 40-million-ruble [R] loan this  year to purchase mineral fertilizers. In other words, there were  R100 per hectare of plowed land. What can you buy for that? This  is not a loan, but a mockery.    "The financial situation of many farms is catastrophic.  Things have come to the point where it has become more  profitable not to cultivate the land than it is to cultivate it.  The expenses to grow flax at the farms are more than the flax  mills pay for it. They say that we used to have a ridiculous  economy, but what we have come to does not fit into even this  concept."    Valentina Fedorovna also came out with a specific proposal:  agrochemical work should be financed by the state. The farms  cannot buy fertilizers at the existing prices. The farmers are  also turning to the agrochemical service for help. They have  many problems, and there must be interaction. When you ask the  farmers about paying for the services, though, each one shrugs  his shoulders: "What payment?! I have nothing but debts, and  this is the third year that I haven't had a penny of income."    This is the sort of speech you have. It is hard not to agree  with many of the arguments. At the same time, however, one feels  like arguing. What is easy to come by is not so highly valued.  Not so long ago, fertilizers arrived at the farms as if from a  horn of plenty, and moreover, were very cheap. So? We all  remember their being scattered on the borders of the fields, in  the gullies, torn sacks and incompetent storage, when they  poured what should have been separated into the same heap.    As we know, the doses of fertilizer placement are closely  tied into the reserves of nutrients in the soil, a fact which  agronomists often disregard. There was a time when many  specialists acted blindly, on the principle of "we take a  measure from the embankment, and then we sort it out." The soil  on their farm remained a thoroughly hidden mystery to them. Now,  true, most of the farms have agrochemical charts. Consequently,  there is a possibility of forming a norm for the placement of  fertilizers according to the needs of the plants in each field.    Not everything depends on the charts, though, there are two  sides to the coin. In this case the second side concerns the  technical outfitting of the farms. Over ten years ago, science  worked out a local method for placing fertilizers. To this day,  however, the peasants have not received the equipment for this  and are forced to use machines with a centrifugal sifting  apparatus to place fertilizers. The lack of uniformity in  placing fertilizers in this case reaches three- or four-fold the  normal value. The consequence? A tremendous overexpenditure of  fertilizers and an increase, on some sections of the fields, in  the nutrient dose, as compared with the recommended one.    This means that the problem is far from ambiguous. A simple  "let it be" will not do very well here. Competent chemization of  agriculture is transforming the rural area, that is  indisputable. In the developed countries, however, the means of  chemizing and protecting plants merges with new technology. The  yield that comes from this can be judged by the published table  (Table 2).

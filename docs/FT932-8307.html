			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (2): Soft landing is planned for this year - The economy ON A recent visit to Santiago, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, thought his Chilean hosts had misplaced the decimal point in their economic statistics. GDP growth of 10.4 per cent in 1992? Private-sector investment up by 30 per cent? A 12 per cent increase in export revenues? Surely this was not possible in a global recession. As Mr Tietmeyer was soon to discover, 1992 was Chile's best economic year in three decades. Growth was spurred by unprecedented investment outlays in Chile's export industries, a construction boom in Santiago, and government infrastructure projects. The country's gross domestic product is approaching Dollars 40bn, while per capita income reached Dollars 3,000 last year. Fiscal discipline allowed the government to match record levels of economic growth with falling inflation. In three years, finance minister Alejandro Foxley's firm grip on the purse-strings of the treasury has doubled the government savings rate to 5.6 per cent of GDP. Over the same period, the annual rate of inflation dropped from almost 30 per cent to 12.7 per cent at the end of 1992. Like Mr Tietmeyer, Mr Roberto Zahler, president of Chile's autonomous central bank, distrusts double digits. 'The economy last year was not overheated, but such exceptional rates of growth are not sustainable over time,' he explains. Mr Zahler aims to engineer a soft landing for the Chilean economy this year. Interest-rate increases in the second half of 1992 and a slowdown in Chile's export sector should moderate economic growth to an optimal 5 to 6 per cent in 1993, according to central bank forecasts. Meanwhile, the strong investment momentum generated by the private and public sectors should lay the foundations for future growth. The most important change Chile will see this year is in its external accounts. Imports are growing at twice the rate of exports. This will probably wipe out the trade surplus this year and widen the current account deficit to around Dollars 1.5bn, or 4 per cent of GDP. Economists, however, are not alarmed by the 25 per cent rise in imports. 'Most imports are going into real bricks-and-mortar investments,' says Mr Armen Kouyoumdjian, a business consultant. 'And with Dollars 10bn in foreign exchange reserves, there is no danger of a balance of payments crisis.' In addition, foreign direct investment, concentrated mainly in the mining sector, continues to flow into Chile, to the tune of Dollars 1bn a year. However, there are signs that the Chilean economy, as it approaches full capacity and near full employment, will have to adjust to lower rates of growth. 'Chile will feel the pain of the international recession this year,' predicts Mr Joaquin Vial, chief economist at the finance ministry. The country's traditional exports - copper, fishmeal and cellulose - have been hit by a slump in world commodity prices, while the appreciation of the Chilean peso is hurting the Dollars 1bn-a-year fruit industry and the dynamic non-traditional exports - jeans and shoes, biotechnology, wine from the Central Valley, and fresh salmon from the southern Lake District. Most economists predict that export revenues will rise by 7 per cent at most in 1993, to about Dollars 10.6bn, compared with growth rates of 12 per cent and above over the past five years. The other question-mark hanging over economic policy is whether Chile's monetary authorities have any leeway to further reduce inflation. Last year, it was curbed by five points to 12.7 per cent, thanks to a hefty revaluation of the peso, interest-rate hikes and fiscal austerity. This year, the central bank's target is to trim the figure to 11 per cent. But even this modest reduction seems ambitious, given the widespread indexation of the economy, growing wage pressures, and the central bank's reluctance to hurt exports with a further revaluation. In addition, this is an election year, and, despite vigorous denials, the government may be sorely tempted to relax the reins on government spending. Against this backdrop, Mr Foxley's greatest battle this year will be to persuade Congress to maintain the present levels of taxation. When President Aylwin took office in 1990, Congress approved tax increases for a four-year period to finance greater social spending. The tax reforms expire at the end of 1993, and Chile's vociferous business community is lobbying for a return to the pre-1990 corporate tax rate of 10 per cent, against 15 per cent at present. Mr Foxley argues that to lower taxes now would unleash dangerous inflationary pressures on the economy. It would also deprive the government of an estimated Dollars 800m in annual revenues. If the right-wing opposition blocks an extension of the current tax rates, Mr Foxley has warned congressmen that the unpopular task of axeing social programmes from the budget will rest on their shoulders.</p>

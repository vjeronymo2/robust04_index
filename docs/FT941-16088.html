			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Capital gains boost for trusts - Collective Funds Investors in gilts through a unit trust will be able to use indexation to mitigate their capital gains, according to a clause in the finance bill. Investors in assets exempt from capital gains tax, such as UK government bonds, are liable to pay the tax when these assets are held in a collective fund such as a unit trust or offshore fund. Under clause 89 of the bill, investors in collective funds and building society shares will be able to offset part of their tax liability through an indexation allowance based on movements in the retail price index. Investors will only be able to use this allowance to reduce tax liabilities on capital gains. In the November Budget the chancellor abolished the use of indexation to create or increase losses for tax relief. Mr Simon Smith, taxation adviser at the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, welcomed the change. 'We have been lobbying for it for a long time so it is nice to see it there,' he said. The bill also removed an anomaly in the treatment of options for capital gains tax payers, making it no longer disadvantageous to exercise a put option rather than sell it. The bill confirms the introduction of the airport departure tax announced in the November Budget. From October 1 air passengers from the UK will be charged Pounds 5 for flights to British and European Union destinations and Pounds 10 for trips elsewhere. Airlines will be responsible for collecting the duty. Children under two, passengers on aircraft with fewer than 20 seats and those making return journeys in the UK will be exempted.</p>

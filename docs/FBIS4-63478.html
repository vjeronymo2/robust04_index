			<p>BFN     [Text] Odessa, 20 May -- Colonel Vyacheslav Voronkov, press  secretary of the Odessa military district commander, refuted  reports by the "Ostankino" TV company about Ukrainian troops  movements, which took place in Crimea. He said information  about the movement of Ukrainian tanks in the vicinity of the  village of Tylovoye, about the deployment of a field hospital in  the village of Chernobayevka, and about the movement of the  special purpose troops do not correspond to reality. The 32d  Army Corps also remains in its deployment site. A routine  inspection is being carried out in the Odessa military district  units. A similar inspection will get under way in Crimea on 23  May.</p>

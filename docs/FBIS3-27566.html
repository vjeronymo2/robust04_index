			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Yang Chengming (2799 2052 2494) and Jiang </F> Yaping (3068 0068 1627)]    [Text] Pale, 22 Feb (XINHUA) -- In an interview with  reporters of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY in his office on the afternoon  of 22 February, President Karadzic of the "Republic of Serbia"  in Bosnia-Herzegovina emphatically noted: The protracted civil  war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has brought great disasters to people  of various nationalities, and Bosnian Serbs are determined to  achieve final peace through political negotiations.    Speaking on the NATO ultimatum about air strikes at Bosnian  Serbs' positions, he said: "This is a shameful act of the  Western countries to practice power politics and show off their  military forces to small nations."    Speaking on the bloodshed in Sarajevo on 5 February,  Karadzic  said: It was "created by Islamic jihad warriors from abroad,"  who attempted to put the blame on somebody else. He maintained  that the bloodshed "had damaged the process of peace talks for  Bosnia-Herzegovina"; "it was a base action against not only  Serbs but also Muslims."    Karadzic continued to stress: The civil war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina has so far claimed over 200,000 lives,  produced millions of refugees, and caused more than $100 billion  in material damages, pulling the economy of the area back to the  level of several decades ago. He believed that the Bosnian war  could be ended if the international community treats all sides  of conflict equally.    Karadzic said he was grateful for the Chinese Government's  principled stand of firmly opposing foreign military  intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina and advocating a resolution  to the Bosnian crisis through political negotiations. He felt  that the Chinese mass media have fairly and objectively reported  the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and have fully respected the  facts.</p>

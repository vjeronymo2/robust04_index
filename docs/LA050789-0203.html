			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE FENCE  </P> <P> Andy Lang (Handyman Q&amp;A, April 16) gave a very informative answer to a "We  want to build a fence on our property" question.  </P> <P> However, where should the property owner put the fence? Where is the property  line? I am a licensed California land surveyor, and I get this question daily.  </P> <P> The only sure way is to find the existing property line markers (if any exist)  or have the line or lines established by a licensed land surveyor. An agreement  line between the two neighbors is fine if the neighbors don't move or change  their minds. It is wiser and less expensive to place the fence in the correct  position than moving an existing one over to the correct position.  </P> <P> LEW NICHOLS  </P> <P> Westchester  </P></p>

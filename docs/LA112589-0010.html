			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS VOTES ITSELF A HEFTY PAY RAISE  </P> <P> Once again the Congress has taken up the issue of a pay raise for its members.  This time they have the pay raise linked to ethics reform. Wouldn't it be nice  to have elected representatives who do not feel that doing the ethical thing  requires a reward.  </P> <P> I will not vote for any member who votes himself a raise or sets up a way for  members to get a raise without them having to vote on the raise. Many people in  government deserve and should get a raise, but Congress is not among the group.  Let's put people in office who deserve our trust.  </P> <P> WILLIAM V. FERRARO  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

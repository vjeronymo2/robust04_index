			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Demand for Taiwanese insurer issue The Taiwan government's offer of 18m shares of Chung Kuo Insurance was fully subscribed, Reuter reports from Taipei. Underwriter Chiao Tung Bank said the shares, equal to 15 per cent of the company's stock, were priced at TDollars 54 a share and would raise TDollars 972m (USDollars 36m). More than 1m applications were received, with 9,000 applicants awarded 2,000 shares each, said Chiao Tung. The Taiwan government eventually plans to give up its majority stake in the group. Chung Kuo is one of three state-owned companies, along with Chiao Tung and Farmers Bank of China, that applied to list last year but postponed the move because of a weak stock market. A domestic and overseas flotation of shares in China Steel is planned for early next year.</p>

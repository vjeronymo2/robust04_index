			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Italy's tourist image loses shine - This year's summer season was one of the worst THE recent sharp fall in the value of the lira should make Italy more attractive to foreigners after one of the worst summer seasons on record. But the country's travel agents warn the problems go well beyond an overvalued currency. Tourism is Italy's third biggest source of foreign income after machinery and textiles and clothing. This summer's disappointing tourist receipts could hardly have come at a worse time for an economy fighting off recession and a severe deterioration in the balance of payments. Earnings from foreigners help to compensate for the huge imports of energy and raw materials needed to run the Italian economy, which is relatively poor in natural resources. So the fall in tourist numbers has worsened a steady deterioration in the balance of payments this year as a result of declining export earnings caused by recession in many major markets. In August, the latest month for which figures are available, the balance of payments registered a deficit of L4,505bn, (Pounds 2.03bn), up from L906bn a year earlier. The deficit for the first eight months of this year surged to L29,064bn, against a surplus of L3,779bn in the same period in 1991. Italy's foreign exchange reserves have fallen heavily as a result of lower receipts and a costly campaign to defend the lira before its devaluation in September. Early data from Emilia Romagna, Italy's leading seaside resort region, suggest visitors in the peak May-September holiday period fell by 8 per cent. The overall drop hides a much sharper fall of at least 15 per cent in visits by foreigners, who in 1991 made up 18 per cent of the region's 4.2m visitors. Hopes that Italy's tourism industry might benefit from the switch away from Yugoslavia because of the fighting there have proved ill-founded. The fall in visitors is as marked in Florence, Venice and Rome as on the Riviera. The Confcrescenti tourism organisation said the numbers visiting Rome plunged by 30 per cent in the first two weeks of August, the peak period, against the same period last year. Early returns for Venice suggest a drop of 15 per cent. Relatively high inflation, combined with limited scope for depreciation when the lira was still in the exchange rate mechanism, lay at the heart of Italy's pricing problem. As the country became more expensive for foreigners, so local hotels and restaurants steadily lost ground against Germany, Austria or Switzerland. Italy's hoteliers and travel agents blame the overvalued lira as the main cause of this year's decline, but other factors played a part. Recession in Germany, the main source of Italy's tourists, was partly responsible. Popular German destinations such as Lake Garda experienced uncommonly high vacancy rates. Foreign perceptions of widespread crime in Italy have not helped. Tales of stolen wallets abound, while Mafia murders and disclosures of corruption in many cities have fuelled a general impression of lawlessness. Earlier this month, Fiavet, Italy's travel agents' association, published a report listing poor service, ageing hotels, bad manners and high prices as top disincentives for foreigners visiting Italy. Tourists complain about museums which are closed, or only open for limited hours. A recent wave of public-sector strikes has not helped. Many visitors object to paying stiff entrance fees to find half a famous venue off limits. The lira's devaluation, now running at around 12 per cent against the D-Mark, will mollify such feelings, but dealing with the problems which have damaged Italy's image as a tourist paradise will take longer.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Rank limits dip in profits after tight control of costs HALF-WAY results at Rank Organisation, the leisure group, reached the top end of expectations in an economic climate which the company said offered little but gloom. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 94m for the 28 weeks to May 16, Pounds 2m less than last year. Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, said the company had kept tight control of costs, including 600 redundancies. Sir Patrick Meaney, chairman, added: 'Until the recession lifts, any improvements in performance are likely to result only from self-help.' The group, whose activities include the Butlin's holiday camps, Odeon cinemas and Pinewood studios, said most areas had been hit by the recession. The Hard Rock Cafes were an exception. Over the past year, Rank has opened new Hard Rock Cafes in Paris and Berlin. Bingo also appeared impervious to the downturn, with admissions and spending per head both up. The company also had encouraging results from its London hotels, where occupancy is now more than 70 per cent. Although this has been achieved through price-cutting, Mr Gifford said profits at the London hotels were at the level achieved in 1990. The group still intends to sell 22 of its UK hotels. Mr Gifford said no sale had yet been concluded, although several buyers had expressed an interest. He hoped to conclude a sale during the second half. Admissions at Odeon cinemas fell 10 per cent, mainly because of an absence of blockbuster films. The US video sales business continued to suffer losses, but new managers had been appointed and computer systems improved. Admissions to casinos remained constant but spending per head fell 4 per cent on last year. The amusement machine business also had a difficult year. The group's share of the pre-tax profits of Rank Xerox was Pounds 71.1m, compared with Pounds 80.1m last year. This included a reduced contribution from Fuji Xerox, which has suffered from the Japanese economic downturn. Turnover was Pounds 935.5m, compared with Pounds 983.6m last year. Earnings per share rose to 14.2p from 11.3p as a result of a lower tax charge, reduced minority interests and a reduction in total dividend payments on preference shares. The interim dividend was a maintained 10.25p. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH CLINIC RHETORIC  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the San Diego city school board will face a tough decision: whether  to give conceptual approval for a health clinic to serve 8,000 students at  several East San Diego schools.  </P> <P> The decision will not be tough for the usual financial reasons. The clinic's  operating costs would come primarily from private foundations. The school  district's contribution would mostly be in administrative services and donated  space.  </P> <P> What makes the decision tough is the opposition of a vocal minority, led by the  Catholic bishop, who, in a pastoral letter called the health centers "sex  clinics" in disguise that will promote free sex, contraception, masturbation  and abortion.  </P> <P> Such rhetoric is absurd. First of all, the clinic will not provide abortion  referrals or information. Second, if it provides birth-control information and  devices -- and it should -- that is not synonymous with promoting sexual  activity. It only recognizes that many teen-agers are sexually active whether  or not their parents want them to be.  </P> <P> Third, all services will require parental permission. The notion that state law  would overrule that requirement has not proven true at clinics elsewhere in  California, and school district officials say opponents are misinterpreting the  law.  </P> <P> What school board members need to keep uppermost in their minds is that the  medical and mental-health services the clinic would provide are sorely needed.  The religious beliefs of a minority should not be able to deny those services  to the majority who support them.  </P></p>

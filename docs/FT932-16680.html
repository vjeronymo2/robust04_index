			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Lufthansa chief attacks US deal THE German government should cancel its air transport agreement with the US, Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa chairman, said at the weekend. All efforts to bring the national flag-carrier back into profit would be fruitless as long as US airlines were allowed to swarm virtually unhindered into Europe and while Lufthansa laboured under the constraints of an antique bilateral treaty, he argued. Mr Weber, a former aviation engineer installed two years ago to set the loss-making, 51 per cent government-owned, German airline to rights, feels he has filled his side of the bargain. 'I cannot take on the tasks of my main shareholder,' he told the FT. He has slashed the workforce - 5,000 jobs have gone in less than a year - a ground-breaking pay deal last summer, including a wage freeze, has helped reduce personnel costs 27 per cent, and flights to the growing markets of Asia and eastern Europe have been increased. But recession and continuing price competition have continued to take their toll. 'Last year we carried 11 per cent more passengers and 6 per cent more freight, but the end effect was less in the till,' he said. In fact, Mr Weber's efforts earned the airline a modest reduction in losses, down DM30m to DM300m (Pounds 127.1m) in 1992. But that seems insufficient for a man who has repeatedly promised that he will return the business to profit in 1995, after just three years of his restructuring programme. Now he believes it is Bonn's turn to deliver the changes he is unable to engineer himself. He has sent government officials off to talks with US authorities with his concerns ringing in their ears. Mr Weber says that cancelling the aviation deal, which in any case is due to be renegotiated by the end of October, will at least clear the ground for a fresh, more even-handed agreement than the one which has limited German airlines' access to a dozen US destinations. 'If it is cancelled then we will have a position where both partners can start off on an equal basis,' he said. But Mr Weber needs more than a level playing field to help him score in the US. Although North American routes account for 30 per cent of group revenues, Lufthansa has been unable fully to capitalise on the access it already has. The main reason is the links that other European competitors enjoy with US airlines, and which enable them to move their passengers smoothly and profitably on to regional destinations within the world's biggest domestic market. In the past two years Lufthansa has started partnership talks with both American Airlines and USAir, only to abort them later. Last autumn it pulled out of a proposed bid for Continental. Now fresh talks are under way with an unnamed party. Their chances of success would hardly be enhanced if Bonn's negotiators took Mr Weber's weekend urgings at face value and chose confrontation. On the contrary, improved access to main landing points in the US could strengthen Lufthansa's hand with its new potential collaborators.</p>

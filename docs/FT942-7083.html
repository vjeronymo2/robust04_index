			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Peace talks unlikely to heal Cambodia's wounds: Many think neither Phnom Penh nor Khmer Rouge wants a solution One year ago this week, the UN effort to bring peace to Cambodia reached its climax as more than 4m Cambodians braved monsoon rains and the threat of Khmer Rouge violence to vote in the country's first free election. Today, despite widespread optimism among voters that they were casting their ballots for peace, the government is still fighting a low-intensity war against Khmer Rouge guerrillas who show no sign of giving up their struggle to retake power. The three top government leaders are due to arrive in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, today for peace talks with the Khmer Rouge. It will be the first time the two sides have met for almost six months, but few in Phnom Penh expect the talks will bring much change. As preparations for the talks go on, sporadic fighting continues in western Cambodia, where 50,000 people have been forced out of their homes by artillery barrages from both the Khmer Rouge and the government. Aid workers say the future now looks bleak for many whose homes are in what is now a combat zone, whose prospects of returning to their villages in time to plough their fields for this year's rice crop are slim. Many Cambodians believe neither the government nor the Khmer Rouge is seriously interested in the search for peace. For the government, an end to war would bring new problems if it finally faced up to the need to demobilise almost half its armed forces. While they are fighting, the government can justify spending more than 35 per cent of its budget on defence. Once the fighting stops, the figures are likely to be scrutinised more carefully by multilateral donors such as the IMF, which has just approved a new Dollars 120m (Pounds 79.4m) soft loan. For the Khmer Rouge, any peace settlement would have to include giving up its guerrilla army and the territory it controls, which would be tantamount to giving up the struggle. Some analysts believe the guerrillas are fighting only to improve their bargaining position before talks; others say they aim to take complete control of Cambodia again. In recent fighting, the Khmer Rouge has shown it can defeat government forces with apparent ease. Military officials say the reason for the guerrillas' successes was the national army's incompetence, rather than the strength of the Khmer Rouge. Even during that recent run of victories, the Khmer Rouge did not manage to capture the town of Battambang. With a strength of 10,000-12,000, the faction is unlikely to be able to capture, far less hold, any significant towns. Ministers are still trying to persuade their allies in the west and in south-east Asian countries to provide them with lethal military aid, fuelling the suspicion they have no interest in reaching a peace settlement with the Khmer Rouge. Some diplomats believe King Norodom Sihanouk, head of state, is alone in pushing for talks and a deal to bring the Khmer Rouge into the government, in exchange for a ceasefire and relinquishing the 10-15 per cent of the country the guerrillas control. Mr Hun Sen, junior prime minister, said he was 'less than 0.1 per cent optimistic' about any progress during the five days of talks. On the government side, Mr Hun Sen is the main stumbling block to a deal with the Khmer Rouge. Prince Ranariddh, senior prime minister and the son of King Sihanouk, has shown he is willing to make peace with the Maoist guerrillas. Late last year, Prince Ranariddh twice flew to Bangkok for talks with the nominal leader of the Khmer Rouge, Khieu Samphan. During these meetings, the two men discussed terms for a ceasefire. But, each time, Prince Ranariddh returned empty-handed. Few in Cambodia believe he will be any more successful this time.</p>

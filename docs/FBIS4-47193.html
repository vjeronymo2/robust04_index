It was organized under the patronage of the  Roskomdragmet [Russian Committee for Precious Metals], the  chairman of which--Yevgeniy Bychkov--was elected president of  the association. Yesterday the new organization obtained  Certificate No. 32211 at the Moscow Registration Office, which  signifies the de facto beginning of its work.    The decision to create this association was adopted on 21  April at a session attended by its founders--the leading  officials of six diamond organizations: three plants in the  Kristall system (Barnaul, Moscow, and Smolensk), three very  large joint ventures (Intertreyd, Kristalldiam, and Ruiz  daymond), as well as the Almazyuvelireksport Foreign-Trade  Association and the Federation of Trade Unions of Workers in the  Mining and Metallurgical Industry.    The new association's charter declares measures aimed at  developing the Russian diamond industry and at increasing its  competitiveness on the world market. This organization intends  to render consultative assistance to all of Russia's  diamond-cutting enterprises, regardless of their forms of  ownership. Included among its potential clients are  approximately 100 legal entities already having licenses to cut  diamonds.    The association sees its special goal as helping in the  cooperation between diamond-processing plants of the CIS  countries: Located in Kiev, Vinnitsa, Gomel, Yerevan, and  Chardzhu are large plants specializing in the production of very  high quality diamonds--the so-called "Russian cut," or "fine  cut." After the disintegration of the USSR, these plants were no  longer able to obtain a full supply of raw materials--basically,  diamonds from Yakutiya. During the years 1992-1993 they began to  obtain significant supplies of raw materials from foreign  firms--for example, Belgium and Israel. Their products are  already competitive with Russian diamonds on world markets  inasmuch as the sector of high-quality diamonds is a  comparatively narrow one. It should be said that contacts with  the above-listed CIS plants have already been established by  Almazyuvelireksport and the Yakutsk company entitled Tumaada  Daymond. And two Yakutsk-Ukrainian joint ventures have been  created.    In the words of its executive director--Ararat Evoyan--the  new association will take steps to make sure that the "Russian  cut" being turned out by the CIS plants and the products of  their Russian colleagues will be sold on the world markets  within a framework of thoroughgoing cooperation.    The Diamond Producers Association of Russia was founded as  an  analogy with such organizations in other countries, having the  typical purposes of civilized lobbying for favorable customs and  tax laws, as well as combating the producers of fake (infused)  diamonds.</p>

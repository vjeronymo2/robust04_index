			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa spoke on the  telephone for 10 minutes on the evening of 20 May with Yasushi  Akashi, the UN Secretary General's special representative in  charge of affairs in former Yugoslavia. On the issue of sending  Japanese personnel to participate in the work of the UN  Protection Forces (UNPRO), which are currently conducting  operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kakizawa said: "It will be  difficult to do so at the moment, but we would like to study the  issue over the medium-to-long-term."    His comments indicated the government intends to consider  plans to send Japanese personnel to participate in UN  peacekeeping operations (PKO). In response, Akashi said: "We  will continue to request deployment of Japanese personnel, but  we would like the Japanese Government to avoid making hasty  decisions and to study the issue from a broad perspective."    Kakizawa then said Japan plans to send a delegation to  participate in a meeting of the Council for the Rehabilitation  and Reconstruction of Sarajevo to be held in Vienna on 24-25  May. He said Japan planned "to seriously consider whether it  would be possible to offer wide-ranging cooperation."    His remarks indicated that Japan also intends to actively  support rehabilitation and reconstruction programs after peace  has been restored in the region.    Alluding to critical remarks made by some U.S. and European  officials against Akashi, Kakizawa said: "I praise Mr. Akashi  highly for preventing the situation from worsening and  maintaining UN neutrality. I also support his way of doing  things."    Akashi said: "It is natural that there is criticism, so I do  not mind that at all. I would like to continue securing UN  neutrality."</p>

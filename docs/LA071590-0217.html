			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARY COLEMAN  </P> <P> I am a former child star. Uniquely grotesque as it seems, the smashing of the  Coleman family's gold-plated communal bowl is only one more in a long train of  similar tragedies to befall child stars.  </P> <P> The saddest part is that all these weful endings were as predictable as any  seasonal hurricane zeroing in on the Texas Gulf. Reversing roles of dependent  and providfer leads to almost certain disaster for all concerned. But as long  as the performing child's salary continues to shower money on the family, the  persons most responsible -- adults who should be in charge -- ignore the storm  warnings until it's too late.Adults are meant to care for small children, not  the other way around. "It's not nice to fool Mother Nature!" the margarine TV  commercial proclaimed. Let the greedy parents of today's budding child stars  read their own future and take heed.  </P> <P> DIANA SERRA CARY  </P> <P> Carlsbad  </P></p>

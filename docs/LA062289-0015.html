			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COASTAL PARK FATE DEPENDS ON CITIES  </P> <P> The area known as Shoreline Park, owned by the county of Los Angeles and  adjacent to San Pedro, has recently been put up for sale as "surplus property."  Governmental bodies have the right to bid on the property before it is offered  to developers.  </P> <P> I would like to suggest that the four cities of the Palos Verdes Peninsula get  together and buy this beautiful piece of shoreline. This would ensure that some  small part of the coastline is left as open space for our children and  grandchildren.  </P> <P> The park could be held by the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy or by a  four-city park district. Because of the scarcity and high price of coastal  land, this opportunity is unique and should be acted upon quickly. If citizens  feel this is a good suggestion, please call your local city hall.  </P> <P> KAY BARA  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

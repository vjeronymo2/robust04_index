			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 110_Registered Traders: In addition to the changes made to Rule 111, the Exchange also proposes to amend Rule 110 to add a reference to Rule 111. As amended, Rule 110 would provide that members may not initiate a transaction while on the floor for an account in which they have an interest unless the member is registered as a registered trader with the Exchange, except as provided in Rule 111, Commentary .03. The Commission believes that this revision permits Rule 110 to maintain its proper relationship with Rule 111 as revised. The NYSE has adopted similar revisions to its comparable rules. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex states that the proposed amendments are based on NYSE Rules 111 and 112. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the changes to Rule 110 are appropriate unifying changes in furtherance of the purposes of the Act designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade which generally serve to protect investors and the public interest pursuant to section 6(b)(5) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> footnote 12. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 115_Exchange Procedures for Use of Unusual Market Exception: The Exchange proposes to add a new Commentary to Rule 115. This Rule contains exceptions to Exchange Act Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1, but currently there is no reference in Rule 115 to the requirements of Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1. The Exchange therefore proposes that Commentary .02 be added to Rule 115 to incorporate the text of Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1, as has been done by the NYSE in its Rule 60. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 3 proposes minor revisions in order to conform the reprint of Exchange Act Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1 which is contained in Commentary .02 to the rule, to the actual language of the Rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees that it is appropriate for Rule 115 to incorporate the text of Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1 in order to create a more thorough Rule, thereby providing the members with clearer guidance. This change will promote just and equitable principles of trade in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  footnote 12. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 124(b)_Types of Bids and Offers: In discussing ``next day'' delivery of rights and warrants, the rule indicates that ``bids and offers in rights and warrants shall specify `next day' in accordance with Rule 17.'' The Exchange proposes that Rule 124 be revised to clarify that the reference in Rule 17 relates only to expiring rights and warrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that the addition of the word ``expiring'' to Rule 124(b) is appropriate to clarify that the next day provisions discussed therein only refer to expiring rights and warrants. This change will, therefore, promote just and equitable principles of trade in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  footnote 12. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 126(e)3_Precedence of Bids and Offers_Sale Removes All Bids: Paragraph 3 generally provides, with one exception, that a sale removes all bids from the floor. <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  The Exchange proposes to amend paragraph 3 of Rule 126(e) to add a provision stating that the aforementioned applies only when not in contravention of Exchange Act Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 126(e)3 provides that a sale shall remove all bids from the floor except that, if the number of shares of stock or principal amount of bonds offered exceeds the number of shares or principal amount specified in the bid having precedence, a sale of the unfilled balance to other bidders shall be governed by the provisions of the Rules as though no sale had been made to the bidder having precedence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the aforementioned change to Rule 126(e)3 is an appropriate clarifying change to the Rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 126(h)_Precedence of Bids and Offers_Disputes: Rule 126(h) provides that, unless resolved by the members involved, disputes shall be settled, if practicable, by a vote of witnesses to a trade, and if not so settled shall be settled by a Floor Official. <FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>  It is proposed that the rule be revised (and redesignated 126(i) due to a change in another rule filing) to provide that disputes will be settled by a Floor Official who may, in his deliberations, consider the comments of witnesses, and where only the amount traded was in dispute, the size of the order held by those involved in the dispute. The NYSE has adopted a similar revision to its comparable rule. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 136(h) also provides that said Floor Official may make separate and different rulings with respect to active openings when bids and offers are simultaneous and with respect to odd-lots. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex states that the proposed amendment is based on NYSE Rule 75. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

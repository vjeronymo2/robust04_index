			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hillsdown Pounds 150m write-off warning STOCKBROKERS are bracing themselves for large scale write-offs and provisions when Hillsdown Holdings, the food group, reports 1992 results on Tuesday. These could total Pounds 150m, with perhaps half going through the profit and loss account as an extraordinary item. However, analysts have been more positive about the group since the interims last September, and the shares have doubled. They expect a bounce in earnings in the current year. Mr David Lang, food analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, who is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 155m compared with Pounds 186.8m in 1991, said the total of write-offs and provisions 'could approach Pounds 150m or could be higher if the knife goes deeper'. Sir Harry Solomon, executive chairman, announced in December that he would retire at next month's annual meeting. It is thought that the new team, headed by Sir John Nott, will take the opportunity of these results to 'clear the decks'. The group will not apply FRS 3, the new accounting standard, which would require restructuring costs to be taken as exceptional rather than extraordinary items. Hillsdown is likely to make provisions for restructuring and rationalisation costs relating to the poultry division, following last year's purchase of the JP Wood business, to the fresh meat business, to the Scottish salmon farming operation, to a Pounds 7.6m provision against Clarke Foods and to the Lyons Maid ice cream company which went into receivership in October last year. The balance sheet will be affected by goodwill write-offs from acquisitions, such as the Pounds 50m purchase of the European chilled foods business of Beledia, a private Dutch company. That company had net assets of Pounds 29m. Earnings per share for 1992 are forecast at around 13p which would comfortably cover a promised maintained annual dividend of 8.8p. That gives a yield of 7.2 per cent on the share's closing price yesterday of 162p, up 3p, which brokers say gives support to the shares.</p>

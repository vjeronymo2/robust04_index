			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / IMF criticises Russian budget Mr Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, yesterday criticised the assumptions of next year's Russian budget and urged the government to adopt a tougher line if it wanted international financial assistance. Mr Fischer said IMF calculations suggested the deficit would be closer to 10 per cent than the 8 per cent included in the draft. The revenue forecasts also looked over-optimistic, he said, given that 1994's revenues were as low as half those forecast. He also questioned whether the the bond market would be sufficiently strong to meet the government's financing needs. An IMF mission is currently in talks with the Russian government about providing its biggest ever stand-by facility of up to Dollars 6bn, with a further Dollars 6bn available as part of a currency stabilisation fund. Mr Fischer hinted at the IMF's negotiating stance by suggesting that a budget deficit of between 6-7 per cent appeared financeable at a low rate of inflation. He also said tax revenues as a proportion of gross national product should be 3-4 percentage points higher than the 11 per cent forecast. The IMF also expected the Russian government to stick to its promise of lifting its oil export quotas.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / The GATT Agreement: PC makers cry foul on chip tariffs Europe's personal computer manufacturers cried foul this week following news that the European Union would maintain 14 per cent tariff barriers against critical semiconductor components imported from outside Europe. They predicted the result would be pared profits, damaged competitiveness, and pressure to move production out of Europe. The protest follows a last-minute decision by EU officials in the tariff-cutting negotiations in the Uruguay Round of global trade liberalisation to maintain tariff protection for imports of D-Rams, critical components in all personal computers and other consumer electronics products. This was in spite of agreement to make sweeping tariff cuts across large parts of the semiconductor and industrial electronics sectors. 'With almost no D-Ram production capacity in Europe, we have to import these at high cost from Japan and Korea,' said Mr Bruno Lamborgini of Olivetti. Mr Lamborgini is also president of the European Association of Manufacturers of Business Machines and the Information Technology Industry (Eurobit). 'It's a nonsense to maintain a 14 per cent tariff wall, while reducing tariffs on other components. It will have a powerful negative effect on Europe's competitiveness, and may force us to move production out of Europe,' he added. The tariffs add Ecu20m (Pounds 15.24m) a year to Olivetti's costs: personal computers account for 25 per cent of the company's sales. The tariffs also hurt manufacturers such as ICL, Philips and Bull. Eurobit accounts for annual computer output of about Ecu12bn, Mr Lamborgini declared. 'Everyone works on extremely thin margins, and even a small amount can make an immense difference to competitiveness.' The only company appearing to benefit is Siemens of Germany, which has a limited D-Ram capacity and may have plans to add to this in the near future.</p>

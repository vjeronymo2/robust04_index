			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Fresh moves on Ferruzzi The new executives running Italy's heavily indebted Ferruzzi group may be planning fresh legal steps against their predecessors and members of the controlling Ferruzzi family, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. The prospect of further action follows a stream of allegations in leaked documents which indicate former executives of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) and its big Montedison industrial offshoot operated an illicit system of parallel funding, based on bank loans to obscure Montedison subsidiaries. The money raised was allegedly used for various means, including covering up commodity trading losses and meeting the personal needs of Ferruzzi family members. Ferfin's new board is meeting today to re-examine its financial position. Tomorrow Montedison's board will meet to consider further legal steps. Earlier this month the company won court approval to freeze up to L500bn (Pounds 209m) in assets from former executives.</p>

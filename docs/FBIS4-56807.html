			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cristina Hasbun de Merino] </F>   [Text] San Jose, 7 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Salvadoran President  Alfredo Cristiani said today that Central America is en route to  political stability and that he believes that with the change in  governments in the area the integration process will receive new  impetus.    In a statement to ACAN-EFE, Cristiani said that Honduras,  Costa Rica, and El Salvador "have consolidated their  democracies" with their recent electoral processes and that the  countries that still "give reason for concern" are Guatemala and  Nicaragua.    Notwithstanding, the Salvadoran president emphasized that  last year Guatemala was able to solve, "within the framework of  constitutional legality," the self-inflicted coup of Former  President Jorge Serrano Elias, after which Ramiro de Leon Carpio  became president.    Cristiani, who signed peace agreements with the former  Salvadoran guerrilla forces in January 1992, is confident that  the peace negotiations to end the armed conflict in Guatemala,  which dates back to 1960, will end successfully and emphasized  that "the science of peace is patience." He emphasized,  however, that it is difficult to predict when the government and  the Guatemalan guerrilla forces will sign a peace agreement,  because "negotiations are sometimes slow and difficult and one  cannot be hasty in something so delicate."    With respect to Nicaragua's political situation, Cristiani  said "there are still some details" to clear up, but "little by  little the Nicaraguan people are overcoming their problems." "I  believe Central America is headed toward stability; there are no  destabilizing elements," stated Cristiani, who on 1 June will  turn the presidency over to President-elect Armando Calderon  Sol, leader of Cristiani's own right-wing Nationalist Republican  Alliance party.    Cristiani is confident that changes in Central American  governments will give new impetus to the region's integration  process, which in recent months have become bogged down due to  the general elections being carried out in most of these  countries.    He said that, since the beginning of the integration  process,  governments of different ideologies have participated and made  satisfactory headway, and that, because of this, he does not  believe there will be any delay in this issue as a result of the  administrative changes going on in El Salvador, Honduras, Costa  Rica, and, just around the corner, in Panama.    Cristiani said he spoke of this with Honduran President  Carlos Roberto Reina, and with Costa Rican President-elect Jose  Maria Figueres, who will be sworn in on Sunday, adding: "The two  are willing to continue the integration effort." In El  Salvador's case, the president said his party's policy "is in  favor of integration."    Cristiani admitted that the major advances in the Central  American integration process have centered on economic issues,  but he did not rule out that in the coming years the social  aspect might climb higher on the agenda. In addition, the  president believes it improbable that his country's peace  process could suffer a setback as a result of the internal  crisis of the former rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front (FMLN), because the five groups that comprise the FMLN  signed the accords that put an end to the 12-year war.    Cristiani believes the differences that arose within the  ranks of the FMLN one week ago are "logical" given "their  different leftist ideologies," which may have united them for  the armed struggle but could lead to their break up in the  political arena.    "The only problem I consider delicate is the internal  threats  that could deteriorate into violence within the FMLN, but the  government will be ready not only to try to prevent this, but,  in case violence does occur, to apprehend those responsible and  put them where they belong," Cristiani said.    A clandestine group of dubious ideology threatened the life  of various former FMLN commanders, including Joaquin Villalobos,  for having "betrayed revolutionary principles" by negotiating  with the government on the make-up of the Legislative Assembly  Directorate.</p>

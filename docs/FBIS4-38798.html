			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 1 (YONHAP) -- Some 200 Taeguk-ki  (Korean national flag)-waving ethnic Koreans welcomed President  Kim Yong-sam as he arrived at Cheremetyevo Airport here  Wednesday for a four-day state visit to Russia.    President Kim, accompanied by First Lady Son Myong-sun  aboard  a Korean Air chartered plane, was welcomed by the Russian  Government protocol officer and Korean Ambassador to Moscow Kim  Suk-kyu.    The presidential plane touched down at 3:30 PM (Moscow time)  and the chief executive showed no signs of fatigue despite the  10 and a half-hour flight from Seoul. He waved at the welcoming  crowd as he came down the ramp.    Kim was then received by First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg  Soskovets and Russian Ambassador to Seoul Georgiy Kunadze before  reviewing an honor guard and saluting the two countries' flags  as their national anthems were played.    After exchanging greetings with Vice Foreign Minister  Alexandr Panov and other Russian Government leaders, the Kims  received bouquets of flowers from the children of Korean  residents -- Shin Yong-un and Kim Pyong-su -- and shook hands  with many ethnic Koreans who had come out to welcome them.    -- Shortly after his chartered plane took off from Seoul  Airport, President Kim changed into causal attire and, in a  relaxed mood, entered the sections where members of the official  entourage and the press corps were sitting and shook hands with  each of them.    When a reporter reminded him that many leaders of opposition  parties, including chairman Yi Ki-taek of the Democratic Party,  had come out to Seoul Airport to see him off, the president  quipped: "Aren't all trying to engage in big-time politics?"    As the plane flew through Japanese air space, Kim summoned  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and other members of the official  entourage to his "office in the air" and had a brief chat.    At the meeting, Gen. Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint  Chiefs  of Staff, told the president that because of North Korea, the  plane had to go to Khabarovsk via Niigata, taking an extra two  hours.    "We should be able to fly directly (to Khabarosvk) soon,"  Kim  said, obviously alluding to a time when the country is unified  and airlines can fly directly to anywhere from Seoul.    -- During the brief meeting with his official entourage, Kim  remembered that the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and  National Unification Committee was to hold a special session on  the North Korean nuclear row.    Talking to Rep. Chong Chae-mun, chairman of the committee,  the president asked jokingly: "Now that you are here, who is  going to preside over the session?"    "(The committee's) manager Rep. Kang Shin-cho can do that,"  Chong replied, seriously but with a smile.</p>

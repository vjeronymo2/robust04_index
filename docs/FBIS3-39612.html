			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>   [Excerpt] A company of around 150 men from the Coldstream  Guards was moving into Sarajevo today as the likelihood of NATO  airstrikes receded.    The British troops will reinforce United Nations forces  already in the Bosnian capital and help monitor the ceasefire  and control Serb and Muslim heavy weapons.    The self-sufficient force, including engineer, logistics,  anti-tank and mortar specialists, earlier left the UK base at  Vitez in Warrior and other armoured fighting vehicles.    They will be joined shortly by a second company of  Coldstream  Guards, bringing the total deployment in Sarajevo to almost 300  men.    Hopes were high that the Moscow initiative to send 400  Russian troops to Sarajevo would persuade the Serbs to comply  fully with the NATO ultimatum to withdraw or hand over control  of their heavy weapons by midnight Sunday [20 February].    Although the Bosnian Muslims and others have voiced concern  about Russia's close relationship with the Serbs, they will not  seek to prevent the move.    And Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind sought to calm fears  about possible Russian bias towards the Serbs.    "Of course it is the case that Russia has a particular  relationship with Serbia, but that also applies to other  countries," he said.    Malaysia was very close to the Bosnian government, yet its  troops were serving under the UN in the war zone.    "We all accept there will inevitably be old friendships, old  ties, that have to be taken into account," said the Defence  Secretary.    "The crucial point is that all forces in Bosnia come under  the UN command."    The Russian decision has led to a significant withdrawal of  heavy guns, with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic pledging  that the war in Sarajevo was finally over.    The UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, said  there was a "particular exodus" and he believed that people  finally wanted peace.    The Russian move eased pressure on the Government, under  attack for refusing to send an extra infantry battalion to  Bosnia after Sir Michael appealed for 3,000 more troops.    Mr Rifkind again defended the Government's position,  stressing that Britain had 2,500 troops in the region while  other countries like the United States had no representation.    Sixty specialist mortar locating troops are due to leave  Britain for Sarajevo tomorrow with morale sky-high.    Men from the 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery [RHA] at  Topcliffe, North Yorkshire, will join colleagues from the 1st  Regiment RHA from Tidworth, Hampshire.    They will take five sets of Cymbeline mortar locating radar  systems, which will be able to detect the precise source of any  shell fired in violation of the Sarajevo ceasefire.

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Marking the 25th anniversary of Surgeon General Luther L. Terry's landmark  report Jan. 11, 1964, on smoking and health, current Surgeon General C. Everett  Koop praised the dramatic changes that have occurred in the nation's smoking  habits, but urged that efforts be accelerated to discourage more children,  women, minorities and blue-collar workers from smoking. "In the 1940s and 1950s  smoking was chic, now, increasingly it is shunned," he said in his annual  report on smoking. Since 1965, Koop said, nearly half of all living adults who  have ever smoked have quit.  </P></p>

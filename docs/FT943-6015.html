			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: US visa gives veteran a role in peace process - Joe Cahill The final piece of the jigsaw to fall into place before the announcement of the IRA ceasefire was the granting on Tuesday of a US visa to Mr Joe Cahill, a veteran republican. During the visit of an influential Irish-American delegation to Dublin and Belfast last week, Sinn Fein attached great importance to the US government allowing a senior republican to visit the country. The purpose of Mr Cahill's visit is to explain the plans of Sinn Fein and the IRA to republican supporters and to prepare the ground for Sinn Fein's efforts to encourage the US administration into acting as an 'honest broker' in developing the peace process. Mr Cahill, now in his late 60s, was sentenced to death for IRA activity in 1942. The sentence was commuted, and he emerged in the early 1970s as a key figure in establishing the Provisional IRA when it split from the Official IRA. He became commanding officer of the IRA's 'Belfast Brigade' in 1971. He met Mr Harold Wilson, the Labour leader then in opposition, during a 72-hour IRA ceasefire. The two met again later at Mr Wilson's home. Mr Merlyn Rees, then Labour's spokesman on Northern Ireland, described Mr Cahill and his colleagues as 'hard men who talked and looked like soldiers. 'They talked solely in terms of military victory. There was no sign of compromise'. Mr Cahill became head of the IRA's Army Council in November 1972 and was involved in negotiating the first Libyan arms shipments for the IRA. He was arrested by the Irish Navy in March 1973 aboard a West German cargo ship, accompanying five tons of Libyan arms. He spent time interned in Northern Ireland and was imprisoned in the Republic, where he spent 23 days on hunger strike. Replaced by a younger leadership in the late 1970s, Mr Cahill has remained a respected figure in the Republican movement.</p>

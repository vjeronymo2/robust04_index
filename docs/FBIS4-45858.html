			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] After a two-day break, the radio bridge with  Gorazde and Esad Ohranovic, chairman of the Executive Council of  the Gorazde Region, and Dr. Alija Begovic, (?director) of the  Gorazde hospital, has been established again. Here is a report  by Senada Cumurovic: [passage omitted]    Ohranovic: The greatest problems that the citizens  of Gorazde are now facing are the accommodation of the  population that has been streaming from the occupied regions  into the town and the problem of water. We are seeking the best  solutions here and are insisting that the international  organizations help solve the problem. The International Red  Cross has tried to do something and has brought some equipment  to supply at least the hospital with drinking water, that is,  water for cleaning. However, the problem of the entire town has  still not been solved. We are working together with the  international organizations to solve the problem, but this is  nevertheless going slowly. Gorazde's people are having a real  problem with water and are using the murky waters of the River  Drina.    Cumurovic: Thanks to the packages from the  International Committee of the Red Cross and Medecins Sans  Frontieres, the medical supplies to Gorazde and its hospitals  have been improved, Dr. Alija Begovic said. However, he  indicated a major health problem.    Begovic: It seems that we are facing an epidemic  of infectious hepatitis. We already have several cases of it in  different parts of the town. In such unhygienic conditions, this  will be fatal if something is not done urgently.    Cumurovic: In three days, 265 wounded people have  been evacuated from Gorazde but the need for further evacuation  is still great. At this moment, UNPROFOR teams are visiting  villages in the commune in order to transport people to Gorazde  and then further on. Besides, in the town itself, 400 to 500  wounded people are awaiting evacuation, Dr. Begovic said.  [passage omitted]</p>

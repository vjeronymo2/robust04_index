			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature, compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] President Yeltsin's press service says that Boris  Yeltsin and Guntis Ulmanis will meet at tentatively 1100, Moscow  time, on Saturday.    The two national leaders will be expected to sign a number  of  documents.    In Friday's interview with INTERFAX, chief Sergey Zotov of  the Russian delegation to the negotiations with Latvia said that  in Moscow Ulmanis would be expected to sign the whole package of  military agreements (a basic agreement on the withdrawal of the  Russian troops from Latvia, an agreement on the 5.5-year lease  of the Skrunda radar station, an agreement on the social  protection of the withdrawing Russian servicemen, and an  agreement on the social protection of the retired Russian  servicemen and their families).    According to Zotov, the Russian and Latvian Government  delegations closed around of negotiations in Jurmala, Thursday  [28 April]. On Latvian request they drew up an additional  protocol to the agreement on the social protection of the  retired Russian servicemen and their families.    The protocol provided for the creation of special funds,  endowments and organizations for the solution of problems that  would arise in the course of the servicemen's voluntary  repatriation. Foreign sources, too, would be allowed to finance  the repatriation.    The protocol eliminated what remained of the Latvian  objections to the whole package of bilateral agreements. So,  Zotov said, the road was clear for Ulmanis' visit to Moscow.</p>

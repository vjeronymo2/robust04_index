			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Peruvian National Police [PNP] have unexpectedly  ordered the dismantling of the Criminal Investigative Police and  the Fiscal Patrimony Division in the interior. Personnel of the  Counterterrorism Provincial Police (Jecote) have been  significantly reduced, thus affecting the technical side of  investigative work.    The personnel from these units, which formed a division and  were headed by colonels (in regions) and commanders (in  subregions), will now occupy administrative posts.    This absurd measure by the PNP has cut personnel and reduced  the duties of the National Counterterrorism Directorate  (Dincote), the National Criminal Investigative Directorate  [Direccion Nacional de Investigacion Criminal -- Dinincri], and  the Fiscal Patrimony National Directorate.    On 4 March, the PNP issued Internal Resolution  2848-DGPNP/EMP, approving the PNP organization for this year.  This entails substantial changes in the structure of the PNP,  which was established by Legislative Decree No. 744 issued in  1991.    Sources have criticized the changes, stating that a  resolution issued by the PNP director cannot modify a resolution  issued by a higher institution. The biggest concern is that the  changes have taken place in the provinces.    EL COMERCIO correspondents have reported that, for example,  the Criminal Investigative Police and the Fiscal Patrimony  Directorate have already been dismantled and the specialized  investigative tasks that they carried out have been assigned to  the local police stations which are short of personnel who, in  turn, are not properly trained to do this job.    The source said that this measure represents a ``green  light'' for delinquency in the interior because personnel at  police stations are scarce and their logistic and investigative  capabilities are well below that of criminals in the provinces.    Reduction of Jecote personnel and duties was also criticized  because, although terrorist actions have decreased, one can  hardly ``sing victory'' or afford to deploy personnel onto other  duties.    Proof of this is that the Armed Forces continue in a "state  of emergency" in many zones that have apparently been pacified.  The military authorities, in a more responsible attitude,  believe there is still work to be done in these areas.    The aforementioned resolution prompted the removal of 200  Dincote detectives specialized in counterterrorism, who will be  placed at the disposal of the Public Order Directorate  [Direccion de Orden Publico]. This means they will wear  uniforms and be assigned to patrol the streets.    Dinincri functions have also been reduced. For example, the  Kidnap Investigation Division (Didcol) -- which handled cases of  adult rape, seduction and rape of minors, procuring, and  indecent assault -- has been dismantled.    The departments and operation groups of five other Dinincri  divisions have also been reduced. Three departments of the  Division for Crimes Against Life, Body, and Health [Division de  Delitos Contra la Vida, el Cuerpo, y la Salud] have been  dismantled and only the Homicide Department is left. The same  goes for the Theft Division.    The Contraband, Customs Tariff Evasion Division, and other  divisions of the Fiscal Patrimony Directorate have been reduced.    As with Dincote, personnel that leave the units will be  placed at the disposal of the Public Order Directorate or will  be given administrative jobs.</p>

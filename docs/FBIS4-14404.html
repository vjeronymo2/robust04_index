			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vissarion Sisnev report: "Washington and `Chicken Kiev.' </F> Review of U.S.-Russian Relations Is Going on Behind the Scenes"]    [Text] Washington -- Monday 28 March will go down in  history as the day when, for the first time, a special briefing  was organized in the White House for the Russian press corps  accredited to the U.S. capital. Admittedly, this event was  organized not by the principal occupant of the White House but  by one of his staff, but it was a major event nonetheless. The  briefing was organized to deal with a topic that is of utmost  importance to us: The state of U.S.-Russian relations. On the  whole the essence of what was said boils down to what Secretary  of State Christopher stated on television last Sunday: Russia  remains one of the administration's foreign policy priorities  and it will offer every possible assistance in order to  strengthen the democratic market road of development.    There is no reason to doubt that this is how things will be.  Just as there is no doubt that relations between our countries  are visibly becoming more strained or at any rate less  unequivocal -- a touch of what I would describe as rivalry has  clearly crept in. Former President George Bush, a Republican, is  being reproached because he was the first to have adopted a  "Russia first" course, and because he arrived in Kiev after  Moscow and "lectured" the Ukrainian leadership on the  desirability of friendly cooperation with Russia. At the time  the press christened this episode "Chicken Kiev," thus alluding  to the second meaning that the word "chicken" has for Americans:  weakness of character.    Eminent observers here believe that Clinton has not only  inherited this "Chicken Kiev," he has recently started to "have  another think about it." At the White House briefing the  changes were expressed in the same mild wording that was used in  Moscow: The "honeymoon" in U.S.-Russian relations is over. At  the same time it was stressed that they certainly cannot be  described as being in crisis. On this there is clear agreement  with Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev, who described the  present stage as "mature partnership" in an article published in  the THE NEW YORK TIMES.    But this is seemingly the only thing which the denizens of  Washington's corridors of power agree with in Kozyrev's program  article entitled "You Should Not Frighten Us." For example,  Professor Perlmutter, the well-known political analyst and  editor of the magazine STRATEGIC STUDIES, thought that "Minister  Kozyrev has started to talk the language of the Cold War." He  took extreme exception to the accusation that "new chauvinist  banners are fluttering in the air in Washington" and that the  United States is striving to achieve "world hegemony."  Perlmutter says that he is "slightly irritated" by the  minister's tendency to include areas of "the former Soviet  empire" in his concept of "our national interests," that is to  say Belorussia [Belarus], Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. And there is  much else besides he does not like about A. Kozyrev's position.    It would be a small misfortune if just one expert or  journalist were to get up and openly voice the question: "What  precisely is the difference between 'national interests'  according to the democrat Kozyrev on the one hand and the  so-called reactionaries and ultranationalists on the other?"  Especially as the specific accusations always boil down to the  "unexpected interference" by Russia in the Bosnian crisis,  thanks to which NATO air power has not been used to launch  strikes against the Serbs. But it is quite clear that in  addition to this unexpected briefing for the Russian press,  other briefings are also being organized in Washington -- at a  much higher level and with franker remarks on the very same  topic. President Clinton spent one and a half hours chatting  with representatives of ethnic minorities of East European  origin, and one of the people who is closest to him -- Deputy  Secretary of State Talbott -- has met with ambassadors of East  European and Baltic countries.    Judging by information which somehow leaked out of these  meetings, we must draw the unambiguous conclusion that a review  of relations with Russia is going on behind the scenes. We are  not talking about a return to the mores of nuclear and political  confrontation. However, again and again we are hearing a term  which dates from that unfortunate period, namely "containment."  The State Department's guests were informed that up to now the  United States has not paid enough attention to states bordering  on Russia, but from now on all this will change because,  according to informed U.S. colleagues, "the United States and  the West cannot basically ignore the legitimate concerns of  these countries which have been provoked by Russian  expansionism."    It is also claimed that President Clinton has privately  intimated that if Russian expansionist behavior spills over the  borders of East European states, the United States will  immediately change its position with regard to admitting East  European countries to NATO. This is reported, for example, by  the consistently well-informed R. Evans and R. Novak in THE  WASHINGTON POST. They also believe that the pressure of public  opinion polls is "drawing Clinton away from a love affair with  Russia." They are referring to the fact that ethnic minorities,  who put together constitute millions of voters, did not forgive  Bush for his "chicken Kiev," and naturally they will not forgive  the current President if he continues the "love affair." It  should also be remembered that before breaking for the Easter  vacation, the Senate adopted a resolution warning that the  United States would rebuff "by all appropriate means" any  Russian attempt to exert pressure on East Europe or the Baltic  states.    The conclusion? It was summarized by Evans and Novak in  yesterday's article: "Bill Clinton and Strobe Talbott are the  last people in the world you would suspect of wanting to return  to the Cold War. But they are unambiguously letting it be known  that they no longer intend to overlook Russia's imperialist  aspirations." Let us not get into an argument about how  justified the term "imperialist" is. Let us simply take it as  given that on this side of the Atlantic, Russian foreign policy  is for one reason or another being presented in this manner. In  print, with quotations from the highest authorities. It seems  the U.S.-Russian "honeymoon" really is over. It is a pity, but,  as they say, nothing lasts for ever and we must see things for  what they really are.</p>

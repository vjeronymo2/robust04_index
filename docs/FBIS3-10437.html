			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Henrique </F> Cardoso by Cristiano Romero on 27 February -- place not given]    [Text] [Romero] Yesterday Deputy Paulo Paim said that he  heard you say that those businessmen who want to convert their  prices into URV [Real Value Unit] will have to discuss this with  the Finance Ministry.    [Cardoso] Prices will not be converted into URV. The reason  is that if prices are converted into URV the initial advantage I  am granting salary earners will disappear because prices will  also be subject to a unit that may increase on a daily basis.  It is worse because salaries are corrected on a monthly basis  while prices vary on a daily basis.    [Romero] If the businessmen choose to convert their prices  into URV, will they be able to do so?    [Cardoso] No. The prices can only be set in real cruzeiros.  Of course, they can say how many URV's the product is worth, but  then the URV has to be a fixed unit. An example: It is worth  10 URV's. They could say what 10 URV's are worth every day. The  URV would have to be fixed but we are not encouraging the  conversion of the URV into a real cruzeiro because that is going  to happen later on when we implement the real.    [Romero] The businessmens' price lists are dollarized.  Suppose they decide to adopt the URV, will they able to do so  freely or will they have to go to the Finance Ministry  beforehand to negotiate the conversion value?    [Cardoso] Nobody will have to go to the Finance Ministry.  Because they will, among each other, among parties, adopt the  dollar or whatever they want as they do now. What they cannot  do is to exhibit the price only in URV's.    [Romero] What about speculative increases?    [Cardoso] Look here, speculative increases will make no  sense from now on because speculating automatically causes  salaries to increase.    [Romero] Will there be any means to fight speculation?    [Cardoso] There is no need due to the method we will use.  We are fully protecting salaries. From now on there will be no  more discussions. I see so many worried labor union leaders but  from now on they will have to worry about something else because  the argument, which has been valid up to now, about "the  government having to adjust, about the peak, the average," will  disappear with this. From now on salaries will adjust  automatically.    [Moreno] How is the government going to control price  abuses?    [Cardoso] You will see what mechanism we use when the  problem surfaces but in a competitive market the market itself  takes care of this problem. The problem is the public  monopolies, the existing monopolies, the oligopolies, and for  these we have adequate tools.    [Romero] How was the minimum salary value established? It  seems that during yesterday's meeting, the president himself  requested an effort to improve the minimum salary value?    [Cardoso] Nothing of the sort. There was no specific  discussion on the subject. The minimum salary issue does not  fall directly under the Finance Ministry, it concerns the Social  Security Ministry. Brazilian laws tie one thing to another.  Therefore, every time the minimum salary increases a bit it  causes a serious problem for the Social Security Ministry. I  believe we must struggle very hard now and during the  constitutional revision to break these ties and give the  pensioners another type of guarantee.    [Romero] Will the minimum salary remain at $64 at the  commercial exchange rate?    [Cardoso] I do not know. I do not know what the exchange  rate will be on the day they are fixed. We have not finished  discussing this issue. I only want to point out that the  Finance Ministry is not causing any difficulties. The  difficulties stem from that real impasse.    [Romero] What about the disagreements between the Labor and  Finance Ministries?    [Cardoso] There are no disagreements between these  ministries. Yesterday the Labor Ministry experts produced a list  but it was wrong. I will explain this once again because it is  very simple. What we are telling the country -- and we are going  to stress it tomorrow -- is: look, prices are increasing,  therefore, we must protect salary earners. What is the best  guarantee you can give salary earners? Transform their salaries  into something that varies as the cost of living varies. That  is the URV. From now on, once the URV has been approved, nobody  needs to worry about the adjustment any more because it will be  automatic.    [Romero] Yesterday experts left the Finance Ministry  commenting that February inflation would be absorbed?    [Cardoso] Look, I do not know because I am not an expert on  the subject. I do not know what that means. I think I can  guarantee what will happen from 1 March on. What happened  before then is something that must be discussed by the labor  unions, businessmen, and the business chambers. The government  is more than willing to solve the problem but it is not  something that can be solved by law. We must say that, from now  on, we have changed the rules. We have changed the rules to  benefit the workers. People must understand this. There is no  point in talking about the past to forecast the future, which is  going to be different.    [Romero] Will some job categories lose money?    [Cardoso] If any category has a small loss, an adjustment  can  be made and this varies from one category to another. There can  be losses in the first month, only in March, but there will be  gains in the following months. But how can the adjustments be  made? Through business organizations, labor courts. The  government favors an adjustment if there are losses in some  categories. Others will have gains. What will happen to those?    [Romero] Will a bill be submitted to Congress to discuss how  to replace the losses?    [Cardoso] No. This is not a question of law. We are here  from  now on to make sure this kind of issue is over. I cannot be  responsible for what happened in the past. I am responsible from  now on. From now on, no worker's salary will ever be below the  cost of living.    [Romero] What about the public servants?    [Cardoso] The situation of the public servants is the same.  I  know they have an advantage. The public servants law readjusts  salaries in January with zero deficit, then it loses 10 percent  and continues to lose. This is no longer the case. The public  servants will have the same monthly adjustment as the private  workers.    [Romero] Members of the Armed Forces were demanding 50  percent in March and will end up gaining 25 percent.    [Cardoso] That is not true. Take the following into account.  In March, the readjustment for public servants will be 50  percent. If the March inflation rate is 50 percent, they will  come out even. You can then imagine: if the inflation rate was  47 percent in March, the workers would gain 3 percent. If the  inflation rate in April was zero, they would get 50 percent.    [Romero] The big question is, what was left behind?    [Cardoso] A portion of the inflation left by other salary  laws resulting from free negotiations. Otherwise, we would fully  adjust salaries from now on and I want to do away with that.  From now on there will no longer be the difference between cost  of living and salaries. Therefore, the portion left behind is  very small and should be negotiated in the business  organizations. The government agrees.    [Romero] Will the losses be negotiated freely?    [Cardoso] Yes, if there are any ...    [Romero] What will the priorities be for converting the  minimum salary: not bankrupt the social security or give  purchasing power to the workers?    [Cardoso] It will give purchasing power to the workers. Why?  Because mainly the ones who earn the minimum salary are  pensioners, 11,000 million pensioners earn the minimum salary.  Minister Cutolo said they will get a real increase of 17 percent  when the salaries are fixed in URV. Some of them will get 30  percent.    [Romero] Even with the prices in dollars?    [Cardoso] Yes. Therefore, it is a monetary illusion for an  individual to think: "I will earn $80." That is not true. He  will get it 30 days later and that money will be worth much  less. Not now. Now, he will gain. Therefore, that is the  difference. The country must understand that difference to be  able to see that we are really doing something, a proposal.  Moreover, I heard from Deputy Paim and other union leaders who,  putting aside the February issue said: Look, that proposal is  very good."    [Romero] If the government does not transform its utility  rates into URV and does not use it to correct taxes, how can you  expect to give credibility to that index in the market?    [Cardoso] No, the government will use the URV to correct  taxes because the URV is produced by three indexes, and one of  the indexes is the Ufir [reference fiscal unit].    [Romero] Will the UVR have parity with the Ufir?    [Cardoso] It will.    [Romero] From the beginning?    [CArdoso] From the very beginning.    [Romero] And utility rates?    [Cardoso] If I fix them in URV, what will happen? They will  increase every day. Then, in order to be on the side of  consumers I will adjust utility rates in a normal way, that is,  by the real average of the past four months.    [Romero] Will there be rules for the conversion of rents,  school tuitions, and health plans?    [Cardoso] We think the idea of the URV is to give a certain  time for the adjustment of contracts between the parties  involved. If they can adjust their contracts in that period and  make them in URV that contract will no longer change. It will no  longer change if it is written in URV. If contracts are not  adjusted for the established deadlines to implement the real,  then we will issue regulations.</p>

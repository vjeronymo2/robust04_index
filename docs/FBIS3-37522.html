Instead, government sources report,  a directorate on the coordination of administrative organs'  activity led by Valeriy Pavlov, former first deputy state  secretary, has been created. Simultaneously, a new position has  been introduced in the Council of Ministers apparatus --  government secretary for national security, whose rank is close  to that of ambassador at large. Appointed to this post has been  the former state secretary, Gennadiy Danilov, whom observers in  Minsk describe as one of the most influential people among those  closest to the premier.</p>

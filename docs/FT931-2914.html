			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / James Fisher falls to Pounds 1.5m and gloomy on trading JAMES FISHER, the Cumbria-based shipping group, yesterday accompanied sharply reduced annual profit and dividend with a gloomy statement on current trading. Despite a reduced deficit of Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.99m) from port operations, a lower contribution from the shipping side of Pounds 2.97m (Pounds 3.8m) and interest payable of Pounds 1.06m (Pounds 674,251) left the pre-tax line for the 12 months to end-December at Pounds 1.49m (Pounds 2.11m). The outcome was struck after exceptional credits of Pounds 194,140 (Pounds 603,104) and came on overall turnover of Pounds 31.1m (Pounds 30.1m). Directors said there were no signs of any improvement in trading conditions. 'pressure on profit margins, aggressive competition and severe recessionary influences continue to affect every sphere . . . trading in the short term will continue to be extremely difficult.' The final dividend is just 0.5p for a total of 1p (5.5p), payable from earnings of 2.66p (6.84p) per share.</p>

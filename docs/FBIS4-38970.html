			<p>BFN     [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Viktor Semenov, head of  the Sevastopol city council of people's deputies, stated at a  news conference on 2 June that two fleets cannot be stationed in  Sevastopol. He backed up his opinion by saying that the  servicemen of Ukraine's naval forces and those of the Black Sea  Fleet are "biologically incompatible." Also, Viktor Semenov  referred to the statements by the defense ministers of Ukraine  and Russia, in which they called relations between the  servicemen of the two fleets normal, as misinforming journalists  and the public.    In this connection, the press center of Ukraine's naval  forces made public a statement, which, in particular, says:  "Admitting the fact that Semenov has the right to express his  personal opinion, the press center of Ukraine's naval forces is  at the same time authorized to declare that such statements by  an official, who is a member of the military council of  Ukraine's naval forces, are of a provocative nature and they do  not promote the negotiating process on the Black Sea Fleet.  Objectively, the servicemen of Ukraine's naval forces and the  Black Sea Fleet, who have for many years been serving together,  cannot have differences; moreover, relations between them cannot  be brought down to a "biological" level. The above statement  can turn political problems between Ukraine and Russia relating  to the Black Sea Fleet into interethnic problems whose  consequences can hardly be predicted."    The command of Ukraine's naval forces is also surprised and  indignant over a statement by the head of the city council to  the effect that "the Sevastopol naval institute is vacant" and  over the "groundless proposals" concerning the further use of  its base. The statement by the press center of the naval forces  of Ukraine indicates that the educational process is now under  way at the institute and all the institute's funds will be  further used in the interests of building Ukraine's naval forces.    The statement by the press center of Ukraine's naval forces  expresses the conviction that "no ill-considered statements by  politicians can stir up enmity between the servicemen of  Ukraine's naval forces and the Black Sea Fleet. As far as  political issues are concerned, these are to be tackled by  politicians."</p>

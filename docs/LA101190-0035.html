			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: HASH: IT'S NOT JUST FOR BREAKFAST ANYMORE  </P> <P> This potato recipe is a sure-fire winner for any meal. For breakfast or brunch,  serve it with slices of fresh fruit.  </P> <P> For lunch or dinner I prefer to serve it with a medley of colorful vegetables.  </P> <P> The hash will taste best if you make it the day before you plan to serve it. It  is a wonderful way to use leftover roast beef.  </P> <P> ROAST BEEF HASH  </P> <P> 2 large potatoes (1 pound), grated, soaked and well- drained (3 cups)  </P> <P> 2 cups finely chopped cooked roast beef, all visible fat removed  </P> <P> 2 cups finely chopped onions  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> 2 cups defatted beef stock  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt (omit if using salted stock)  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce  </P> <P> Combine potatoes, roast beef and onions in shallow baking dish. Mix well. Place  under broiler until browned, stirring frequently to brown deeply and evenly.  </P> <P> Transfer mixture to heavy, oven-proof skillet. Add garlic, beef stock, salt,  pepper and Worcestershire. Mix well. Simmer over medium heat until potatoes are  tender and all liquid is absorbed.  </P> <P> Pat surface down with back of large spoon. Again place under broiler to brown  and crisp top. Serve immediately. Makes 4 cups or 4 servings.  </P> <P> Note: If made day before serving, cool to room temperature after simmering hash  and before crisping final time. Return to baking dish, pat surface down with  back of large spoon, cover tightly and refrigerate. To serve hash, heat at 350  degrees about 15 minutes to heat thoroughly. Place under broiler to brown and  crisp prior to serving.  </P> <P> Each serving contains approximately 289 calories; 91 mg cholesterol; 8 gm fat;  480 mg sodium.  </P></p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Technology: Setting standards for telecoms - Technically Speaking The diverse interests which comprise European telecommunications meet in Nice next month in an attempt to resolve an issue which threatens to split the industry and damage the standards-setting process. The issue concerns telecoms standards, intellectual property and the extent to which a company's rights to a proprietary technology can be overridden in the public interest. The Gatt trade talks and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) are both likely to be affected by the outcome of the Nice meeting. ETSI was established by the European Commission to handle the highly technical but commercially vital subject of telecoms standardisation. It is made up of telecoms operators (PTTs), national governments, telecoms equipment manufacturers, information technology companies and consultants. When it comes to voting, national governments and the PTTs are in the majority. ETSI plays a crucial role in the standards-setting process and, therefore, in the development of the single market where inter-connectivity and inter-operability of electronics equipment is essential. Brief acquaintance with Europe's motley collection of telecoms systems is enough to convince anyone of the importance of ETSI's work. All the greater shame that it is in danger of being disrupted by the current squabble. Standards are essentially concerned with operational rules. Inevitably, they involve products and processes that are the intellectual property of companies which may have invested many millions of dollars in their development. For most standards-setting bodies - the International Standards Organisation, for example - international property rights licensing is voluntary; the IPR owner agrees to the incorporation of its technology in the standard. If it refuses, the standards body is forced to find a way of setting the standard without impinging on the IPR. ETSI is taking a different tack. It has written a draft proposal which would allow 90 days from a particular date during which a company may withhold a particular IPR from a standard; if it fails to do so, the technology becomes available for licensing to members and non-members. Governments and the PTTs, which spend comparatively little on research and development and own few IPRs, seem content with the proposal. IT companies, which sow billions of dollars a year in research and harvest IPRs like wheat, are outraged. Led by International Business Machines, Digital Equipment, Motorola and Philips, they are lobbying for a modified proposal involving voluntary licencing. The essential problem is the difficulty for any large company of knowing precisely which IPRs or potential IPRs it holds at any one time and which ones may be involved in the standards the multiplicity of ETSI committees are working on. They fear losing their IPRs by default. Ownership of an IPR which becomes a standard is one of the key technological differentiators for IT companies today. There are arguments that it is a technological problem which could be solved by technology - a computer database, for example, which would match ETSI's work with its members' IPR records. This would be hard to implement in globally spread companies where research is carried out at a multiplicity of sites. There are other considerations. The IT companies complain the proposal may breach Gatt regulations. EC importers of licensed products manufactured in third countries would be at a disadvantage because the terms available to them would be less good than those available to ETSI members. Some computer companies are so concerned by the proposal they are prepared to withdraw from ETSI rather than risk their intellectual treasures. The commission wrote to ETSI last year encouraging it to opt for a voluntary licensing system, based on 'tried and proven principles'. It is hard to disagree with its sentiments.</p>

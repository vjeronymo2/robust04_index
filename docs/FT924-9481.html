			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / US agency urges more Boeing 747 inspections MORE thorough inspections of Boeing 747 aircraft in the wake of last month's crash of an El Al jet in Amsterdam are being strongly urged by the National Transportation Safety Board, the independent federal agency that investigates aviation accidents in the US. The US Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for airline safety standards, has already issued a directive, ordering carriers to inspect engine fuse pins made before 1981 after every 500 landings. The FAA has also demanded increased inspections of engine pins - which help to attach the engine to the wing of the aircraft - made after 1981. However, in a letter to the FAA, the NTSB suggests checks should be even tougher. It recommends inspections after every 100 landings, and that inspection requirements for pins made after 1981 should be stepped up. Yesterday the FAA said the NTSB's suggestions were being given 'priority consideration'. Under US law, the FAA has 90 days to accept or reject the recommendations, or put forward an alternative.</p>

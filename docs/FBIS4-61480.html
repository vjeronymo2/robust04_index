			<p>BFN     [Text] Head of the General Headquarters of the Russian  Armed Forces Mikhail Kolesknikov said that Russia is ready to  launch a first space ship from a base of the missile complex  located in the town of Svobodny-18 (the Amur region) in 1996,  and to carry out manned flights in the future. Speaking to  journalists in Moscow on Wednesday he noted that extra funds  would not be needed for these purposes.    Kolesnikov said that despite positive progress in talks with  the Kazakh side on the use of the Baykonur cosmodrome, a lot of  problems remain unresolved. At the same time he noted that  "today it is impossible to pretend that we do not need Baykonur."    Answering questions, Kolesnikov spoke in favor of holding  Russian-American military exercises on the Totsk test ground of  the Orenburg region this summer. He expressed regret that this  issue "caused heated debate" in the State Duma. "They will be  command post exercises, and not a single American tank will roll  on the Totsk test ground," he said.    Kolesnikov said that by the beginning of this year the  Russian Armed Forces numbered 2,300,000 military servicemen. He  also said that by January 1, 1995, it is planned to reduce the  armed forced down to less than 2 million. He said that  currently the armed forces are recruited to 62 percent of  capacity. He suggested that after the spring draft the figure  will remain the same.</p>

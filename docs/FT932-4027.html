			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory joins attack on VAT reforms MR JOHN WATTS, the Cons-ervative chairman of the Commons Treasury committee, has joined forces with Labour MPs in criticising government plans to change the handling of penalties for misdeclaration of value added tax. A new rule will allow mitigating circumstances to be taken into account by a VAT tribunal when considering a misdeclaration. But Mr Watts said the restrictions on the use of mitigation to explain non-payment were so strict that 'it is difficult to conceive under what circumstances it could be taken into account'. Mr Watts, who withheld his support from the government in a vote this week during discussions on the Finance Bill, said: 'There can be instances where omission to pay tax is wholly innocent. A VAT tribunal ought to be in a position to reach that conclusion.' Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour MP for Hartlepool and a member of the Commons finance committee, said he would consult business organisations and co-ordinating pressure on the chancellor to look again at the government's approach to VAT. According to clause 49 of the Finance Bill, a VAT tribunal is not allowed to take into consideration three factors: Inability to pay. The fact that there has been no actual loss to the Exchequer. The fact that the liable person was acting in good faith. Mr Mandelson said not allowing 'good faith' as mitigation was particularly damaging.</p>

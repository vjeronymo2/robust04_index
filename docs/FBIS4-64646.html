			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. PESC/94/44: "Communique of the Presidency </F> on Behalf of the European Union on the Gaza-Jericho Agreement"]    [Text] The European Union warmly welcomes the agreement  between Israel and the PLO on Gaza-Jericho signed in Cairo on 4  May 1994. It pays tribute to the determination of both sides not  to allow extremist elements to pose obstacles to peace; and  notes with appreciation the role played by the co-sponsors, the  host country and others in encouraging the continuation of  bilateral contacts and negotiations.    It also calls for the full and early implementation of the  declaration of principles, towards which the agreement on  Gaza-Jericho is an important step. In the light of this  agreement, the Union urges all parties to play a full and  positive role in both the bilateral and multilateral tracks of  the peace process.    The European Union has reaffirmed its continuing commitment  to the peace process with its adoption of a joint action on 19  April. This will mobilize the political, economic and financial  resources of the Union in support of a just, lasting and  comprehensive peace. outstanding among them is the fact that two  members of the EU are already taking part in the temporary  international presence in Hebron, the confirmation of the  Union's willingness to participate, at the request of the  parties concerned, in a temporary international presence and the  observation and monitoring of elections.</p>

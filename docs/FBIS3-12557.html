Addressing the Security Council during its session last night  to discuss the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque,  al-Batayinah said: What is required is to provide effective  protection for the Palestinian people to ensure their safety,  security, and basic liberties, to save the holy places from  desecration, and to remove the Israeli settlements. The  objective, he added, is to continue the peace process to reach a  just and honorable settlement based on Israeli withdrawal from  all occupied Arab territory and to ensure the Palestinian  people's legitimate rights.</p>

			<p>Star'?   <F P=102>   43070043B Tokyo JAPAN CHEMICAL WEEK in English 2 Dec 93 pp  6-8--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 43070043B </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo JAPAN CHEMICAL WEEK </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [First two paragraphs are JAPAN CHEMICAL WEEK introduction] </F>   [Text] Japan's fine-ceramics industry is in a major  transition period. Although it had experienced steady growth for  over 10 years, the industry is now in a condition of  unprecedentedly serious proportions, hard hit by the fall in  demand caused by the prolonged economic slump, cost  differentials with established materials as well as cutbacks in  its R&amp;D expenses and personnel as a result of the industry's  poor performance.    Withdrawal from the industry by raw-material and other  makers, and suspension of R&amp;D have become a grisly reality.  Fine  ceramics now stand at the crossroads. Will they end up as merely  the lead-off batter in the fierce new-materials game or will  they overcome their many difficulties and become the real star  of the new-materials troupe?  <H5>  Dow Plans Full-Scale Production of Al Nitride Via Cost </H5> Reduction    The announcement by America's Dow Chemical Co. of an  industrialization plan for aluminum nitride has been one of the  hottest news topics for the fine-ceramics industry this year. It  had been anticipated that Dow Chemical, who had been eagerly  engaged in the study of nitride fine ceramics, would launch  industrialization of the business sooner or later, but industry  circles were surprised when the announcement came during this  worst-ever slump. Moreover, the said plan overwhelmed those in  the fine-ceramics industry, and other observers as well, with  its ambitious scale and the strategy taken by the company: it  plans to industrialize and sell, mainly in the Japanese market,  aluminum-nitride powder in an amount of approximately 1,200 t/y,  while current world demand for the material stands at only  several hundred t/y.    In the history of the Japanese fine-ceramics industry, there  have been business judgments similar to that of Dow Chemical,  although on a smaller scale. Japan's Ube Industries took such a  course when it began industrialization of silicon-nitride  powders, as did Tosoh Corp. with zirconia powder.    Although both companies constructed their large-scale plans  to meet existing domestic consumption plus prospective  world-market demand, the facilities are now compelled to operate  at a low level due to sluggish demand.    Dow's industrialization project may not proceed as smoothly  as planned, although the company has presented a definite target  for cost-cutting by means of mass production, unlike its  Japanese counterparts. "Aluminum nitride has great potential  demand. Though there are users who cannot afford to use it now  as much as they'd like because of its high price, we will be  able to supply them with the product at half the current market  price." (Dow) This is just what these potential users have been  waiting to hear.  <H5>  Sales Likely To Mark Negative Growth for Second Consecutive </H5> Year    Volumewise fine-ceramics sales for 1992 plunged 8.4 percent  from the level of the previous year, according to statistics of  the fine-ceramics industry released by the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry. The negative growth was the  second since 1986, when the ministry started recording  statistics, but the rate of decrease was the largest. As the low  operating rate is continuing this year, the figure for this year  will most likely register for the first time negative growth for  a second consecutive year. Recovery will not be seen until 1994.    What has brought about this situation? The main cause is the  prolonged recession. Since it is a material still under  development, fine ceramics may not recover like established  industrial materials when the economy recovers; fine ceramics  together with other new materials may have to start from scratch  because their reliability has not yet been established. If the  relationship with present users is discontinued, development on  the users' side may also be discontinued.    In the electronics industry, a major user of fine ceramics,  and the automobile industry, a prospective user, the switch to  materials cheaper than fine ceramics is under way for some  parts, although these industries are requesting cost reductions.    Material makers as well as parts makers are faced with a  crucial decision: whether to invest more money and manpower to  further develop new products and realize cost reduction or to  discontinue industrialization of the business.    Another problem is that fine ceramics is used by many  enterprises in their new business sectors, where part of the  profits obtained from their main businesses has been invested.  Many enterprises are suffering from the poor performances of  their main businesses, and one material maker has withdrawn from  the business. Effects on other makers are now under close  observation.

In the field of R&amp;D, a project called "High-Order  Structural Control Fused Inorganic Materials (synergy  ceramics)," which had been promoted as a leading research  activity, will start afresh from the next fiscal year based on  the research and development system of industrial science and  technology.    The aim of the project is to improve, to a great degree, the  properties of fine ceramics by concurrent control at each level  of atomic, molecular and macro structure and to create new fine  ceramics capable of performing, synergistically and  concurrently, plural functions which are not normally feasible.    Development is expected for such industrial uses as follows:  heat exchanger for gas-turbine generators and solid electrolyte  fuel cells in the field of energy; functional material for  purification system for diesel engine exhaust gas and  NO[.sub]x[/] purification catalyser in the environmental  protection field; materials for supersonic aircraft and the  space shuttle in the space and aviation field; and the general  industrial material field.    Another project "High-Temperature CO[.sub]2[/] Separation  and Recovery/Recycling Technologies" will begin next year. It  aims at developing a system which uses ceramics separation  membrane to separate CO[.sub]2[/] at high temperatures above  300C from high-temperature exhaust gas generated from power  plants and cement factories, as well as the application of  segregated carbon dioxide. Zeolite-applied porous membrane,  porous glass-based segregation membrane, and fused  carbonate-carried membrane are being considered. This is the  first project for environmental protection to take advantage of  the properties of fine ceramics, such as that of its  heat-resistance.  <H5>  Standardization Meet Due Next Spring in Tokyo </H5>   International standardization of fine ceramics, a  long-standing problem for the Japanese fine-ceramics industry,  began recently. The ISO (International Standardization  Organization) set up a special committee for fine ceramics  (TC206) in December of last year. Since Japan has been entrusted  with the management of the committee, a parent body for  management promotion, "Promotion Council for International  Standardization of Fine Ceramics," was established in July this  year.    The council will tackle "standardization anticipation": How  to standardize experiment and assessment methods in anticipation  of the direction of technological developments in high-tech  fields and make the standardization concepts common language  among technical circles.    Already the council is actively engaged in coordination of  standards with the U.S. and the EC as well as discussions with  nations whose representatives will be on the committee. The  first general meeting of ISO/TC206 will be held in Tokyo next  spring. Along with the international activity, a domestic  committee, made up of specialists in industrial, official, and  academic circles, was formed within the Fine Ceramics Society of  Japan. The committee has started research for the purpose of  constructing a database for fine ceramics. To secure users'  trust, it is necessary to provide them with information on the  properties of the material in a readily available way, the  database should be reinforced with guaranteed values of physical  properties, in order to expand demand for fine ceramics.    The plan calls for research on the existing database and the  industrial needs for the database, its structure, selection of  data, development of network and selection of access system for  the current fiscal year. Establishment of a database, based on  the results of the research, is planned for the next fiscal year  and thereafter.    In the past, a great market in the future for fine ceramics  was foreseen, providing the basis of corporate judgments for  industrialization. However, now that the world and the  environment surrounding fine ceramics have markedly changed,  corporate awareness may also have to be modified. Apart from  judging the continuation of the business from the viewpoint of  an individual company, this may be the chance for making the  best use of its past development results in cooperation or  tie-up with other companies. After all, fine ceramics is the key  material to support the advanced information-oriented society of  the 21st century.  <H5>  [Box, p 6] </H5> <H5>  "Competition and Cooperation Hold Key to Industry's Future" </H5>   A mood of pessimism is engulfing the fine-ceramics industry  caused by slackening demand for the materials under Japan's  economic recession. But this does not necessarily portend a dark  future for the industry. For fine-ceramics makers, the important  thing is "attitude" reform. Specifically, they should either  present users with easier-to-use products or consider how to  better provide consistent, general-purpose information. This is  necessary from the standpoint of encouraging crossovers from  rival materials to fine ceramics and in cultivating new demand  sources. The ability to do this may hold the key to the  industry's future.    A period of more than 10 years has elapsed since fine  ceramics caught the world's attention as promising new  materials. Looking back over this period, it is clear that the  industry's approach -- namely emphasizing R&amp;D for  technologies  to support next-generation industries -- has played a  significant role in this regard.    Remarkable achievements were made in improving the  properties  of fine ceramics and in appraising related technologies as well.  In particular, the improved characteristics rekindled  anticipation of unlimited possibilities for fine ceramics.    Viewed from a market perspective, the physical improvements  coupled with Japan's period of high economic growth kept  fine-ceramics demand expanding smoothly during this time.    But the economy's lapse into recession put a damper on  fine-ceramics demand growth. Although applications themselves  have been expanding, most of this growth has been observed  within specific areas of use. In other words, manufacturers as  yet have been unable to establish a base for fine ceramics as  general-purpose materials and components. In this sense, the  industry is approaching a turning point.    Spurring crossovers from existing materials to fine ceramics  will require both competition and cooperation. Up to now  fine-ceramics makers for the most part have provided users with  technological information and services, and standardized their  products, on an individual basis. They must pay closer attention  to users' needs in the future.    With these considerations in mind, the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry has taken up  medium-to-long-term challenges facing the industry and proposed  several R&amp;D themes, including High-Order Structural Control  Fused Inorganic Materials (synergy ceramics) and High  Temperature CO[.sub]2[/] Separation and Recovery/Recycling  Technologies. The ministry is also pursuing international  standardization and database building for fine ceramics.  Although such efforts are being undertaken in a tripartite  government, industry and academia arrangement, the enthusiasm  shown by industry is especially encouraging.    Japan must build up its technological development capacity  to  remain competitive in the 21st century. Since technological  innovation energizes industry, and materials play a key role in  this process, fine ceramics would seem to offer much promise. We  hope industry will recognize this and pursue fine-ceramics  development with confidence.</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FED-UP JUDGE SCOLDS 'NAMELESS' DEFENDANT  </P> <P> Struggling again to glean the identity of a man accused of fleecing clients of  thousands of dollars, a Harbor Municipal Court judge on Monday ordered the  defendant to remain in jail.  </P> <P> After twice pressing the man for his true name and date of birth, Judge Susanne  S. Shaw got this response:  </P> <P> "Your honor," said the defendant, "I don't know."  </P> <P> The defendant's attorney then added that her client was invoking his  constitutional right, under the Fifth Amendment, to avoid self-incrimination.  </P> <P> Countered Shaw: "That's fine. That's great. He can remain in jail. He can  remain John Doe forever if he wants. His bail is to remain. Aloha."  </P> <P> Actually, that wasn't all.  </P> <P> Before the defendant was led back to jail, held under bail of $100,000, Shaw  offered her own exposition on constitutional privilege.  </P> <P> "You think you have a Fifth Amendment right," Shaw said. "That's great, because  we have a Fifth Amendment right to have bail in this matter. . . . You're going  to be John Doe and Mr. Defendant until we find out who you are. I think we have  a right to know what your true date of birth is, where you were born. If you  don't want to give us that, that's wonderful."  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Connie Johnson also announced during the arraignment that  the defendant, accused of using as many as 10 aliases, is being charged with a  new felony grand theft count. Johnson said the charge was filed after a woman  who read news accounts of the case identified the defendant as the "lawyer" to  whom she paid $3,000 in a divorce case.  </P> <P> Interviews and court records show that the defendant was known to many clients  and lawyers as J. Christopher Kennedy, the name of an attorney who is licensed  by the State Bar of California.  </P> <P> Among the other aliases used by the defendant, according to the records, were:  Jeffery Biddle Smith, Christopher Chamberlain, Philip Santos Centineo and  Christopher Larry Parks. He varied those names by slightly changing spellings  and the middle names, according to the records.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Concerning the signing of the joint declaration on  the normalization of relations between the FRY and Republic of  Croatia, Djordje Bjegovic, prime minister of the republic of  Serbian Krajina, gave Radio Beograd the following statement:    [Begin Bjegovic recording] The joint declaration signed in  Geneva on 19 January this year between Mr. Vladislav Jovanovic  and Mate Granic, foreign ministers of the FRY and the Republic  of Croatia respectively, which envisages mutual recognition and  the normalization of relations, and the opening of  representative offices in Belgrade and Zagreb, does not violate  the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of the republic of  Serbian Krajina.    The Republic of Croatia can sign international agreements  only for the territory it controls and that are not disputed.  The government of the republic of Serbian Krajina sees the  Geneva agreement between Croatia and Yugoslavia in this light.  The CSCE documents do not imply the borders that the Croatian  Government would like to have but those that it does have. The  UN Charter, mentioned in the joint declaration of Yugoslavia and  Croatia, has these regulations in mind, regulations that  administer the peaceful solution to disputes and the right of  nations to self-determination. This implies the will already  expressed at the referendum by the people of the republic of  Serbian Krajina, which is well known, not only once but on two  occasions.    The government of the republic of Serbian Krajina welcomes  the peace processes on the territory of the former Yugoslavia,  and the normalization of relations between the Republic of  Croatia and the FRY, in the belief that it will contribute to  the establishment of peace along the borders between the  republic of Serbian Krajina and the Republic of Croatia. I  believe that this agreement opens vast possibilities of great  interest to all the partners in the region. For example, in the  infrastructure there are great possibilities for the use of the  capacities that have been out of use for four years now. I  believe that thus, in a peaceful way, we can solve these  problems to everyone's advantage. I particularly think that  there are no changes in the relations between the Republic of  Croatia and the republic of Serbian Krajina. That is a problem  that the republic of Serbian Krajina will solve in the best  interests of the country through delegations, the government,  the assembly, and other institutions. I believe that there  should be more of such agreements, since if we are heading for  peace such agreements can only benefit us.</p>

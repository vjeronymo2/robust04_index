			<p>BFN     [Text] The war situation in Cuito is worsening, with the  number of victims increasing every second. So far, 175 people  have already been killed. Today, more than 50 people died and  80 others were wounded. UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] rebels have fired more than 500 shells  at the city of Cuito since dawn today. The few houses that had  been left standing during the nine-month war have been flattened  to the ground. UNITA snipers continue to shoot at everything  that moves on the streets. The last food stocks at World Food  Program warehouses have been distributed to the starving  residents. That means that as of now the situation will be like  during the nine-month war when people starved to death at just  about every corner.    Meanwhile, movements by Jonas Savimbi's troops have been  reported in the outlaying areas of the city of Luena, Moxico  Province, in the past few days. Government forces say UNITA  will not succeed in its plans.    In Lubango, the military situation is not good. UNITA troops  have stepped up their operations in the Southern Military Front  since 2 May, particularly in the Front's northeastern strip.  UNITA raided the capital of Quilengues District. Southern  Military Front commander General Pereira Furtado told our  correspondent that the Angolan Armed Forces have not lost any  positions and the situation is under their control. He said  government forces have not yet gone on the offensive.</p>

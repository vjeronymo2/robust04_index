			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO MEETS RAMONA IN SOFTBALL  </P> <P> Mission Viejo High School's softball team must feel as if it has a fairy  godmother, because just when everything was going wrong, the team was granted  its most desperate wish -- a berth in the Southern Section 3-A playoffs.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo (17-8) has made the most of its at-large berth, upsetting  top-seeded La Mirada on the way to today's semifinal against Ramona (22-7) at  3:15 p.m. at Alicia Park in Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> But things looked bleak three weeks ago. The Diablos struggled through the last  half of South Coast League play and finished fourth at 14-8.  </P> <P> During that stretch, the Diablos lost starting pitcher Erin Fitzgerald (0.58  earned-run average). She was trying to get into her home after school and  banged on the front door just a little too hard.  </P> <P> "That's all it took," Fitzgerald said. "My hand swelled up the size of a  balloon and it was all blue and it had to be casted right away."  </P> <P> Fortunately, the hand was not broken, even though Fitzgerald was lost for the  last half of league play.  </P> <P> Diablo Coach Jeff Cunningham told his team that it had to beat El Toro in the  team's final league game to have a chance for the playoffs.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo lost.  </P> <P> "The seniors went through the emotion of thinking that was their last game,"  Cunningham said. "I had not even looked at the possibility of an at-large  berth."  </P> <P> Mission Viejo's luck was about to change. The Diablos were granted an at-large  berth, and Fitzgerald healed just in time to take the mound for the playoffs.  </P> <P> "Before the draw, I told the girls I didn't know that we would be selected,"  Cunningham said. "I felt we deserved to be because we had been rated in the  (Southern Section) 3-A division up until the last week. We played a very good  preseason, scheduling teams like Marina, Mater Dei, Canyon, Tustin, Foothill.  There were only two teams on our schedule that didn't make the playoffs.  </P> <P> "Our record came against quality teams, so I told the girls we deserved to be  in and if we got in, we could compete with just about any team in the 3-A."  </P> <P> In the playoffs, Mission Viejo has defeated South Torrance, 4-1, La Mirada,  2-1, and Montclair, 2-0.  </P> <P> In the 4-A division:  </P> <P> Kennedy (21-4) vs. Western (25-5) at Arnold Park 3:15 p.m. Kennedy, seeded  fourth and the defending 3-A champion, has defeated Rolling Hills, Millikan and  Sunny Hills in the playoffs. Western has defeated beat Los Amigos, Rubidoux and  top-seeded Hart.  </P></p>

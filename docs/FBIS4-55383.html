			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 12 (CTK) -- Slovak ex-Premier  Vladimir Meciar's "shadow" cabinet strongly criticised a drafted  amendment to the election law at a press conference today. The  amendment will enable Slovak citizens who do not permanently  reside in Slovakia to participate in the elections providing  they vote in Slovakia.    Ex-Justice Minister Katarina Tothova said that the amendment  did not stipulate any registration of these citizens, so  theoretically they could vote in as many constituencies as the  transport system allowed them to get to.    Ex-Finance Minister Julius Toth said that citizens were  allowed to vote several times in various constituencies  providing they had valid federal passports and claimed they had  permanent residence in the Czech Republic. "We are likely to  have more voters in Slovakia than citizens," Toth said.    Tothova said that the electoral law also had holes in that  it  enabled politicians to run on another party's ticket without  their describing themselves as independent candidates or  creating a coalition with the party for which they would run.  Theoretically, this would mean that parliament could be entered  by parties which would otherwise not stand a chance.    The government Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) of Jan  Carnogursky has recently offered to individual politicians from  other right-wing parties to run on a KDH ticket.</p>

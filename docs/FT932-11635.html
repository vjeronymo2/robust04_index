			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Real home cooking - A house conversion with a difference THE CLEANING lady thought of it first. 'If all else fails, Mrs Graham,' she said, early last year, 'you can always open a restaurant in your dining room.' Amanda Graham needed no further urging. Nine months later, Colquhoun's was born at Alton, Hampshire. Necessity was the mother of this culinary creation. Like many others, the Grahams were finding life tough in the recession. His architectural practice was suffering and could no longer afford her secretarial skills. There were three children, aged from 12 to 16, to feed and educate. Their large, double-fronted Victorian house had a dining room that would, they calculated, seat 20. And Amanda was not without experience: early in the 1980s, during the previous recession, she had done a Tante Marie cooking course. Small children and a recovery in her husband's business allowed her to try her skills only on family and friends. They must have been impressed because they were quick to voice encouragement for the Grahams' new project. One snag arose when she sought planning permission for change of use: she was opposed by local authorities worried about parking, but managed eventually to allay their fears. Making alterations to satisfy the fire regulations was the most expensive element of the conversion. By the time it was finished, and including working capital, Colquhoun's had cost Pounds 14,000 to set up. It was financed by a loan from her brother (now repaid), personal savings and a bank overdraft. Publicity was a family affair, too. Daughter Hannah and her friends distributed 4,000 leaflets around Alton and the surrounding villages. The big bay window of Colquhoun's - Amanda's maiden name - provides plenty of natural light and the room has been decorated in white and blue. The only evidence of its former use is two sets of family photographs on either side of the chimney breast above the fireplace. From the start, Amanda realised that, because she was the only chef, the opening hours must be tailored to her physical capabilities and culinary strengths. So, despite having a rota of four waitresses and an unpaid, supportive husband to help with the washing-up, the restaurant opens only four nights a week: Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Her working day lasts from 9.30 am to 1.30 am and she changes her set menu every Friday for the following week. These menus are readings from culinary heroines: Elizabeth David, Jane Grigson, Claudia Roden and Josceline Dimbleby. But they are cooked with such care and thought that her mentors certainly would approve. There is a choice at the first course: terrine of pigeons, salmon pate with fennel or a cream of potato and onion soup, for example, followed by a set main course. This usually is a casserole: chicken Provencale, beef braised in red wine with black olives, or a Rhone ferryman's stew. Then salad, English cheeses and a choice of three homely desserts (which has included a bread and butter pudding described by one elderly diner as the best since prep school). For this, she charges Pounds 16.50 a person, which includes a complimentary aperitif: Dunkerton's perry or Rock's elderflower wine. The restaurant is unlicensed and makes no corkage charge but her greatest ally in Alton has been Oddbins, the liquor merchant, which displays her new menu every Friday and suggests wines to complement her main courses. There is another bonus for customers: with a fixed-price menu and their own wines, they know almost precisely what an evening at Colquhoun's is going to cost. The quality of the cooking and the novelty of the restaurant brought full houses until Christmas. Since then, there has been a slowdown, particularly mid-week, but Amanda hopes for better business after Easter. There have been unforeseen problems, of course. The restaurant's size means it is too small to buy from wholesalers: thus, it must get its raw materials from the supermarket, the local butcher, the cash and carry or the farm shop nearby. And although she will cook happily for vegetarians, fish as a main course is difficult because there is no local fishmonger. Inconsistency of demand is the main drawback to Colquhoun's showing a profit so far. But there does look to be the makings of a flourishing business and, for Amanda Graham, a satisfying new career. Colquhoun's, 58 Anstey Road, Alton, Hampshire GU34 2RF. Tel: 0420-544774.</p>

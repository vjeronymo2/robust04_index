			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling Yesterday's German money supply figures show that monetary growth is slowing, but only at a snail's pace. At the margin, that may lessen the risk of a further rise in German interest rates. Further signs this week of weakening demand in some sectors of the real economy may also give small comfort to Germany's beleaguered ERM partners. But it is clear that the monetary trend is much too strong for the Bundesbank's taste. Certainly the market is in no mood to respond to any crumbs of comfort from Frankfurt, and sterling finished the day at its lowest level against the D-Mark since the pound entered the ERM. At present, though, the real fear in traders' minds is the French referendum on Maastricht. Opinion polls which increasingly show that a French 'no' vote is a real possibility increases the strain on weak ERM members; if the monetary union project finally unravels, the markets may lose faith altogether in current ERM parities. If the French say 'non', and mortgage rates rise, Mr Lamont can look forward to a lively reception at the Conservative conference.</p>

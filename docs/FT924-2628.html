			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Lonrho - Rowland's Exit: The quiet man with clear ideas of what he has to do DO NOT confuse Mr Dieter Bock for one of 'our publicity seeking entrepreneurs in the UK' said one of the advisers to the German financier who is buying a big stake in Lonrho. According to those close to him, Mr Bock has deliberately decided to keep a low profile until after Lonrho's rights issue is completed. 'He has very clear ideas on what he might do but is keeping his powder dry. He likes to remain quiet until he is sure his plans can work,' the adviser added. There are, however, two main areas in which Mr Bock and his advisers have already shed some light. When he signed the deal with Lonrho on Wednesday he made it clear that he believed Lonrho's assets were worth considerably more than the group's market capitalisation of about Pounds 490m. In particular, it is understood that he feels he can realise greater value for the hotels and property interests. A German industrialist who has worked with Mr Bock on a transaction in Germany said: 'Mr Bock is convinced that he knows how to realise the true value of the UK-based Metropole hotels and North American-based Princess Hotels.' The Metropole Hotels have been the subject of controversy since the government-controlled Libyan Arab Finance Company took a one third stake for Pounds 177.5m earlier this year. When asked about the Libyan stake on Wedndesday evening, Mr Bock said: 'Who knows what will happen to their shareholding. All things can change. The company has suffered enough in respect of that stake.' It is also clear that Mr Bock is only expected to take up a directorship at Lonrho if the board agrees that he should become joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland. Even before Mr Bock's arrival, the old guard surrounding Mr Rowland has begun to leave. Mr Roger Badger, a director, has just resigned and others may follow. 'There may have to be an infusion of new management under Mr Bock since the current generation are getting close to retirement age,' the adviser said.</p>

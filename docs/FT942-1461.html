			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Latin America: chance to break the cycle of sorrow - Stephen Fidler on prospects after action on budget deficits, protectionism and the role of government The World Bank's chief Latin American economist, Mr Sebastian Edwards, likens the region's economic history to Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude. In the novel events follow irregular and magical cycles of sorrow and frustration. He now sees rays of hope that this melancholy sequence may be broken by the economic measures that governments in the region have undertaken - to varying degrees - over the last five years. These measures have brought budget deficits under control, ended years of protectionism and sharply reduced the role of government, thereby vastly enlarging the part played by the market. On the face of it, they have been mostly successful. Inflation has fallen dramatically in the 1990s, except in Brazil, and the region as a whole has enjoyed per capita growth, though modest, for the first time in more than a decade. The reforms have had other, often underestimated, effects. Many companies are looking for the first time to markets beyond their own borders, usually within the region. Even if Latin American governments stall in their efforts to achieve formal economic integration - another feature of the 1990s - a de facto integration is under way at the corporate level. Companies are also undergoing profound restructurings to compete in an international environment. Some are making important gains in productivity, as management and workforces realise that new working practices are needed for survival. Yet many see themselves in a vice between high-technology exporters of the industrialised world and the ultra low-wage economies of Asia, in particular China. Imports flood into the shops, and Latin America's trade deficit widens. A study published today by the McKinsey management consultancy finds that in three of four industries studied, Latin American labour productivity was extremely low. 'In steel, productivity averaged 37 per cent of the US level, 31 per cent in the food processing industry, and 29 per cent in the retail banking industry.' Only in telecommunications did productivity begin to approach American levels. But McKinsey also shows that productivity in two of the industries - telecommunications and steel - has increased significantly in recent years, especially in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. Latin America's steel producers can remain internationally competitive because of low labour costs, it concludes. The question is whether these productivity increases will be widespread or rapid enough to build a platform for exports. Without export growth doubts will remain about the foreign exchange generating capacity of some countries which still register very high debt ratios. According to figures from JP Morgan of the US, Argentina's debt-to-export ratio hardly changed between 1982-84 and 1991-93 at over 430 per cent. Brazil's ratio, around 300 per cent, and Venezuela's around 200 per cent, have not improved much either. Last year, the region's Dollars 40bn (Pounds 26bn) plus current account deficit, which includes interest payments on debt, was easily financed. This year, with foreign capital markets more hostile, the economies with the largest deficits look vulnerable. For now, the region's only undisputed comparative advantage remains in raw materials and energy. Most governments are welcoming foreign investment, and many mining and energy companies are getting excited about prospects. While the development value of raw material exploitation has been questioned, it at least offers flows of foreign exchange to allow breathing space for other sectors become productive. Indeed, Latin America's most successful economy, Chile, built the initial phase of its strategy on the exploitation of raw materials. However, Chile pursued an explicit policy of encouraging exports in the 1980s, including a crawling peg devaluation of the Chilean peso. Capital inflows have forced some peso appreciation, but the long-standing disposition to keep the exchange rate competitive has encouraged investment in export sectors. Other countries have either been less successful in stemming exchange rate appreciation, for example Colombia, or have explicitly used the exchange rate as the central plank in fighting inflation - such as Argentina and Mexico. A competitive exchange rate was also, according to a book published by the World Bank last year, an important feature of the economic success of east Asian economies. The east Asian economies 'avoided strategies of macroeconomic stabilisation that stressed the role of the exchange rate in breaking inflationary expectations,' it says. The book, The East Asian Miracle, describes the following as common factors in Asian success: Low inflation and competitive exchange rates Successful building of human capital, in particular universal primary education Creating effective and secure financial systems, which encourage savings Limiting price distortions Disposition to absorb foreign technology Limiting the bias against agriculture Strong institutional mechanisms, including a meritocratic and well-paid bureaucracy. While economists caution that this is not a unique and infallible recipe for success, Latin American countries score only average marks in important areas. In some, the recipe is already impossible to follow. The need to maintain access to markets in the industrialised countries will make it difficult to provide domestic protection for export industries used by Asian economies. Savings rates, while rising, are still well below levels in Asia. Latin America's average, says Ms Barbara Stallings of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, is 19 per cent of GDP, compared with Asia's 29 per cent. This is also at the core of the region's overdependence on foreign capital. The competence of Latin American governments to drive this agenda is also open to question. The UN Human Development Report, published last month, shows many Latin American countries raise as much in tax revenues as their Asian counterparts. However, they have spent it badly, in part because of corruption. According to Mr Juan Llach, Argentina's economic planning secretary: 'The state used to direct 7 per cent of GDP a year to investment, but since it bought everything at twice market prices, this was only equivalent to 3 1/2 per cent.' In 1990, the Venezuelan government spent 4.1 per cent of its gross domestic product on education, more than Singapore's 3.4 per cent, but the quality of spending was atrocious. According to one study, 43 per cent of the education budget went into administration and planning, and 37 per cent to further education, leaving only 16 per cent for basic and 2.9 per cent for secondary education. 'Education appears to be the single most important determinant of inequality at any given time,' says Mr Edwards at the World Bank. Mr Alejandro Foxley, Chile's former finance minister, reckons that the crucial difference between Asia and Latin America is wealth inequality. In Asia, the richest fifth has between 5 and 10 times more wealth than the bottom fifth; in Chile the ratio is 12, in Argentina 16 and Mexico 27. These divisions have weakened social consensus in Latin America. And, unlike many parts of Asia (and indeed Pinochet's Chile), Latin Americans have a choice when they elect their governments. Already -in Venezuela, Costa Rica and Colombia - voters have returned governments offering a softening of market-oriented reforms. Elections are due in the region's three largest economies - Brazil, Mexico and Argentina - in the coming 12 months. Mr Foxley asks whether the new economic order is politically sustainable, particularly if Latin Americans cannot be persuaded that the benefits of reform are being equitably divided. If market reforms are, or are seen as, widening the already-broad divide between rich and poor, then electorates will become intolerant of them. If this happens, the threat of populism - which offers only a return to Marquez's baleful cycle - may not be far away. By reducing their interference in the economy, Latin American governments have provided the basis for escape from that cycle. Paradoxically though, the final escape looks like it will only be achieved through government action: in education, in improving the quality of government spending and in making sure the benefits of growth accrue to more than a narrow proportion of the population.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 14 (AFP) -- Serb troops surrounded  French UN peacekeepers guarding an arms collection site Thursday  [14 April] and threatened them in an attempt to reclaim heavy  weapons, a UN spokesman said.    Serb soldiers and a tank confronted 30 French troops  guarding  weapons at Krivoglavci, northwest of Sarajevo, and demanded the  weapons, said Eric Chaperon, a spokesman for the UN Protection  Force.    The weapons were placed under UN control following a  February  9 accord between Bosnian Serbs and Moslems on a ceasefire and  withdrawal of heavy weapons within a radius of 20 kilometres (12  miles) from the capital Sarajevo.    The spokesman could not describe the nature of Serb threats  but said the situation was tense.    A high-ranking UNPROFOR official telephoned the Bosnian Serb  stronghold of Pale after the encirclement at 2:OO p.m. (1200  GMT), and the Serb tank withdrew. Serb troops continued to  surround the weapons site, the spokesman said.    Serb troops tried to seize heavy weapons from the  Krivoglavci  site on Tuesday but withdrew after receiving orders from their  command post of Lukavica, contacted by UNPROFOR.    Following Sunday and Monday's NATO air strikes on Serb  positions around the eastern Bosnia Moslem enclave of Gorazde,  Serb troops have also placed mines around three weapons  collection sites, blocking UN personnel guarding the sites, an  UNPROFOR spokesman said Wednesday.</p>

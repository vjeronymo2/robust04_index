			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Maxwell receivers to sell Mirror Group HQ TEN BUILDINGS in London's Holborn, including the Mirror Group headquarters and Maxwell House, have been put up for sale by Grant Thornton, the receivers to Robert Maxwell Estates, Vanessa Houlder writes. The buildings, which cover nearly three acres bounded by Fetter Lane and New Fetter Lane, were valued last year at Pounds 120m, although the value has fallen sharply since then. Robert Maxwell Estates had obtained planning permission to redevelop the site with 500,000 sq ft of offices and 250,000 sq ft of retail property. Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, property consultants, said there was interest in the site as a whole, although the collapse in the property market made the redevelopment unviable. MGN sale, Page 12</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Arts: Why the gods booed the Gods - A look at the virulent display of disapproval that greeted Covent Garden's new Ring The rowdy reception given to the Royal Opera's surreal new production of Wagner's Rheingold at Covent Garden on Thursday marked a novelty in the history of booing in London. It was unusually virulent, wave on wave of baying anger billowing across the auditorium from the highest reaches, aimed mainly at director Richard Jones and designer Nigel Lowery. It was also one of those rare demonstrations that unite all classes, price levels and degrees of operatic expertise. Disapproval more usually observes social demarcation lines. A Covent Garden Wagner production of Der fliegende Hollander found at least one tiara-wearing dowager in the stalls shouting 'Rubbish],' while the gods applauded an innovative concept. Conversely, even an acknowledged disaster like the Royal Opera's Huguenots two seasons ago had its supporters in the stalls even as the first night gallery bellowed its contempt. At the new Rheingold, the booing from the upper ranks blended with exclamations of 'puerile' from the more genteel stalls like a Gilbert and Sullivan double chorus. Until fairly recently it was surprising to hear any booing in a British theatre. John Osborne's works were occasionally the target for audience hostility, but booing has caught on more readily in the opera house than in the theatre. This may be to do with the heightened emotional situations of opera, or the heightened prices a disgruntled punter may have paid; or perhaps imitation of sinister continental practices. Italy has its time-honoured claques who demand money from artists in return for cordiality. Richard Bonynge allegedly called the Scala claque's bluff before his wife Joan Sutherland's debut - and she survived. Paris was until recently notorious for the arbitrary way in which the Opera claque would decide whom to boo that night, irrespective of how the artist might perform. No sordid considerations of money affected the French claquer. After the soprano Regine Crespin rose from her seat in the audience to defend a colleague and shout back at the hecklers, she was subjected to an ugly campaign of hate mail, death threats and abusive phone calls. In the 1950s, after a Vienna State Opera Tannhauser, the tenor was chased through the streets until he lay vomiting with exhaustion and terror on the pavement, watched by devotees of the lyric art. The 1950s saw heated correspondence in the British press on whether to boo or not, a sign perhaps that there are no absolutes in criticism and one man's deconstructivist illumination is another man's pretentious tosh. More recently, English National Opera has blazed the trail for respectable booing with a series of productions that polarised opinion, even erupting into foyer fisticuffs with the film noir-cum-Dali production of Verdi's Masked Ball. In the opera house at least, booing is now an established fact of first night life. But disapproval tends to be reserved for production teams; for outrageous ideas rather than inadequate performers. Don't shoot the singer, he's doing his best, seems to be the philosophy in Britain. But the producer is fair game. David Murray reviews Das Rheingold and Die Walkurie in Monday's paper</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Social Europe The white paper on European social policy marks an important watershed in the complex, and often rancorous, debate about the European social dimension. Five years after the launch of the social charter and 18 months after the arrival of the single market, the European Commission is at last signalling a highly desirable period of consolidation. The white paper will not convince the Euro-sceptics in the UK government of the case for Europe-wide minimum standards. And some rather complacent rhetoric about the superiority of the European model will, no doubt, cause them great irritation. But that is not the point. The European social dimension will not - and should not - disappear. But it badly needs more restraint and more rigour. It is hard for a document written by committee to provide such rigour, and this document has its fair share of confusion. Nonetheless, the underlying agenda of the white paper is a welcome departure from the bombast of the past few years. It places a welcome emphasis on subsidiarity. It openly acknowledges the dispute over labour market regulation, and stresses taking stock rather than plunging on with more legislation. When it does call for action it is generally in sensible areas. It wants far more work done to ensure that the directives which have been passed are actually implemented. The UK can be proud of its record here. It also, like the UK government, wants to make sure that the rules governing labour mobility work better and, indeed, wants to extend them to cover things such as occupational pensions. This more cautious agenda is partly a reflection of the fact that there is now a substantial body of legislation in place, mainly in the relatively uncontroversial areas of mobility, health and safety, and equality between men and women. It also reflects the fact that several member states, notably Germany, do not want to allow a big regulatory gap to open up between the UK  -with its Maastricht treaty 'opt-out' from some legislation - and the other 11 states. This must be regarded, at least by the UK government, as a success for the opt-out policy. It is true that the white paper does talk about possible future fields for legislation. The mention of individual dismissals may well cause particular anxiety to employers. But overall there is scarcely a single hard commitment to new legislation in this document. The new image for Directorate-General Five, the social affairs directorate, appears to be that of a think-tank rather than of Europe's labour ministry. Indeed, the white paper explicitly talks about the Commission acting as a clearing house for good ideas from different countries or as a broker, able to 'pick and mix' best practice from around the EU. Among other things, it might ask itself whether all aspects of past regulation are sacrosanct.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Corlita Ollivierre] </F>   [Text] Kingstown, St. Vincent, 15 Jan, CANA -- Minister in  the St. Vincent prime minister's office, Burton Williams, on  Saturday announced he had tendered his resignation. Williams  told the Caribbean News Agency he needed more time to take care  of the organisation and development of his constituency, South  Windward. The resignation was effective from Saturday, he said.    Williams was health minister until June last year when he  was  transferred to the prime minister's office after a crisis in the  health sector.    He said he intends to contest the next general election,  constitutionally due by the end of August. But it was unclear  whether he would be a candidate for the ruling New Democratic  Party. Williams, reported to be in the late 30's, went into  politics in 1984. At the time, he was operating a taxi service.    On Friday, in a paid announcement on national radio,  Williams  stated his intention to be a candidate for the South Windward  constituency which he represents in parliament. This followed  months of speculation that Williams was among three persons who  would be axed from the slate of candidates of the New Democratic  Party for the next general election.    Williams, in the announcement directed to his constituents,  termed the reports a malicious rumour "by persons intending to  create division and confusion..." He continued: "I have no  intention to, and will never ... Be ungrateful nor disrespectful  to you all. I want you to understand clearly that I will be  contesting the next general election on your behalf."    The three functioning parties here have not announced their  candidates for general election, but the campaign unofficially  kicks off on the electronic media this week with the beginning  of weekly television appearances by the NDP.    The main opposition St. Vincent Labour Party has been having  regular weekly broadcasts. Dr. Ralph Gonsalves' Movement for  National Unity returned to the television screen Wednesday after  a few weeks' break.</p>

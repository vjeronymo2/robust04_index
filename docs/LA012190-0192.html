			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET ENCLAVE DECLARES INDEPENDENCE  </P> <P> The ruling council of the Azerbaijani enclave of Nakhichevan declared  independence Saturday from the Soviet Union and called for international  protection, according to an Iranian news agency report later confirmed by  officials in Moscow.  </P> <P> Iran's IRNA news agency, monitored in Cyprus, said the declaration of the  Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic called on Turkey, Iran and the United Nations  to secure its territorial integrity. The report quoted the statement as  demanding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the 2,200-square-mile enclave,  which bears the same name as its capital city.  </P> <P> According to the IRNA report, a Nakhichevan television station broadcast the  announcement shortly after midnight. It was delivered by Sakina Ali-Ava,  identified as head of the region's Presidium.  </P> <P> The IRNA report quoted her as declaring that the announcement of independence  was taken in accordance with the Soviet constitution and that it was proclaimed  "due to the lack of defense for the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and  Nakhichevan and the creation of a state of terror following the aggressions of  Armenians."  </P> <P> The announcement, which followed a broadcast of martial music, appealed for  outside powers to "prevent a massacre of the people" in the capital city, the  scene of clashes between Soviet Azerbaijanis and the Armenian minority early  this month.  </P> <P> In Moscow, First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander A. Bessmertnykh told  reporters that the announcement declared secession from both the Azerbaijan  republic and the Soviet Union. He argued that the decision violated the  constitution, which, he said, requires an autonomous enclave to receive  approval of the superior republic to secede.  </P> <P> Nakhichevan is a small enclave of 250,000 people, mainly Muslims. Located about  220 miles southwest of Baku and bordering Iran, Turkey and the Soviet republic  of Armenia, it has been under Azerbaijan's jurisdiction since 1924.  </P> <P> It also has been a hot spot of the current turmoil. Friday's editions of the  Soviet daily Izvestia reported that Iranian Azerbaijanis, who share the same  language and Shiite Muslim faith as their Soviet compatriots, had supplied  weapons to Azerbaijanis north of the border. Moscow reports quoted Izvestia as  saying thousands of Azerbaijanis had been crossing the border in both  directions in recent days.  </P> <P> More than 5 million Azerbaijanis live in Iran, and 6.8 million live in Soviet  Azerbaijan.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, angry Nakhichevan residents, seeking closer ties with Iran,  destroyed about 120 miles of frontier fortifications. And on Friday, according  to IRNA, large numbers of Soviet Muslims had crossed the border in the  Nakhichevan area to attend Muslim prayer services in Iran and staged a  demonstration in support of the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Shiite spiritual  leader.  </P> <P> The Iranian government took a cautious stance as the disturbances flared  earlier this month along its northern border west of the Caspian Sea. "Iran on  her part," said Mahmoud Vaezi, a deputy foreign minister, "has no penchant for  taking advantage of the U.S.S.R.'s domestic problems and the pressures mounting  on Moscow by ethnic crises, especially in the southern republics. Iran is no  political opportunist, neither is it after a change in the present border lines  between the two countries."  </P> <P> This week, however, Khamenei raised the Islamic issue, declaring that Muslim  Azerbaijanis were expressing sectarian values after long decades of suppression  of religion under the Soviet system. "These sentiments are Islamic and have  their attractions for 1 billion Muslims worldwide," he said.  </P> <P> And on Saturday, IRNA published a statement by the Foreign Ministry calling on  Moscow to settle the crisis in Azerbaijan by peaceful means and "stop its  violence against the people."  </P> <P> The IRNA report, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in London, quoted  the Tehran statement as saying:  </P> <P> "Iran's Foreign Ministry expresses deep regret . . . and seriously wants the  Soviet government to halt violent encounters with the people of Azerbaijan and  resolve the issue by employing peaceful means."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Masha Hamilton, in Moscow, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

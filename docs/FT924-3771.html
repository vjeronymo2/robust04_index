			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / International Company News: Rhone Poulenc share sale postponed THE French government yesterday postponed its plans to sell a substantial minority stake in Rhone-Poulenc, France's flagship chemicals group, because of the erratic state of the stock market. The postponment of the Rhone-Poulenc issue is a setback for France's partial privatisation programme which is scheduled to include similar sales of minority stakes in a number of state-controlled companies in both the financial and industrial sectors. The government had planned to float at least 6m shares in Rhone-Poulenc, roughly 10.6 per cent of its equity, by the end of next month. However, it has long stressed that it would only proceed with the sale provided that market conditions were correct. The Paris stock market has fluctuated in recent weeks on concern about the threat of a devaluation of the French franc and the implications of France's opposition to the new farm trading deal between the European Community and the US. Yesterday, the CAC 40 Index fell by nearly 1 per cent to 1,781.68 in a bout of profit-taking. The index, which has performed poorly since reaching its 1992 peak in May, rose by 1.83 per cent last week. But Rhone-Poulenc's investment certificates have under-performed the market, falling for the past five successive days. This fall has triggered intense speculation about the prospects for the Rhone-Poulenc sale, which would have been the first in which the government's holding in a state-controlled company would have fallen below 50 per cent. The combination of the flotation and the accompanying enfranchisement of Rhone-Poulenc's non-voting shares would reduce the state's holding from 77.5 per cent to 45 per cent. However, the finance ministry yesterday evening announced that the sale could not proceed in current conditions. This time last year a similar slowdown in the stock market prompted the French government to delay the proposed flotation of a minority stake in Elf Aquitaine, the oil group. The Elf sale eventually went ahead in March, resulting in a successful, and over-subscribed, issue.</p>

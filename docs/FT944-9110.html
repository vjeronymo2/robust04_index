			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Cubans court UN rights watchdog The United Nations' top human rights watchdog began a visit to Cuba yesterday by meeting political dissidents ahead of formal talks with the Cuban government. Mr Jose Ayala Lasso, the Ecuadorean diplomat newly appointed UN high commissioner for human rights, was in Havana at the invitation of the Cuban government, normally sensitive to international criticism of its human rights record. Reacting to Mr Ayala's meeting with the three moderate dissidents, Mr Roberto Robaina, Cuba's foreign minister, said the official was free to speak to whom he wished. 'We want to show the world that, as far as human rights are concerned, Cuba has nothing to hide.' Mr Elizardo Sanchez, one of the dissidents who met Mr Ayala, said they gave him a list of 1,195 persons allegedly being held in Cuban jails for political offences ranging from rebellion to criticising Cuba's one-party communist government and leadership. Mr Robaina said the human rights issue was being manipulated by the US in a politically motivated propaganda campaign against Cuba. US-sponsored resolutions passed by the Geneva-based UN High Commissioner for Human Rights have condemned the widespread jailing of political dissidents and other rights violations on the island. Other human rights organisations have made similar charges. Mr Ayala risks angering his Cuban hosts if he endorses existing accusations against Cuba, but he could be accused of pandering to the government if he fails to probe alleged rights violations. The Cuban government was expected to press its argument that one of the biggest violations against the rights of the Cuban people was the US economic embargo.</p>

			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Letter: Seven into one just won't go Sir, Professor John Saunders (Letters, December 21/22) presents an argument for Sunday trading, which makes me - one of the few remaining small retailers - seriously consider opening on Sunday. Perhaps Prof Saunders could also advise on how a trader such as myself, with one part-time member of staff, can manage to provide a seven-day service - not to mention make a living out of my business? The very fact that businesses such as mine still survive through this severe recession surely shows that our high streets need the speciality service and goods we provide. It is said that England is a nation of shopkeepers, but the big boys have advantages which this government should ensure are not exploited at our expense.

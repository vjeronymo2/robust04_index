			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPERS USE $100 BOOK FOR ESTATE-OF-THE-ART ADVERTISING;  </P> <P> BEVERLY PARK: SOME POSH HILLTOP ESTATES, MANY OF THEM NOT YET BUILT, ARE  FEATURED IN A COFFEE-TABLE BOOK ALONG WITH MANY OF THE OLDEST AND MOST ELEGANT  MANSIONS ON THE WESTSIDE.  </P> <P> Developers of the hilltop Beverly Park Estates have published the second  edition of a lush coffee-table book called "The Estates of Beverly Hills,"  complete with an entire chapter that puts their scenic but largely unbuilt  neighborhood on a par with the fanciest homes of the Westside.  </P> <P> "We wanted our future audience . . . to find through reading this book that  there's a new opportunity in town," said Brian Adler, principal developer of  the property high above Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> "This is an opportunity people haven't had since the 1930s -- to get a house on  two level acres . . . with city and canyon views," he said. "It's the feeling  of what an estate is supposed to be."  </P> <P> Carved out of the hillsides north of Beverly Hills in the 1960s by bulldozers  moving 8 million cubic yards of earth, the land was originally intended for a  country club project that was to have been named after entertainer Dean Martin.  </P> <P> That deal fell through, along with several other efforts involving a Teamsters  Union pension fund, but developer Elliot Gottfurcht managed to consolidate 16  lots on part of the property, a ridge overlooking Franklin Canyon, before he  sold out to Adler and his associates last year.  </P> <P> The first edition of "The Estates of Beverly Hills," financed by developer  Gottfurcht, came out in 1984, filled with stories and pictures of the stately  homes of Beverly Hills, Bel-Air and Holmby Hills. Hoping for gilt by  association, Gottfurcht devoted a few of the book's oversized, 100% rag cotton  pages to sketches of the yet-unbuilt mansions of Beverly Park Estates.  </P> <P> The latest edition, published this time by Adler, went on sale last month for  $100 at bookstores and upscale outlets such as Neiman-Marcus. It expands its  coverage of some of the older homes in Beverly Hills and neighboring high-rent  districts. But it also features 14 pages of color photographs showing the  gushing fountains, curling driveways, landscaped vistas and highly decorated  interiors of homes built in the first phase of Beverly Park.  </P> <P> The first 16 lots were limited in size to flat pads of about one acre each, but  the next batch of 64 properties, in a man-made bowl below Mulholland Drive,  will be twice as big -- big enough for almost anybody's dream house, not to  mention tennis court, guest house, pool and lots of lawn.  </P> <P> "This is the most expensive (real estate) brochure ever circulated," said  Jeffrey Hyland, a Beverly Hills real estate broker who wrote the book with  Charles Lockwood, an architecture and travel writer. "And the most important  thing is that no one realizes this is a promotional brochure."  </P> <P> Indeed, the privately printed, 170-page volume stands on its own merits. Hyland  and Lockwood, together with researcher Peter V. Persic and photographers  Randolph Harrison and Baron Wolman, have made a genuine contribution to local  history.  </P> <P> Their text, based on a combing of old newspaper files and the testimony of  longtime residents, complements glowing photo layouts of some of the grandest  chateaux this side of the Loire Valley.  </P> <P> The writers do not hide the pitfalls of living on a grand scale. Some of the  oil barons and movie moguls who built for the centuries ended their lives in  poverty, forced to sell out for as little as $200,000 at a time when lavish  estates were a drag on the market.  </P> <P> But with athletes and entertainers raking in greater earnings every year, the  market for great houses is a lively one today.  </P> <P> The developer has already sold homes in the remote, gated community to the  Lakers' Magic Johnson, entertainer Pia Zadora and her multimillionaire husband,  Meshulam Riklis, and others in the seven-figures-and-up income bracket.  </P> <P> "A couple of them learned about it through 'The Estates of Beverly Hills,' but  mainly it was through word of mouth," said Adler, who has been involved in the  project since 1979. "I've been very low-key about it, but when the most  affluent buyers, the ones for whom a few million dollars either way doesn't  matter, picked us, that's the greatest compliment, because they can be  anywhere."  </P> <P> At a time when buyers of run-down mansions are confronted with rehab costs of  $1 million or more, Hyland said, there should be a lively demand for the  two-acre estates of Beverly Park, where empty lots are going for $3.5 million  to $5 million and completed houses are expected to cost $8 million or more.  </P> <P> "The big thing today is big estates," said Hyland, whose firm of Alvarez,  Hyland &amp; Young is the fourth-largest real estate brokerage in Beverly  Hills.  </P> <P> "It's easier for us to sell a house for $10 million than for $2 million or $3  million, (because) there are more people on the high end than on the low end,  and they'd rather pay you another $1.5 million or more to build a house for  them than do it themselves," Hyland said.  </P> <P> "(The clients) would rather spend the time on their own business, and they  don't want a divorce."  </P> <P> The authors were especially proud of their entree to the Warner and Kirkeby  estates, which are concealed behind gates and greenery and have not been  photographed for public consumption in decades, although the facade of the  Kirkeby house is known to millions as the home of the nouveau riche Clampett  clan in "The Beverly Hillbillies" television series.  </P> <P> Hyland and Lockwood said they were besieged by anxious property owners whose  homes were left out of their chronicle of conspicuous consumption.  </P> <P> "People would call up and say: 'You've got to put me in this time. I've put on  a 10,000-square-foot addition,' " Hyland said.  </P> <P> But the authors spelled out their standards in the foreword: A property must  have at least 1 1/2 acres of flat land to be considered an estate. The only  exceptions in the book are the homes from the first phase of publisher Adler's  development, Beverly Park.  </P> <P> Some famous homes were excluded because much of the surrounding land was  subdivided and sold off over the years. Others with large grounds did not have  enough flat land.  </P> <P> In all the Westside, only 31 properties qualified in Beverly Hills, 22 in  Holmby Hills and 15 in Bel-Air. The book also counts the 64 two-acre lots in  Beverly Park Estates, which have yet to be built on.  </P> <P> "Omission from this book does not imply that a residence is any less attractive  or any less valuable than the properties that are featured," Hyland and  Lockwood wrote.  </P> <P> They also made it clear that homeowners whose dream houses did not make it into  the second edition will have to learn to live with the ignominy. There will not  be a third.  </P></p>

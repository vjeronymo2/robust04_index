			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (4): Governments cling to their autonomy - The European Union is crawling cautiously towards harmonisation People who are sceptical about European tax harmonisation and integration commonly point to the failure of the Ruding Commission to make any real impact on European tax systems in the Single Market. They note that various measures proposed to harmonise corporate income tax in Europe have failed to be enacted. The Transitional VAT Regime which has been in place since January 1, 1993 is criticised for its complexity and other shortcomings. The doctrine of subsidiarity has had a significant impact on tax harmonisation in the post-Maastricht period. Under the direction of Taxation Commissioner Christiane Scrivener, the Commission has changed tack somewhat in relation to its programme. Member state autonomy has been emphasised and a number of direct tax harmonisation measures previously proposed no longer form the main thrust of the Commission's direct tax activities. The Commission is now focusing specifically on cross-border activities. It has issued detailed recommendations on how cross-border or frontier employees are to be taxed in order to avoid arguments about tax discrimination against employees from one member state working in another. Other projects include the harmonisation and simplification of procedures for claims under intra-Community tax treaties relating to repayment of withholding tax and other reductions of taxes. They are also examining the improvement of exchange of information procedures in order to counter cross-border tax evasion. Neither of these are likely to result in high profile legislative amendments, but will undoubtedly contribute to the integration of tax administration and ease of cross-border investment. The European tax system is indeed developing rapidly and has taken a number of significant steps forward. Some of these changes receive relatively little publicity, but nonetheless have an important unifying effect. The Community Customs Code which came into force on January 1, 1994 consolidates and amends European Customs law in its entirety. It has been adopted by way of EU Regulation. As a result, it is automatically binding in all member states and needs no further legislation to make it directly applicable. Although administration and enforcement is left to member states, a single accessible body of rules emphasises the singularity of the Customs Union. The most significant recent step is the introduction of the Transitional VAT Regime on January 1, 1993. It is a hybrid system combining both a 'destination' principle for cross-border commercial transactions and an 'origin' principle broadly for non-commercial transactions. Although the lifting of internal border controls and the doing away of some 60m administrative documents have been hailed as a success, the introductory period has not been easy. A fundamental change in the rules has left tax administrators and payers alike with an enormous task both in understanding the new system and implementing it. Some have claimed that it merely replaces one form of bureaucracy by another. Some of the difficulties raised by the new rules have already been smoothed out. For example, the so-called Simplification Directive aims at minimising the tax burden in so-called 'triangular' transactions where delivery of goods does not follow the same path as legal title. The fundamental issue is that the current rules are intended to be replaced by a 'definitive' VAT system by the beginning of 1997. The definitive system is expected to be based entirely on the origin basis of taxation. Such a system will clearly favour member states which supply goods and services at the expense of those in which the goods and services are consumed. Doubts have therefore been expressed as to whether a 'definitive' system will emerge and what form it will take. The year 1997 also marks one of the target dates for direct tax harmonisation in accordance with the Ruding Committee proposals. Both these deadlines must be seen in the context of wider European integration. While the tax integration is intended to follow political and monetary union, undoubtedly their futures will be tied up with the outcome of that debate. The Commission's controversial carbon/energy tax proposal for a levy of Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent has met with considerable opposition. Nonetheless, the Environment Commissioner, Yannis Paleokrassas, has suggested a shift overall in the tax burden away from taxes on employment such as social security taxes to pollution and resources. He has also suggested a new system of land use and building use and vehicle taxes to improve environmental and fiscal conditions of cities. He has been at pains to suggest that this should not increase the overall tax burden. The Ruding Committee and the Commission have both emphasised the necessity for completing bilateral tax treaties between member states in order to minimise double taxation within the EU. Treaties have been signed between Greece and Luxembourg, and between Portugal and Ireland. Neither of these are yet in force. Portugal still has no treaty with the Netherlands, and Greece has no treaty with Ireland or with Spain. Some of the most important European Union tax developments have occurred outside the overt political arena. The European Court has given judgment on a number of crucial issues affecting the ability of member states to do as they please in tax matters. In the Commerzbank case, the European Court found that the UK rules which allowed only UK residents interest (the 'repayment supplement') on tax overpayments was discriminatory and contrary to European law. A similar line has been taken recently by the Advocate General in the Halliburton case where the Advocate General has issued an opinion condemning Dutch property transfer tax rules which discriminate against cross-border corporate reorganisations as being contrary to the law of the European Union. In each case, disputes have arisen on the validity of the tax laws of member states not in relation to the taxation directives, but in relation to the basic European law as set out in the Treaty of Rome. The European Court has shown no mercy in striking down a miscellany of taxes imposed by member states which are contrary to European law. Recent examples include a Portuguese tax on the sales of domestic and imported paper pulp, Italian annual payments for the registration of companies, and Italian penalties which discriminate more severely in relation to cross-border tax offences than offences relating to domestic transactions. The Court has examined closely the manner in which member states have given effect to VAT law, striking down those rules that are not consistent with VAT Directives.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 9 (AFP)--The Chinese Government on  Thursday accused German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and  Danielle Mitterrand of exploiting dissident Wang Juntao to  promote "political activities" against Beijing.    "Wang Juntao was allowed to go abroad to receive medical  treatment," a foreign ministry spokesman said by phone.    "We are against anyone making use of Wang Juntao in any form  to carry out political activities against the Chinese  government."    Wang, 35, had been sentenced to 13 years in jail for his  role  in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, but was released last month  on medical grounds and put aboard a plane for the United States.    He made a private trip to France to commemorate the fifth  anniversary of the June 4 crackdown in Tiananmen Square, and met  Mitterrand -- the wife of French President Francois Mitterrand  -- who chairs a human rights group known as France-Liberte.    Wang met Kinkel in Bonn on Tuesday before heading back to  the  United States.</p>

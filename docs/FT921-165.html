			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Letter: Transport priorities Sir, Londoners will have been saddened to read of the difficulties of Olympia &amp; York, the company which has brought to Docklands the magnificent Canary Wharf project, but the company's involvement in funding the Jubilee Line should be the least of our worries. Polls carried out by Mori have shown that the top priority of eight out of 10 Londoners is making improvements to the existing services such as new rolling stock, new signalling and better stations on lines, such as the Central and Northern line stations. As one would expect, the customers have got it right. In Westminster and the City of London we have 170m square feet of offices and a workforce of around 1m people. What is more, we have most of the capital's tourist attractions and half the hotel bed spaces. Let us concentrate on getting a modern, reliable underground system for today's workers, residents and visitors. I note that John Prescott, the shadow transport secretary, thinks that this delay in O &amp; Y's Pounds 40m contribution to the Pounds 1.3bn Jubilee Line project shows that 'determining transport priorities on the basis of development case was folly'. It was not. The slower than expected take-up of the 5m square feet of Canary Wharf offices means the Jubilee Line will not be needed so soon. Bringing in the private sector has meant the government programme is forced to take into account market needs. So much the better, say I. London Transport's lethargic response to the problems of today is what should concern us, rather than any delay in Olympia &amp; York's contribution to the Jubilee Line project. Railways to Docklands can wait while existing problems in central London are sorted out. David Weeks, leader of the council, City of Westminster, 64 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6QP</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / 'I am just a number . . .': Andrew Adonis asks if a UK identity system is creeping in They seek him here, they seek him there, those Frenchmen seek him everywhere. Is he in Heaven, is he in Hell? That damned elusive Pimpernel. The Scarlet Pimpernel had fled to the UK, of course, where there are no national identity cards to uncloak him. But for how much longer will his hideaway be safe? Mr Eric Howe, data protection registrar, believes the UK is slipping towards a national identity regime. This is the result, he says, not of a formal policy but of the growing use of identification numbers and cards for purposes other than those originally intended, without any public debate as to the merits of such a course. The most immediate and serious threat he sees is the plan to put photographs on driving licences issued from 1996. If that happens, Mr Howe argues driving licences might become a general means of identification. He cites California, where the state government has started issuing 'non-driver driving licences' for that purpose. Mr Howe highlights another significant trend: the growing use of National Insurance numbers for non-insurance purposes. NI numbers were originally used for keeping track of insurance contributions and benefits. Now they are also used for income tax and, more recently, for personal equity plans and tax-exempt savings accounts. Further, 'child reference numbers' are now issued for the payment of child benefit. The number, conferred at birth, becomes the individual's NI number at the age of 16. It is easy to see NI numbers becoming, in effect, national identity numbers. At the same time, the social security department is considering using 'swipe' cards - similar to bank cash-machine cards - to replace benefits payments books. There is also the possibility of National Health Service numbers spreading beyond the NHS. These trends alarm Mr Howe, who is about to retire after 10 years as data protection watchdog. He says the dangers are 'too fundamental for the UK to allow itself simply to slip into having a de facto national identification system without the necessary restrictions and safeguards'. Should we be concerned at the rise by stealth of national identity cards and numbers? The case against identity cards has traditionally focused on their implications for the citizen's relations with the police. Identity cards used during the second world war were discontinued in the early 1950s, after Lord Chief Justice Goddard ruled that obliging citizens to produce cards 'tends to make people resentful of the acts of the police and inclines them to obstruct the police instead of to assist them'. Increasingly, however, concern is moving to the implication of national identity numbers - not cards - for the way personal information on individuals is treated. Mr Howe is already in dispute with the financial services industry about the transfer of personal financial details between credit organisations without the consent of the individual concerned. The industry argues that such disclosure is essential to prevent fraud; Mr Howe believes that in most cases individuals should have control over access. Civil liberties groups fear that access to, for instance, social security records could spread in a similar way through a national identity system. The experience of Sweden is a salutary warning. 'Personal identity numbers' (PINs), which Sweden has had since 1947, are now used in virtually all public transactions, from health and tax to banking and nursery waiting lists. 'You need them for everything, and to change your number you need a sex change,' says Ms Anitha Bondestam, director of Sweden's data inspection board, a state regulator. Ms Bondestam believes that assigning all-purpose numbers to individuals poses a 'serious threat' to civil liberties. She cites a 23-year-old woman who recently had a care order imposed on her two-year-old son on the grounds that she was a drug abuser. After much anguish, it turned out that a drug abuser had consistently been using her number in dealings with the police and hospitals - 'and nobody challenged it because the number was correct'. Ms Bondestam says: 'The use of these numbers has been taken too far, without us quite understanding how it all came about.' She argues that numbers are rapidly taking the place of face-to-face contact. 'The bank, the insurance company and the national authorities don't want to have contact with their customers because, through the numbers, automation is much less trouble. So now if we walk into a bank, we feel like intruders.' Sweden is trying to row back. Recent legislation will restrict the use of identity numbers, notably by the financial services industry, and plans are under way for a privacy law. That may go some way to allaying the concerns, but not necessarily slow the spread of information. After all, the transfer of data, electronically or otherwise, does not require cards or PINs. Plain old names and addresses are quite good enough.</p>

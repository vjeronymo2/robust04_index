			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDIA BIAS ON ABORTION ISSUE  </P> <P> Thank you for the series. Since pro-life sentiment is as intense and widespread  in this country as pro-choice sentiment is, how does it happen that journalists  in big-city news organizations "don't seem to have many friends or colleagues  who oppose abortion," so that they aren't even aware of the magnitude of  pro-life rallies like the one in April?  </P> <P> What kind of hiring and promotion practices are producing whole staffs with the  same blind spot? What other issues are being screened out in the same way,  while the media spotlights converge momentarily on broccoli?  </P> <P> FAYE JEANIS  </P> <P> San Jose  </P></p>

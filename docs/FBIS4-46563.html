			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel of State Security Viktor </F> Nikolayevich Bobrov, chief, Department of Military  Counterintelligence, by I. Barykin; place and date of interview  not given: "It's Painful To See How They're Selling the  Motherland'"]    [Text] Could I ever have imagined five or so years  ago that I would be able to interview the counterintelligence  chief so easily? All the more so because he has no patience with  the mass media which, in his opinion, are responsible in many  ways for some of the things that are happening in the country  now? But V. N. Bobrov, colonel of state security, chief of the  Department of Military Counterintelligence of the RF Federal  Counterintelligence Service for the 8th Guards Army Corps, does  have respect for our firm--VOLGOGRADSKAYA PRAVDA. Because in his  words it continues to express the views of many, including the  unfortunate, layers of, and it tries to speak the truth, no  matter how bitter it may be.    At the appointed hour I drove up to the famous "house  with antennas" on Chekisty Square. Vladimir Nikolayevich  received me in his modestly furnished office. The furnishings  were limited to a huge map of Europe covering an entire wall  showing the locations of the intelligence centers of the NATO  bloc, portraits of F. E. Dzerzhinskiy and Yu. V. Andropov  (despite the changes, the occupant of this office remains  faithful once and forever to assimilated principles), and a pile  of telephones on a little table, ready for instantaneous  communication with the most remote points in the country and  with the chief of the RF Federal Counterintelligence  Service.    No matter how I tried to steer it in the needed channel, our  conversation, which went on for over an hour, wouldn't stay  within its banks. Viktor Nikolayevich guided the interview away  from slippery issues with a smile. Anyway, I soon became used to  these "secrets of the Madrid court," and accepted the rules of  the game.    My first question touched upon a topic that was most painful  to my partner in conversation:    [Barykin] Would I be right in saying that these are the  worst  times for counterintelligence, now that the economy has been  devastated and the army is disintegrating, now that there are  huge holes in the borders, and now that people are trying to  toss 70 years of history into the trash can?    [Bobrov] "That's putting it mildly," my partner in  conversation bitterly asserted. "Many military secrets have been  sold for 30 pieces of silver (seven and a half dollars, if we  convert this at today's rate), footholds have been lost in  Europe, Africa, Latin America and the Near East, and our troops  are scurrying out of Eastern Europe and the Baltics. Giving away  state secrets has become so commonplace. Things can't get any  worse," my partner in conversation sighed. "But no matter how  they've tried to bring my department down," he continued, "it  has managed to keep its secrets. There were enough clear minds  around here that we managed to encrypt the archives and  information on our agents long before the August coup. For  example the BND (West German intelligence) is still trying to  figure out the GDR's undercover operation. I can tell you that  their efforts are useless."    [Barykin] What are the strategy and tactics of  counterintelligence today?    [Bobrov] "Having managed to preserve its operation, our  department is doing what it is supposed to be doing--protecting  state and military secrets, providing counterintelligence  support to the Armed Forces, determining their combat  capability, and fighting terrorists and saboteurs, organized  crime and the drug trade (unfortunately it has made its way into  the army as well)."    [Barykin] To the extent possible, can you offer any details  about the activity of your department?    [Bobrov] "Now that servicemen are being withdrawn hastily  from the Western and Northwestern groups of forces, foreign  intelligence is openly recruiting our soldiers and officers. We  are trying to stop this work. Recall the notorious `Gorchakov  case.' The ex-civil aviation pilot was recruited by the BND, he  stayed behind in the FRG, and there he organized a local ring,  trapping in his nets those whose eyes caught fire from the sight  of dollars and Deutsche marks. Our fellow-countryman from  Volgograd managed to fall in with them. Gorchakov tasked him to  collect secret information from a certain unit in the Western  Group of Forces. The sorry spy was caught red-handed and was  shuttled over to Moscow, where he faced a military court. My  associates and I had the occasion to question him in Lefortovo.    "Unfortunately such recruitment of our soldiers and officers  by Western special services is continuing, and it is proceeding  more intensively. Not only our potential enemies--the special  services of the USA, France and Germany--but even our former  friends are showing keen interest in the new huge force grouping  building up in the Northern Caucasus. Intelligence services of  Ukraine, Moldova and the Baltic and Transcaucasian states are  pricking up their ears, even though we had reached agreement  with them not to engage in such activity. They are all  interested in learning the scale of deployment of the new force  grouping, its mobilization plans, its armament, combat  readiness, and the morale of our soldiers. Our `friends' are  also interested in the latest developments of our defense  research institutes and plants. This is why military delegations  from the NATO countries have started visiting Volgograd so much  more frequently. All military attaches that visit us are in fact  career scouts, and they have but one purpose--gathering secret  information, and filling in the details that their associates in  espionage failed to root out.    "They come here like it's their home, behave impertinently,  and capitalize on the possibilities offered by the conventional  arms limitation treaty for their own ends. We naturally keep our  eyes on all of them. Our operational possibilities allow us to  do so. When it becomes necessary, we toss them some `bait,' lead  them on a false trail, and establish who their contacts are.    "As long as you've asked for the details," V. N. Bobrov  said,  "our department's sphere of activity includes the lower reaches  of the Volga, and naturally, Kapustin Yar, which is also within  the zone of interest of `friendly' special services. That's how  far things have gone! A military attache is, after all, a  military scout, he can fly into our city incognito, without any  kind of permission, settle down with some family, and go about  getting answers to questions he's interested in.    "We also monitor the activities of foreign specialists  employed in construction of military posts. There are no  restrictions, you see, on their movements about the territory of  another state. That's how it came about that we detained Turks,  even in Kapustin Yar, under the guise of vocational-technical  school students, with forged diplomas and passports. What were  they doing in Kapustin Yar?    "Korean specialists carry dollars from English banks in  their  suitcases in circumvention of tax laws."    [Barykin] "One of the tasks assigned to military  counterintelligence, as you yourself have said, is to fight  organized crime in the army. Has all of this really assumed such  a scale?" was may next question to Bobrov.    [Bobrov] "Unfortunately, all of the negative processes that  have affected the society are affecting those who work behind  the high fences of the military. The army is disintegrating,  discipline and the morale of servicemen are falling, and as a  result, incidents occur--`dedovshchina' going as far as murder,  shady bank transactions, and major misappropriations of weapons  and explosives from military storage dumps.    "Recently we fended off an attack on a certain military  depot  near Kotluban by persons of Dagestani nationality. They planned  to kill the sentries and take large lots of weapons out of the  oblast. To the honor of our division, in the 4 year's that I've  been in Volgograd only one assault rifle has gone missing. We  squelched an attempt to obtain several million rubles from a  bank on the basis of a forged letter of advice."    [Barykin] As I understand from this conversation, military  counterintelligence has its "eyes and ears" everywhere. By that  I mean undercover agents.    [Bobrov] "As they say in cases such as this, we don't get  paid to do nothing: Where necessary, we use special equipment  and undercover assistance. These people are patriots who offer  to help for something other than the sake of money. We simply  can't offer them any incentives at market prices. All  intelligence services of the world have their informants, and  for some reason it's only in our country that the impression  certain strata of the population sometimes hold of them is not  as it should be. These people are a priceless treasure to us,  and they help us a very great deal. Who do you think wrote the  Old Testament? A scout! This was his first message to the Divine  Center. Covert operatives--angels--helped him to gather the  data. And the first counterespionage agent did everything he  could to keep the message from the Center's scout from falling  into the wrong hands."    During our interview the telephone rang incessantly, and  Viktor Nikolayevich's short answers--"I'm busy"--once again  emphasized that this department has respect for our newspaper  and its representatives. Nonetheless, in order not to abuse the  counterintelligence agent's time, I cut short my list of  questions.    [Barykin] "Viktor Nikolayevich," I urged my partner in  conversation to be open, "tell me honestly, are you sorry that  you went into counterintelligence?"    [Bobrov] "So far, no," the occupant of the office smiled.  "Still, all of these years--and I've worked in this department  for almost a quarter of a century--I've been unable to calmly  accept those who are selling the country and its secrets. It's  painful to see, believe me, and painful to hear that the KGB,  and now the FSK, is looked at as some kind of monster. It angers  me to hear that. The country was strong in its secrets, which  our people have watched over at the cost of their lives. They  were the first to fall under the knife of the purges of 1932,  and NKVD divisions defended Stalingrad down to the last warrior.  And it's not the fault of the rank and file of the KGB that it  was headed by scum like Beria. There are many people like that  in the MVD, and if you're looking for a true monster, consider  what the MVD has transformed into.    "I started my military career in the missile forces," the  counterspy continued his narration when I asked him for a sketch  of his biography. "I graduated from the appropriate schools. No,  not the kind you're thinking of--missile schools. The KGB school  and academy came some time later. Once I was summoned by KGB  chief Kryuchkov: You're going to Afghanistan for a week, he told  me. But as it turned out, I stayed half a year there. I worked  on a special assignment in this country from the first day of  commitment of our troops. After Afghanistan I worked wherever  they sent me. In 1990 I moved with my family to Volgograd."    Three years ago Viktor Nikolayevich became a grandfather.  His  daughter works in the tax inspectorate, his son-in-law is a  military pilot, and his wife is a well known radio journalist.    "No matter how difficult it may be for the motherland today,  I believe that some sort of stability will nonetheless set in,"  the counterintelligence chief concluded the interview. "And I'll  be happy if our department could make the contribution within  its means to this effort. And one other thing. Please extend my  deep regards to all war veterans in this holiday period. For  saving the world from the abhorrent yoke of fascism. And this  rain that is now falling outside this window is the tears of  soldiers' widows that had not be fully shed during the war."    What V. N. Bobrov said in parting is still fresh in my  memory: "The English have a saying: My country, right or wrong.  That is, our problems are for us to solve, and we don't need any  `friends'."</p>

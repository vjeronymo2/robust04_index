			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Kohl warns of two-year delay for monetary union MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, admitted last night that strict insistence on economic convergence between EC member states could delay creation of a single European currency 'by a year or two,' but he said the ultimate objective would be unaffected. The timetable of European economic and monetary union would be discussed at the special EC summit planned for October, he said in an interview on SAT-1, a German television station. A decision on the location of the future European monetary institute - the forerunner of the planned European central bank - would also be taken at that summit, which is intended to mark the final ratification of the Maastricht treaty. The chancellor staunchly defended the actions of the Bundesbank and the German government during the recent European currency crisis, saying Germany had yet again proved its firm commitment to European co-operation. 'The Bundesbank fulfilled its obligations fully and without any hesitation, fully supported by the German government,' he said. 'The close and good co-operation between Bundesbank and government proved its worth, especially in recent days.' The decision to relax the margins of currency fluctuation within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System was 'not a decision against Maastricht', he insisted. However, he agreed that the timetable of economic and monetary union would have to be discussed by the EC heads of government at the special October summit. In a firm reiteration of his commitment to European integ-ration, Mr Kohl repeated Germany's insistence that the strict economic convergence criteria  -including limits on government indebtedness, budget deficits, and inflation - must be maintained. 'We must on no account ease the very strict conditions for national economies,' he said. 'If this has the consequence . . . that the timetable now envisaged is delayed by a year or two, then I would simply ask: how does that change the basic course?' The decisive thing, he said, was that a united Europe would be built in this decade, something which had been unimaginable for the previous 90 years of the century - a Europe in which individual peoples, such as the Germans and French, would still maintain their national identity, but under a single 'European roof'. Mr Kohl said recent upheavals in the EMS were 'nothing new'. The problem was that they were compounded by the international recession, which was a structural crisis in the world economy. EC member states had also failed to bring their budget deficits under control. He expressed surprise that the French government had proposed the temporary withdrawal of the D-Mark from the ERM during negotiations. He said he told the French that other EC member states would object, 'and that is what happened'. There was no German 'plot' against France. Mr Kohl repeated that Germany was the obvious choice for the site of the EMI, in spite of the 'reluctance' of one or more member states, in a clear reference to British opposition. He was 'quite optimistic' that the German battle to have the institute in Frankfurt would win in the end. The Hard Ecu and All That, Page 2 Editorial Comment, Page 13 Lex, Page 14</p>

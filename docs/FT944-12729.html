			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Economics Notebook: An economics of corruption Sleaze can have political costs, but what about the economic side of the equation? In the past, economists usually assumed corruption was an economic 'bad', and left the more detailed theories to their colleagues in the political science department. Yet analysis of economies with very different styles of political crookedness has made them think again. Drawing on their experience helping to implement reforms in formerly communist countries, two Harvard economists, Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny, have come to the conclusion that being able to bribe politicians is not always a bad thing. As always, it depends on the options. One way to see bribes in a more positive light is to view them as a furtive form of taxation. Instead of paying for high public sector wages through general taxation, people in corrupt countries end up footing the bill more directly, bribing officials in return for passports, import licences, or other forms of patronage. At best, this sort of bribe is like a 'hypothecated', or earmarked, tax. The official is performing a service - stamping a passport with the correct visa, for example - and the bribe allows the user of the service to pay for some of the labour costs directly. In this ideal case, taxpayers who never go abroad might even benefit, because corrupt customs officials should insist on lower wages than honest ones. When bureaucratic and political interference is widespread, it is more difficult to see bribes as an extra tax for public goods. But in these circumstances, paying officials not to do their job is better than paying them to do it. When individuals and businessmen face a web of cumbersome rules and regulations, the economy could end up more productive if bribes prevent pointless restrictions from being enforced. In the real world, of course, the effects of corruption will rarely be so benign: the very fact that bribes must be kept secret will make them less efficient than a more transparent revenue-raising system. Unless the 'going rate' for a given service is very well known, the additional uncertainty will severely undermine the prospects for investment and growth. But just as there are better and worse ways to collect taxes, some systems of corruption will be a lot more harmful to the economy than others. Predictably, the two economists argue that the costs will depend on whether the market for political favours is competitive, and how well it is regulated. When there are plenty of officials in a position to provide a particular good, bribes will be kept down because the public can always seek a lower price elsewhere. Corruption is more of a problem when officials have a degree of monopoly power: awarding import licences in a particular sector, for example. This could mean a very high 'tax' on the companies concerned, leading to artificially high prices. Nevertheless, it will rarely be in the official's interest to put all his customers out of business. The real trouble comes when doing business in a given market involves buying off not one, but dozens of individual monopolists, each asking to be paid off for providing (or forgetting about) a particular licence or permit. If there is nothing regulating who can ask for bribes and how much they can ask, firms may simply move abroad if they can, or else give up doing business altogether. Unco-ordinated, bureaucratic fiefdoms will tend to corrupt themselves out of a living: the economy becomes so burdened with the cost of corruption that it simply ceases to function. The monopolists need to co-ordinate their activities, and for that there must be a single source of power to enforce the system. According to the authors, this explains why some countries have managed to cope with high levels of corruption better than others. Where there is one mafia or political party effectively controlling the system, only 'insiders' can demand bribes, and they will be penalised if they demand more than the going rate. This was probably the case in Soviet Russia. Now, however, the country has the most damaging combination of all: thousands of people with an instinct for working the system, and almost no central authority capable of regulating their actions. Whether corruption is viewed as a tax, or a way of reducing regulation, neither argument suggests that corruption is optimal. Indeed, in the latter case, many silly regulations may be imposed by officials, precisely in order to earn money taking bribes to ignore them. The bribes may lessen the negative effects of these rules, but it would obviously be better not to have them in the first place. More generally, companies that specialise in currying political favour will devote less time and resources to making a better product. If firms would otherwise be able to compete on their merits, widespread corruption is clearly worse for the economy. This is consistent with various studies suggesting that corrupt economies tend to have low rates of investment and growth. As Profs Shleifer and Vishny note; 'corruption goes hand in hand with political control. The empirical result that corruption is bad for growth simply reflects the fact that heavy government regulation is bad for growth.' As ever, competition between politicians will be the best way to cure the system. *see 'Corruption', Quarterly Journal of Economics, Autumn 1993 and 'Politicians and Firms', Harvard Mimeo, July 1994.</p>

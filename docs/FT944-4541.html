			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Orange County hit by Wall St selling The affairs of Orange County, the California region which filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday, appeared in chaos yesterday as Wall Street firms started selling investments held on the county's behalf. The move, which the bankruptcy was designed to prevent, risks pushing Orange County's losses above the Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 961m) disclosed last week. Several companies, among them the Japanese bank Nomura, were reported to have liquidated up to Dollars 500m of reverse repurchase positions. These are deals whereby Orange County had borrowed up to Dollars 12bn from Wall Street firms to buy securities, which were then left with the firms as collateral. On Tuesday some firms, led by CS First Boston, liquidated over Dollars 1bn of these positions, precipitating Orange County's bankruptcy later that day. Orange County said yesterday morning it believed the bankruptcy 'stayed and enjoined' all creditors from further liquidation of securities held under reverse repo transactions. However, the Wall Street broker Smith Barney, which holds Dollars 800m worth of reverse repos, said: 'We dispute the stay. It doesn't mean we can't liquidate.' The county filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 9, which applies only to municipalities. Since there is no precedent for a Chapter 9 case of this size or complexity, there has been wide confusion over the legal position. One expert, Mr James Spiotto of Chapman and Cutler, said yesterday that recent amendments to the municipal bankruptcy statute allowed liquidation of reverse repos. The broker Merrill Lynch, which was the county's chief source of finance and holds Dollars 2bn worth of its repos, said: 'We have not liquidated collateral or withdrawn any credit extended to the county.' Merrill defended its role in the collapse, saying it had worked with Orange County for 20 years and had operated in line with its client's published strategies. 'The client has managed a large portfolio in a sophisticated and public manner, with above-average returns, for many years.' It denied it had any legal liability for the bankruptcy. Last week it emerged that Orange County, under its treasurer Mr Robert Citron, had incurred paper losses of Dollars 1.5bn on its Dollars 7.5bn fund as a result of aggressively leveraged investment strategies. Mr Citron resigned on Monday. It is not certain that Orange County will be allowed to go bankrupt. In 1991, Bridgeport, Connecticut, sought Chapter 9 protection but a judge denied it on the grounds that the city was solvent.</p>

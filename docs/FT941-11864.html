			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Management: Shouts are not enough UK companies doing business in the emerging market economies of eastern Europe can now use a service* to help with the languages spoken in many of the areas, as well as with cultural differences. The initiative, launched yesterday, is part of a wider government attempt to encourage more language training for exporters. A report last year showed that a third of small UK exporting companies had missed opportunities because of linguistic barriers. In the Netherlands, only 4 per cent of exporters had experienced the same problem. Few Slavonic languages are taught in British schools and it is for this reason that eastern Europe, which has some of the greatest export opportunities, is now a focus of attention. The new service, backed by the Department of Trade and Industry, is a joint venture between the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, a college of London University, and Communicaid, a corporate trainer. The service offers 'language audits' of a company's needs for trading in a particular area, followed by tailored, individual tuition. Seminars on cultural, economic and political considerations are available, as well as access to an archive of materials from London University. 'Many British exporters have already realised that shouting loudly in English is no longer enough,' said Richard Needham, the trade minister. 'They've tackled languages strategically - as part of their business plan - and they're the ones who are cleaning up. The problem is that many more still haven't got the message and are actually losing out.' *DTI Languages for Export Campaign, Joint Export Promotion Directorate, DTI, Bay 905, Kingsgate House, 66-74 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6SW.

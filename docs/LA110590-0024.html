			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> SKIN CANCER GENE IDENTIFIED  </P> <P> Japanese researchers have identified the defective gene that causes one form of  xeroderma pigmentosa, an inherited disease in which sufferers are unusually  sensitive to sunlight and are prone to light-induced skin cancer. Although many  people carry the defective gene, only about one in 250,000 actually develops  the disease.  </P> <P> There are believed to be about eight genes that cause different forms of the  disease. A team headed by Kiyoji Tanaka of Osaka University reported in the  British journal Nature that they isolated the gene causing the most common form  of the disease, known as XPAC. It causes about a quarter of all cases.  </P> <P> The defective gene, first isolated in mice and then in humans, is thought to be  involved in the repair of deoxyribonucleic acid -- DNA, the genetic blueprint  of life -- damaged by sunlight. Earlier this year, researchers identified the  gene that causes a rarer form of xeroderma pigmentosa, and scientists are  currently searching for the remaining genes.  </P></p>

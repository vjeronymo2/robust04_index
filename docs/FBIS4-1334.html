			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network  in English at 1535 GMT on 23 April broadcasts the following  advertisement: First, a slogan sung by several voices: "Join us  and build a better future." Then follows a voice reading the  following: "The great thing about a multiparty democracy is that  one party cannot just do whatever it likes, because the others  keep an eye on it. Look, we did have opposition parties in the  past but, well, maybe they were too weak to do anything, you  know. This time I'm making sure we get a better life. I'm  voting with my head, not my heart. I'm voting for the new  National Party." The advertisement is followed by the voices  singing: "Be sure of a better life for you."    At the beginning and end of the advertisement an announcer  says: "This political advertisement was paid for by the party."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dan Margalit: "Self-Made Impasse"] </F>   [Text] Yitzhaq Rabin has chosen the wrong way to defend  the wise agreement he made with Yasir 'Arafat. In a television  appearance, he ridiculed Menahem Begin, saying that his ceremony  at Camp David was not marred by an incident like that  orchestrated by 'Arafat in Cairo because Begin gave everything  to Anwar al-Sadat, whereas Rabin was not so generous toward  'Arafat.    Why should Begin be derided? Faced with giving in to U.S.  pressure and going for the chance of peace with Egypt on one  hand, or caving in to the rage of the settlers and extreme  right-wing demonstrations in the territories on the other, Begin  decided to uproot the Sinai settlements, and this was a  reasonable decision.    Rabin already knows that the establishment of the Qatif Bloc  was an act of political madness on the part of former Labor  leaders. He would prefer it to be abandoned, because the  presence of the settlers in the Gaza Strip increases unnecessary  friction in this test period of neighborly relations between the  two nations. The prime minister, however, still lacks the  courage to tell the settlers that the refrain "do not uproot  what has been planted" is only a prayer and not an expression of  hard political reality.    It is true that it is hard for any Zionist to uproot trees  or  fences. But this myth must not blind us to reality: Even  during the period that all Israeli ideologues like to invoke  nostalgically, settlements were dismantled on the Golan and in  the Galilee. Ze'ev Jabotinsky, the spiritual father of all  right-wing ideologues, opposed the establishment of Tel Hay [a  settlement in upper Galilee stormed by Arab attackers in 1920];  Yosef Trumpeldor had to die before Jabotinsky adopted his name  for his own newly formed youth movement [BETAR, Brit Yosef  Trumpeldor].    There is a serious contradiction in Rabin's attitude toward  this issue. On one hand, he had the courage to tell the United  Kibbutz Movement that in exchange for peace with Syria, he will  disband settlements on the Golan; on the other, he refuses to  explain why this logic should not apply to the Gaza Strip as  well.    If it is possible to disband Merom Golan, it should also be  possible to relocate Kfar Darom. Were it not for Rabin's  obsessive stubbornness, which prevents him from relocating any  settlements even a few meters away, many issues could have been  solved without planting an explosive device right in the middle  of the festive Cairo ceremony. The maps with the problematic  attached signatures are, to a large extent, the result of a  settlement concept that forced the two sides to put the solution  of the problems off to a later stage. Have we forgotten the  Taba affair, which placed so many obstacles on the path of  Israeli-Arab diplomacy, before being solved with a clear victory  for the Egyptians?    Rabin's adamant refusal to soften his position regarding  some  of the settlements raises serious doubts about his confidence in  his ability to insist on issues he really considers paramount --  perhaps even that of the 'Etzyon Bloc, which he considers  absolutely vital. The prime minister is afraid that he will not  be able to keep this bloc of settlements intact. As a result,  he is entangling himself in a self-made impasse regarding all  the settlements, both the vital and the insignificant ones.    Rabin's adamant position regarding the settlements has hurt  the Oslo and Cairo agreements, because it is a mistake to leave  a large Jewish population in the Gaza Strip under physical and  psychological conditions that are a breeding ground for Jewish  terrorism. It is also a mistake to insist on leaving Na'ama in  its present location, because this makes it difficult for Israel  to evince even modest generosity regarding the size of the  Jericho autonomous area.    The stubborn decision to keep these settlements in their  present location fails to placate the turbulent right wing in  any event. The right wing considers the Gaza-Jericho agreement  "the beginning of the Palestinian people's redemption," and if  this is indeed the case, it is regrettable that the government  is denying instead of confirming it. Does Shim'on Peres really  reject the establishment of a Palestinian state in the Gaza  Strip with a federative link to the West Bank and Jordan?    I believe it is high time the government admitted this  reality. All the ministers, however, refuse to acknowledge this  possibility. This will force them to again fall back on Peres'  fertile imagination to produce another original and helpful --  albeit partial -- solution. It is reasonable to assume that in  the near future, Peres and 'Arafat will raise the possibility of  a mini- interim arrangement in the framework of which another  city and town will be transferred to Palestinian authority every  three months. Qalqilyah, Janin, Nabulus, and Qabatiyah, and  another year will have passed.</p>

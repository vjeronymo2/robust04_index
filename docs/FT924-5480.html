			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Danish financial groups abandon proposed merger the second-biggest bank Unidanmark, insurer Tryg, and mortgage credit association Nykredit - have abandoned plans for a merger which would have created Denmark's largest financial institution. The announcement has been heralded as the end of a period of consolidation in the financial sector. The merger - which had been under discussion for two years - would have required changes to the law. The banks said this seemed politically unlikely at the present time, after the collapse of the insurance company Hafnia and the problems faced by other Danish financial institutions. Tryg and Nykredit said they would try to proceed with their own merger.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Pension fund move shelved: Twelve have second thoughts on liberalisation A long-awaited European Community directive liberalising pension fund investment has effectively been scrapped because some member states believed it went too far towards encouraging investment outside their home markets. At a June 14 meeting of the internal market council members voted to refer the matter back to a working party where it hoped a compromise might be reached. The wording of the draft document, hammered out after two years of talks, must now be renegotiated. 'There is a general agreement building up at the Commission that this text is an unhappy one,' said Mr Koen de Ryck, permanent representative of the European Federation of Retired Persons, a trade association for Europe's pension funds industry. The directive's key elements were rules barring countries from requiring pension funds to hold a minimum of their investments in certain asset categories and allowing up to 40 per cent of assets to be invested in non-domestic currencies. The directive was also opposed by the UK fund management industry, which believed that the currency diversification rules did not go far enough. Britain had urged that the directive contain no restrictions on currencies but should instead require 'prudent' investment by pension funds. One stumbling block is understood to have came from the Dutch, who sought to exclude its ABP civil service pension scheme from the directive. The fund, the Netherlands' largest, is only allowed to invest up to 5 per cent of its assets abroad and the Dutch government feared disinvestment in local markets. The French objected to rules allowing fund managers to select a custodian for assets outside the country. Arguments put forward by Paris and backed by the Italians, Spanish and others, were that pension schemes wanted their assets reassuringly and safely nearby. They also wanted the directive to spell out more clearly the requirement of regulators to co-operate closely in their supervisory duties.</p>

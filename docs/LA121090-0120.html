			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> REPORT URGES SHUTTLE FLIGHTS BE CUT BACK  </P> <P> A top-level review of the nation's space program recommended today that space  shuttle flights be confined only to those that require human involvement and  that the proposed space station be redesigned from top to bottom.  </P> <P> A committee of experts said some of the concerns expressed about the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration are "deserved and occasionally even  self-inflicted."  </P> <P> Their report was released after Vice President Dan Quayle and NASA  Administrator Richard Truly were briefed on its contents.  </P> <P> The committee was asked whether some new form of management structure was  called for, but it said "changes of such sweeping scope are inappropriate."  </P> <P> "Briefly stated, the committee believes that NASA, and only NASA, realistically  possesses the essential critical mass of knowledge and expertise upon which the  nation's civil space program can be sustained."  </P> <P> The committee said NASA should start immediately to phase out some of its  missions on the space shuttle and transfer them to a new, unmanned launch  vehicle that would be developed.  </P> <P> The report said the civil space program is overly dependent on the shuttle for  access to space and warned that statistically, "we are likely to lose another  space shuttle in the next several years."  </P> <P> The committee recommended that the priorities of the space program be shifted  to place primary emphasis on science. It also recommended that the space  station be redesigned.  </P></p>

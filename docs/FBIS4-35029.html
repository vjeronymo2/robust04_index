			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 27 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Official sources reported  today that the Ecuadoran Government will enforce the National  Mobilization Decree that has been in effect since last week to  counteract a 28 June labor strike declared to express support  for Indian protests.    Government Minister Marcelo Santos said the government  drafted a national plan to confront the work stoppage called by  the United Workers Front (FUT). The strike was called to demand  the suspension of the decree that established the state of  emergency and to express support for the Indians who are  demanding the repeal of the new Agrarian Development Law.    The strike is taking place one week after President Sixto  Duran Ballen issued the mobilization decree following violent  demonstrations staged by Indians to protest the Agrarian Law.    Santos announced the Army and police will be deployed within  the framework of the National Mobilization Decree to maintain  public order and to guarantee the Ecuadoran people's security  during the strike, the fifth such strike declared by FUT in 22  months since Duran Ballen took office.    Meanwhile, FUT President Juan Andrango confirmed the unions  will stage a 24-hour strike on 28 June to express solidarity  with the Indians and to condemn the government's economic  policies. At a news conference, the union leader confirmed the  labor union's decision to suspend work, and he outlined the  "battle plan" workers will follow on 28 June.    The repeal of the National Mobilization Decree and the  suspension of the Agrarian Development Law, which has triggered  an Indian uprising, are among FUT's demands. FUT also is  demanding that the government put a stop to constant rises in  fuel prices and reject its "neoliberal" policies, including the  privatization of public enterprises.    Alfredo Corral, labor and human resources minister, deemed  the FUT strike "untimely," because talks between the government  and the Indians on a new agrarian law are expected to resume  soon. Corral maintained that FUT is very irresponsible because  it is organizing a strike at a time when the executive branch's  National Mobilization Decree remains in effect. The official  added that the strike is not aimed at mitigating labor claims.  Instead, he said its political undertones are evident within the  pretext of expressing solidarity with peasants and Indians.    Minister Corral expressed regret over the union's decision  and warned that, under the National Mobilization Decree, the  Armed Forces will be in charge of ensuring the country's social  order and peace. President Duran-Ballen last week issued the  National Mobilization Decree to overcome internal unrest  triggered by nine days of Indian protests over the Agrarian Law,  which they say is unconstitutional.    The Indian demonstrations, including roadblocks, brought  business to a standstill in at least six provinces of the  inter-Andean and Amazon regions and sparked shortages of food,  medicine, and petroleum byproducts in several regions.    Leaders of the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of  Ecuador (Conaie), the group leading the demonstrations, have  reported that at least four people have died, 15 have been  wounded, and an undetermined number arrested during  confrontations with security forces.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Taunton Cider to join market with Pounds 150m tag TAUNTON CIDER, the UK's second largest cider maker, is expected to raise between Pounds 75m and Pounds 85m from its planned stock market flotation later this month. The company, acquired by its management last year for Pounds 72.5m from a consortium of brewers including Bass, Courage, and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, will have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 150m. Directors and more than 500 employees, who invested a total of Pounds 650,000 in the management buy-out backed by Samuel Montagu and Morgan Grenfell Development Capital, will emerge with a 10 per cent stake - worth about Pounds 15m - in the company. The original lending institutions will hold about 50 per cent of the enlarged share capital. The share offer will be split equally between the public and a placing with institutional investors. The offer price will be announced on July 7. About Pounds 70m raised by the issue of new shares will be used to pay off bank and other borrowings, reducing the company's debt to about Pounds 10m or less than 50 per cent of shareholders' funds. The sale of shares by existing shareholders is expected to amount to about Pounds 10m. Mr Peter Adams, chief executive, who led the management buy-out, said yesterday that the increased financial flexibility provided by the flotation would enable Taunton to take advantage of further opportunities for growth. Results for the year since the buy-out, published in the pathfinder prospectus yesterday, showed a 34 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 12.5m) on turnover 11 per cent ahead at Pounds 105.3m. Operating margins rose from 13.1 per cent to 15.9 per cent. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 7.4m, reflecting interest charges of Pounds 9.6m on the buy-out debt. Taunton claims a 33 per cent volume share of the UK cider market compared to the 45 per cent of HP Bulmer, the market leader. Heavy advertising by the two companies, which has given cider a more contemporary image, helped to maintain overall market growth last year to 76.8m gallons, worth nearly Pounds 600m, while sales of beer and spirits declined. Though the cider market has more than doubled in volume in the past 20 years, sales still represent less than 6 per cent of beer sales. Taunton's growth took off in the late 1960s and early 1970s with increased distribution through Courage and Bass pubs and the launch of Dry Blackthorn, its mainstream brand and number two to Bulmer's Strongbow, which now accounts for 35 per cent of the company's sales. In recent years, Taunton has had a successful record of new product development, particularly in the higher-margin, premium sector, which is now dominated by its Diamond White brand. Red Rock, launched in 1989, has been targeted on lager drinkers; and its most recent brand, Brody, launched nationally last month has already achieved significant distribution. Mr Adams said yesterday that the programme of new product development would continue with the introduction of brands to meet varying consumer tastes and to capitalise on trends in the drinks market.</p>

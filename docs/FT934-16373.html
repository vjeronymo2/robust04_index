			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Survey of Cable TV and Satellite Broadcasting (4): Eutelsat's bird takes wing ASTRA IS the best-known television satellite system in Europe with three 16-channel satellites already co-located in space so that their channels can be received on a single dish. A further satellite is due to be launched next year and a fifth is planned. But Eutelsat, the Paris-based European satellite organisation owned by the PTTs of Europe is intensifying the competition. It is trying to establish an alternative 'hot bird system' - the satellites that everyone wants to be on  -in opposition to Astra. Mr Giuliano Berretta, marketing director of Eutelsat, concedes there was no point in duplicating the service offered by Astra. As well as offering conventional European coverage, Eutelsat also offers a special wide beam which carries programmes to north Africa and on to the Middle East. Already 37 television channels are carried on four Eutelsat satellites, ranging from Deutsche Welle, the international German broadcaster to the Egyptian satellite channel. The organisation aims to concentrate as many channels as possible at 13 degrees east and plans to launch its 16 channel Hot Bird satellite next year. This month, the Eutelsat board will decide on a third television satellite for the 13 degrees east position with up to 20 channels. The satellite - Hot Bird Plus - will be able to deliver digital satellite television direct to the home on dishes of 40cm diameter. Eutelsat is already delivering channels to more than 30 homes attached to cable networks and direct to an estimated 3m homes. By the end of last year 89 satellite television channels were available in Europe on four satellite systems and the number is likely to continue growing, particularly with the introduction of digital compression.</p>

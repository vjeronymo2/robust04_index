			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Singapore Press Holdings raises USDollars 200m Singapore Press Holdings, the island republic's largest publishing group, has raised close to USDollars 200m through the private placement of foreign shares with institutional investors. The 11m new shares, which account for about 4 per cent of the company's share capital, were priced at SDollars 26 each. This represents a 1.9 per cent discount to the last traded price on the foreign shares on August 22. Lead manager BZW said the new equity would raise the percentage of foreign ownership of the company to close to the maximum level of 49 per cent. There is a restriction on foreign ownership because the company controls the media in Singapore.</p>

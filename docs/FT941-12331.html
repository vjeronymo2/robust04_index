			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / The price of a share in the cake / Are structural problems in the US stock market being obscured? Every business day, at 5pm Eastern Standard Time, a computer in a plain building in Phoenix, Arizona, goes into action. It does not take long for it to do its work: within seconds, orders from people who want to buy and sell shares in US companies have been matched together and deals struck, without human intervention. At less than 700,000 shares a day, the two-year-old Arizona Stock Exchange accounts for a tiny fragment of the volume of trading that passes through the US stock market. It represents about 0.1 per cent of the combined turnover of shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, the US's screen-based market. To some in the longer-established exchanges, however, the Arizona Stock Exchange, and others like it, pose a serious threat to the future of the US stock market by taking business away from so-called 'primary' markets such as the NYSE and Nasdaq. The critics have two complaints about the newcomers. First, some investors' orders may end up being executed in a market where they do not find the best price. Second, and worse, fragmentation may weaken the mechanism by which markets determine the best price for shares: increasingly buyers and sellers will no longer be coming together in a single forum. The people who raise these concerns - the NYSE has been among the most vocal in recent years - do so in part out of self-interest. But such worries prompted the report last week by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the government agency which regulates the investment markets. 'Market 2000', the SEC's first broad study of the structure of the US equity markets for two decades, concluded that there is not much wrong with the way the markets are currently run. In the process, though, it may have skated over some of the structural questions worrying participants. At first sight, there seems to be little wrong with the way the US stockmarket is operating. The volume of shares traded across the country is far higher than in the fabled trading frenzy which seized financial markets in the mid-1980s. On the NYSE, the number of shares traded in 1992 crept back above the previous, 1987, peak to 52bn; last year it soared to 67bn and shares worth Dollars 2,250bn changed hands. The brokers, dealers and trading systems which act as intermediaries to this activity have reaped the benefits. Whether in the form of trading fees, dealing spreads (Dollars  1/8 a share is typical) or commissions (big institutions generally pay six cents a share), their income has been surging ahead, along with the volume of trading. Competition has intensified for this business - particularly as technology has increased opportunities for automating large parts of the share-trading process. Technology has also blurred the distinction between broker/dealers and trading systems. Some of the biggest private automated systems are owned by securities houses - for instance by CS First Boston in New York. But the argument of the critics is that the competition is threatening the integrity of the US stock market. Certainly, some of the methods used by dealers and trading systems to win business may be at the expense of customers. One way to attract more orders is to pay the person who brings them to you. Some dealers pay a cent or two a share to brokers who put business their way (known as 'payment for order flow'). Another way is to refund part of an institutional investor's commissions by supplying him with equipment such as Reuters screens or other services (known in the US as 'soft dollars', and in the UK as 'soft commissions'). This is big business: soft dollar 'refunds' run at more than Dollars 1bn a year. As the commission pie keeps getting bigger, more and more people are trying to cut out a slice. Such practices raise serious questions about whether inducements interfere with a broker or institutional investor's duty to get the best deal for their customers. However the SEC, in its report last week, seemed to disagree - provided there was full disclosure of the practices being used. It concluded that the inducements should not be banned. But it is planning to bring forward new regulations this year to force the release of more information about such arrangements. However, automated trading systems, such as the Arizona Stock Exchange, have other ways of attracting business. They allow buyers and sellers of shares to deal directly with each other, avoiding the dealer's spread. To the extent that it has brought down the cost of trading and forced established markets to improve their services, this has benefited investors. Though the NYSE is worried about the impact on its business, the SEC concluded that fledgling new markets should be nurtured with a light regulatory touch and, if anything, given greater opportunities to compete with the primary markets. The SEC has, however, not assuaged a far-reaching fear of established players in the US stock market: that if the volume of share trading is divided among an increasing number of arenas, the efficiency of the market will eventually be undermined. Trading on the NYSE still determines the price of, say, IBM shares. Other markets take its prices as a reference when handling trades. But if many of the orders to buy or sell IBM shares never reach the NYSE, its effectiveness in setting the most appropriate price will be lessened. So far, the extent of the fragmentation is limited, though use of private trading systems is growing fast - the volume of shares traded on them rose by 60 per cent in 1992 and then doubled again last year. They still account for only a small fraction of the total: 1.4 per cent of trading in NYSE stocks last year, and 13 per cent of Nasdaq stocks. The NYSE still handles 79 per cent of the trade in the shares it lists, and customers are generally happy with the service. 'I like the NYSE - it's a fine auction market and costs are OK,' says Mr George Pirrone, head trader at mutual funds group Dreyfus. At the same time, the NYSE has itself encouraged the fragmentation of markets. Half of its trading (up from 17 per cent 20 years ago) does not take place on the exchange's floor at all but is carried out by big securities firms who match buy and sell orders from their own customers, or who take big blocks of shares from sellers and parcel them out to other investors. These trades only nominally 'cross' on the floor of the exchange. One way to overcome the potential problems of fragmentation as the US stock market expands, is through linkages. Some electronic links already exist: the ITS, a link between the US's seven exchanges, Nasdaq and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, handles about four per cent of trading in NYSE shares. To reinforce such safeguards, the SEC last week proposed rule changes which would go some way towards forcing a greater dispersal of information within the US stock market about possible orders from buyers and sellers of shares. But while the commission wants to to give the stock market a nudge towards a more open, competitive trading environment, the tone of its report leaves it unclear how hard it will push for reform. Changes will, in part, require amendments to the 'primary' exchanges' own rules. It is not yet evident how willing they will be to make such adjustments - nor how much pressure the SEC will try to exert on them to do so. In expressing a desire not to disturb what it calls the 'carefully maintained equilibrium' in the markets, the SEC may have avoid antagonising many of the middlemen who make a living out of trading shares. But the SEC may have missed an opportunity to establish a framework to cope with the upheavals in market structure that competition and technological advance - and perhaps a future downturn in the volume of transactions - will bring.</p>

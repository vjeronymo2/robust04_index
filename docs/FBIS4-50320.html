			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Letter to the editor" by Michael J.J. Hanson, Hong Kong </F> Government Information Co-ordinator]    [Text] Martin Lee seems to subscribe to the old adage that  one should never let the facts get in the way of a good story.  How else can one explain his statement that the Governor "has  consistently resisted calls from the Hong Kong community to  strike from Hong Kong's law books the draconian colonial  statutes which could be used to muzzle journalists after 1997"?  Let's put the facts on the record.    Soon after he arrived in Hong Kong as Governor in July 1992,  Mr Patten met representatives of the Journalists Association.  They presented him with a list of 17 laws which in their view  were either an actual or a potential threat to press freedom.  Mr Patten immediately agreed to conduct a review.    The review in fact covered 27 Ordinances (not the 17  identified by the Journalists Association) and a total of 53  separate provisions. The initial results of the review were  reported to the Journalists Association and to the Legislative  Council in March and April last year.    We have already amended three Ordinances, a further seven  will be amended before the end of the year and we are still  working on four Ordinances, i.e. the Crimes Ordinances, the  Official Secrets Act, the Police Force Ordinance and the  Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.    The remaining Ordinances have been reviewed, but we have  concluded that, as they exist to protect the privacy of  individuals, there is no case for amending or repealing them.  The Government has a duty to protect the privacy of individuals  as well as to protect the freedom of the press.    Far from resisting calls for action, the Government has  moved  quickly to identify the legal provisions which could jeopardise  the freedom of the laws identified and we will complete work on  the remaining four before the end of the year.

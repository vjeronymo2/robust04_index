			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / EC set to approve subsidies for Bull THE European Commission is likely to approve FFr6.6bn (Pounds 670m) of French government subsidies aimed at returning Bull, the French computer manufacturer, to profitability. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner, will ask his fellow-commissioners next week to clear the state aid. His investigation, which began last July, found that the money would be used for genuine restructuring and not simply to prop up an ailing company. If Sir Leon had proposed blocking the aid he would almost certainly have faced a fierce battle within the Commission, and a damaging row with the French authorities at a sensitive time for relations between Brussels and the member states. The French government has already injected FFr2bn of fresh capital into Bull, but to its annoyance the Commission's inquiry has held up a second FFr2bn capital injection for nearly a year. Last month, Paris announced the loss-making group would proceed with the second equity increase even though the Commission had not approved it. The Bull case has also prompted concern in the Commission about the alleged sluggishness of Brussels' general competition inquiries, relative to merger investigations, which are subject to a binding five-month deadline. Sir Leon and his officials are already looking for ways to speed up their work. Apart from the capital injection, Sir Leon's recommendation on Bull covers a further FFr2.6bn of research funding and takes into account the FFr540m investment in Bull by IBM, the US computer manufacturer, formalised last month, and last year's investment by NEC, the Japanese electronics company. That left the two companies with 5.68 per cent and 4.7 per cent of Bull respectively. Those agreements should help Bull realise its ambition of returning to operating profitability by the end of this year and net profits by the end of 1993. But Commission competition experts believe the combination of aid and investment will not give Bull an unfair edge over its EC competitors. The computer group's rivals are said to have raised few objections to the French government's plan, which will involve heavy job losses and the closure of several factories.</p>

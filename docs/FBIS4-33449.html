			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 31 May (NOTIMEX) -- Cuban Agriculture  Minister Alfredo Jordan today criticized the country's private  farmers for failing to sell produce to the state, and he  announced the government will take steps to resolve the problem.    At a meeting in western Matanzas Province, Minister Jordan,  who is a member of the Politburo of the ruling Communist Party  of Cuba, said the state will impose a tax on "fallow lands" to  force private rural landowners to produce. He said, "We must  make demands on those who fail to comply and, if necessary,  apply the penalties prescribed by the Agrarian Law without fail."    In the first admission by a public official of the farmers'  reluctance to sell crops to the state, Jordan said, "There are  landowners who have not delivered even one quintal of  agricultural products over the course of the year; this is  totally unacceptable."    The official demanded that private farmers who control 20  percent of the country's arable land comply with their  obligation to sell crops to the so-called collection centers  that are in charge of marketing for the state. "Feeding the  people is a sacred task, and those who possess land and make  production commitments through agreements with the state must  fulfill their obligations," Jordan insisted.    The minister's warning coincided with the publication in the  official press of reports regarding a drop in the production of  tubers and vegetables in 1993. Many private farmers prefer to  sell their crops to middlemen or consumers who visit the rural  areas on weekends to buy provisions at prices higher than the  official price.    "There are farmers who do not sell their crops to the  state's  collection centers and who seek to enrich themselves by other  means," said the weekly newspaper TRABAJADORES, the mouthpiece  of the unions. The weekly said that in 1993, the production of  various crops, including vegetables and tubers, dropped 77  percent in comparison to the 1992 crop, and this was made  evident by empty stores in Havana.    According to the source, the volume of agricultural  production by the cooperative-peasant and state sectors  declined, and the ensuing deficit has led to a reduction in  other related crops.    Private farmers produce 35 percent of the country's total  agricultural production, producing more than the state in crops  such as coffee, tobacco, tomatoes, onions, garlic, green  peppers, and carrots.    In terms of land distribution, from September onward state  agriculture has been reorganized into basic units of cooperative  production which are managed by experienced farmworkers. These  units control some 80 percent of the island's arable land.    Following the two agrarian reform programs implemented in  the  sixties, there are some 200,000 registered private farmers  affiliated with the National Association of Small Farmers. As a  group, these private farmers own more than 865,000 hectares of  land, which are distributed among 2,260 farming cooperatives.    Some 125,000 farmers refused to pool their land together but  maintain a certain level of cooperation through "credit and  services cooperatives."    Private rural farmers had sold their products at the  so-called "farmer's free markets" which flourished up until  1986, when the government ordered them closed to avoid  "excessive enrichment."</p>

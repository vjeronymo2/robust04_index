			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN BARS U.S. RICE SAMPLES  </P> <P> Japan has told the United States to remove a small display of American rice  from a Japanese convention hall because it violates the country's strict rice  import rules.  </P> <P> Japan bans all imports of rice for commercial purposes.  </P> <P> "We are sorry but we had explained to the (U.S. Agricultural Trade) office  already last month that any samples would be prohibited, but I hear the office  actually did offer some samples, or display for commercial purposes," an  official at Japan's Food Agency said Thursday.  </P> <P> "The U.S. Agricultural Trade Office is thus complying with the request from  Japan's Food Agency to remove approximately two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of U.S.  rice on display," an American Embassy spokesman said today.  </P> <P> The Japanese government forbids the sale of foreign rice. Only imports for  personal use of up to 220 pounds are allowed.  </P> <P> A booth operated by the U.S. Rice Council will continue to provide information  about U.S. rice until the convention ends Saturday, the embassy spokesman said.  </P></p>

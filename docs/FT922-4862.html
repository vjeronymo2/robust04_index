			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Serbs attack children's relief convoy HOPES of implementing any ceasefire in Bosnia-Hercegovina collapsed yesterday after an aid worker with a humanitarian relief convoy was killed in an attack by Serb militia on the outskirts of the capital Sarajevo, and fighting spread to other parts of the republic. Shortly after the attack Yugoslavia's collective leadership in Belgrade called on Serb leaders in Bosnia to 'immediately halt all bombardments of Sarajevo. . . and to cede the city airport to the control of the United Nations'. The statement, initialled by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, was the strongest criticism yet of Serb irregular forces in two months of fighting in Bosnia. Diplomats said the communique appeared to indicate that leaders from Serbia and Montenegro were trying to distance themselves from Bosnia's Serb leaders and militia groups following UN sanctions. The relief convoy, organised by the Children's Embassy, an international charity, and escorted by two UN armoured personnel carriers, had attempted to take food to Dobrinja, a suburb of Sarajevo. Over 20,000 people have been under siege by Serbian militia for 40 days. Ms Sanja Rihtman from the Children's Embassy in Sarajevo said one aid worker was shot dead and another badly injured in the attack. Despite the incident Mr John Thornbury, a UN special envoy, yesterday flew by helicopter to Sarajevo in an attempt to start negotiations on reopening the airport. Meanwhile Sarajevo radio, quoting the Bosnian government, said 5,700 people had died, and more than 20,000 had been injured since fighting in the republic began two months ago. About 1.5m people had been displaced. Sarajevo Radio said there was no let-up in fighting yesterday. It said Serbian militia forces and the Yugoslav army bombarded Jajce, a city in north-east Bosnia, where Croats and Moslems make up 70 per cent of the population. A western diplomat said it was 'unclear' if the Yugoslav presidency's call would reduce the level of violence in Bosnia or if the Serb militia groups were beyond Belgrade's control. UN officials say General Ratko Mladic, commander of the Bosnian Serb army, is ordering the attacks. Gen Zivota Panic, commander of the Yugoslav army, was due to hold talks with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Sarajevo. However, it is unclear if General Panic can control General Mladic's forces.</p>

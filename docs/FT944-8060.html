			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Budget 1994: Sizing up the chancellor's shade of green - The environmental options business and lobbyists would like to see in the Budget The caution with which environmental pressure groups, manufacturers and retailers greeted the proposed pollution measures announced in last week's Queen's Speech was typical of the wariness surrounding government attempts to 'green' domestic and business activities. They are now wondering whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will include measures intended to help the environment in his Budget next week. Business is concerned about how fiscal instruments will affect competitiveness. Pressure groups fear taxation could be used to replace regulatory measures. Most groups expect the chancellor to continue raising duty on fuel. Mr Roger Bate, director of the environment unit at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: 'He is committed to a 5 per cent real increase per annum on fuel . . . There was quite a lot of bad press on VAT on domestic fuel but now that is considered water under the bridge so my guess is that will probably stay.' Some analysts argue that increasing fuel prices - especially for cars - may make little or no impact on pollution. Mr John Cridland, environment director of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'It has not been demonstrated that increasing the price on petrol would reduce the cars on the road.' Mr Bate warned that fuel taxes bore most heavily on those who were least responsible for the problem. 'The worst effects are on disparate groups, like rural individuals who contribute very little to pollution. It would be better to privatise the roads or introduce congestion pricing,' he said. Alternative options for addressing this problem would need a longer timescale than one Budget and would entail considerable capital investment. One such option might be congestion pricing - taxing car owners based on the amount of time they spend in traffic jams - to target the environmental problem directly, rather than taxing activities associated with environmental damage, such as the use of fuel. Such a charge would require cars to be fitted with a smart card that would tally the minutes spent idling in traffic, with the owner charged accordingly, encouraging drivers to travel at different times or to use public transport. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, which produced a prospectus for possible inclusions in the Budget, discussed one mechanism for direct taxation of pollution: emission taxation on individual sources. Units of pollution would be measured much like gas or electricity use, and taxed proportionately. The institute said there was a trade-off between direct taxes such as emission taxation, and financial instruments based on existing tax bases - such as VAT on fuel. Setting up a new tax system might entail high administrative costs, but is more likely to be specifically levied on sources of pollution. In the Queen's Speech the government made clear its plans to push through schemes to increase recycling. One instrument that could encourage this is a landfill levy - a charge on landfill owners in the hope that the extra cost would be passed on to customers, encouraging them to seek other alternatives. The CBI supports a charge on the packaging industry to support recycling but is sceptical about the landfill levy. Mr Cridland said: 'No analysis has been done with the landfill levy to assess the effect it will have on business or the environment.' With all green taxation issues, he said, it was important to consider whether the benefit of a particular tax to the environment outweighed the impact on business competitiveness. He said: 'Economic instruments are a very trendy policy mechanism but their introduction does not always follow a thorough assessment of whether the cost will outweigh the benefit.' Friends of the Earth believes cost-benefit analyses should be subservient to the need to prevent pollution at source. Mr Andrew Lees, campaign director, said: 'A cost-benefit analysis in the traditional approach is an inappropriate tool for assessment . . . How do you do a cost benefit analysis on the basis of value for money today versus value for money later? Environmental assets increase with time.' While Friends of the Earth advocates the use of taxation to curb environmental damage, it does not believe taxation can eliminate the problems on its own. Mr Lees said: 'Economic instruments can only be used for fine-tuning, they are no substitute for the regulatory approach. The government may use environmental taxes to camouflage its deregulated agenda.'</p>

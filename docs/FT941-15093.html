			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Dollar FRNs back in the limelight - Capital &amp; Credit The dollar floating-rate note (FRN) sector staged a dramatic come-back last week and is set to grow further in coming months, driven by growing investor demand. Investors' recent appetite for US dollar FRNs largely reflects fears that, as the US economy continues to recover, the US Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy to forestall a resurgence in inflation. 'Investors are beginning to feel the next move in US interest rates will be up, which means there's a special attraction in holding floating-rate instruments,' said a London syndicate official. 'We have seen a major reallocation of funds from fixed-rate into floating-rate paper,' added another. Last week's highlight in the FRN sector was Canada's Dollars 2bn five-year issue, paying a coupon of three-month Libor minus 25 basis points. Although the deal was considered to be aggressively priced, it met with solid demand. Total FRN issuance last week amounted to some Dollars 2.9bn. 'After last week, it's fair to say the FRN market is back,' said a senior London banker. The FRN market slumped in 1986 after the perpetual floating-rate note sector crashed; in the aftermath of the sell-off, issuance dried to a trickle and the market became illiquid. Only in the last two years has it managed to get back on its feet and enjoy growing popularity among investors. Analysts at Kidder Peabody cite several reasons for the market's recovery. For one, innovative structures, such as so-called collared floating-rate notes (where the coupon range is limited by a floor rate and a ceiling rate) have enabled issuers to achieve sub-Libor funding through floating-rate products. Furthermore, volatility in European currency markets, amid uncertainty over European Monetary Union, increased the attraction of US dollar floating rate securities as a safe haven investment, the analysts note. Lastly, they point out that tight swap spreads have offered limited arbitrage opportunities, making it more difficult for borrowers to issue fixed-rate and swap into sub-Libor funds. Most syndicate managers expect to see substantial FRN issuance in coming weeks, partly because floating-rate debt currently can offer comparatively cheap funding. 'The market has got to the stage where it has become more cost-competitive and efficient for raising large size,' says an FRN trader, adding, 'at the moment it tends to be cheaper to borrow floating-rate funds.' Moreover, floating-rate debt offers borrowers maximum flexibility as they can include a call option which the borrower can exercise if its funding needs change. Canada, for example, included a call option after the first year. With the US furthest ahead in the global interest-rate cycle, the dollar sector is expected to dominate FRN issuance in coming months. But once rates are seen to have bottomed in Europe and Japan, issuance is also expected to pick up in sterling, D-Marks and yen. Meanwhile, in the sterling sector, some Pounds 1.7bn in FRNs, issued mostly by building societies, will be redeemed this year. Building societies, which like to match their variable-rate liabilities and assets, are natural FRN borrowers. A further Pounds 2.9bn of FRNs include call options in 1994 and as most of them involve 5 per cent coupon floors, observers say it is likely a substantial amount will be called if UK interest rates are cut again. 'If base rates are cut to 5 per cent, Libor will probably fall below that level, making an FRN with a 5 per cent coupon rather expensive funding,' said a syndicate manager. 'The market may see quite a lot of paper being withdrawn, some of which could get refinanced,' especially if building societies see an upturn in mortgage demand, he said.</p>

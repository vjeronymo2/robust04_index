			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 20 May (TANJUG) -- At today's news  conference for foreign and Yugoslav reporters at the Palace of  the Federation, Federal Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic  said that the priorities of Yugoslavia's current foreign policy  activities are the search for a political solution to the  Bosnian crisis, the resolution of other aspects of the crisis in  the region of former Yugoslavia, and the strengthening of trust  and cooperation with neighboring countries.    At the start of the news conference, the Yugoslav foreign  minister recalled that the government reviewed and adopted three  reports at its session today -- on the announcement from the  meeting of the five foreign ministers (United States, Russia,  Greece, France, and Belgium) devoted to the resolution of the  Bosnian crisis, on the meeting of the economic group within the  framework of the international conference on former Yugoslavia,  and on the recent visit by Zoran Lilic, president of the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], and Vladislav Jovanovic to the  Republic of South Africa.    According to Jovanovic, the Federal Government today  expressed a positive stance on the announcement of the five  ministers in Geneva, especially the part renouncing the war  option. "However, we pointed to the practical shortcomings that  have faithfully accompanied earlier initiatives of this kind:  the unequal treatment of all the protagonists in the Yugoslav  crisis, certain remaining forms of hostility, and the fact that  the international community should take a more balanced approach  in the process of establishing full equality and lifting the  sanctions."    The first question to Jovanovic (APA) concerned his recent  statement about war cries from Austria and Albania. Jovanovic  replied that it would be best if there were no such cries from  any country. "Unfortunately, Austria and Albania were involved  in the process of the disintegration of former Yugoslavia in the  most flagrant and aggressive way, just as they are now involved  in exerting pressure on the FRY," he said. Jovanovic added that  this also refers to their insisting that the sanctions should  stay and be further tightened and to their "very aggressive  attitude toward Kosovo and Metohija, Sandzak and Vojvodina."    "We would like this hostile attitude to end," the Yugoslav  foreign minister said. Jovanovic was then asked to present  Yugoslavia's position on the proposed territorial division of  Bosnia-Herzegovina based on the 49- 51 percent principle.    Having recalled the recent meetings with important  international factors, he replied that everyone was clearly told  about Yugoslavia's vital interest -- the immediate and permanent  cessation of hostilities in Bosnia and, as far as the percentage  is concerned, "it is a matter for the three warring sides to  agree on."    A reporter of the Slovene news agency was almost astonished  about the greetings which the federal prime minister and the  foreign minister extended to their Italian colleagues clearly  alluding to the victory of the Right. Jovanovic first said that  such greetings from Belgrade are not at all unusual. As for the  victory of the Right, Jovanovic said, Yugoslavia is not going to  get involved since this would mean interfering in Italy's  internal affairs.    "We do not have a single serious problem in our relations  with Italy and we wish to develop cooperation with this country  and all other countries," Jovanovic said."    Commenting on the position adopted by the five foreign  ministers on the sanctions, voiced at the recent meeting in  Geneva, Jovanovic stressed that this was the first time that  Europe, Russia and the United States expressed a joint position  on the issue.    According to him, the fact that the lifting of the sanctions  is not linked with a final solution to the Bosnian conflict is  also positive. "That is a certain step forward, but not big  enough, because it does not lift the sanctions which are a huge  obstacle to peace in Bosnia," Jovanovic said.    A STUDENT correspondent asked Jovanovic: "Up to when will  the  Africanization of Yugoslavia continue, considering that the  nonaligned countries were among the first to stab our country in  the back, and when will Yugoslavia return to where it belongs --  to Europe."    "First, speaking about stabbing in the back, the blow did  not  come from Africa, but from Europe," Jovanovic said. "Second,  African nonaligned countries wanted to help Yugoslavia, but the  former federal government tactically prevented that by turning  its back on those countries and asking for assistance from the  European Community."    "And third, our activities are not leading to the  Africanization of the country. We are a European country  although we are now excluded from Europe," Jovanovic said.    The next question referred to "the halt" in relations  between  the FRY and Croatia.    "The reasons for the halt, if that is true, lie with  Croatia.  I would like to remind you that the Deputy Federal Prime  Minister Zeljko Simic visited Zagreb without any preconditions,"  Jovanovic said. "We expected, and continue to expect Croatian  Deputy Prime Minister Mate Granic to come to Belgrade, but he  has set conditions for his visit. That means that the FRY is  not slowing down the development of relations with Croatia," the  Yugoslav foreign minister said.    Asked by the Macedonian radio correspondent about relations  between the FRY and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia], Jovanovic said that "we, on our part, have done  nothing to make these relations what they are today."    "All problems were caused as a result of Macedonia's  activities. Macedonia opted for secession and got into trouble  with Greece. It is denying our right to succession by  advocating secession. This is at terrible loggerheads with  reality," Jovanovic said.    "The moment Macedonia resolves its problem with Greece and  acknowledges our right to succession and continuity,  normalization will ensue."    Are there any differences in the U.S. and European approach  to the process of resolving the Yugoslav crisis?    "As far as we are concerned, Europe neither has the same  interests as the United States nor does it view the future  development of the former Yugoslavia in the same way, because it  is aware that if the crisis drags on, with all its elements --  including the sanctions -- this will also be fatal for Europe.  The destabilization of the Balkans poses a threat to the whole  of Europe," Jovanovic said.    A German correspondent asked whether the federal foreign  minister was consulted before the decision was made to withdraw  certain foreign correspondents' credentials. At the same time  he expressed his "surprise" that not one German correspondent  had been put on this list.    Jovanovic replied briefly that the decision on the  withdrawal  of credentials was under the jurisdiction of the Federal  Information Ministry.    Information Minister Slobodan Ignjatovic dealt with the  surprise. "I am pleased that you are surprised that credentials  were not withdrawn from German correspondents. This strengthens  my conviction that you too are aware of the objectivity, or the  lack thereof -- displayed by certain reporters. This does not  mean that we are pleased with the objectivity of what certain  reporters are writing. There are limits."</p>

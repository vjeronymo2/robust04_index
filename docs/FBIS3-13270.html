			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Arab Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab </F> Darawshah, by Sana' al-Imam in Damascus on 10 Mar--recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Imam] As Israeli Arabs,  how do you view the Gaza-Jericho agreement?    [Darawshah] First of all I object to such description. We  are not Israeli Arabs. We are Palestinians and are citizens of  the State of Israel. We are part of the Arab nation.  Therefore, I hope Arab reporters and media would not use such  an appellation. [passage omitted]    [Al-Imam] Nayif Hawatimah, leader of the Democratic Front  for  the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has said you are very  displeased with the Cairo agreement and that you will demand  that the Israeli Government cancel it.    [Darawshah] We used the phrase "having reservations." This  is the ?(view) of Palestinians inside Israel. The majority of  the political forces, including the Arab Democratic Party,  welcomed the Oslo agreement as an agreement of principle, hoping  that this would be (?followed) by a detailed agreement ensuring  Palestinian rights. However, Israel's attempt to obtain big  gains from the Palestinian side without offering real  concessions made us express reservations over the Cairo  agreement, without expressing opposition. We have reservations.  [passage omitted]</p>

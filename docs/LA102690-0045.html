			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: A POST-NUCLEAR WORLD IN 'RIDDLEY WALKER'  </P> <P> "Ain't that a larf?" asks the hero of Russell Hoban's "Riddley Walker" at  CalRep. He's talking about the world 3,000 years after the explosion of the  "one big one" in 1997.  </P> <P> The larf is on the human race. It hasn't learned a thing. It's back at square  one, trying to find the "numbers" that will produce primitive explosives.  </P> <P> The plot is no more extraordinary than your generic post-holocaust B-movie, but  Hoban's fable-like structure and his imaginative invention of a language that  is all that remains of good English (its decline is already starting in  pre-holocaust 1990) make the evening fascinating. It only takes a minute to  tune in -- the leader is the "Primintser" and the dread Usa (U.S.A.) controls  the "puterlite" (computer elite).  </P> <P> Ashley Carr's staging on D Martyn Bookwalter's intriguing primitive grotto  setting is notably colorful, and Craig Rovere's wide-eyed Candide of a Riddley  Walker gives the action a backbone and fine comic shading.  </P> <P>  At Cal State Long Beach, 1250 Bellflower Blvd.; Fridays and Saturdays, also  Oct. 24-27, 8 p.m.; call for Nov.-Dec. schedule; ends Dec. 15. $10-$14; (213)  985-5526.  </P> <P> T.H.

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SINGLE LIFE: GOVERNMENT AWAKENS TO COST OF MARITAL-STATUS DISCRIMINATION  </P> <P> A consumer task force -- the brainchild of Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn  -- was convened for the purpose of determining if, and in what ways, single  people suffer discrimination as compared to married people.  </P> <P> How ingenious.  </P> <P> But the study was bound to happen, given the fact that unmarried people compose  55% of the population in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> A 126-page report was released last month by Thomas F. Coleman, chairman of the  Consumer Task Force on Marital Status Discrimination.  </P> <P> It revealed what I had long known: Singles' are indeed penalized for not  committing matrimony.  </P> <P> Coleman said, the "report represents the emergence of a new dimension of the  consumer protection movement. Call it singles' rights."  </P> <P> I wonder how many committee members, ancillary staff and taxpayer dollars it  took to screw in this light bulb. They could have saved time and money by  simply phoning me. For the price of a lunch at the Ritz I could have told them  a thing or two.  </P> <P> Marriage is still considered an achievement in our society, especially for  women. A woman's social status is elevated by virtue of taking on a man's last  name. And a man, if he really expects to hit corporate heights, must have the  obligatory family portrait atop his mahogany desk or be prepared to have his  masculinity quotient questioned behind his back.  </P> <P> Try calling the Auto Club for a membership. If you and your significant other  are living together it will cost each of you $51 a year. If you are married, it  will cost $51 for the "primary" member and $14 for the "secondary" member.  </P> <P> Insurance companies discriminate against singles. Many of them refuse to write  home renters' insurance for a single person. Two insurance company  representatives told me that they no longer insure single people. "Single  people have a tendency to have a lot of people running in and out of their  homes," the insurance agent said.  </P> <P> "Well, I don't," I protested.  </P> <P> "Yes, I am sure you're responsible, but we see so much theft from boyfriends  and girlfriends coming and going, it just doesn't make sense for us to write  these policies."  </P> <P> I was finally permitted the luxury of purchasing such a protective policy but  was forced to sign an affidavit assuring them I lived alone. Adding insult to  injury, I was actually required to furnish a list of names of anyone who might  visit me for 24 hours or longer.  </P> <P> Auto insurance wasn't any easier: Two prior moving violations -- five years ago  -- and one accident in 1984 -- that was not my fault -- made it difficult to  find an insurance company that would accept me. The reason given? I am a single  self-employed person who works at home. They politely suggested that I put  myself in someone else's good hands.  </P> <P> Taxes? Don't get me started. A married couple are allowed a renters' tax break  of $131 contrasted with $61 for a single person. As a single person the  equitable break should be $65.50.  </P> <P> Single people without kids pay more than their fair share. Parents with  children receive a tax break and their kids use the school system and  government sponsored day care (where available).  </P> <P> Airlines restrict frequent-flier awards to married partners or blood relatives.  TWA recently dropped the spouse-only policy, but most airlines are  single-minded on this issue.  </P> <P> Join a health club as a single person. If you and your fiance live together and  work out together, or if you are single and work out alone, it will cost you  about twice as much for a membership in most health clubs as it would if you  were married.  </P> <P> Travel clubs all over Southern California assist singles' in locating other  single people with whom to travel to save members money on mandatory  double-occupancy fees. An estimated 300,000 members of such travel clubs abound  in the United States today as contrasted with only 10,000 in 1980.  </P> <P> People may exclaim: "But it's against the law to discriminate."  </P> <P> It is. But those who choose to discriminate will always find a way.  </P> <P> Commenting that Los Angeles "has taken a very positive first step," Virginia M.  Apuzzo, deputy executive director of New York state's consumer protection  agency, vowed to mount a strong campaign against marital-status discrimination.  </P> <P> "People are not being treated fairly in the marketplace," she noted.  </P> <P> The Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn. has responded to the marital-status issue.  Long-held membership policies dictated that admission was only for the member  and "spouse." Bowing to public pressure, the association recently relaxed the  policy, allowing members and any adult guest to be admitted.  </P> <P> Dr. Doolittle would be proud.  </P></p>

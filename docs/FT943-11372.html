			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lower bad debts boost N of England Society North of England Building Society, which is planning to merge with Northern Rock, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.21m for the six months to June 30, an increase of 6.8 per cent on the comparable Pounds 7.7m. The rise was largely due to a fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts from Pounds 787,000 to Pounds 327,000. New gross lending fell to Pounds 61m over the period, sharply down on the Pounds 77.4m advanced in the first half of 1993. The decline compared with the sector average which showed a slight rise in gross lending. The society experienced a net outflow of funds totalling Pounds 12.6m, against an inflow of Pounds 28.3m. Total assets rose slightly over the six months from Pounds 1.509bn at the start of the year to stand at Pounds 1.514bn, compared with Pounds 1.49bn a year earlier. Mr Ronald Shiel, chairman, said that the merger with Northern Rock, the 11th largest society, had taken much time and effort since its announcement at the start of May. He acknowledged that activity in the lending and savings market had been at a low level, and said that competition had been intense for what business was available.</p>

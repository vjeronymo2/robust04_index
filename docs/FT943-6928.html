			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Japanese capital spending continues to fall Domestic capital spending by Japanese companies remains on a downward trend and may not recover even by the year which ends in March 1996, according to an annual survey released yesterday by the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. Across all industries, planned outlays on plant and equipment were down 2.1 per cent for the year to March while initial expectations for the following year indicated a further 1.7 per cent cut. That would make a fourth consecutive year of decrease, although LTCB said it saw 'a strong possibility that plans will be revised upward' next year, with 'some faint but positive signs' of recovery already beginning to emerge. However, there was little chance that any extra funds committed would be substantial, it added. The poll of 1,869 companies, largely its own customers, produced a gloomier outlook than a similar survey unveiled last week by Nippon Credit Bank, another big lender to industry. NCB's data projected a dip of 1.1 per cent this year and 0.9 per cent next. Manufacturers polled by LTCB said they intended to cut outlays by an average 3.3 per cent this year but by a sharper 8.2 per cent in the 1995 fiscal year. This largely reflected the contraction of old industries such as steelmaking and pulp and paper. Both banks identified a revival in expenditure by the automotive and electric machinery sectors, but in each case commitments showed signs of tapering off after this year. Electronics producers are benefiting from strong world demand for semiconductors and liquid crystal displays, while car makers began their capital investment cuts earlier than most. In the service sector, excluding electric power and leasing companies, the LTCB showed cuts in investment of 8.2 per cent this year moderating to 6 per cent in the following term. Overall, the bank said that 'unlike last year, which was marked by consistent reductions, investment has clearly begun to recover in some industries and stopped declining in others'. It also said the yen value of domestic investment plans had been held down by cheaper raw materials and land. Reflecting wary consumer sentiment, meanwhile, nationwide department store data for July yesterday showed a 1.8 per cent year-on-year decline, the 29th successive monthly fall. But the Japan Department Stores Association said less lavish corporate gift purchases were partly to blame. Clothing sales, up 0.7 per cent, showed their first rise in two years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan has said  that his party will get at least 15 million votes and 1,000  mayoral positions in the 27 March local elections.    Addressing crowds in Karaman, Erbakan said that the country  has been going through a bitter experiment over the past 50  years and now wants to return to a national party. Nobody can  prevent us from coming to power, he said, or from establishing a  great Turkey.    Erbakan alleged that certain circles are nervous because the  Prosperity Party will come to power soon. Our correspondent  Omer Kebapcioglu reports that Erbakan said: Those circles are  those who brought the country to the brink of collapse with  their inefficiency.    Addressing a ceremony in Konya, Erbakan recalled that the  Prosperity Party was in power for four years as the partner of a  coalition. He added: We carried out the great leap of heavy  industry. We raised wheat production from 10 million tonnes to  18 million tonnes. We raised meat production from 125,000  tonnes to 625,000 tonnes. We set up factories in all corners of  the country. That is what the Prosperity Party did. We did not  take a single cent in foreign loans in four years. We did not  raise taxes by a single kurus. We kept the value of our money  stable by keeping it at 16.5 Turkish lira per U.S. dollar.  Naturally, we pursued a dignified foreign policy. When the  United States placed an arms embargo on our peace operation in  Cyprus, we closed down its bases. Therefore, we manufactured our  own weapons. That is what the Prosperity Party did, and that is  what it will do.</p>

A group of 300 aged 13 to 17 were first interviewed in the spring about their expectations after the Conservative election victory. This month a follow-up study showed that 40 per cent of the group had seen redundancy affect their family or friends. In 10 per cent of cases their fathers had been made redundant.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interviews with NPC deputies and CPPCC members by </F> correspondents Wen Baowei and Ma Lin in Beijing; date not given  -- from the "Special Program on NPC-CPPCC Sessions"]    [Text] Listeners, New China has made brilliant  achievements in education since its establishment more than 40  years ago. Particularly in the last 15 years since China's  reform and opening up, as educational reform unfolds gradually,  all types of educational undertakings at different levels have  developed rapidly. Primary education has become virtually  universal in over 90 percent of the country's populated areas.  Today, nine-year compulsory education is being implemented step  by step in a well-planned way.    China's vocational education has also developed rapidly in  the past few years. Total enrollment in vocational schools at  the senior middle school level has exceeded that at regular  senior middle schools. The unitary nature of China's secondary  educational structure has also undergone major changes.    China's higher education has also developed at an  accelerated  pace. According to statistics, the number of post-graduate  students reached 110,000 last year. The number of regular and  special program students at regular colleges totaled more than  2.5 million, while the number of regular and special program  students at adult schools of higher learning reached 1.9  million. Both numbers were the highest in history. A  comprehensive higher education system incorporating essentially  all kinds of disciplines at different levels has basically taken  shape.    China's legislative work has also made heartening progress.  It has promulgated, one after another, a law of compulsory  education, a law on teaching, and many other laws. In addition,  it has also promulgated regulations and decrees related to  policy implementation. Thus, China has gradually entered the  path of managing education according to the law.    China's education has truly brought forth noticeable  achievements. However, it should also be recognized that China,  a fairly poor and large country, faces numerous problems and  difficulties on its way to making its education successful. The  tasks are also enormous.    Despite the many problems facing China's education, there is  still a way to make it successful. Exactly as Premier Li Peng  said in his report on government work, we must acquire a  long-term perspective and a sense of urgency toward education  and give strategic consideration to developing education on a  priority basis. We must recognize the importance of education  from the perspective of modernizing our country. Particularly,  we must promote education in a concrete way.    During the National People's Congress [NPC] and Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] sessions,  deputies and CPPCC members gave their very useful views and made  good suggestions on reforming and developing China's education.  In an interview with station reporter Wen Baowei, Zhang  Tianbao, CPPCC member and vice minister of the State Education  Commission, talked about major problems in China's education  today.    [Begin recording] [Zhang] I think one of the problems is  that the pace of reform on China's education front cannot keep  up with the general situation of China's reform to establish a  socialist market economy. This is a fairly serious problem.  The second problem concerns practical issues. There are three  major issues here. One is the lack of investment in education.  This is a fairly difficult problem to tackle. We hope to  resolve it gradually. Teachers' pay and benefits will improve  considerably in the wake of ongoing wage reform. However, their  pay and benefits, especially the pay and benefits of primary and  middle school teachers, cannot be expected to reach the  standards set in the Teachers' Law before our economy develops.  The third issue concerns teachers' housing, mainly urban  teachers' housing. The situation of teachers' housing in rural  areas is a little bit better. They do not need much investment  from the state, as they have their own houses. In urban areas,  although there has been great improvement in recent years,  teachers' housing is still a major problem.    [Wen] Specifically, what important tasks does the State  Education Commission plan to accomplish in 1994?    [Zhang] The State Education Commission's central task is to  further implement China's Education Reform and Development  Program and the Teachers' Law. It will focus on achieving two  goals for all types of education at all levels: basically making  nine-year compulsory education universal and basically  eradicating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people.  These two goals will be at the heart of our work. As far as  reform is concerned, the focus is on the structural reform of  our higher education, including reform of the management  structure, the enrollment system, the employment system for  college graduates, the ideology for education, the contents of  teaching, and the establishment of special fields of study. The  main emphasis of our reform is to make education serve the needs  of society under the conditions of a socialist market economy.  [end recording]    [Wen] (Chen Yiliang), NPC deputy and assistant principal of  the Fuzhou First Middle School, said:    [Begin recording] [(Chen)] The Teachers' Law was promulgated  last year, and took effect on 1 January 1994. The broad masses  of teachers place great hopes on the implementation of the law.  The Fujian delegation was the first to bring forward a motion  on a law for teaching. I was the one who made the motion at  that time. Everyone hopes that the Teachers' Law can be truly  implemented, that more discussions will be held on education  during the current NPC session, and that the present government  will be able to adopt some practical and effective measures, to  speed up the pace of educational reform, to conscientiously  increase input into education, to give full play to the role of  teachers, to improve pay and work conditions for teachers, and  to bring about a good social climate of showing respect for  teachers and attaching importance to education. This is also a  focal point of current problems existing in our education. [end  recording]    [Wen] As a socialist market economy develops in depth, China  badly needs a large number of laborers to be engaged in  operation and services in the forefront of production, in  addition to various professional technicians. All these  personnel should undergo strict vocational training to meet the  qualifications of different trades and professions. What is the  present situation of vocational education in China? Station  correspondent (Zhang Xiangyuan) interviewed Comrade Wang Mingda,  member of the CPPCC National Committee and vice minister of the  State Education Commission on the issue. He said:    [Begin recording] [Wang] After China implemented reform and  opened its doors to the outside world, a very important aspect  of China's educational reform was to reform secondary school  education and to vigorously develop vocational and technical  education. In 1980, the number of students enrolled by  vocational senior middle schools accounted for only 11.49  percent of the total number of students enrolled by all senior  middle schools; the ratio reached 57.95 percent in 1993. Thus,  we have fulfilled the ratio of 1:1 between the number of  students enrolled by vocational senior middle schools and the  number of students enrolled by ordinary senior middle schools  proposed by the CPC Central Committee in its resolution on  reform of the education system adopted in 1985. [end recording]    [Ma Lin] In fact, China conducted vocational education as  early as 1917. Vocational education was conducted at the  Zhonghua Jiaoyu She [China Vocational Education Society],  initiated by such famous educators as Cai Yuanpei and Liang  Qichao. In view of the fact that education was seriously  divorced from social life at that time, they said one of the  purposes of running the society was to provide job opportunities  for the unemployed and to make the employed work in contentment.  Today, the Zhonghua Jiaoyu She has expanded to a nationwide  organization for vocational education. It has set up 50 schools  offering vocational education. Among them are three vocational  universities that boast more than 30,000 undergraduates in all.    [Wen] Member Wang Mingda said the objective of China's  development of vocational education at secondary schools is to  make the number of students attending vocational schools account  for approximately 60 percent of the total number of secondary  school undergraduates by the end of the century.    [Begin recording] [Wang] To achieve the objective, we must  further increase the number of students and, above all, improve  the quality of vocational education. [end recording]    [Ma Lin] At last, Member Wang Mingda said: The  comparatively conspicuous problems existing in current  vocational education include finding the means to enhance the  level of teaching and management, a shortage of funds, and a  need to build more vocational education centers. It is  necessary to bring vocational and technical education into line  with a legal system through legislation. A law on vocational  and technical education has been incorporated into the NPC  Standing Committee's plan for legislation in the next five years.    [Wen] Qu Qinyue, NPC deputy, president of the Nanjing  University, and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,  expressed his views on the guiding ideology for running a school  at colleges and universities in the course of reform and opening  up. He said:    [Begin recording] [Qu] I think it is necessary for  universities to grasp two links at the same time. They must  attach equal importance to enhancing academic levels and, at the  same time, making concrete and important contributions to  national economic construction and social development. These  two links apply to the guiding ideology for running a school.  Now, I think, it seems that two tendencies exist in  universities in the course of reform. One tendency attaches  more importance to the academic level of universities to the  neglect of making very good contributions to the nation's  economic and social development. In particular, the  universities have run their schools in a way that closes their  doors, instead of opening their doors, to the public amid the  implementation of reform in the past few years. Therefore, they  took into consideration their academic level only and did not  take into consideration social needs. After the implementation  of reform, due to difficulties related to policies, confusion  over education policy recently encouraged universities to move  to the other side of the two links of running a school, namely,  divorcing themselves from society. They attached undue  importance to maintaining [words indistinct] to the neglect of  enhancing the level of a university, which is the most important  task. [end recording]    [Ma Lin] Listeners and friends, accelerating the development  of education in regions inhabited by minority nationalities has  a direct bearing on the regions' economic development.  Therefore, it is an even more urgent task. When (Qiang Erba  Douji Ouzhou), member of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee and  vice chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Education  Commission, spoke of the relationship between economic  development and education, he said:    [Begin recording, (Qiang), in Tibetan fading into Ma Lin  translation into Mandarin] Tibet is economically backward.  Believing that development is sufficient as long as enough food  is provided for the people, Tibet set the economy against  education for a certain period of time in the past. The focus  of our work shifted to the central task of economic construction  after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee. We must promote the development of science and  technology before we can promote economic development.  Education is the foundation. While endeavoring to promote  economic development, we incorporated education into our plan.  Tibet has enjoyed a very rapid development of education in  recent years. Last year, the autonomous regional party  committee and the autonomous regional government specially held  the fourth education work conference, and drew up a magnificent  plan. It aims at increasing the percentage of children of  school age attending schools from the current 63 percent to over  80 percent by the year 2000. In addition, the work conference  also mapped out two plans. They required that every county have  a middle school and every township a primary school run by  herdsmen. According to the plans, Tibet only has to base itself  on areas inside its territory in its efforts to educate trained  personnel; meanwhile, continued efforts will be made to  successfully run classes in the hinterland for children of  Tibetan nationality. At present, there are 11,000 plus Tibetan  students studying in the hinterland. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Mixed signals on state of the economy Further contradictory data about the state of the Japanese economy emerged yesterday. Although an index used to measure the economic outlook for the next six months was up, unemployment rose sharply and sales in large stores fell. The latest report from the Economic Planning Agency showed the diffusion index of economic indicators had risen to 60 in January, moving solidly above the 50 mark, the dividing line between growth and contraction. The index can be unreliable, since it indicated an economic recovery during the first four months of 1993 which did not occur. Nevertheless, housing loans increased sharply during February, as home buyers took advantage of low interest rates. The number of loan applications for owner-occupied homes rose 65.9 per cent compared with last February, the Housing Loan Corporation said. The pick-up in housing loans fed through to a small increase in sales of furniture and household electrical goods at large retailers. But overall sales at such outlets dropped 2.8 per cent in February compared with the same period last year, according to the international trade and industry ministry. This was the 21st month retail sales fell, and throws some doubt on the likelihood of a consumer-led recovery. Any upturn in the economy has yet to feed through to the jobs market. The government yesterday said the unemployment rate last month had risen 0.2 percentage points to 2.9 per cent compared with January. The rate was the highest since June 1987, while unemployment among women rose steeply to reach an all-time high of 3.2 per cent. Economists said employment normally lagged behind an economic recovery, but the sharp rise in unemployment was a disappointment after it had fallen in January for the first time in 22 months. The number of people without jobs reached 1.94m in February, an increase of 370,000 (23.6 per cent), compared with the same month last year. Much of the fall was caused by a drop in manufacturing jobs, down 480,000 since last year. A rise in the number employed in construction and services failed to offset the decline. The continuing weakness of the jobs market was confirmed by a fall in the ratio of employment available to job seekers, which dropped 0.02 percentage points to 0.65. The rate peaked in March 1991 at 1.45. The number of jobs available fell 1.5 per cent; the number of applicants rose 2 per cent.</p>

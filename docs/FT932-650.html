			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Babangida move prompts protests OPPOSITION to a call by President Ibrahim Babangida for a fresh presidential election mounted yesterday amid continuing confusion about Nigeria's political direction. Gen Babangida on Saturday confirmed the annulment of the June 12 poll and ordered a rerun, while promising to keep to the scheduled handover to civilian rule on August 27. According to new conditions he laid down, both Mr Moshood Abiola, leader of the Social Democratic party (SDP) and winner of the aborted poll, and his rival, Mr Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention (NRC), would be ineligible to stand. He said presidential candidates have to have been members of their party for at a least a year - which disqualifies Mr Abiola  -and over 50, which rules out Mr Tofa, who is 45. Moroccan opposition groups made strong gains at the expense of the five centrist parties in the first phase of parliamentary elections, Reuter reports from Rabat. However, no party won an outright victory.</p>

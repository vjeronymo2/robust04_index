			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: No early restart at Panguna planned CRA, the Australian mining company in which Britain's RTZ holds a 49 per cent stake, yesterday said it would need to see permanent stability on the strife-torn Pacific island of Bougainville before it would consider reopening the controversial Panguna copper mine there. 'Until we've got political stability on the island . . . and also a decision by the locals to support the reopening of the mine we won't be going back,' the company said. However, CRA's caution did not prevent a surge in the shares of Bougainville Copper which, though controlled by CRA with a 53.6 per cent stake, is also quoted separately on the Australian stock exchange. When trading opened, they hit ADollars 1.25, before dropping back for a gain of 12 cents at ADollars 1.18. Speculation about the re-opening of the mine follows a ceasefire agreement reached over the weekend between the Papua New Guinea government, which controls Bougainville, and the Bougainville Revolutionary Army, which represents the demands of locals who want to secede from PNG. The PNG government and the BRA have been fighting a six-year guerrilla war on the island, and hundreds of people are estimated to have been killed. The mine, operated by CRA, was a catalyst for the outbreak of the hostilities back in the late 1980s. At one stage, Panguna provided about 30 per cent of PNG's export revenues and accounted for 10 per cent of the nation's gross domestic product. However, locals claimed that they had been inadequately compensated for allowing the mine to be built, and that income was flowing out of Bougainville, into the coffers of CRA and the PNG government. The mine was mothballed in 1989.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Leading Article: The Atlantic looks wider PRESIDENT BILL Clinton and his secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, are not happy about the way their foreign policy is going. That is understandable. They have discovered, like the leaders of almost every great power in history, that great power status does not automatically give you control of small crises. In Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti they have been defied by people with only a tiny fraction of the resources they have at their disposal, but who are (partly for that very reason) much more single-minded and less scrupulous than their adversary about the use to which resources are put. In the absence of really big crises, small ones loom large. None of these is entirely or even mainly of Mr Clinton's making. None in itself constitutes a global problem, though all in their different ways are very unpleasant, and have some serious implications for other countries in their respective regions. It would have been difficult for any US administration to ignore them, and almost any US administration would have tried to tackle them, as Mr Clinton has, with a mix of diplomacy and force, sharing the burden as far as possible with like-minded and interested partners under the aegis of the UN and other international organisations. Having run into difficulties with all three, Mr Clinton and Mr Christopher have at least had the honesty to admit their mistakes. They would not be politicians, indeed they would hardly be human, if they did not point to the mistakes made by others as well. In Somalia, it is mainly the UN and its unfortunate secretary-general that are taking the rap. In Bosnia, it is the US's European allies, and especially the UK. They richly deserve it, and would be ill advised to reply in kind. If blame for the Bosnian tragedy must be apportioned, there is plenty to go round, but Europe can hardly avoid the lion's share. It is after all happening in Europe, on the very borders of the EC, and the EC in the early stages made much of its peacemaking role. Within the EC, Britain commandeered the lead, putting in two former foreign secretaries as successive chairmen of the peace conference. It also sent troops, whose presence it has repeatedly used as an argument to block US initiatives and to brush aside US criticisms. If the troops had actually stopped the fighting or protected the victims, that might be fair enough. Instead they have had to watch while the proclaimed will of the international community, and all the most basic human rights, have been repeatedly violated on a large scale. That is still happening, and Britain along with other European countries has clearly run out of ideas on what to do about it. American ideas might not have worked any better, but American frustration that they have not been tried is entirely understandable. The tragedy is by no means over. European powers should be looking urgently for new ways of dealing with it. They should listen with greater humility to American views. And they should be concerned about the wider damage the affair is doing to the transatlantic relationship. The problems of the former Yugoslavia are ones which 'Europe', if it existed, might reasonably be expected to handle on its own. Other issues are genuinely insoluble without American commitment and co-operation - the most obvious being the management of relations with an increasingly volatile Russia, the conclusion of negotiations on a new framework for international trade, and the redefinition of the role of the Atlantic alliance itself, particularly in relation to the new security problems which have arisen in central and eastern Europe. In their frustration, Mr Clinton and Mr Christopher let slip something that careful observers of the US have realised for some time: that relations with Asia and the Pacific are now more important to it than relations with Europe. Getting the American public to focus on global problems at all is increasingly difficult, and economic concerns now tend to loom larger than military ones. Europe needs to work harder both on solving its own problems and on engaging US interest in those that need it. It can no longer take US interest for granted.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Improved trading conditions help Stakis advance to Pounds 6.6m Stakis, the hotels and casinos group, almost trebled pre-tax profits in the six months to April 3, reflecting slightly improved trading conditions, increased revenue from acquisitions and a substantial drop in interest payments. Pre-tax profit was Pounds 6.6m for a 26 week period, compared with Pounds 2.3m for the equivalent 27 weeks restated to reflect the FRS 5 accounting standard on off-balance sheet financing. Sir Lewis Robertson, who became chairman in 1991 after the Glasgow-based company got into difficulties following poorly managed expansion, is to retire next March and hand over to Mr Richard Cole-Hamilton, deputy chairman and former chief executive of the Clydesdale Bank. Operating profit from the group's 33 hotels rose 15 per cent to Pounds 9.91m (Pounds 8.6m) and operating profit from the 21 casinos was up 25 per cent at Pounds 6.77m (Pounds 5.4m). Mr David Michels, chief executive, said the average room rate had risen by 3 per cent and occupancy rose from 62.6 per cent to 63.3 per cent in the low season. The casinos, boosted by three acquisitions last year, showed a rise in the gaming win percentage from 17.8 per cent to 18.7 per cent. Net interest charges fell from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 7.31m reflecting lower debt after the Pounds 28m rights issue in 1993 and the sale of the healthcare division. Group overheads were static at Pounds 2.4m. Stakis raised a further Pounds 67m from a 1-for-4 rights issue in March and together with new banking arrangements negotiated with four banks now has about Pounds 100m to spend on purchasing new hotels and casinos. It bought two hotels in March and last month acquired the Avisford hotel near Arundel, Sussex, for Pounds 7.1m. It expects to conclude two more purchases in the next eight weeks. Earnings per share were 1.58p (0.66p) and the interim dividend goes up to 0.65p (0.45p).</p>

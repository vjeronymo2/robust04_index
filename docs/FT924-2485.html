			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Brussels takes embarrassed look at UK barriers to porn WITH LESS than three weeks to go until the single European market is born, EC Commission officials are being obliged to take an interest in British pornography. Brussels has received a number of inquiries from 'small UK importers', questioning whether British customs authorities have the right to impound certain magazines and videos. The importers say the pornography - mainly Dutch - is no worse than items made in Britain and sold as sex education videos and manuals in High Street newsagents and bookshops. Brussels officials will have to decide whether the UK is discriminating against foreign pornography and whether the British authorities should be able to continue to control the import of videos, magazines and sex aids at the border after January 1. If the importers' claim can be proved, then Britain is almost certainly breaking EC law. So far there has been no formal complaint and no inquiry has been opened. What's more, the Commission has no objection to EC countries outlawing certain types of pornography on moral grounds, and certainly does not want to be cast as the arbiter of decency in such a case. A much higher priority is being given to the question of border controls on pornography, which, like all frontier checks on goods, should disappear on January 1. On Thursday, Britain will chair the final meeting of internal market ministers before declaring Europe open for business. One of the UK's priorities will be the abolition of systematic frontier controls on goods. As one British official pointed out yesterday, 'removal of border controls won't mean that Dutch porn can flood into the UK'. Instead, checks will be based on intelligence information. But, as Commission officials point out, if the checks are too heavy - and carried out exclusively at border crossings - Britain may find itself in front of the European Court for breaking single market rules on the free movement of goods.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- In the fight against right-wing  extremism in Germany Interior Minister Manfred Kanther  (Christian Democratic Union) intends to take greater action also  against denials of the Third Reich's responsibility for the war  and its atrocities. Kanther underlined today, at the 5th  German-Jewish dialogue in Koenigswinter near Bonn, that those  "suppressing" and "playing down" the Holocaust have to be "put  in their place." The state must not leave it only to "major  films and television series" to inform people and make them  aware of German history.    The interior minister pointed out that the right-wing  extremists in Germany are increasingly stirring up antisemitism  and revisionism. Their agitation is having an effect. For  example, instances of cemeteries being desecrated are  continuing. Attacks on people motivated by anti-Semitism are  also a cause for concern.    Kanther added that 2,232 right-wing extremist acts of  violence were committed last year alone. Of these, 1,609 were  xenophobic and 72 antisemitic. Overall, the number of  antisemitic offenses rose from 562 in 1992 to 656 in 1993.  Initial findings show that this trend is continuing in 1994,  too. Greater efforts will therefore have to be made to combat  this. Overall there are potentially about 8,000 people who  "openly admit to being antisemitic".    The interior minister announced that the fight against  right-wing extremism will be intensified further. The state and  society have to take all possible steps against these "sometimes  inhumane acts", specifically through "repressive and preventive  measures." Possible gaps in the law have to be closed.    Kanther stressed that the Office for the Protection of the  Constitution is currently conducting "extensive" investigations  into the right-wing extremist republicans. Any further action  against this party will depend on the results. At any event,  incorrigible agitation and violence have to be "rigorously  banned and punished under the law."</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACK MONDAY MEMORIES HELP TO AVERT PANIC  </P> <P> They sported thick skins and took deep breaths, chomped antacid tablets and  blamed it on the date: Friday the 13th. But above all, they managed to make it  through the second stock market crash in as many years without panic.  </P> <P> For when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190.58 points Friday  afternoon, Southland investors and brokers were fortified by experience gained  from Black Monday -- Oct. 19, 1987.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to jump off the 26th floor of the One Wilshire Building,"  quipped Carl Shusterman, an immigration lawyer whose few over-the-counter  stocks lost little ground.  </P> <P> "None of our clients are panicking," said Jeffrey Kilpatrick, president of  Newport Securities in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> "People should remember that, in retrospect, the best thing anyone did in that  situation was buy," Kilpatrick said of 1987. "The investors who sold lost it  all, and those who did nothing didn't gain much. Situations like this create  more opportunity than problems."  </P> <P> The plunge was reminiscent of another Bad Friday, this one Oct. 16, 1987. That  day, the stock market dropped more than 100 points, rattling investors over a  tense weekend and setting the market up for its 508-point fall three days  later.  </P> <P> Brokerage houses throughout the Los Angeles Basin reported increased business  and heavier-than-usual telephone traffic Friday. But, because the fall began  late in the trading day, many investors did not hear the news until after the  stock market closed.  </P> <P> Business was up only about 10% compared to a normal Friday at Fidelity  Investments, a Boston-based mutual fund manager and discount brokerage. And the  mood among investors? Much less panicky than two years ago, said Neal Litvack,  vice president of marketing, in a telephone interview from Boston.  </P> <P> "The tone of the people calling is much less of a knee-jerk reaction," he said.  "People are feeling that they've been there before. People are feeling OK"  because they know the market recovered from its last bruising.  </P> <P> To handle customer concern, Fidelity is opening its 53 branch offices -- four  of which are in Southern California -- on Saturday and is putting extra  employees on its 24-hour phone banks.  </P> <P> Officials at the Pacific Stock Exchange in downtown Los Angeles said trading  volume was not as heavy as it was on the Black Monday. Still, shocked and  exhausted traders trudged off the floor of the exchange comparing Friday's  nearly 200-point decline to the stock market crash of 1987.  </P> <P> "It was absolutely crazy in there, just like the crash two years ago," said  Doug Clark, an equity trader with Legend Securities. "I started out the day  with a whole pack of Rolaids, now I'm down to one."  </P> <P> Traders say they began to sense the change shortly before noon, when they were  deluged with wave upon wave of selling orders stemming from the surprise news  of financing problems connected with the $6.75-billion buyout of UAL Corp.  </P> <P> "The government released inflation figures this morning, and they didn't seem  particularly bad," said David Barry, a securities trader. "But when that UAL  deal ran into trouble, we went into a self-perpetuating slide."  </P> <P> Even so, officials at the Pacific Exchange say orders were executed more  efficiently than during the October crash two years ago. And they said the  experience of the 1987 stock market tumble helped prevent the spread of a  general market panic.  </P> <P> "It went a lot smoother this time," said Keith Zambelich, a quality assurance  analyst at the Pacific Exchange. "We really learned a lot from Black Monday."  </P> <P> David Wikle, a trader with Paine Webber, was among those least rattled by  developments on Friday: "The market's got a long way to fall before it gets  really bad."  </P> <P> Doron Kochavi was in the research room at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los  Angeles, writing a speech with the working title of "Ten Best Ways to Invest in  the 1990s." It was just after noon, and quote machines started showing "major  pressure on the sell side," he said.  </P> <P> Kochavi is senior vice president for investments at Wedbush, and when the  market closed, he jumped on a conference call with technician David Holt, to  figure out what happened. Their conclusion: 1989 was vastly different than  1987.  </P> <P> "There was no panic selling at all," Kochavi said. "We immediately got on the  phone and faxed information to our clients to calm down and hold their hands. I  saw it as a great opportunity to position myself to do some buying, so I was  very much involved in trying to get some terrific bargains."  </P> <P> The drop was a surprise for Steve Lauck, manager for Ashfield &amp; Co., a San  Francisco investment firm for pension funds and wealthy individuals. Still,  Lauck said, the market's weakness is only temporary.  </P> <P> "We have seen this before," Lauck said. "Once the selling starts, it  intensifies. It is clearly a shakeout in the junk bond market and mergers  financed by junk. But we view it as a short-term phenomenon. The market is  fundamentally attractive."  </P> <P> Fears concerning the recent problems takeover targets have faced with obtaining  financing, including through the junk bond market, touched off a ripple effect  across a broad range of stocks, whose prices also fell.  </P> <P> "Nobody committed suicide, but I don't think today's the day," said Marilyn  Cohen, president of Capital Insight Brokerage in Beverly Hills. "I think  Monday's the day."  </P> <P> Investors who were crushed in the 1987 crash have rebounded in the ensuing two  years and are investing again, Cohen said. If Friday's damage expands into  Monday, "it's really going to take a whole generation of investors out of the  market."  </P> <P> "They were burned once, and after a second time, it's 'forget it,' " she said.  </P> <P> Mel Knee, a Sherman Oaks dealer in contemporary art, said he spent Friday  afternoon putting in an order to "sell everything" when the market opens on  Monday. Knee had his money invested largely in Sotheby's, the art auction  house, and a computer company called Safeguard Scientific.  </P> <P> If he can sell at today's closing prices, Knee's portfolio will still have  gained 13% to 14% during the year. And once he's out of the market, he said,  he'll be hoping the drop continues so he can buy stocks at bargain prices at a  later date.  </P> <P> Still, Knee said, he has no one to blame but himself for his losses. Early  Friday morning he had an "uneasy feeling" that he wished he'd heeded: "It's  Friday the 13th," he said, "and everything's starting to get gray."  </P> <P> Leonard Gumport, a Los Angeles bankruptcy attorney said: "I'm glad I don't own  any stock." Gumport grinned and opened his briefcase to reveal a book entitled  "Boom &amp; Bust."  </P> <P> "It was bound to happen," he said.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Nancy Rivera Brooks, John O'Dell, John Medearis, Jesus  Sanchez, Jim Schachter, Jube Shiver Jr., Ralph Vartabedian and Teresa Watanabe  contributed to this story.  </P></p>

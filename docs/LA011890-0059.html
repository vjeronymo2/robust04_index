			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY CELEBRATES KING'S BIRTHDAY, ITS DIVERSITY  </P> <P> The spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. descended on Parcher Plaza -- the heart of  civic Glendale -- for the first time Monday, as about 80 city officials and  employees celebrated the 61st birthday of the slain civil rights leader with an  outdoor party.  </P> <P> The Rev. David Scott of the North Glendale United Methodist Church delivered a  speech, calling for continued progress toward racial unity and citing King's  famous "I Have a Dream" address.  </P> <P> The Glendale High School Chamber Choir opened the festivities with a soulful  rendition of the national anthem and entertained the crowd after the speech.  Volunteers served free turkey and ham sandwiches and potato and macaroni salad,  and Mayor Jerold Milner read a proclamation.  </P> <P> In many respects, the celebration mirrored hundreds of King festivities around  the country. But for at least one Glendale minority employee, it was a special  day.  </P> <P> "Twenty years ago it was uncomfortable for minorities to come into this city at  any time, particularly in the evenings," said Glendale Community Relations  Coordinator Rick Reyes, who has worked for the city for 29 years.  </P> <P> "Even today there are pockets of resistance, but the attitudes are slowly  changing."  </P> <P> As recently as three years ago, a black delicatessen owner left town after  attacks by vandals who repeatedly smeared her store with racist graffiti.  </P> <P> In past years, the city quietly recognized King's day with a proclamation and a  lunchtime movie in the basement of city hall.  </P></p>

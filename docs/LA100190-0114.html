			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YUGOSLAV'S SERBS CLAIM AUTONOMY, SEAL OFF AREA  </P> <P> Minority Serbs in Croatia today proclaimed autonomy within the republic,  sealing off roads and railways in defiance of Croatian authorities.  </P> <P> "The Serbian people must use all means to resist the terror of the fascist  (Croatian) government and to protect its human dignity and civil and national  rights," the Serbian National Council said in a statement carried by Tanjug  news agency.  </P> <P> The council, an unofficial body claiming to represent Serbs in Croatia, said  the declaration was based on the results of an August referendum that showed an  almost unanimous vote for limited self-government. Croatian authorities  declared the referendum illegal, but it was held anyway.  </P> <P> Belgrade radio reported barricades were set up early today across roads and  railway lines to Knin, a Serbian-dominated city of 10,000 people near the  Adriatic coast.  </P></p>

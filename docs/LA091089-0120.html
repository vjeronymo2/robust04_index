San Diego Trust &amp; Savings Bank is paying for the project as  part of its 100th anniversary celebration.  </P> <P> At the same time, storm drain reconstruction on the bridge's eastern side will  be funded by the city.  </P> <P> Construction work at both ends is expected to be completed before Oct. 15,  Stromberg said.  </P></p>

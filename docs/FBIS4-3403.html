This is a  gratifying step toward realizing the goal of equipping the Daya  Bay Nuclear Power Plant with homemade fuel.    As China's only nuclear power plant fuel package production  base, since its founding in 1991, the broad masses of workers,  cadres, engineers, and technicians in the Yibin Nuclear Fuel  Package Plant have labored under an excessive workload and,  after two years and seven months of efforts, the plant has  smoothly passed the following five rigorous tests one after  another: The test by the State Bureau for Nuclear Safety; the  simultaneous acceptance test of the three aspects of  environmental protection by the State Environmental Protection  Bureau; the project construction appraisal by French  specialists; the industrial approval test; and the product  approval test. The plant will begin to provide the No. 2  Generating Unit of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant with [words  indistinct].

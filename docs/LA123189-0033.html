			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: DIVORCE AND TAXES: HOW TO DEFER PROFITS FROM SALE OF  YOUR HOME  </P> <P> QUESTION: My soon-to-be-ex-wife and I are getting a divorce and selling our  home. We paid around $82,500 for it and should receive about $175,000 from its  sale. My questions concern how much tax we will owe on the sale, and if there  is any way we can avoid paying tax.  </P> <P> ANSWER: Presuming you and your ex-wife are dividing the sale of your former  principal residence equally and neither of you is 55 or older, you can each  qualify for 100% tax deferral profit if you each buy a qualifying replacement  principal residence. However, if only you or only your wife buys a replacement  home, then just that one spouse gets to defer tax on their share of the profit  and the other spouse must pay tax on their profit share.  </P> <P> When using the "roll-over residence replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code  1034, all that really matters is your net (adjusted) sales price.  </P> <P> As an illustration, let's presume your home sells for $175,000 after paying  sales costs, such as the realty sales commission. Dividing $175,000 by two  means that to defer tax on your half of the sales profit, you must buy a  replacement principal residence costing at least $87,500 within 24 months  before or after the sale.  </P> <P> Even if your ex-spouse doesn't buy a replacement home but you do, you can  qualify for tax deferral while your ex-wife pays tax on her profit share.  Please consult your tax adviser for full details.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  Telling the Truth About Time-Shares  </P> <P> Q: Several months ago, you said the big problem with time-shares was that there  is virtually no resale market. As the owner of a rather desirable Hawaiian  time-share, I fully agree. Yes, there are a few auctioneers, but they usually  sell time-shares at very distressed prices. Since you never seem to hold back  what you are thinking, what do you really think about time-shares?  </P> <P> A: Every time I answer a question about time-shares I receive incredible  pressure from those in the time-share industry who try to "re-educate" me. I  have had to ask some of them not to contact me further because they have worn  out their welcome.  </P> <P> As I've said before, the time-share developers earn huge profits. They are  selling future vacations, which is fine. But nobody should invest money they  ever want to see again. The reason is that it is almost impossible to get out  of a time-share purchase for the amount paid. Even the time-share promoters  agree.  </P> <P> I do not like time-shares and do not recommend them. Time-shares are not real  estate investments. Rather, they are purchases of future vacations. The very  limited resale market that exists sells these time-shares at distress prices.  Buying a time-share in a desirable complex in the resale market from a  distressed seller can be a great place to buy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bankruptcy Filing No Foreclosure Protection  </P> <P> Q: Due to unemployment and illness, I have been unable to make my mortgage  payments. Last February, the mortgage company started foreclosure. In March I  filed bankruptcy to stop the foreclosure. But in May the bankruptcy judge said  the mortgage company could proceed to foreclose. Last month, they sold my house  at auction and I am now being evicted by the buyer. I thought filing bankruptcy  stopped them from foreclosing. How can this happen to me?  </P> <P> A: Filing bankruptcy only delays real estate foreclosure. If you don't work out  a satisfactory mortgage payment plan, the mortgage lender can get the automatic  stay against foreclosure lifted. That is apparently what happened.  </P> <P> Since the foreclosure sale was approved by the bankruptcy court when the  automatic stay was removed, unless the sale was incorrectly handled, it appears  you have no further rights in your home. Please consult a real estate attorney  for further details.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Promising Cure for 'Buyer's Remorse'  </P> <P> Q: My husband and I signed a contract to buy a home. The realty agent arranged  what, I admit, is a terrific fixed-rate mortgage. But I'm not sure about my  job, as I've heard the hospital where I work as a nurse might be cutting back.  Fortunately, my husband owns his company and business is booming. But without  my paycheck, I'm not sure we can afford this house. How can we get out of our  purchase contract, as I am scared we won't be able to afford the payments?  </P> <P> A: It sounds like you have a very serious case of "buyer's remorse." The best  remedy for this non-fatal disease is to consider the pros and cons of that  house you agreed to buy.  </P> <P> Please list all the advantages of buying, such as a home meeting the needs of  your family, in a desirable part of town, for a reasonable purchase price and  with favorable financing. I'm certain you can list other advantages.  </P> <P> Now try to think of any disadvantages. Perhaps a large mortgage payment, but  with a large itemized interest deduction on your tax returns. Maybe you won't  be able to make the mortgage payment if you lose your job. But I hear  registered nurses have no trouble finding jobs so, at the worst, you might be  out of work an hour or two.  </P> <P> If it is any comfort, most home buyers suffer the same buyer's remorse you are  encountering. I remember contracting this dread disease the first night I lay  awake in my new home worrying about how I would ever make the mortgage  payments. Fortunately, I made the next payment and all 132 payments since then.  </P> <P> Since then, my home has more than quadrupled in market value, has been a very  comfortable place to enjoy living and has provided some outstanding income tax  advantages, too. I'm certain your new home will be an equally profitable  investment once you get over your non-serious case of buyer's remorse.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Double Joint Tenancy in 2-Family Duplex  </P> <P> Q: You are not going to believe this, but my wife and I want to buy a  two-family duplex house with my in-laws. They are wonderful people who treat me  like a son. My wife and I have two children who get along great with their  grandparents. We found a huge two-family duplex house where my in-laws would  live in the two-bedroom unit and our family will live in the four-bedroom unit.  </P> <P> They will be making the down payment, and we have agreed to split the monthly  payment on a one-third, two-thirds basis. The problem is how to hold title. We  all want to own the property as joint tenants with right of survivorship. But  my wife thinks we should own half and her parents should own half, as joint  tenants. Can this be done?  </P> <P> A: Of course. Although you didn't indicate the ownership shares, I presume each  couple will own one-half the property. In other words, each couple can own  their half as joint tenants with right of survivorship. When one spouse dies,  the surviving spouse then owns that half as surviving joint tenant. In other  words, you will have a double joint tenancy in the two-family duplex. A real  estate attorney can prepare the deed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Risk of Buying a Home 'Subject to' Mortgage  </P> <P> Q: Almost six months ago, we bought our first home. I admit we were rather  uneducated and the sellers took advantage of us. However, the price was a good  deal so we really can't complain. But the problem is the mortgage. The seller  said we could "take over" the payments on their old mortgage. Not knowing any  better, we did so.  </P> <P> A few months ago we received a nasty letter from the lender stating that if we  did not agree to raise the loan's interest rate from 8.75% to 10%, the lender  would call the loan. When I contacted the sellers, they said the lender told  them we could take over the loan. The lender denies any such statement. If the  interest rate is increased, our monthly payment will go up substantially. What  should we do?  </P> <P> A: Rather than assuming the existing mortgage, it appears you bought the home  "subject to" the old loan. If it contains a due-on-sale clause, the lender is  entitled to call the loan if the property is transferred to new ownership.  However, if there is no due-on-sale clause or the lender told the seller it  could be assumed by a buyer, then the lender cannot call the loan or increase  your interest rate.  </P> <P> Your first step is to get a copy of the promissory note and mortgage. Then read  it to see if there is a due-on-sale clause. If not, the lender cannot call the  mortgage. If there is a due-on-sale clause, consult a real estate attorney  about negotiating with the lender and the seller. Incidentally, the seller may  still have liability on that mortgage if you default and the lender suffers a  foreclosure loss.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Amount of Earnest Money Is Disputed  </P> <P> Q: As a real estate agent, I find I must read your articles otherwise my buyers  and sellers tell me what you had to say and I appear to be ignorant. But I must  take issue with you about your suggestion that home buyers make as small an  earnest money deposit as the seller is willing to accept. That's baloney. As a  longtime realty agent, I know, as I'm certain you do, too, that the larger the  deposit, the greater the probability the buyer will complete the home purchase  as agreed. Don't you think it's time you change your thinking and tell buyers  to make earnest money deposits of at least 10% of the sales price?  </P> <P> A: Sorry, I can't agree. Yes, when I am a property seller I want a substantial  earnest money deposit. If I feel the buyer's deposit is inadequate, I can make  a larger deposit requirement part of my counteroffer.  </P> <P> However, when I am a buyer I want to make as small a deposit as possible, just  in case the seller can't or won't deliver the property on the terms agreed. I  want to tie up as little cash as possible until the sale is ready to close.  From your viewpoint as a realty agent, I fully understand why you want buyers  to make large earnest money deposits. However, we will have to agree to  disagree on this issue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Net Listings Can Be Troublesome, Illegal  </P> <P> Q: I want to net a specific amount for the sale of my land. However, I cannot  find a decent real estate agent who will take my listing. I know my land is not  easy to sell and want to give the agent maximum incentive. Why can't I find any  agent who will take my net listing?  </P> <P> A: Most real estate agents are aware of the pitfalls of net listings, which are  illegal in some states. As a property seller, you should be grateful the agents  you contacted wouldn't accept your net listing.  </P> <P> Problems can develop with net listings in several ways. If the agent obtains a  low offer below your net price, the agent might be tempted to lose that offer  and never deliver it to you because the agent would receive no sales  commission. However, if the agent obtains a purchase offer substantially above  your net price, you would feel the agent failed to inform you of the true value  of your property and you would probably insist the agent adjust the sales  commission.  </P></p>

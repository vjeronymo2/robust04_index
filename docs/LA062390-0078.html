			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORATORIUM IMPOSED ON DWP TOURS;  </P> <P> EXPENSES: BRADLEY SAYS FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY 'SHOULD BE OF PARAMOUNT  IMPORTANCE.' THE PROGRAM HAS COST NEARLY$1 MILLION IN THE PAST YEAR.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley on Friday imposed an immediate moratorium on a Department of  Water and Power tour program that has cost nearly $1 million in the past year.  </P> <P> With stiff budget restraints at other agencies and a costly water-rationing  plan under consideration at the DWP, Bradley said, "It is a time when fiscal  responsibility should be of paramount importance. . . . Exorbitant expenditures  undermine the public's confidence."  </P> <P> Bradley issued the order in response to a Times story Friday detailing a  $913,000 tour program in which legislators, business customers and department  executives received all-expenses-paid tours of DWP facilities throughout the  West. Department officials say the tours are necessary to update officials on  the utility's needs and plans.  </P> <P> In a letter to the DWP Board of Commissioners, Bradley ordered a report on the  necessity of such trips and added, "If some prove absolutely essential, I want  an outline as to the less expensive modes of travel, boarding and cost of  meals."  </P> <P> The mayor, in criticizing DWP expense policies for the second time in a week,  said, "Lodging in first-rate hotels and chartered flights clearly are an  unneeded perk."  </P> <P> On Monday, Bradley chastised the utility for chartering private jets when  cheaper commercial flights were available. The mayor demanded tough new travel  restrictions and ordered commissioners "to take immediate action to prevent a  recurrence" of controversial expenditures such as a $95-a-head meal for five  officials in Salt Lake City and a $2,800 charter jet flight that DWP General  Manager Norm Nichols took to Sacramento.  </P> <P> On Monday, Bradley said he wanted the Board of Commissioners to approve all  major travel expenditures in advance.  </P> <P> The mayor said that action, combined with the moratorium ordered Friday, "will  hopefully rebuild the confidence I fear has been eroded" at the giant  city-owned utility.  </P> <P> City Council members on Friday also were quick to react to reports of the DWP's  unusually extensive and costly tour program.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ruth Galanter filed a motion calling for a similar report on tour  expenditures. Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores suggested that money saved from  halting the program could be used to offset rate increases.  </P> <P> In her motion, Galanter said, "While trips to remote facilities can be a  valuable tool, expensive dinners and lavish accommodations do not necessarily  pay equivalent dividends." Galanter, who like most city elected officials has  attended DWP tours, said it was "very educational."  </P> <P> Flores also acknowledged that the tours were valuable but added, "Sometimes the  department becomes overzealous."  </P> <P> While supporting the mayor's call for a moratorium, she said, "It's a shame  that the mayor's office has not been aware (of the tour cost) and had to wait  for the newspapers to uncover it."  </P> <P> Rick Caruso, president of the DWP Board of Commissioners, said he would put the  mayor's demands on the board's next meeting agenda, but otherwise had no  comment on Bradley's action.  </P> <P> Earlier, Caruso said, "It's important for government officials, bankers and  environmental groups to see these places and understand what's going on and  what's involved in bringing water and power to Los Angeles."  </P> <P> DWP officials said that as a result of the mayor's order, all tours have been  cancelled, including two bus tours scheduled next week to the Owens Valley. One  tour was for a group of Los Angeles teachers and another for Museum of Science  and Industry docents.  </P> <P> "It's really a shame," said DWP spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen.  </P></p>

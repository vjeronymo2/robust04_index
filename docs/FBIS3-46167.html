In his  hour-long speech he mainly talked about domestic problems,  stressing health and security, the two key points.    President Jefferson, who was the pioneer in U.S.-style  democratic politics, once abolished the practice of personally  going to Congress to deliver an address; he held that it was a  kind of "British habit," which was reminiscent of the way in  which the British monarch speaks to the parliament at the  beginning of every legislative year. In 1913, President Wilson  restored the practice of going to Congress to deliver the  address, hoping that by making an open speech he could win the  support of the public to overcome obstruction from Congress.    Clinton's speech yesterday also put Congress in the position  of an imaginary enemy, while he himself emerged as a reformist,  who described Congress as a force obstructing reform. He pulled  out a pen, which he waved as he said that if the law adopted by  Congress could not guarantee a health program enjoyed by the  whole people, he could use the pen to sign a veto order.  <H5>  Taking Tough Measures To Fight Crimes </H5>   At the same time when Clinton raised the reformist banner,  he  also tried to avoid an excessively radical image. U.S.  political analysts commented that in his "State of the Union  Address," Clinton shifted attention to programs of the  middle-of-the-roaders and abandoned the left wing of the  Democrats to win the support of the middle class and even set  foot in areas traditionally guarded by the Republicans. For  example, the problem of law and order is one which has always  been emphasized by the Republicans. Clinton used a lot of time  in his address to claim that he would take tough measures to  fight crime, in contrast to the Democrats' constant advocacy  that criminals must be treated leniently. He even borrowed  jargon from baseball and said one "must be out after three  strikes," meaning that persons who have committed serious crimes  three times must be sentenced to life imprisonment.    He demanded, on the one hand, a reform of the health and  medical insurance system, so that it can benefit more the 37  million people who are currently not covered, and on the other  hand, he thought that it is necessary to encourage work and  employment, and that there should not be too much welfare; he  suggested that the time for claiming unemployment assistance  should not be more than two years, while retraining must be  given as a backup. All these are quite able to meet the values  of the middle class.  <H5>  Reform Launched Simultaneously on Two Fronts </H5>   In his "State of the Union Address," Clinton linked welfare  reform to health and medical reform, and this drew attention.  Before this, Clinton's draft on health reform was a 1,300-page  document, which involved a great many complicated arrangements,  and was strongly criticized by the Republicans and would  probably run into strong resistance in Congress. Some political  analysts thought that in order to win support for his draft of  health reform from a majority of congressmen, Clinton might  succumb to the pressure of congressmen in other areas, or even  China's most-favored-nation trading status would become a  trading condition in congressional politics. Now that Clinton  has added the welfare reform plan to his address, it would be  more difficult for the plan to pass in Congress.    There are also some people who hold that this is a kind of  strategy offered by the strategists in the White House, with the  purpose of deliberately allowing the health and welfare reform  plans to run into hindrance by Congress, so that they cannot be  adopted this summer, thus, in November when mid-term elections  are held, the Democrats would be able to push responsibility  onto the Republicans, and accuse them of ignoring public  interests, and by so doing they can win votes. Thus, the  problem may not have to be settled before June.</p>

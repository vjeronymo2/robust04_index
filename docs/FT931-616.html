			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Economics: Markets face surfeit of news from France, Germany and the US THIS week promises to be unusually busy for the time of the month. Financial markets will be keenly anticipating clarification of the new French government's policies as well as its membership following yesterday's second round of the National Assembly elections. In the US, a raft of statistics, culminating in Friday's non-farm payroll data for March, will give new insights into the strength of the US economic recovery and whether President Bill Clinton's deficit reduction plan has damaged consumer confidence. The German Bundesbank's decision-making central council holds a regular fortnightly meeting on Thursday. Its decision late last week to cut the interest rate on its three-day Treasury bill sharply to 7.5 per cent has revived hopes that it may trim its official rates further in response to signs of accelerating economic slowdown in Germany. Behind the scenes, senior officials in the foreign and finance ministries of the Group of Seven countries will be continuing urgent work on a support programme for the Russian economy. The possibility of new assistance for Russia will be raised in talks between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin in Vancouver next weekend. Meanwhile, rumbling trade disputes between the US and its European Community partners will be given a new airing in talks between Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and senior EC Commission officials in Brussels today and tomorrow. In Britain, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England governor, will be testifying on this month's Budget to the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee on Wednesday. This week will see the release of important economic statistics from Japan, Germany and, in particular, the US. Tomorrow's March consumer confidence index in the US will be closely watched for signs of further deterioration following the decline to 68.5 in February from 78.1 in December. February's US factory orders on Wednesday and the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index on Thursday will give an insight into the state of US manufacturing. But most attention will focus on the March employment data. Non-farm payrolls increased by an unexpectedly strong by 365,000 in February, the largest such rise since January 1989. Many analysts expect employment gains will have been much slower this month. Another unexpectedly strong rise would suggest that the economy continues to grow well and casts doubt on the need for the expansionary elements in President Clinton's economic policy. The main statistical releases and events are as follows. The figures in brackets are averages of what financial markets expect, according to MMS International, an economics consultancy.

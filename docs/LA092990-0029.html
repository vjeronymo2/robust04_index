			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CALARTS STUDENT, 21, HELD IN BURGLARY SPREE  </P> <P> A CalArts student wanted on charges of breaking into a safe in Michigan was  arrested in his dormitory room on the Valencia campus by investigators who also  found property from five Simi Valley burglaries, authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> Stuart Wesley Hicks, 21, was arrested Thursday night and was being held without  bail because of a warrant charging him with safe breaking and embezzlement in  Charlotte, Mich., officials said.  </P> <P> Hicks was arrested by members of a Sheriff's Department anti-burglary team  based in the Santa Clarita Valley. The deputies located Hicks with information  from Simi Valley police, who were investigating a series of commercial  burglaries.  </P> <P> Simi Valley Police Detective Christopher Ward said Hicks is believed to have  been involved in numerous burglaries in Los Angeles and Simi Valley. He said he  will ask the Ventura County district attorney to file five burglary charges  against Hicks stemming from break-ins at four restaurants and one motel in  which about $9,000 in cash and property were taken. Property from those  burglaries was found in Hicks' dorm room, Ward said.  </P> <P> Ward said Hicks enrolled at the school this year, but it was unknown what he  was studying because school officials declined to release information about  him.  </P> <P> He was identified as a burglary suspect last week when Simi Valley police  arrested 29-year-old Tambra Lipps as she was attempting to break into the Oak  Pit Restaurant in the 3200 block of Los Angeles Avenue, Ward said.  </P> <P> Lipps told police she had been taught how to break into businesses by Hicks,  whom she had met at a Simi Valley boarding house, Ward said. She allegedly told  police that Hicks was attending college in Valencia.  </P></p>

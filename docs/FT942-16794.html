			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Management: Revolution in toyland - William Dawkins reports on a US discount retailer's success in Japan US trade officials considering economic sanctions to blow open Japan's closed markets should reflect on the experience of Toys 'R' Us, the American discount toy retailer. Over the past two years, Toys 'R' Us has taken an independently estimated 4 to 5 per cent of Japan's Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.1bn) retail toy market, on which, to its managers' surprise, it is almost breaking even. It has, with a mixture of managerial nerve and political help from the US government, destroyed a small but symbolic part of Japan's costly multi-layered distribution system and been a leader in the price discounting now sweeping across Japanese toy retailing. Toys 'R' Us's experience has disproved the official US view that political pressure is the only way to make progress in the Japanese market - though it is useful - as well as challenged the belief of some European businesses that the best way in is to tip-toe across the threshold over many years. The US group has swiped market share from the department stores and small corner shops that dominate retailing by offering up to 20 per cent discounts  -admittedly helped by the dollar's fall against the yen - a wider product range and extras like parking, a luxury for most Japanese shoppers. Annual turnover per Toys 'R' Us store in Japan is Dollars 15m-Dollars 20m (Pounds 10m-Pounds 13.5m), roughly double the sales per store in the US and it expects its overall Japanese sales to double this year. 'We wanted to make a statement and capture the minds of consumers. We felt a modest entry would have been more hazardous to our health than a massive move,' says Larry Bouts, president of the US company's international division. He says Japan's recession has nurtured a fashion for value for money. Bouts' experiences have become a case study for other foreign retailers thinking of moving into Japan, like UK retailer Marks and Spencer, Eddie Bauer, a US retailer of outdoor lifestyle goods, and The Gap, a clothes store. Unsurprisingly, the US toy group met fierce opposition from small shopkeepers when it was planning its arrival in the late 1980s, but their political influence has waned with that of their political patrons in the Liberal Democratic Party, thrown out of power last year for the first time since 1955. The progress of deregulation over the past 10 years, while slow, meant Toys 'R' Us also had consent, if not support, from an unexpected quarter, the Tokyo government. Toys 'R' Us knew it had to take a bigger financial risk in Japan than in other foreign markets. It committed Dollars 100m to Japan in lease payments, stock, working capital and training, even before it opened its first store in late 1991. 'Several hundred million dollars' later, says Bouts, it has 16 stores stretching across regional Japan and plans to increase this to 24 this year, with an eventual goal of 100 stores. The decision to hit the market on such a big scale is in line with Toys 'R' Us's general approach. But Bouts felt it was especially right for Japan, a lesson of the 'only modest success' achieved there by Pepsico Foods, his former company. Very high turnover per store was needed to cover costs which are, generally, the highest Toys 'R' Us has encountered in any market. The only exception is debt, made cheap by Japan's low official interest rates. Bouts estimates that his Japanese prices are between 50-100 per cent higher than in the US. Even so, his Japanese profit margins are 'much lower' than the average for Toys 'R' Us's stores worldwide. But a high proportion of Toys 'R' Us's Japanese costs are fixed - rent, for example - so that further rises in sales should create sharp rises in profit. 'We keep adding to fixed costs at a declining rate as we achieve economies of scale . . . I have some warm feelings about our cost structure,' says Bouts. The other advantage of size is negotiating power, an important ingredient in Toys 'R' Us's success in the US and Europe. Three quarters of its Japanese stock is imported from the US, which gave the group enough volume to justify setting up its own direct import company, to deliver straight from the docks to its warehouses, the first foreign retailer to do this in Japan. Toys 'R' Us makes direct imports elsewhere in the world, but this was provocation to Japan's still powerful network of distributors. 'People said we could not do it, but we insisted we needed control over our distribution,' says Bouts. In a second challenge to Japan's cosy distribution cartels, Toys 'R' Us insisted on buying some of its Japanese-made stock direct from the manufacturers. 'At first, most Japanese manufacturers said they would not sell to us. But as the downturn started we became more in demand. They needed large orders,' he explains. Nintendo, the computer games maker, initially said it would only sell through wholesalers. The wholesaler pays 60 per cent of the suggested retail price and sells on to the next stage of the chain at 70 per cent, which then adds another margin before selling to the shop. Nintendo's eventual agreement, to sell to Toys 'R' Us at 70 per cent of the retail price, sent 'shock waves' through the toy industry, says Dean Perry, retail analyst at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. Even Daiei, Japan's only national supermarket chain, has faced a struggle to achieve direct buying. Yet Bouts believes the shift in balance of power from manufacturer to retailer seen in the US and Europe is now taking place in Japan. Evidence for that is a decline over the past five years in the proportion of Japanese toyshops to stick to manufacturers' recommended retail prices, from 70 per cent to just under 30 per cent, according to a recent survey by the Fair Trade Commission. More than 80 per cent of the shops surveyed attributed this to the impact of Toys 'R' Us. US political pressure was useful, in that it inspired a Japanese government decision to speed up approvals for the development of new shopping complexes. This was a result of the Structural Impediments Initiative trade talks with the US, one of the several abortive attempts at bringing down the Japanese trade surplus. Toys 'R' Us was even singled out as a lesson in US-Japan trade relations by former US president George Bush, who opened its second Japanese store on his 1992 trade mission to Japan. However, even after this liberalisation, Bouts says it still takes three times longer in Japan than in the US to get approval for a new store. Toys 'R' Us was, however, pleasantly surprised at the understanding it received from the Japanese government on other matters. It agreed, for example, to allow Toys 'R' Us to send toys to foreign laboratories to be tested for rigorous Japanese safety standards and to scrap a requirement that foreign toys had to be retested every six months. It is difficult to tell whether Toys 'R' Us has been a catalyst in the changes in Japanese retailing or has simply cashed in on them. But its experience does show that one part of the Japanese market is opening for real. Other sectors might follow a similar pattern.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Arts: Fabricated thoughts - Television When Garry Bushell, television critic of The Sun, went on Channel 4's culture series Without Walls to attack the 'middle class culturati' who dominate television for suppressing the working-class hero Alf Garnett, it was not Johnny Speight, creator of Till Death Us Do Part and therefore of Garnett, who was so striking. Nor was it the black TV presenter Darcus Howe, who bravely and sanely argued for the true freedom of speech which the Garnett series represented. The most memorable moment came when Bushell showed us his local Working Men's Club on St George's night with a crowd of Londoners roaring out 'We are red, We are white, We are English dynamite'. Why was this such an astounding and unforgettable scene? Because (this was Bushell's point) while the TV mandarins provide us with countless programmes about West Indian working-class culture, Scottish working-class culture, and even Chinese working-class culture, they systematically suppress any reference to English working-class culture unless it is generations out of date, very left wing, or very sentimental. Gosh, Vanessa, 'We are red, We are white, We are English dynamite'? that's fascist isn't it? Oh yah, Emma, let's show that nice clip of the battle of Cable Street again. Those who say 'Come on, don't pretend it's Orwellian, it's all perfectly harmless', might reflect on the fact that, in the most recent screening of The Dam Busters on television, the name of Guy Gibson's black labrador had somehow been changed from Nigger to Trigger. Thus do the Thought Police become a reality. Someone in television is already doing Winston Smith's job. The idea of re-making old television dramas which were originally broadcast live, or recorded and then wiped for reasons of economy, is a good one. But what possessed BBC2 to choose Dennis Potter's Message For Posterity as the re-make to open a new series of 'Performance'? After its first production in 1967, my predecessor, TC Worsley, gave a detailed explanation on this page of why it was an inferior example of Potter's work. After describing the play, about an old politician having his portrait painted, Worsley wrote 'So what has it all amounted to? Alas, nothing at all. Every issue has been burked. A non-confrontation has taken place, and a purely arbitrary denouement has been tacked on - much too arbitrary, this attack of madness, to make the flip comment 'We always win in the end' have any resonance. I am severe towards Mr Potter's work only because I am so sure that his real gifts will one day flower into something remarkable'. Ten out of ten to Worsley and 'Must try harder' to the BBC, which magnified the silliness of choosing a poor apprentice piece by having it directed as ineptly as any major drama undertaking from them in the last 10 years. In BBC2's Walking The Wall and Fall Of The Wall we have seen television doing one of the things it does best: synthesising recent history. The first programme was concerned with the physical entity of the wall, from the moment it was built until the moment it was sold off in large and small pieces, with fake lumps on sale in street markets. The second told the fascinating story of how the wall, and hence all the contingent dominoes, fell. By combining newsreel clips with the key protagonists speaking to camera - from Otto von Habsburg who led the trans-wall picnic, to Hungarian prime minister Miklos Nemeth who described looking into Gorbachev's eyes at the Warsaw Pact meeting and knowing he could breach the iron curtain with equanimity - it provided an engrossing first-hand account of one of the most heartening key events of the 20th century. Have you seen the appalling new chat show in which six embittered men sit around slagging off women? One of them will say 'The only things I need a woman for are sex and washing my socks', and the rest all agree and try to say something even more contemptuous about women. Unthinkable on such a politically correct channel as BBC2? Well yes, of course. The programme, called The Last Word, actually features six women slagging off men, saying 'All I need a man for is sex and DIY' and so on. Totally different. Germaine Greer (who else) is in the chair, and the only mystery is what the usually sensible Ann Leslie is doing among such a cheerless, self-pitying bunch. How the world has done them down] How men have done them down] How their parents have done them down] How ghastly it is to have to have children] How terrible it is not to have children] Incapable or terrified of simple human affection so long as the opposite sex is involved, they accompany everything they say with a constant drone of anti-male sentiment, like that awful background keening you get from a hurdy-gurdy. Saddest 45 minutes of the week. The opening episode of Ellen, a newly imported American comedy series on Channel 4 on Friday, caused considerable laughter in our household. True, it is yet another programme about a bunch of oddly assorted 30-somethings, but it has that fast-fire wise-cracking quality which is missing from so much British comedy. Off for a major 'inter-gender ordeal', Ellen opens her coat to reveal a little black number and asks 'Okay you guys, does this say desperate?' The following programme, Paris, a comedy in which Alexei Sayle plays an artist in 1920s France, has reached its mid point (three out of six episodes) without raising more than a snigger and a couple of groans on the old green sofa. Sayle, one of the truly original talents of his generation, is not suited to this sort of sitcom. People are always inexplicably keen to parrot myths. On Monday yet another commentator writing about Drop The Dead Donkey repeated the assertion that 'Topical quips are cut seamlessly into script at the last possible moment before transmission'. Actually 98 per cent of the comedy in this - still excellent - series, set in a television newsroom, arises from well established character traits (Sally's superciliousness, Damien's cowardice). The few topical quips delivered in vision are so obviously tacked on that they are scarcely worth the trouble. Most of the topicality is, anyway, inserted voice-over above the end roller.</p>

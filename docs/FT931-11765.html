			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: British Steel Paradoxically, given the row about US duties, things may be looking up for British Steel. This is only partly because the company has limited sales in the US. The row appears to be concentrating minds in Europe about cutting capacity. British Steel would benefit because its efficiency advantages would come into play in a more evenly balanced market. With sterling weak, it stands a better chance than its German competitors of making last month's price rises stick. Unsurprisingly, its shares are in demand, especially among US investors attracted by possible currency gain. Yesterday they rose a further 5 per cent. The bull case, though, is flawed. Detailed debate on European cutbacks has yet to start. It would be rash to assume the UK will escape additional burden just because British Steel has already closed Ravenscraig. Other European countries may demand further sacrifices, especially given British Steel's exchange rate advantage. Besides, the economic downturn in Europe hardly bodes well for demand. Cheap imports from eastern Europe continue to depress prices. British Steel is unlikely to revisit its earnings peak of 28.2p in the year to March 1990, not least because it no longer has net cash in its balance sheet. Investors cannot expect 8.75p dividends again. Last year's reduced dividend of 4.5p might be sustainable in the medium term. On a presumed yield of 6 per cent, shares would have a cruising altitude of around 100p against 77p last night. Patience will be required. British Steel would need profits of above Pounds 200m to cover such a dividend twice. Even if all goes well in Europe, the company may not be back in profit for another couple of years.</p>

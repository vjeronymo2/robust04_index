			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Teesside retail plan rejected Plans for a 100,000 sq ft extension of the Teesside Retail Park, an out-of-town shopping scheme on the edge of Stockton-on-Tees, have been rejected by the environment department. Local authorities in Cleveland welcomed the decision as a significant step in underlining the recent shift in government thinking towards promoting town centres for retail investment. The retail park is a Teesside Development Corporation scheme. Mr Duncan Hall, the corporation's chief executive, said it was reviewing the situation but remained confident the land would be developed.</p>

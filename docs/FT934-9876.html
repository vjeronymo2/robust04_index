			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Russian know-how for Hyundai air deal HYUNDAI, South Korea's largest business group, plans to produce passenger aircraft using Russian technology in the second Korean civilian aerospace project to be announced within the month. Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry, which manufactures railway and other transport equipment, will establish a joint venture aerospace company with Yakovlev of Russia in which the Koreans will have a 51 per cent stake. Yakovlev will be responsible for the design and development of the passenger aircraft based on 150-seat Yak42H and the 30-seat Yak40H. They will be assembled by Hyundai in South Korea. Hyundai will also establish a global marketing and after-sales network for both the Korean-made airliners and other aircraft produced by Yakovlev. It is the first civilian aircraft venture for Hyundai Precision, which already assembles military helicopters. It follows last month's announcement by Daewoo Heavy Industries that it plans to manufacture medium-sized airliners in co-operation with Aviation Industries of China and Korean Air, the country's main airline. Daewoo is also negotiating with Hindustan Aeronautics of India and Singapore Aerospace to participate in the Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) project to develop and produce the airliner that is scheduled to enter service in 1998. The Hyundai and Daewoo civilian aircraft programmes represent a new departure for the Korean aerospace industry, which now largely consists of assembling US military aircraft, such as the F-16, and the production of civilian airliner components. The Korean government wants the country to become one of the world's ten leading aerospace producers by the year 2020 and has budgeted some won250bn (Pounds 209m) for the development of a medium-sized passenger aircraft.</p>

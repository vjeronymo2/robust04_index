			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- The news media generally  welcomed President Kim Yong-sam's meeting Monday with three  former presidents and urged them to use the occasion to start  working for national harmony and unity.    Former Presidents Choe Kyu-ha, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u  personify the conflict and yoke that stained the political  history of South Korea for the last 15 years, some newspapers  said.    Kim had invited the trio to Chongwadae [presidential office]  for lunch and informal talks, but the news media and general  public attached significance to the event and used words like  "great reconciliation" and "great harmony."    In addition, Kim invited his predecessors to seek their  support for his administration's efforts to boost competitive  strength in the era of globalization through national unity.    But below this facade, the TONG-A ILBO could not help  detecting Kim's political calculation. The daily said in an  editorial Tuesday that through the last 10 months of  anti-corruption campaigning Kim has alienated himself from Chon  and No and must have felt a political burden.    In this respect, the presidential get-together could be  nothing more nor nothing less than a meeting of pro-government  forces, the TONG-A said, adding that this was why it could not  but worry that the meeting may force a dispersal rather than a  concentration of national strength.    The TONG-A nevertheless ended its editorial on a hopeful  note, urging Chon and No to make efforts to make up their  personal animosity so that the public no longer hears about  their conflict.    Moreover, if the meeting was held to help gather national  competitive strength within a big framework of reconciliation  and unity, the newspaper said, the public suspicion or  impression that Kim has been waging a political vendetta against  his predecessors under the pretext of an anti-corruption  campaign has to be cast off.    The SEGYE TIMES, in an editorial, said that it did not view  the meeting as an occasion for simple reconciliation, for it has  to be reconciliation and cooperation for the future through  readjustment of personal attitude and self-reform.    It should not be a reconciliation that accepts past mistakes  or wrongdoings as they are, but one based on a thorough self-  examination and efforts to reborn for the future, it said.    A SEOUL SINMUN editorial said angry and fighting politics  were replaced by politics where there are smiles. There was no  better sign than that Korean politics have stabilized and  matured, it said.    There were times when chief executives could not go out to  the public freely and express their own opinions.    As one of the persecuted politicians during those  unfortunate  days, President Kim has extended his arms to former presidents  based on his legitimacy and confidence, the SEOUL SINMUN said.    Kim's efforts to get the nation back to normal have to be  evaluated highly, the newspaper added.</p>

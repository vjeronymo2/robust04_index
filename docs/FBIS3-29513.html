			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Seoul, Feb. 18 (YONHAP) -- A senior South  Korean Government official on Thursday denied various press  reports that "something has happened" to Kim Chong-il, son and  heir-apparent to North Korea's paramount leader Kim Il-song.  Kim Chong-il's conspicuous absence from nationwide celebrations  of his 52nd birthday on Wednesday has triggered wild speculation  ranging from rumors that he had been wounded in an assassination  attempt to reports of his being placed on good behavior by his  father.    "Such speculation was probably prompted by his absence from  celebrations of his own birthday," the official said. "But it  has been their (North Korean) custom that Kim Chong-il doesn't  show up for such occasions."    The official, who declined to be identified, noted that Kim  Chong-il was also absent from last year's celebration of his  birthday.    "As far as we know, the theory that something happened to  Kim  Chong-il is groundless," he added.    A similar line of thought was expressed in Moscow, where  most  Russian officials in charge of collecting external information  reacted to the reports on Kim Chong-il with incredulity.    "As of this moment, we have not received any information  that  something has happened to Kim Chong-il," one official said.    "Moreover, the report that he was gravely wounded in a  shooting appears to have no foundation whatsoever," he said.    The ITAR-TASS News Agency said it has contacted its  Pyongyang  bureau to confirm the reports but was unable to receive any  information. "A reliable report is bound to come out if we wait  a little longer," one official said.    Meanwhile in Los Angeles, Korean-Americans who have close  contacts with North Korea also said they have not heard anything  untoward had happened to "the dear leader," as Kim Chong-il is  commonly called in North Korea and by pro-Pyongyang ethnic  Koreans abroad. [passage omitted on background]    Separately, it was reported in Beijing Thursday that Kim  Chong-il was placed on good behavior by his father over North  Korea's nuclear policy. This report, which quoted an  unidentified source in Beijing, could not be confirmed either.</p>

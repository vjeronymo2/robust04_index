			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Japan's trade access limitations require unorthodox responses Sir, In commenting on my article, 'Good and bad of managed trade' (August 18), Daniel Moylan asks (Letters, August 23) for criteria to judge whether voluntary import expansions (VIEs) will increase economic wealth. There are three such criteria: (1) demonstrable limitations on market access for specific products; (2) where foreign goods or services are demonstrably competitive; (3) where the preferable policy responses, eliminating a visible barrier or applying anti-trust policy to collusive corporate practices, are unavailable. In such cases, VIEs will increase competition and reduce prices. Mr Moylan fears that political clout rather than these objective criteria will determine which sectors get VIEs. But political capture is much less for VIEs than for the bad form of managed trade, voluntary export restraints (VERs), because proper VIEs (as with semiconductors to Japan) set targets for imports from all countries. Uncompetitive American exporters would thus derive little benefit from a VIE negotiated for their products by the US government. This latter point exposes the errors in Professor Bhagwati's letter (August 24) on my article and in Miti official Risaburo Nezu's subsequent contribution ('An ill-advised way to manage trade', September 1). Mr Bhagwati claims that VIEs give 'your producers' a guaranteed market share and promote cartels. But exporters in all countries must compete for the newly available market. The framework agreement released by President Clinton and former prime minister Miyazawa in Tokyo explicitly states that 'benefits under this framework will be on a most favoured nation basis', refuting Mr Nezu's claims that the Clinton administration 'seems to be pursuing' enhanced market access only for American firms. Finally, Prof Bhagwati is flatly wrong in charging that my discovery of Japanese import barriers is a recent phenomenon. In 'The United States-Japan economic problem', published by the Institute for International Economics in 1985, William Cline and I derived estimates of the adverse impact of Japanese barriers on American exports that are quite similar to those in my new 'Reconcilable Differences? United States-Japan Economic Conflict'. Prof Bhagwati also inferred incorrectly that I advocate VIEs for all 12 sectors analysed in the new study; I plainly stated that NIEs are useful only for intermediate industrial products and cannot be applied to consumer items, and that they 'should be used sparingly and only with the utmost care'. Japan's access limitations severely damaged the prospects for both trade liberalisation and an effective General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which Prof Bhagwati and Mr Nezu claim to support. It is that country's pervasive pattern of exclusionary corporate practices, combined with opaque governmental intervention, that requires resort to unorthodox policy responses like VIEs.

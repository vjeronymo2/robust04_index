			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- A director of a key  committee in the House of Representatives from Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], a core party in the ruling coalition, was  removed from the post after criticizing his boss, Ichiro Ozawa,  party officials said Thursday [19 May].    Koichiro Aino was replaced by Morio Kimura, another  Shinseito  member, as a director of the lower house steering committee, the  officials said.    A senior party official said the change is a regular one.  But the sudden change is widely regarded as punishment for  Aino, who described the formation of a joint parliament group in  the lower house which triggered the withdrawal of the Social  Democratic Party (SDP) from the coalition as a blunder by Ozawa.    Aino's remarks angered Ozawa, the chief coalition  strategist,  and he later retracted them.    The SDP walked out of the coalition in late April after the  abrupt formation of the Kaishin parliamentary group, excluding  the party. The SDP's withdrawal meant Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata had to form a minority government for the first time in 39  years.</p>

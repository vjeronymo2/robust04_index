			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Eurotunnel share movements under scrutiny by watchdog COMMISSION des Operations de Bourse (COB), the French regulatory body, confirmed that it had opened an investigation into recent movements in the price of shares in Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, Reuter reports. The inquiry was triggered by a sharp drop in Eurotunnel's stock price last week following remarks by the chairman of builder Bouygues and speculation that price manipulation had occurred. Mr Martin Bouygues, Bouygues chairman, said talks between Eurotunnel and its contractors, including Bouygues, to resolve a prolonged legal battle over cost overruns were deadlocked and that he could not rule out Eurotunnel going bankrupt.</p>

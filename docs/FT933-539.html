			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (29): The music of strategy / Management REAL-TIME STRATEGY by Lee Tom Perry, Randall Stott and Norman Smallwood John Wiley &amp; Sons Dollars 27.95 250 pages MOST COMPANIES realise the need for change - but when the opportunity arises can they actually seize it? Such a question might well be addressed to US competitors of the Perrier Group, which allowed the French bottled water company to jump back into the game remarkably quickly after catastrophe struck in February 1990. The discovery of traces of benzene, a known carcinogen, in the Perrier product was arguably a once-in-a-lifetime chance for its rivals. But while Perrier displayed considerable skill in limiting the damage - and in reasserting its position as market leader - the lame response from its competitors was extraordinary. Some of the excuses - lack of marketing money, limited bottling capacity, fears that a weak Perrier might weaken the overall market - made sense. But according to Lee Tom Perry, Randall Stott and Norman Smallwood 'they did not go after the leader because they did not want to change their strategies. The Perrier tragedy actually upset their plans because they had settled into the role of industry followers'. This book argues that in an increasingly interdependent world of accelerating economic cycles such complacency is dangerous, and that successful companies need to embrace the concept of strategic improvising. Strategic improvising, the authors contend, responds to the concerns which have been voiced about traditional strategic planning. As a real-time process it promotes flexibility and action-oriented responses; creates a high rate of focused innovation; and encourages greater individual involvement and team-based thinking. They develop a musical metaphor, based on the differences between jazz groups (for which read strategic improvising) and symphony orchestras (strategic planning). Strategic improvising is not directionless - hence the analogy is with the lead sheet of a standard jazz composition rather than the avant garde variety. Strategic improvisers are jazz players in that they are participative, they listen and are listened to; they are responsive - like jazz musicians acting on musical ideas rather than slavishly following the orchestral score; and they are communicative, organised into small teams for lateral communications. It is no accident that a jazz group is typically five to nine members, against as much as 110 for a fully fledged orchestra. However, this book consists of more than flights of musical fancy. It incorporates down-to-earth case study experiences of corporations like Taco Bell, the fast food subsidiary of Pepsico, WL Gore and General Electric, whose improvising cultures are admired. From these it is shown that strategic decisions are best made at all organisational levels, not exclusively at the top; that strategic improvising involves a 'high frequency', and typically 'low impact' approach, the taking of lots of initiatives rather than the agonising over each one; and that whereas strategic plans are 'front loaded' - ie a lot of effort is put in before managers actually act - strategic improvisers believe the process can be improved by acting before they plan. Published in the portable MBA series this book provides a useful summary of the criticisms of traditional strategic planning. Whether it offers anything original is more doubtful. It makes some elegant points and provides useful advice. The suspicion remains, though, that strategic improvising is a mishmash of empowerment, team development, core capabilities, and other fads.</p>

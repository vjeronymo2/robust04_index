			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> An inaugural exhibit of a new gallery features Lawrence Weiner who helped  spearhead the late '60s conceptual art movement with his fragments of text  painted on walls. Here, the phrase "assuming the position" is enclosed in a  handsome graphic logo of black lines and silver strips. The design and words  are repeated on each gallery wall with opposing phrases, such as put together  and spread apart or tossed aside and carried along printed above and below.  </P> <P> The installation reads like a refresher course on conceptual art, and that's  not so bad since the movement is at the core of everything from happenings to  environmental art to Joseph Beuys' work. By pitting obvious conceptual  dichotomies around the written litany "assume the position," Weiner recalls  conceptualism's key idea that art is not the production of salable objects but  the process by which the artist formulates creative options and the viewer  invests these with meaning.  </P> <P> Weiner's text is intentionally drained of personal and art historical cues so  that ideally each viewer has a pure, unguided and unique reaction. This renders  value judgments of good or bad and issues of taste meaningless in defining what  counts as art. Further, Weiner's transitory media -- the gallery walls will be  eventually whitewashed -- remind us that the materials of art are also not what  defines the presence of art. Art is the creative impulse.  </P> <P> This isn't new. When Duchamp made art of a bicycle wheel he was making a  similar point. And Weiner's philosophy suffers from the same ironic twist noted  by Duchamp when he said, "I throw a urinal in their faces and they admire it  for its beauty." By its very presentation in a gallery setting, by its very  authorship by a noted and vocal conceptualist, we're predisposed to look for  certain cadence and meaning consistent with Weiner's intent. The good news is  that we find it, and it enlightens us about the process of perceiving meaning  in art. The bad news is exactly what conceptualism hoped to avoid: If we're not  privy to certain information, the words can hang as meaningless as billboard  gibberish. (Stuart Regen Gallery, 619 N.

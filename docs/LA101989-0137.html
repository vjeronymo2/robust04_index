			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHUTTLE ALOFT, SENDS GALILEO ON 6-YEAR VOYAGE TO JUPITER  </P> <P> The shuttle Atlantis roared into space Wednesday on the first leg of the most  ambitious planetary mission to date.  </P> <P> Galileo, the most sophisticated unmanned spacecraft ever built, was released  from the shuttle's cargo bay six hours after the 9:53 a.m. PDT launching and is  finally on its way to Jupiter. It was a launching that some scientists were  beginning to think they might never see.  </P> <P> The spectacular liftoff, which had been delayed several times, marked both a  beginning and an end.  </P> <P> It marked the end of years of frustration for scientists and engineers who  built the Galileo and then watched it narrowly escape the scrap heap several  times.  </P> <P> "It was definitely a special day for them," launch director Robert Sieck said.  </P> <P> "It was worth the wait," said Richard Young of NASA's Ames Research Center in  Mountain View, Calif., one of the principal scientists on the project. "It was  fantastic."  </P> <P> Atlantis commander Donald E. Williams, 47, could not have agreed more. "We're  happy to be here," he said as the shuttle orbited 184 miles above Earth.  </P> <P> And the launching signaled the beginning of what promises to be a spectacular  journey through space. It will take six years for Galileo to reach Jupiter, the  largest planet in the solar system; but, along the way, the spacecraft will  tour the inner solar system and its camera will even offer humans their first  view of Earth as it would be seen by visitors from outer space.  </P> <P> For a while, NASA officials considered scrapping the $1.4-billion project as  the space agency struggled to rebuild after the Challenger explosion.  Scientists who had invested much of their careers in the project held their  breaths as NASA reevaluated the mission.  </P> <P> Galileo had been designed to be put into low Earth orbit by the shuttle and  then use a liquid-fueled engine to blast itself on to Jupiter. But, because of  concerns about safety after the Challenger disaster, NASA decided to prohibit  liquid fuel in the shuttle's cargo bay, leaving Galileo with a great itinerary  but no way to travel.  </P> <P> Galileo was saved when engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory came up with  a way of getting the spacecraft to Jupiter without using liquid fuel. It could  be done, they concluded, by using a safer solid rocket motor to push Galileo  beyond Earth's grasp.  </P> <P> The solid rocket is not powerful enough to give Galileo the speed it will need  to reach the outer solar system, so Galileo will have to take the scenic back  roads to Jupiter.  </P> <P> After Galileo was released from the shuttle's cargo bay, it used its rocket to  slow itself down as it sped around Earth.  </P> <P> The reduced speed left Galileo falling toward the sun. But, in February,  Galileo will pass close enough to Venus to use that planet's gravity to change  its course. Venus will swing Galileo around and throw it back toward Earth.  </P> <P> In December of 1990, Galileo will come within 600 miles of Earth, whipping  around its home base for the first time and using Earth's gravity to slingshot  itself through the asteroid belt outside of Earth's orbit. Ten months later,  Galileo is to pass within about 600 miles of the asteroid Gaspra for the first  encounter with an asteroid, snapping pictures and studying this remnant of the  early solar system.  </P> <P> In December of 1992, Galileo will make a daringly close approach to Earth,  passing within about 185 miles and using the planet's gravity to boost its  speed by 8,000 m.p.h.  </P> <P> If all goes well, that should give Galileo the speed it will need to reach  Jupiter.  </P> <P> It is the second encounter with Earth that most worries anti-nuclear  protesters, who tried to block the launching.  </P> <P> Galileo carries about 48 pounds of toxic plutonium 238, which it uses to  generate electricity to run its many instruments. The protesters, who had also  feared a launching disaster, worry that, if Galileo accidentally plunges down  into Earth's atmosphere during that close flyby, the plutonium -- which is in a  solid, ceramic form and packaged in steel canisters -- could somehow be  vaporized and spread around the world.  </P> <P> That would require multiple failures, which NASA judged to be highly unlikely.  In the end, the courts ruled for NASA, and protesters did not try to physically  disrupt Wednesday's launching.  </P> <P> Although Galileo will send data back to Earth during its entire journey, the  most important payday will occur when the three-ton spacecraft, carrying a  total of 16 scientific instruments, encounters Jupiter. Galileo will loop  around Jupiter and its moons for two years, capturing close-up pictures of the  planet and its moons with a high-resolution camera that will make the images  from the Voyager spacecraft look like snapshots.  </P> <P> About 150 days before Galileo reaches Jupiter, the spacecraft will release a  probe designed to plunge into the gaseous planet's heart, sending back data  until it is crushed by the dense layers of gas.  </P> <P> Atlantis is scheduled to land at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California  on Monday at 12:39 p.m. The shuttle's pilot is Navy Cmdr. Michael J. McCulley.  Other members of the crew are Shannon W. Lucid, Franklin Chang-Diaz and Ellen  S. Baker.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RETURN TO JUPITER  </P> <P> After a flight lasting six years, the Galileo probe will separate into two  parts as it approaches Jupiter. The orbiter section will circle the planet for  at least 22 months. The probe capsule will descend into the planet's atmosphere  and make direct measurements until it is destroyed by the high-pressure gases  there.  </P> <P> GALILEO'S FLIGHT PATH  </P> <P> The spacecraft was originally designed to make a 2 1/2-year direct flight to  Jupiter. Changes after the Challenger disaster resulted in a six-year flight  path using flybys of the planets Venus and Earth to build up enough speed to  reach Jupiter.  </P> <P> 1.

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: San Miguel soars 40% in first half San Miguel, the Philippines' largest manufacturing enterprise, has announced a 40 per cent rise in first-half net profits to 2.23bn pesos (Dollars 55m), on consolidated net sales 13 per cent higher at 32.9bn pesos, writes Jose Galang in Manila. Earnings per share advanced to 1.56 pesos from 1.12 pesos previously. The company said higher sales volume, which reflected the accelerated economic growth during the period, accounted for the robust financial results. San Miguel's brisk profit increase in the first half did not include any extraordinary income. The company in April sold the present site of its Hong Kong brewery, and the windfall gain from the sale will be booked in September, when full payment for the property will be made. The sale is estimated to result in a non-recurring income of HKDollars 2.93bn (USDollars 379m) for San Miguel Brewery Hong Kong.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Braking the thieves Vehicle theft is a growth industry. But while most people's attention is focused on car security, truck and trailer users are increasingly concerned about protecting heavier vehicles. To combat theft of truck loads, trucks and trailers, David Bramley Engineering has developed a range of precision products which fit on to the vehicle. Among them is the Bramley Trucklock, which fits into the parking brake circuit and locks the braking system with a 10-pin high-security lock offering 1m different key cuts. Other products protect the trailer's king-pin and brake line coupling to prevent thieves towing the unit away. David Bramley Engineering: UK, 0602 623499.</p>

			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / IMF to extend loan facility: Account offers credit to countries in economic transition Executive directors of the International Monetary Fund agreed yesterday on a four month extension of the Fund's systemic transformation facility, a loan account that provides special assistance to help formerly communist countries make the shift to a market economy. The IMF board agreed to extend the STF, which was due to expire at the end of this year, to April 30. The STF offers loans to countries in economic transition under looser policy conditions than a normal IMF standby loan. IMF officials and member governments had hoped to agree on a longer STF extension at the Fund's annual meeting in Madrid last September, as part of a much larger package of measures intended to expand the resources available to developing countries and especially to the new market economies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, had wanted the package to include a general distribution of SDR36bn (Dollars 52bn) to all member countries. The plan fell apart in Madrid in a blazing row between the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, which wanted a much smaller distribution of SDRs, and developing countries. Developing countries also objected to the STF extension, complaining that the G-7 and the IMF have devoted all their attention to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The IMF did agree at the time to expand its access limits for member countries. Standby loans have been increased from 68 per cent of a country's quota - a measure close to its share in the IMF and calculated in reference to the size of its economy - to 100 per cent, with similar increases for other IMF loan accounts. That measure alone will increase the amount Russia could borrow from the IMF by Dollars 2bn. Agreement on an extension of the STF to April 30 gives IMF member countries enough time to resolve their dispute before the spring meetings in Washington of the Fund and the World Bank. G-7 officials expect that the SDR row will be resolved by then, although little progress on specific solutions appears to have been made so far. The IMF has been considering not just extending the STF, which has so far lent a total of Dollars 4.9bn to transitional countries, but of expanding access. Countries are at the moment allowed to draw on the STF twice, but the possibility of a third drawing has been raised. The IMF yesterday approved a loan of 16.9m SDRs to Armenia under the systemic transformation facility. This is the former Soviet republic's first IMF borrowing, and follows progress in efforts to stabilise the economy. The IMF said monthly inflation had fallen from over 50 per cent in January-May to 3-6 per cent in June-September, though it then increased to 13 per cent in October-November.</p>

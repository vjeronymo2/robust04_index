			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Shares taken for genuine market-making, jury told BLUE ARROW shares worth 4.5 per cent of the company were taken by County NatWest Securities for genuine market-making purposes, Mr David McMullan, the former CNWS finance director, told an Old Bailey jury yesterday, John Mason writes. Mr McMullan, a prosecution witness, said the size of the holding did not matter. He had no reason to think that even such a large stake was not for market-making purposes. Mr McMullan agreed with Mr Roy Amlot, QC, for Mr Alan Keat, a solicitor with Travers Smith Braithwaite and one of the defendants, that he took it for granted that legal advice given before the 1987 rights issue was that market-makers would be exempt from disclosure obligations if the shares were bought for the purpose of the business. County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the result of the Pounds 837m issue. The trial continues today.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / People: Watery processes North West Water has appointed a managing director to turn round the fortunes of its process division. John Beckitt, 46, comes from ICI, where as international business manager for its KLEA business he was responsible for developing, manufacturing and marketing a range of refrigerants as alternatives to CFCs. His task at the process division will be to reverse the recent decline which has seen profits before interest and tax fall from Pounds 19.7m to Pounds 8.8m in the last year. The division has suffered from a delay in expected spending on water treatment equipment by US city councils. Brian Staples, North West's chief executive, said Beckitt was well-qualified to oversee the division's development. 'John's wide expertise in developing manufacturing and marketing technical products in an international market makes him the ideal candidate,' he said. 'Under his leadership I fully expect the process equipment division will progress strongly to make a valuable contribution to the group's overall performance.' The division, recently created by the merger of North West's process equipment and instrumentation businesses, employs more than 2,000 people in North America, Australasia, and Europe.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Single union deal at Scotch plant THE FIRST single-union agreement in the Scotch whisky industry has been signed between William Grant and Sons and MSF, the general and technical union. Workers at the Glenfiddich plant in Paisley, Strathclyde, voted overwhelmingly that the MSF should have sole negotiating rights at the company. Seventy four per cent backed the MSF although the union has only 19 per cent membership among the workforce. Fewer than 7 per cent of the workers chose the TGWU general union and 11 per cent the AEEU engineering union. The MSF said: 'The result suggests an overwhelming endorsement of MSF's negotiating skills and support services.' But it brought strong criticism from local officials of the TGWU and AEEU. The ballot was held by the company with the support of all the unions at the plant, which agreed to abide by the verdict of the workforce. Mr Roger Lyons, MSF general secretary, said: 'This deal is important because the terms are not being dictated by management.' William Grant insisted it wanted a single-union agreement at the new whisky plant being opened at Strathclyde Business Park 30 miles from the Paisley site.</p>

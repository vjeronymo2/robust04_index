			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BURNED BODY IN STREET IS IDENTIFIED AS THAT OF MISSING LANDLORD;  </P> <P> CRIME: THE RANCHO PALOS VERDES RESIDENT SET OUT TO COLLECT RENT FROM DELINQUENT  TENANTS. HE NEVER RETURNED.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police said Wednesday they had found the badly burned body of a  Vietnamese-American landlord who disappeared last week as he left his Rancho  Palos Verdes home to collect rent from delinquent tenants.  </P> <P> The body of John Long, 53, was discovered Nov. 8 lying in a street near 91st  Street and Stanmore Drive in Westchester, about five miles from the 10-unit  Hawthorne apartment building he has owned since last year, police said.  </P> <P> LAPD spokesman Lt. Fred Nixon said the body was discovered only eight hours  after Long vanished, but that the coroner's office was unable to positively  identify it until Wednesday because it had been "severely and extensively  burned."  </P> <P> Police said they had no suspects and few leads in Long's death. They could not  explain how he died.  </P> <P> Long's wife, Kimchi, said she last saw her husband at about 1 p.m. on the day  he disappeared, when he left for the Hawthorne apartment building in his beige  1980 Mercedes-Benz.  </P> <P> Two days after Long vanished, a passer-by found the car abandoned and ransacked  near 53rd Street and Central Avenue in Southeast Los Angeles. Scattered inside  the car were Long's business papers and the rosary beads that Long, a Catholic,  always carried.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County sheriff's homicide investigators, who handled the case while  Long was still missing, said he was last seen by his wife headed for one of the  two English-style townhouse apartment buildings he owned on Truro Avenue.  </P> <P> According to Kimchi and Long's friends, the landlord visited the apartments  frequently because some of the tenants owed him as much as $3,000.  </P> <P> Despite her concerns for his safety, Kimchi Long said her husband always made  sure he collected the rent personally, driving into a dangerous neighborhood  where drug dealing and prostitution purportedly was common.  </P> <P> Although the buildings appear to be well-maintained, residents and neighbors  said that on most evenings, a host of drug dealers operate in an alley behind  the apartments.  </P> <P> "I know that area is not the best area," Kimchi Long, 40, said in an interview  before her husband's body was discovered. "I did mention it to him. He told me  not to worry about it. He said, 'I'm very nice to them.' "  </P> <P> Long's tenants agreed that their landlord was a likable man who has taken good  care of the apartments.  </P> <P> Weldon Young, a 40-year-old school teacher, said he considered Long his friend.  "He was a nice guy, but I don't think he should be collecting rent. It's  dangerous," Young said.  </P> <P> Still, Young said, some residents had run-ins with the landlord.  </P> <P> "People had differences of opinion with him because of certain things he did,"  Young recalled. "He came knocking on the door a lot."  </P> <P> Young and another renter said that on the afternoon of Long's disappearance,  they saw the landlord arrive and walk toward an alley behind the building. They  said Long returned to his car a few minutes later and drove off alone.  </P> <P> Long had been scheduled to visit a third building he owned in Hawthorne to show  a vacant apartment to a prospective tenant, said Jerry Callahan, Long's  next-door neighbor and friend. But Callahan said it was not clear whether Long  ever arrived for the appointment.  </P> <P> Kimchi Long, who had been living with her husband and 12-year-old son, Michael,  in Rancho Palos Verdes, recalled the day of her husband's disappearance with  sadness.  </P> <P> She became concerned when her husband did not return home for dinner, she said,  and by midnight she began to telephone police and local hospitals.  </P> <P> "He didn't call, so I thought maybe he was stuck in traffic," she said. "After  10, I started worrying and my son started asking me, 'Where's daddy?' "  </P> <P> After Long's disappearance, Callahan, an attorney, served eviction notices on  two tenants of the Truro Avenue apartment building who, he said, are thousands  of dollars behind on their rent. Callahan also said he intends to serve  eviction notices on other delinquent tenants.  </P> <P> Callahan described Long as a clever businessman and investor, but not  thick-skinned enough to be a good landlord.  </P> <P> "I think he has a very soft heart," Callahan said. "(The tenants) take  advantage of him. They say they don't have money and he believes them."  </P> <P> Kimchi Long said that when she asked her husband why the tenants were  frequently late with the rent, he answered: "Oh, they are very poor. Just give  them a chance."  </P> <P> Long arrived in the United States from Vietnam in the 1960s and later became a  naturalized citizen and received training at De Paul University in Chicago as  an electrical engineer. At the time of his disappearance, Long was working as  an independent real estate broker out of his home.  </P> <P> It was only in recent years that Long began to invest in apartment buildings.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies said they were preparing to launch a door-to-door search for  the missing landlord when they were informed that Long's body had been  identified.  </P> <P> In a strange twist, authorities later announced they had mistakenly identified  a second body found near the airport as that of the missing landlord. That body  was discovered Wednesday by LAPD officers but it turned out to be that of a  74-year-old resident of an apartment building who had died of natural causes.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 1 Jun (PL) -- A special Belgian Government  envoy is in Cuba participating in the talks to find a solution  to the situation caused by the illegal occupation of the Belgian  ambassador's residence in this capital.    Cuban Foreign Ministry sources confirmed to PRENSA LATINA  yesterday's arrival in Havana of Ambassador Willy Verriest, who  has already met with acting Foreign Minister Isabel Allende.    The Cuban side described this meeting as positive. The  diplomat's presence in the country is considered a demonstration  of Belgium's interest in obtaining a satisfactory solution to  the incident.    Cuba and Belgium agree on the illegal nature of the forced  entry into the building, which has been occupied by a group of  people since Saturday in an attempt to force the foreign mission  to enable them to leave the country without carrying out the  normal procedures established for leaving.    It has been learned that Verriest was ambassador to Cuba  from  November 1986 to February 1990 and now holds a high position in  the Belgian Foreign Ministry.    Parallel to his initial activities in Cuba, it was reported  that Alfredo Morales, Cuban ad interim charge d'affaires in  Brussels, has met with Belgian Foreign Ministry officials,  especially the chief of staff of that Ministry.    The objective of that meeting was also to exchange ideas and  positions on the development of the negotiations begun by the  two parties immediately after the occupation of the Belgian  ambassador's residence in Cuba.    Cuban Foreign Ministry officials consulted by PRENSA LATINA  reaffirmed the normal nature of the negotiations, which are  being conducted in accordance with the international customs and  regulations that exist for these types of cases.    The Cuban position, which is shared by the Belgian mission,  is that of facilitating the departure from the diplomatic  residence of all the people who violated its  extraterritoriality, independent of whether afterwards and in  accordance with pesent legal provisions, they begin the  appropriate steps to leave the country.</p>

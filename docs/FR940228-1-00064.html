			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amendments of 1992 amended the HEA in several areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to the participation of institutions in the Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA programs. The Student Assistance General Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations contain requirements that are common to educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following list summarizes the major issues in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Each participating institution is subject to a new statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of an academic year in which a full-time student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (with respect to an undergraduate course of study), during a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum 30-week period, must complete: At institutions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure program length in credit hours, at least 24 semester  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or trimester hours or 36 quarter hours; or at institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that measure program length in clock hours, at least 900  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clock hours. Section 668.2 proposes to clarify the terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in the statutory definition of academic year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The statute now mandates the definition of an eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program for proprietary institutions of higher education and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postsecondary vocational institutions, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``short-term'' programs (at least 300 but less than 600 clock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours) that would be eligible for the FFEL programs only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute requires that these programs must have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completion and placement rates of at least 70 percent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured in accordance with regulations. Section 668.8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes methodologies for those measurements. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary eventually may propose a single methodology (based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on comments on this NPRM, regulations to implement the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Student Right-to-Know Act, and other NPRMs) to be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wherever appropriate in regulations for the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. In accordance with the statute, this NPRM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains further provisions to evaluate the quality of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, specifically a requirement proposed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary that a program may not exceed by more than 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent the minimum number of clock hours required by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State for training in the recognized occupation for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the program prepares students, and a requirement that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program be in existence for at least one year before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying for eligibility under these criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;This NPRM proposes to add two new sections to codify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures with regard to applications to participate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initially or to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program (proposed &sect;668.12) and procedures by which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary certifies that an institution meets the standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in subpart B of these regulations and accordingly may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in a Title IV, HEA program (proposed &sect;668.13).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;668.13 also includes proposed procedures whereby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary codifies new statutory provisions governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisional certification procedures for participation in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program. Provisional certification permits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary to allow an institution that otherwise would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not qualify to participate in a Title IV, HEA program to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate on a limited basis. The institution is subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to shorter periods of participation than a fully certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution and does not have the right to the extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal proceedings under subpart G of the Student Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General Provisions if the Secretary revokes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's provisional certification. Instead, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed by the Secretary in this NPRM, the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be offered a modified appeal. Further, an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is provisionally certified may be monitored more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closely to the extent that the Secretary believes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution warrants a greater degree of oversight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 668.14 proposes to amend the regulations governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program participation agreements to include numerous new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions added by the Amendments of 1992 and provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously prescribed by the HEA but not specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spelled out in the regulations. This section also includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions proposed by the Secretary. This NPRM proposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement statutory requirements regarding disclosure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revenues and expenses for institutions that offer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> athletically related student aid. This NPRM would also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address statutory requirements concerning incentive payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based directly or indirectly on success in securing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollments or financial aid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;This NPRM proposes significant changes to &sect;668.15 (currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.13) the section governing the evaluation of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's financial responsibility. The NPRM proposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to strengthen the factors used to evaluate an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility and to reflect statutory changes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the provision that requires that any standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed for the determination of an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility take into account any differences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accounting principles between for-profit and nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions. For example, this NPRM proposes to require a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for-profit institution to have a ratio of current assets to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current liabilities of 1.25:1 and a nonprofit institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1:1. As the statute requires the establishment of cash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reserves sufficient to ensure repayment of any required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refunds, the NPRM also proposes to require each institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to maintain a minimum cash reserve of at least 10 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution's total deferred tuition income at the end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the institution's most recent fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

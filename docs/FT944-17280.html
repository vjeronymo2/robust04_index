			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Princess Di gazed into my eyes . . .: Peter Aspden describes his intimate encounters with members of the royal family I crossed paths with the Princess of Wales a few weeks ago. It was in the middle of the King's Road, broad daylight, not a detective to be seen. I stared. I wish I could say, pace Pasternak and Hewitt, that I was aware of her 'not in the gawping, let's assess-her-from-head-to-toe way, but with a protective sense of excitement and relief', but I would be lying; I gawped, I assessed, and my only sense of excited relief was that I wasn't her. As she walked towards me on her way to take one of the little princes to a movie, a strange feeling came over me; I felt embarrassed. I found myself unable to carry on staring; it seemed indecent. While the caddish captain, on his first meeting, 'drank in her effortlessness, her vibrant sheen and the way she cupped hands', I could only look down in furtive discomfort. Instead of our eyes meeting, it became a contest of who could bore the deepest holes into the pavement. She probably won, having had more experience, but I gave it all I had. I cursed that I did not have my camera with me, but I could no more have sprung in front of her flashing lights in her face than taken an axe to her neck screaming 'Viva la repubblica]'. The whole affair lasted all of 30 seconds, but, just in case, publishers, agents and great-nieces can get my number from the main FT switchboard. It gave me a further, infinitesimal insight into life in the grotesque glare of the royal spotlight. My shifty unease had come from the wish to dissociate my rational judgment (she is an over-privileged, under-performing subject of no interest whatsoever) from my quasi-prurient curiosity (exactly how beautiful / thin / depressed is she?); it is, I believe, a battle that is fought daily in the minds of newspaper readers of all hues as they struggle to balance moral censoriousness with the frivolous lust for high-quality gossip. I should have learned my lesson some years ago, when I became, for a mercifully short time and in the most half-hearted of ways, a member of the royal rat-pack. I had been deputed by my local paper to cover Prince Edward's activities at Cambridge University. I reported on his first rugby match for his college ('a sinewy frame' I think I wrote), his first tutorial (they surprisingly declined to invite us in) and, eventually, his stage debut, in Arthur Miller's The Crucible. After the performance (before a wonderfully bizarre mix of undergraduates and Fleet Street's instant Miller experts), I was rung by a local radio station; would I do a live interview? Inebriated by the absurdity of the evening, I cheerfully agreed, and let rip. He was sim-ply won-derful, I opined; prancing around in thigh-length leather boots, barking at underlings as if he had been born to do so, magnetically dominating the proceedings like a young Olivier. My fine-spun and brutally sarcastic words were rammed down my throat the next morning when my 'review' was broadcast nationally, on the hour, every hour, over the whole of the next morning; for my sumptuously ironic tone was lost completely. Friends called from all round the country, wondering why I suddenly sounded like Barbara Cartland. I was humiliated. The next time I encountered Edward was at a garden party, part of the usual scrum of malingering press-hounds scrutinising his every move. Suddenly, he bent down and picked up a small object. The cameras clicked as one. It was a royal rota press pass, the one you need to get within a whiff of these occasions. He smiled cruelly: 'Someone has been rather careless]', twiddling the pass in his fingers while the pack laughed uneasily. I looked downwards and froze. My lapel was naked. The pass was mine. I was going to have to step forward, say sorry, bow in abject shame while every photographer swooped on the heaven-sent headline opportunity: 'Please sir, can I have my pass back?'; 'Who's a silly boy, then?'; 'The Prince and the Plonker]' My life flashed before me. For the merest of seconds, I understood what it was like to be him. I, however, had an extra option open to me - I fled. No one took my picture, no one plastered me across every news-stand. I escaped, the moment was forgotten. All these memories flashed by as I read Princess in Love, the story that was so beautiful, it had to be told, and as I read of Hewitt's plight ('The world would judge him harshly in its ignorance, when all he was was a kind, weak man who had done his very best'), I wondered if anyone knew the meaning of shame any more.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Inland Revenue seeks order for the winding up of Nissan UK The Inland Revenue has applied for a winding-up order against Nissan UK, the former importer and distributor of Nissan cars which was at the centre of Britain's biggest tax fraud. The Revenue is seeking repayment of up to Pounds 238m from NUK, controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, which it claims is the company's tax liability for a period of 17 years in which NUK's profits were understated. Earlier this year two former NUK directors were jailed for their part in the tax fraud. The High Court has appointed Mr Colin Bird and Mr Dipanka Ghosh of accountants Price Waterhouse as provisional liquidators of NUK. The appointment is only temporary, however, and the Revenue will seek on Monday in the High Court to have the arrangement extended. NUK is expected to challenge the appointment of the liquidators and the winding-up petition. It has also appealed against the assessment of its tax liabilities and maintains there are no valid grounds for the tax claim. The company, which was deprived of the lucrative Nissan franchise by Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker, at the end of 1991, reported net assets of Pounds 96.6m at the end of July 1992 in its last set of audited accounts. Under the terms of their appointment, the provisional liquidators hold a neutral position with the task of locating and safeguarding the assets of NUK for the benefit of all its creditors. NUK is a subsidiary of Nissan UK Holdings, which is owned by European Motor Vehicles Corporation. EMV is registered in Panama and was established as a trust by Mr Botnar. Following the loss of the Nissan franchise, NUK said that it would 'continue as a property investment company'. Its sister company Automotive and Financial Group (AFG), which is owned through a trust in the Bahamas also established by Mr Botnar, is still one of the biggest multi-franchise UK motor retailer groups. Earlier this year Mr Michael Hunt, managing director of NUK, was jailed for eight years for his part in the NUK tax fraud. He is currently appealing against his conviction and sentence. He was convicted for conspiring to defraud the Revenue of Pounds 55m in corporation tax by helping artificially to inflate freight charges for Nissan cars imported from Japan. When interest is added, the total loss to the public purse from the fraud was estimated to be more than Pounds 87m. His co-defendant, Mr Frank Shannon, a former finance director with the company, was sentenced to three years after admitting, before the trial, to one offence of cheating the Revenue. During the two-month trial the prosecution said the fraud was by far the largest ever perpetrated on the Revenue. The 'prime mover' behind the fraud, it alleged, was Mr Botnar. Mr Botnar has remained in Switzerland beyond the reach of UK justice since a warrant was issued for his arrest in early 1992.</p>

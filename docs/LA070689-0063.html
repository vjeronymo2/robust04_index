			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN TOLD TO REPAY SCHOOL FOR SON'S EDUCATION  </P> <P> In an action that state and Los Angeles education officials called highly  unusual, a one-time Burbank school board candidate who has been battling school  authorities over whether his son can legally attend a Burbank school has been  ordered by a judge to reimburse the school district for educating the boy.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Thomas C. Murphy has ruled that S. Michael Stavropoulos, a  neurosurgeon who ran unsuccessfully for the five-member school board earlier  this year, lied when he said he lived in Burbank.  </P> <P> Murphy lifted a court order that allowed the boy, Michael Stavropoulos, 14, to  attend John Muir Junior High School during the 1988-1889 school year while the  matter was being heard in court. The district can refuse to enroll the boy when  school resumes in September, he said.  </P> <P> Murphy also said Stavropoulos must reimburse the district for the cost of  educating the youth during the last two school years. "There are expenses," he  said. "It cost the district money to put this kid through school."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Present Statistics  </P> <P> Murphy said that before the reimbursement amount is determined, the district  must present statistics demonstrating the average cost of educating a student  during the 1987-1988 and 1988-1989 school years. Officials also must show  Murphy how many days the younger Stavropoulos actually attended school, he  said.  </P> <P> Those costs, authorities estimated, could be more than $5,500.  </P> <P> The district, which receives money from the state for every child enrolled, may  have to return the state funds it received for Michael Stavropoulos, school  officials said. The average state payment for the 1987-1988 school year was  about $14.44 a day. The payment for the 1988-1989 school year was about $15.54  a day.  </P> <P> Pat McGinnis, a state Department of Education spokeswoman, said the case was  highly unusual "because these matters don't usually get to court." Either  school administrators or school boards determine a student's residency, she  said, and their decisions are rarely challenged.  </P> <P> She said state legal authorities could not recall a similar case in California.  </P> <P> Tammy Sims, a Los Angeles Unified School District spokeswoman, said such an  issue has never come up in Los Angeles schools.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Youth Faces Expulsion  </P> <P> The younger Stavropoulos also faces expulsion by school authorities after he  fought with another student earlier this year, officials said. The school board  is slated to decide whether to expel him on Aug. 4.  </P> <P> Stavropoulos reacted angrily to the judge's ruling.  </P> <P> "I was a resident of Burbank, I am a resident of Burbank, and I will continue  to be a resident of Burbank," Stavropoulos said Wednesday. He called the school  board members "corrupt, vengeful individuals."  </P> <P> Stavropoulos has been locked in a bitter struggle with the Burbank school board  since last October. The board ruled then that Stavropoulos was maintaining a  phony residence so that his son could attend John Muir Junior High School.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Family's Pictures  </P> <P> District officials visited the house in the 600 block of East Walnut Avenue  where Stavropoulos said he lived. But they were not convinced he lived there  because another family's pictures were in the home, said John J. Wagner, a  school district attorney.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Filed Lawsuit  </P> <P> Stavropoulos filed a lawsuit against the district and won a preliminary  injunction to allow the boy to continue attending Muir while the case was heard  in court. Murphy ordered the board to hear Stavropoulos' appeal of the board's  October ruling. The board rejected Stavropoulos' appeal in February.  </P> <P> Although his residency was in question, Stavropoulos ran for one of two open  seats on the board this year. Burbank City Clerk Merle Woodburn said an  investigation would have been conducted into Stavropoulos' residency had he  won.  </P> <P> Stavropoulos filed a second lawsuit accusing the board of capricious and  arbitrary behavior. That suit is pending.  </P> <P> Stavropoulos' son attended Muir during the 1987-1988 school year. In May, 1988,  when he was involved in an altercation with another student, the boy told  authorities he lived in Los Angeles, district officials said.  </P> <P> He was allowed to finish the school year but was told in the fall that he could  not return because he did not live in Burbank.  </P></p>

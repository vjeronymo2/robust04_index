			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / EU to monitor progress of Tokyo trade The European Union will monitor the implementation of US-Japanese trade accords to ensure they conform with multilateral trading rules and do not unfairly exclude third countries. The move was agreed at an annual EU-Japan ministerial meeting in Tokyo over the weekend, in which the European Commission also told the Japanese government that Brussels expected to see Japan's current account surplus fall from last year's 3.1 per cent of gross domestic product to 2 per cent by 1996. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister, said the figure was reasonable, but could not accept a date. Sir Leon Brittan, European commissioner for external economic relations and trade and leader of the three-Commissioner negotiating team, stressed that the EU was not seeking a target for the surplus, in line with its continuing aversion to the US strategy of seeking to pin Tokyo to precise figures on opening its markets. It was simply an expectation based on the Japanese government's economic policies, said Sir Leon. 'We have made progress on many items,' he said, referring to a series of Japanese market-opening measures announced by the government over the weekend. The meeting marks the EU's growing anxiety to ensure that European businesses are not cut out of trade deals negotiated by the US, in the 18-month old economic framework talks between Tokyo and Washington. These cover a wide range of sectors that include important European competitors, including cars and car parts, telecommunications and financial services. The EU, for its part, was not seeking concessions for European business to the exclusion of others, but felt certain it could increase its share of the Japanese market 'given the proper opportunities', said Sir Leon. Mr Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, assured Sir Leon that Japanese trade accords with the US would automatically be extended to other trade partners. Sir Leon feared that Japanese private sector companies might, despite this, still feel under political pressure to buy US cellular telephones, aircraft and car parts, rather than equally competitive European ones. In response, Mr Kono promised to remind Japanese private companies that they were free to choose foreign suppliers on purely commercial grounds. However, the government declined the Commission's request to monitor jointly the fair implementation of trade deals with the US, with the result that Tokyo and Brussels will monitor US-Japan trade in parallel. The Japanese government will keep the Commission informed of further progress in its US trade talks. The EU had no plans to revive its failed attempt to launch trilateral trade talks with the US and Japan, said Sir Leon. The weekend ministerial meeting had shown it was possible to make progress under present arrangements, he said.</p>

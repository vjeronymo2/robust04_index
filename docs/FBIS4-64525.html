			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed Th.F.: "Brussels Demands Formal Apology From </F> Rwanda"]    [Excerpt] Belgium has given its first official response to  the Rwandan accusations that Belgium was involved in the attack  on 6 April in Kigali which cost the life of President  Habyarimana and led to the massacres. Yesterday morning,  Francois Ngarukiyintwali, the Rwandan ambassador in Brussels,  was called to the Foreign Ministry. After announcing Belgium's  "vigorous" protests at the statements made by the Rwandan  ambassador in Zaire, in particular, and by the Rwandan foreign  minister, the Foreign Ministry's Secretary General Roelants  repeated that Belgium had nothing to do with this tragedy,  either through the Belgian units which are part of UNAMIR (UN  Mission in Rwanda) or through any Belgian authority.    Consequently, the Rwandan ambassador was informed that the  Belgian Government is demanding the interim Rwandan Government  to formally and unequivocally withdraw the statements that  Belgium was an accomplice, an instigator, or the perpetrator of  the assassination of Juvenal Habyarimana, as well as the  statements claiming that the Rwandan Patriotic Front (FPR)  received support from Brussels.    As long as these statements have not been withdrawn, neither  the Rwandan foreign minister nor any member of the interim  Rwandan Government will be allowed into Belgium. This does not  mean a breakdown in diplomatic relations between Brussels and  Kigali. To put it plainly, any future contact between Belgium  and Rwanda at the highest level will be subject to an apology  from Rwanda. [passage omitted]</p>

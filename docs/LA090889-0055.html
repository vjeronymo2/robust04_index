			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Two Soviet cosmonauts successfully docked their Soyuz TM-8 spacecraft with the  Mir orbiting space station, the official Tass news agency said. "Everything is  in order on board, and the cosmonauts feel well," Tass said. The Mir station  has been vacant for more than four months. Commander Alexander S. Viktorenko  and engineer Alexander A. Serebrov, who blasted off from the Baikonur  Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia early Wednesday, will remain aboard Mir for  six months. Along with the cosmonauts, scientists are sending up two modules to  expand the station's living space and upgrade its scientific capabilities.  </P></p>

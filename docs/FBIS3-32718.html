			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "BARRICADA on the Sandinist Debate"] </F>   [Text] The debate among Sandinists, now that the special  session for the First FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front]  Congress looms ahead, has broken out with such a strength and  vigor that no one in Nicaragua, regardless of his stance on the  national crisis, can escape the repercussions.    This is easily understood because Sandinism is the most  important political movement and it has the greatest  responsibilities in terms of the country's future. What the  FSLN discusses today regarding its political platform, the  national crisis, its concept of a party, its statutes, and its  leadership will have momentous consequences for Sandinism.  Moreover, it also will have an impact on society as a whole  because there is a direct relationship between the process to  strengthen democracy within Sandinism and progress achieved in  the national democratization process.    Therefore, we believe all Sandinists are dutybound to  realize  the importance of participating in the debate. We have a double  responsibility -- to support the reorganization of Sandinism,  the main goal of the First Congress, and to simultaneously help  outline the perspectives of a solution to the national crisis.  No one can fail to endorse those efforts.    Today BARRICADA wants to ratify its pledge to work and help  bring Sandinists together again.    Because of professional ethics, we reject sectarian  journalism that is only appropriate for zealots, like the one  endorsed by the right wing which does not allow other opinions  or a diversity of sources on current events. Three years after  BARRICADA was relaunched, when it stopped being the official  newspaper, the influence and credibility earned by this  newspaper have proved, as an expression of political efficiency,  that we adopted the right decision.    Just as we have proclaimed on previous occasions, BARRICADA  has always been and always wants to be a free forum for  discussion and national debates. We are not a cathedral where  dogmas are preached; instead, we are a medium open to doubts,  intellectual honesty, constructive polemics, and exchanges of  practical experience to seek solutions and guidance for the  citizens.    We support a debate among Sandinists where ethics prevail.  In other words, we sponsor a discussion of ideas -- political  and ideological positions -- where sincerity and a spirit of  unity prevail above all. We oppose the methodology of using  exclusion and epithets, and we only endorse strong arguments and  reason when refuting opposing opinions. We understand that all  debates imply a reasonable quota of zeal, but this does not mean  the discussion should degenerate into personal attacks. These  are the basic norms we ask you to share with all those who have  an opinion and who wish to state it through BARRICADA.    Aside from the observance of ethics, the rules for the  debate  demand a political willingness to continue advocating a greater  flow of information and greater editorial opportunities that  allow the greatest diversity of opinions, whether on an  individual basis or as a group, in the Sandinist debate.    The existence of different currents of opinion has resulted  from the vitality of Sandinist democratization. BARRICADA,  being a member of the news media, has a responsibility -- to  offer the reader in-depth research into the exchange of  organized opinions. Therefore, we have begun publishing a new  section in this edition -- the "FSLN Congress" section -- which  shall be published whenever necessary to divulge the different  positions and documents, as well as rank-and-file activities,  polls, and personal interviews, and it will complement the  "Opinions" and "Readers' Forum" sections.    We pledge to follow the policy of allowing all kinds of  opinions to be heard, and we urge all the Sandinist media to  open their pages and radio and television programs and to  sponsor an ample debate without sectarianism.    At BARRICADA, we view the media as autonomous areas of power  that are linked to the broad spectrum of our society, and we are  sure the debate also will strengthen the media's autonomy.  Moreover, we want to remind readers that BARRICADA's  journalists and workers, and the members of its editorial staff,  have different personal opinions about the topics for the  Sandinist debate, and they state their opinions in the  newspaper's pages under their respective signatures. Only the  editorial represents the official position of the newspaper.</p>

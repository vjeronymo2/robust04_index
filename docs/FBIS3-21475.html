In the face of foreign competition, domestic  private investment has increased [as published] without any  compensating increase in foreign investment. All of this has  fueled an unemployment crisis which has [also] been caused by  the fact that the state has given up its role of providing  employment.    Unemployment is considered to be the most important problem  from which Morocco suffers. This problem rapidly became worse in  the early eighties and has continued to become worse during the  nineties. The underlying reason for the problem goes back to the  manner in which the restructuring policy has been applied in  Morocco since 1983. The policy had the aim of restoring  equilibrium to both the nation's domestic and foreign finances.  It was also behind the push to have the state give up numerous  job slots considered to be normal and natural even in liberal  economies and to give up protecting the national economy, both  in the face of foreign competition and with regard to social  gains for the working class. The rate of unemployment went up  for three basic reasons.    The first reason was Morocco's open-door policy with regard  to foreign countries. What this meant was that the doors were  opened for foreign goods and services to be imported instead of  having an increase in Morocco's exports, because our potential  to produce and export goods had not risen to a level that could  allow us to deal with foreign competition either on the  technical or technological level or in terms of the nature and  cost of our production. This liberal trade policy caused many  Moroccan firms to go out of business, lay off many of their  workers, or shorten their work hours. As a result, the rate of  layoffs and level of unemployment both increased. The Moroccan  companies were no longer able to employ as large a work force as  they had, much less create new positions. Opening the doors of  the economy in this fashion caused the economy to be oriented  more toward the exchange of goods rather than the production of  goods. This created what could be called a "bazaar economy,"  meaning an economy of buying and selling goods, without any  production taking place, and an economy oriented toward the  consumption of foreign goods without any domestic production or  involving only domestic production that was very weak in terms  of both quantity and quality.    So the liberalization of imports, without protection for the  economic foundation of our domestic manufacturing and  agricultural production, caused the rate of layoffs and  unemployment in the production sectors to increase.    The second reason for the unemployment, due to the policy of  restructuring and related to the first reason above, is that our  economy was impelled to become what has been known for years as  an unregulated or unstructured economy. This type of economy was  encouraged because our economy embarked upon a policy of  restructuring and because it will be part of the GATT agreements  that will be signed in Marrakech in mid-April. As a result of  this, our economy has entered into a framework of intense  international competition on all levels, including the areas of  cost of production, manner of production, and production  efficiency. These factors have impelled numerous firms to leave  the regulated sector and enter the unregulated sector. The  reason for this is that, in the unregulated sector one can pay  wages that are so low that they do not even come up to the level  of the minimum wage, which is "theoretically" guaranteed by the  state. Also, in this sector, one can avoid paying taxes, and the  workers are given no social benefits, which they are supposed to  receive. No contributions are paid to the national social  security fund. Of course, this situation also applies even to  some of the establishments operating within the structured  economy. Another characteristic of the unstructured sector is  that it does not provide for guaranteeing continued employment,  because foreign competition leads to an increase in the rate of  layoffs, and the rate of hiring new workers is subjected to  external factors. This rate, in any case, remains circumstantial  rather than being structural, because the establishments both  lay off and hire workers whenever they so desire. Usually there  are more layoffs than there are jobs created.    The Moroccan economy has become oriented toward being an  unregulated economy that employs an uneducated work force. This  explains why the figures published by the Directorate of  Statistics show that the level of unemployment for holders of  diplomas is higher than that for persons having no  qualifications. Another characteristic of this sector is that it  pays very low wages and is usually oriented toward employing  women or children. This is something that has begun to become  alarmingly widespread in nearly all the developing nations,  especially those in Africa. Also, it is a trend that has begun  to lead to the spread of numerous demographic phenomena, which  are evident, for example, in the fact that the populations have  stopped progressing and are going back to previous demographic  growth levels. The number of children is increasing, whereas the  average life expectancy is decreasing, because children who work  during their early years usually are exposed to illnesses,  accidents, and numerous ailments, shortening their life spans.  This is something that causes social and demographical problems,  and consequently economic problems.    The third reason for the increase in the unemployment rate  is  the decrease in the rate of domestic investment, without any  compensating foreign investment. Whoever says that foreign  investments have increased is mistaken, because when we compare  foreign investments made between the years 1982 and 1992, we  notice that the increase has not taken place to the degree  quoted by official speeches. In fact, the increase during this  period of time has not gone over 4 percent. This fact becomes  even clearer if we take into consideration a series of factors  such as the decrease in the value of the dirham, domestic  inflation, and foreign inflation. This has led to an increase in  the prices of numerous goods and equipment that we used to  purchase before the beginning of the eighties. The same 1982  investment, in terms of value, has become of far less value in  real terms in 1992.    The fourth reason or factor is the appearance of what has  come to be called the unemployment of young people who have  graduated from educational institutions and have degrees. This  new phenomenon is a result of the fact that the state has given  up its role of providing them with employment. Until 1982 the  organs of public administration provided from 40,000 to 50,000  jobs each year. But then the restructuring policy began to be  applied, and since this policy stipulates, among other things,  that the state be downsized and the budget deficit be reduced by  means of reducing public expenditures, the state has decreased  its volume of employment, starting in 1983, down to between  12,000 and 15,000 jobs per year.    Judging from the overall situation that characterized the  above-mentioned 10-year period, it is clear that there was a  difference of between 200,000 and 250,000 jobs provided in the  seventies as opposed to the eighties. This clearly explains the  reasons for the widespead unemployment among the ranks of our  young people. These young people cannot get jobs unless the  state undertakes its role of providing employment, particularly  in fields that are experiencing a large gap [in the number of  positions filled]--such as the field of education on all levels  and the field of public health, which is considered to be one of  the most impoverished fields both on the regional and  international levels.    The employment of young people with degrees brings up the  issue of the restructuring of our system of education and of  programming its subjects in order to make the education more  capable of providing young people with new opportunities to  obtain jobs. This issue has become all the more relevant because  the government has given up providing young people with  employment, on the one hand, and because, in addition to this,  the world economy has begun to demand that employees have skills  and qualifications that are no longer provided by our system of  education.    The four above-mentioned factors are what have led to a  widespread high rate of unemployment in Morocco. The manner used  in the attempt to mitigate the severity of unemployment in  general and unemployment among our young people in particular  has proved to be of limited effect, because employing young  people either directly or indirectly in establishments created  especially for this purpose has not led to the results hoped  for. Since 1991, not more than 45,000 young persons have  received jobs, whereas the goal was to create 100,000 jobs for  young persons holding degrees in 1991. And since 1991 the size  of this group of unemployed persons has grown because additional  graduates from institutes and colleges since 1991 have increased  the ranks of the unemployed.    In general, whether the matter concerns Morocco or other  countries, the policy of restructuring has led to a decrease in  employment because the policy was based on reducing the cost of  labor and has caused the state to decrease its investments after  the national economies of these nations were liberalized. Since  the European economies are still dominant, since their export  capabilities are greater than those of the backward nations, and  since their production costs are lower in comparison to those of  the backward countries, this has led to an increase in  unemployment. In addition to this, Morocco occupies a special  place within this general orientation. Morocco has experienced a  noticeable decrease in its national income--down 3 percent in  1992 when compared with 1991. Furthermore, this income is  characterized by the fact that there is a great discrepancy in  how it is distributed among the various groups of people in our  country. There is a vast difference between the income of the  low-income groups and the high-income groups. Proof of this can  be seen in the realm of public employment where the highest  official wage is as much as 70 times greater than the lowest  official wage. This discrepancy in income, in addition to the  meagerness of the average income, has caused the domestic market  to continue shrinking. And this has caused both Moroccan and  foreign investors to cease investing in this market. The absence  of a domestic market is also a factor that can be added to the  above-mentioned factors, which indicate that the rate of  unemployment in Morocco will increase in coming years. Poor  incomes do not help create a broad consumers' market. The  absence of such a market means that there is no incentive for  investment, and a lack of investment results in the lack of  creation of jobs which, in turn, results in the spread of  unemployment, impoverishment, and thus entry into a vicious  circle.    As for fiscal rectification, which was one of the hoped-for  goals of the policy of restructuring, results in this regard  have been unsatisfactory. Let us disregard the fact that there  has been a decrease in the rate of public expenditures, leading  to a decrease in the number of government jobs and to a decrease  in the public debt from 11 percent of the national income in  1982 down to less than 2 percent at the present time. Let us  disregard all of this--and it is something which the state has  always been able to do in view of the fact that it has began to  rapidly reduce its expenditures on employment, health,  education, and the protection of consumer capacity of the  low-income working classes by means of cutting the revenues of  the budget fund. Disregarding all of this, it is nevertheless  true that our foreign debt has not decreased from what it was in  1982. That year the foreign debt was an estimated $13 billion,  and in 1992 the value of the debt went up to where it amounted  to about $22 billion. All of our financial and social efforts  have not led to a decrease in the foreign debt. In fact, the  opposite is true. The debt has increased in scope, because the  actual policies that have resulted in this debt have not changed  and are continuing as before.    Concerning the balance of trade, the policy of restructuring  and the reduction [in value] of our national currency in the  form that this has been done since 1982/83 have not led to a  decrease in the trade deficit. Statistics coming out of the  Office of the Budget themselves confirm this view, because  exports amounted to only about 53 percent of imports in 1982,  and the situation was still the same in 1992. The level of  imports has been much higher than the level of exports. What  this means is that Morocco has come to [export] more actual  natural resources than it exported in 1982, because the value of  our exports has either decreased or not increased sufficiently  to keep pace with world inflation, whereas the prices of the  goods we import from other nations have increased greatly. The  reason for this is that the nations and companies who export  these goods have control when it comes to setting the prices,  and the consequence has been that Morocco is now exporting more  goods at lower prices and is importing fewer goods at greater  cost than we were importing in 1982. One should add to this the  fact that the imbalance in the national income, the tax policy  that has been followed since 1983, especially the policy  followed with regard to customs duties and the value-added tax,  has resulted in the fact that many of the luxury items that are  imported are sold at prices that, in some cases, are nearly the  same as the prices of basic items. This is something that  becomes obvious when we see the imported luxury cars that are  cruising around on our streets and roads. Also, we are importing  a series of luxury appliances that the national economy could do  without if we had a wise economic policy for controlling imports  and protecting our national potential.    Even in the field of tourism we have seen that the  devaluation of the dirham really has not changed anything.  Income from tourism has been steadily declining since the  mid-eighties, and foreign investments themselves have not  increased as much as was anticipated by the economic production  policy.</p>

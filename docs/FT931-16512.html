			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Seeking haven with Laporte in the storm - The background to the intervention in the fight for Evode LAPORTE'S intervention yesterday into Wassall's bid for Evode, might appear to have occurred at five minutes to midnight. But Mr Ken Minton, Laporte's chief executive, explained his move followed seven years of negotiations with Evode. 'I first approached Andrew Simon (Evode's chairman), in 1986 but the businesses didn't fit. Since then, Evode has shed much of its basic plastics operations and moved into higher-value speciality products,' said Mr Minton. Laporte made a second approach in January 1992, when the harsh trading environment resulted in halved pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.3m at Evode for the year to September 28 1991, against Pounds 15.2m. Mr Minton described the results as far from outstanding. 'The results made them vulnerable. With margins of 2 per cent on sales of Pounds 280m, something wasn't right. We talked between January and May, but there was a large gap between what we were willing to pay and Evode's aspirations,' he said. 'Nothing came of the approach, but we explained that if they ever got into trouble they knew where their friends were. After the Wassall bid was announced, Andrew Simon's first call after talking to his bankers was to me,' he explained. One of the attractions for Evode of Laporte is its strong management team, which has transformed the business from a low-margin bulk operation into a successful speciality chemicals company. The group, managed by Mr Minton since 1980, is concentrated on five core business areas, organic chemicals, absorbents, metals and electronic chemicals, construction chemicals, and hygiene and process chemicals. Mr Minton believed there were clear synergies between Evode and Laporte. Two of Evode's five business areas - adhesives and polymer compounds - fit classicly into Laporte's businesses, he said. Evode's adhesives operations generate sales of about Pounds 85m a year and mainly supply the construction and automotive sectors. Laporte sells different types of adhesives to the construction industry through alternative distribution channels. Most of Evode's polymer activities would also fit, even though Laporte has no direct experience in this area, said Mr Minton. He explained the businesses, with a combined turnover of about Pounds 85m, were all involved in formulating chemicals, one of Laporte's strengths. The three polymer operations in the US - supplying high-quality plastics for the medical, food and electronics industries - all had margins in double figures. In contrast, the UK footwear business, hit by the recession, and the Italian operations, were in low-margin markets. Mr Minton admitted there were some question marks hanging over Evode's other three main business areas - powder coatings, plastic fabrication and a miscellaneous bundle of companies. Powder coatings, generating annual sales of about Pounds 20m, was not an area in which Laporte operated. Although the sector had the advantage of not being capital intensive, Mr Minton said he was unsure whether Laporte would keep powder coatings because of competition from groups such as Imperial Chemical Industries and Courtaulds. 'When I have to compete with big boys like these, I start getting nervous.' The five plastic fabrication operations, with annual revenues of Pounds 20m were less attractive to Mr Minton. Three businesses - in the US, Italy and the UK - had good margins. Two others required turning around. The fifth business area involving a miscellaneous grouping, mainly of vinyl coatings for the wallpaper market had sales of about Pounds 40m. It does not appear to fit into Laporte's business. Mr Christopher Miller, Wassall's chief executive, said he was surprised to hear of Laporte's plans for a radical rationalisation of Evode. In contrast with Laporte he said he was commited to the powder coatings business and was not advocating Evode's break-up. He added: 'We believe we are far more closely related to Evode than Laporte. We have extensive knowledge of the adhesives and sealants and DIY businesses from our acquisition of DAP (a US supplier of construction products and filling compounds).' Evode's margins are about 5 per cent in the UK, similar to those Wassall inherited at DAP and Metal Closures, the bottle top group. It managed to almost double them at both businesses. Mr Minton also proposed to improve Evode's margins, in the same way he improved those of Laporte from about 10 per cent during the mid-1980s to nearly 15 per cent. The improvement at Evode could be achieved through better pricing policies, extending product ranges, reducing raw material costs, improved manufacturing, cutting overheads and better marketing, he said. There would be significant job losses. Mr Minton denied the cost of rationalisation would affect earnings. The group had plenty of experience of cost-cutting and there would be few environmental costs. Mr Minton's aim is to ensure the merger with Evode would enhance earnings per share in the first year. That will partly depend on how much Laporte pays for Evode. Payment is likely to be made through a mixture of cash and shares. Analysts believed Laporte would need to pay about Pounds 70m for the ordinary shares and at least Pounds 72m for the convertible and cumulative preference shares. It would also take responsibility for about Pounds 28m worth of net debt.</p>

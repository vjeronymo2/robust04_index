			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> ROONEY FALLOUT: Don Hewitt, executive producer of "60 Minutes," said that he  believes the suspension of commentator Andy Rooney, right, has hurt the show's  ratings. "60 Minutes" was outperformed Sunday night by "America's Funniest Home  Videos."  </P> <P> It was only the second time in 12 years that the long-running newsmagazine had  been beaten in its regular time slot by an entertainment program other than  sports. In a memo Tuesday, Hewitt noted "60 Minutes' " surprising loss in the  ratings and said, "What part the Andy Rooney affair played is anybody's guess.  My guess is that it played a pretty big part. Be that as it may, Andy will soon  be coming back."  </P></p>

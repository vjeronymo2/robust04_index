			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Money Markets: French rates descend FRENCH cash rates fell sharply yesterday as the D-Mark's weakness on the currency markets raised speculation that the Bank of France would ease policy on Monday, writes James Blitz. France's short term rates have been below Germany's for several weeks, as dealers seek a premium to compensate for the growing economic and budgetary problems in Germany. The French franc yesterday pierced the FFr3.36 level against the German currency in European trading, and dealers believe that French rates could go even lower. France's 3-month money yesterday fell to 7.07 per cent on the bid side, a drop of 8 basis points on the day. German 3-month money also dropped some 15 basis points from 7.45 per cent to around 7.32 per cent at the end of the day. One reason for this was a very good figure for the German producer price index in May, showing a drop of 0.2 per cent on the month. As inflationary pressures ease, the chance of another cut in short-term German interest rates increases, and there are already expectations of a repo rate cut on Wednesday. The spread between French and German 3 month money was around 25 basis points yesterday. But it was striking how interest rate futures dealers believed this could widen. The September French franc contract rose some 12 basis points yesterday to close at 93.62. This brought the spread between September French and German contracts to some 30 basis points. In sterling markets, the overwhelming view appears to be that recent economic data have made another cut in UK base rates very unlikely this year. The September short sterling interest rate contract dropped 2 basis points to close at 94.09, bringing it in line with 3 month money, which was more or less unchanged at 5 27/32 per cent. The Bank of England dealt with a Pounds 1.55bn shortage in a very helpful way. A few dealers wondered whether the government might not be tempted into a rate cut now. Inflation is at a 29-year low, the pound was yesterday testing DM2.52, European rate cutting seems imminent and Mr John Major needs a political boost. But with a new governor of the Bank of England about to take office, the authorities may keep their powder dry for the time being.</p>

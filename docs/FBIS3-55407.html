Ukraine will have to  have 1.2 million U.S. dollars repaid by 1999. The Ukrainian  side has not yet defined its position on determining either the  debt of Kazakhstan to Ukraine or those of Russia and other CIS  countries, although there have already been cases of debts made  over to be repaid by the state, in particular in mutual  relations with Russia.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE MARKET: CHRISTMAS STAPLE FRUITCAKE;  </P> <P> HERE TO ETERNITY;  </P> <P> SOAKED IN LIQUOR, THESE BRICKLIKE CONCOCTIONS SEEM TO LAST FOREVER AND CAN BE  WELCOME GIFTS.  </P> <P> Which of the following would top an adult's least-wanted holiday gift list.  </P> <P> A) Another necktie.  </P> <P> B) A cheap-bottle-of-wine and matching glasses gift set.  </P> <P> C) A purple shawl knitted with grandmotherly love.  </P> <P> D) none of the above.  </P> <P> If you guessed D, you're right.  </P> <P> Conspicuously absent from the above list is, of course, that standard around  holiday time -- the venerable fruitcake.  </P> <P> A popular gift item, yes, but not always a welcome one. Fruitcake receivers can  often be heard muttering "Ahh, you shouldn't have. . . ."  </P> <P> But isn't it the "thought that counts"? We'll leave the answer to people who  get one each Yule, via a loving relative or unimaginative boss, and end up  piling the new one on top of last year's -- and the year's before.  </P> <P> But even people who like them often let them stack up. A true fruitcake, it is  said, should stand the test of time. Commonly mummified in liquor-soaked linen,  some holiday fruitcakes are then placed in tightly sealed tins and stored for  what seems an eternity.  </P> <P> The holiday fruitcake -- made with just enough batter to bind the fruit --  features a sugary assortment of candied fruits and nuts. If candied fruit  doesn't appeal, look for a fruitcake made with dried ingredients, such as  apricots, raisins, figs and currants.  </P> <P> In keeping with tradition, we'd like to suggest some fresh variations on a  fruitcake theme, offered at some local bakeries:  </P> <P> * Sweet Cinns, 313 E. High St., Moorpark, is offering a Sour Cream, Cream  Cheese Coffee Fruitcake made with your choice of fresh strawberries,  blueberries, raspberries, boysenberries or apples. "We make it year-round,"  owner Peggy McLaughlin said, "but it's a holiday favorite with our customers."  Sweet Cinns also has a dried fruit "combo cake" with prunes and apricots.  </P> <P> McLaughlin said traditional fruitcake gets a bad rap.  </P> <P> "People don't even bother to taste it," she said, "they've heard too much bad  about the stuff."  </P> <P> Apparently she doesn't pay attention to fruitcake bashers. "Personally I like  it. I'm the only one in my family that does though -- there's 13 of us."  </P> <P> Call 529-7493.  </P> <P> * At Bill Baker's Bakery, 457 E. Ojai Ave., Ojai, owners Colleen and Thomas  Kohnen prepare a traditional German fruitcake known as stollen (pronounced  SHTAH-len).  </P> <P> "German Christmas stollen is more of cake than the traditional fruitcake,"  Colleen Kohnen said, "it's not so much of a fruit solid."  </P> <P> Stollen's list of ingredients include raisins, soaked three days in rum, and  three kinds of nuts: walnuts, pecans and almonds.  </P> <P> "We also use some candied fruit like pineapple and cherries," she said, "but  very little."  </P> <P> It's best to let your stollen -- dusted on top with powdered sugar -- sit for a  while before eating, according to the Kohnens.  </P> <P> "It's best if you let it sit for at least two weeks," Colleen Kohnen said. "As  the rum ferments it gives it a nice strong flavor."  </P> <P> "In Germany this is the most popular holiday food item," Thomas Kohnen said.  Stollen, yes, but not the American version of fruitcake.  </P> <P> "It's much too sweet and heavy," he said. "Germans would not like it at all."  </P> <P> If you think a relative or friend out of town may like stollen, the Kohnens  will ship it anywhere for you, Colleen Kohnen said.  </P> <P> Stollen is available in four sizes: 1, 1 1/2, 2 and 3-pound cakes.  </P> <P> Call 646-1558.  </P> <P> * Norbert Viaud features a "light and fluffy" fruitcake at his Raffine Gourmet  Boutique, 3741 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Westlake Village.  </P> <P> "French fruitcake is shaped like a loaf and contains candied fruits," he said,  "but not near as much as a traditional American fruitcake."  </P> <P> The French version also calls for pecans and walnuts "and contains a lot of  eggs and butter -- it's a very fluffy and rich cake," Viaud said.  </P> <P> Along with Thomas Kohnen, Viaud considers American fruitcake too sweet and  over-laden with fruit. "Way, way too heavy," he said, "it's like a piece of  rock."  </P> <P> If Viaud's fruitcake version sounds appealing, just ask for the cake wrapped  with decorative golden foil.  </P> <P> Call 496-2699.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SERVING SUGGESTIONMINI FRUITCAKES  </P> <P> If traditional fruitcake is something you must have, here is a recipe for  Miniature Ruby Fruitcakes.  </P> <P> 1 cup raisins  </P> <P> 1 cup chopped dried apricots  </P> <P> 1 cup mixed candied fruit  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped candied pineapple  </P> <P> 1/4 candied cherries  </P> <P> 1 cup pecan halves  </P> <P> brandy  </P> <P> 1/3 cup butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1/3 cup brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 1 egg  </P> <P> 1 tsp. grated lemon peel  </P> <P> 3/4 cup flour  </P> <P> 1/4 tsp. baking powder  </P> <P> 1/4 tsp. salt  </P> <P> Marinate raisins, apricots, mixed fruit, pineapple and nuts in 1/2 cup of  brandy for at least two hours. Cream butter and brown sugar. Mix in egg and  lemon peel.  </P> <P> Sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Stir into batter. Fold in  marinated fruit and nuts. Spoon into greased miniature muffin tins. Place  cherry on top of each.  </P> <P> Bake 35 minutes at 300 degrees. Drizzle with brandy while warm, if desired.  Makes 24 fruitcakes.  </P> <P> The fruitcake can be stored for up to two months. Wrap airtight and store in  cool place, adding more brandy each week.  </P></p>

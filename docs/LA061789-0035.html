			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TIMING, PURSE WILL LIMIT STAR QUALITY OF TRIATHLON  </P> <P> Organizers of the San Diego International Triathlon wish their international  event had one particular entrant with a U.S. passport.  </P> <P> When the gun goes off Sunday at 7 a.m. at Spanish Landing, defending men's pro  champion Scott Tinley of Del Mar will be missing.  </P> <P> Tinley received a generous fee -- far exceeding the $1,500 the winner here will  earn -- to compete in this weekend's Nihondaira Triathlon, a stop on the Japan  Triathlon Series.  </P> <P> "And we almost lost Paula (Newby-Fraser)," race spokesman Stephanie Taylor  said.  </P> <P> Newby-Fraser, the defending women's champion and course record-holder from  Encinitas, also planned on racing in Japan this weekend, but sponsor  commitments kept her here.  </P> <P> Conflicting events kept the biggest names from competing in the independently  run San Diego triathlon. It comes between qualifying races for the world  championships.  </P> <P> Also keeping the event from star attraction was lack of sponsorship. With the  San Diego Port District offering the only major funding, last year's prizes of  $10,000 each for the top men's and women's pro finishers couldn't be  duplicated. This year's total purse is $5,500.  </P> <P> "If there was more money, there would be a lot more pros," Newby-Fraser said.  </P> <P> Still, a near capacity turnout -- close to 1,000, with 25 men and women entered  in the pro division -- is expected, with up-and-coming pros rather than  established big names to generate excitement.  </P> <P> "The men's race should be good, because lots of good men train here in San  Diego," said Newby-Fraser, regarded as the most consistent woman in the sport  today. She set the course record of 1:37.16 last year and is Sunday's favorite.  </P> <P> Newby-Fraser said Shannon Delaney of Del Mar, Janet Stamper of Tucson, Ariz.,  and Nancy Vallance of Santa Barbara should challenge her.  </P> <P> Going after Tinley's course record of 1:24:42 (set last year) are Brad Kearns  of Malibu, the winner here in 1987, Emilio de Soto and Mark Montgomery, both of  Encinitas, and Mark Pringle and Glenn Forbes, both of Australia.  </P> <P> De Soto recently finished second to Tinley at the Orange County Performing Arts  Center Triathlon. Montgomery won here four years ago.  </P></p>

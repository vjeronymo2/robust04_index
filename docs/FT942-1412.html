			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Property spending up in first quarter UK pension funds and insurance companies invested a net Pounds 479m in property in the first quarter of 1994, underlining the resurgence in the commercial property market. Figures from the Department of Trade and Industry show that net investment in the first three months of the year was more than 90 per cent of the total net investment in 1993, which was Pounds 520m. The biggest spenders in the first quarter were long-term insurance funds, which spent a net Pounds 537m. Other insurance funds sold a net Pounds 168m, while pension funds invested a net Pounds 110m. The institutions were active sellers as well as buyers, with sales of Pounds 1.35bn, compared with purchases of Pounds 1.83bn. They became enthusiastic buyers of property in the last quarter of 1993, when they invested a net Pounds 791m, because they considered that property values had hit bottom and offered good value compared with other investments. In the autumn of 1993 and the spring of 1994, the fierce competition to buy prime property regularly pushed prices well above the asking price. However, since Easter the market has cooled. Total returns from the property market edged downwards in May, according to Richard Ellis, chartered surveyors. Intense buying activity in the first half of the year has given way to a quieter second half, as turbulence in the bond market spilled over into the property market. The bond market's influence is because, in the absence of rental growth, property resembles a fixed-interest investment. Pressures from the bond market have particularly affected sales of buildings that had little prospect of rental growth. Investors are giving more consideration to the location and quality of a building, which will determine rental growth. Mr Adrian White of Fletcher King said: 'Investors must be convinced of the underlying fundamentals of location and quality of a building, because the yields now being achieved demand rent growth in the medium term to justify acquisition against a background of higher bond yields.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed EE/SV/AL: "End of Jean-Pascal Delamuraz' </F> Visit to Russia -- Reinforced Trust Between Both Countries"]    [Text] Moscow, 13 May (ATS) -- Federal Counselor Pascal  Delamuraz has returned from a two-day trip to Moscow. At a news  conference at the Swiss Embassy in Moscow, he highlighted the  "particular openness" of his talks with Russian officials. The  main purpose of this first official visit to Russia was the  signing of a trade and economic cooperation agreement on  Thursday [12 May] by the head of the Federal Department of  Public Economy [DFEP] and Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin.    Mr. Delamuraz stressed that his visit has contributed to  reinforcing the trust between potential investors and between  the two countries. The DFEP head also insisted on the "human"  value of the trade and economic cooperation agreement that was  signed last Thursday. This accord is intended to replace three  bilateral agreements that were concluded with the former Soviet  Union, as well as the 1979 program for economic, industrial,  scientific, and technical cooperation.  <H5>  Arduous Privatization </H5>   On Friday morning, the federal counselor met with Mr.  Anatoliy Chubays, Russian deputy prime minister in charge of  privatizations. They discussed the issue of privatization.  "This is a sensitive topic. Calling for privatization is not  enough. Russia is a state which is experiencing rapid change,  where the structure of law, the consistency and prevalence of  specific rules are hardly established," Mr. Delamuraz said.    The Russian Government assured the federal counselor that  access to foreign assets would not be limited and that there  would not be any discrimination. "Many fields of activity are  open, except that of rail transport," Mr. Delamuraz added.    As far as Russia's debts to 83 Swiss companies, amounting to  320 million Swiss francs [SFr], are concerned, the DFEP head  said that the Russian prime minister had confirmed that a  solution would be found by summer.  <H5>  Exports on the Rise </H5>   The visit by Mr. Delamuraz comes at a time when Swiss  exports  to Russia have increased considerably. Totaling SFr327 million  last year, exports mainly comprise machines, chemicals, food,  and watches. Imports (SFr376 million in 1993) chiefly are fuels  and metals.</p>

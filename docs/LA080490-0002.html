			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PATT MORRISON  </P> <P> Talent agents, on your toes:  </P> <P> When U.S. Rep. David Dreier (R-La Verne) appeared on a British public affairs  TV show recently, his straight man -- make that fellow guest -- was noted  Chinese dissident physicist Fang Lixhi, who was allowed to leave China after he  took refuge in the U.S. Embassy for months.  </P> <P> On the air they got down to serious foreign policy. But Dreier warmed up the  act by telling Fang that his name was the same as that of comic Phyllis  Diller's fictitious husband.  </P> <P> "He laughed hysterically," Dreier wrote us.  </P> <P> Uh-huh. And after all those overseas tours, tens of thousands of people in  dozens of countries still think Bob Hope was the Secretary of State.  </P> <P> Joyce Goerner of Pomona is the first to answer -- and in verse, yet -- our  question, what to do with the Spruce Goose?  </P> <P>  Disney wants to shuck the Goose.  </P> <P>  Never was of any use.  </P> <P>  Put a great big price tag on,  </P> <P>  Sell it to the Pentagon.  </P> <P> A tuck under the wings, a little work around the propellers, they could pass it  off as a B-2 stealth bomber. Perfect element of surprise; who'd expect to be  bombed by a low-flying orange crate?  </P> <P> As they say, or attempt to say, there's nothing certain in life but negative  patient outcome and revenue enhancement.  </P> <P> If you divined "death and taxes" out of that, you qualify to attempt this word  problem, from a memo circulated at a major downtown firm:  </P> <P> "Effective today, employee parking fees will be reduced at all ... employee  parking facilities ... The total amount you pay for parking each month will  remain the same."  </P> <P> The company is The Times. The memo obviously did not pass through our usual  gantlet of alert editerz.  </P> <P> Give up? Like a dishonest mystery writer, we left out the key clue. The city of  L.A. imposed a 10% tax on downtown parking. So the company thoughtfully cut  parking fees to its employees by that same 10%, so, voila, everybody pays the  same amount as before, except 10% now goes to the city instead of the company.  </P> <P> Tipple d'Or is on tour: a solid gold bottle of Pinch, 86-proof Scotch in an  18-karat container (California bottle deposit not included).  </P> <P> After being displayed in local liquor and discount stores, the bottle settled  into more fitting digs in Beverly Hills Friday for a multiple sclerosis  fund-raiser.  </P> <P> The notion that gold-bedazzled people will reflexively empty gold from their  pockets has worked. The Pinch bottle has raised $402,000 for MS research, and  the goal is $1 million.  </P> <P> It's called the most expensive bottle in the world -- $115,000 -- but if you  count contents, in 1985, a member of the Forbes family plunked down $157,500  for a bottle of 18th-century plonk: a 1787 Chateau Lafite claret, its label  initialed by Thomas Jefferson. Within a year, the cork had dried out from  exposure to display lights, and the wine was undrinkable. But we were still  amused by its presumption.  </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> Twenty-five percent of Los Angeles County is said to fall within the boundary  of the Angeles National Forest.  </P></p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Kwik-Fit advances by 49% Property sales, cost cutting and aggressive marketing helped Kwik-Fit Holdings, the tyre, exhaust and brakes fitter, lift full year pre-tax profits by 49 per cent. Pre-tax profits in the year to February 28 increased to Pounds 25.4m, against Pounds 17.1m, on turnover which grew by 11 per cent to Pounds 260.1m (Pounds 233.6m.) The profit figures included net property profits of Pounds 4.08m (Pounds 3.74m). Earnings per share increased by 47 per cent to 10.39p (7.06p) and a final dividend of 2.3p (2p) is recommended making a total for the year up 13.4 per cent to 3.8p (3.35p). The shares closed 11p up at 167 1/2 p. Operating profits advanced 51 per cent to Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 15.3m), reflecting the benefits of higher volumes and reductions in the underlying cost base. At the year-end Kwik-Fit was operating through 626 retail centres, up from 610 a year earlier. This included 125 in Holland and Belgium and 10 in Ireland. Mr Tom Farmer, chairman, said UK sales and profit growth were achieved 'against very demanding conditions'. Operating profits increased 35 per cent to Pounds 18m on turnover up 9 per cent at Pounds 202m. The group launched a cut-price tyres campaign in November aimed at boosting volumes and market share. As a result it claimed its share of the replacement tyre market jumped by four percentage points to 18 per cent and overall sales for the year grew by 10 per cent to Pounds 108.3m. Exhaust sales grew by 4 per cent to Pounds 63.1m while revenues from the new nationwide brake fitting business grew by 40 per cent to Pounds 9.5m. Overseas operations contributed Pounds 5.1m (Pounds 2m) to profits on turnover which increased by 19 per cent to Pounds 58.1m (Pounds 49m). Net interest costs fell to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.96m) and the group ended the period with Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 100,000) of net cash. COMMENT Kwik-Fit's business is growing again, but the group faces an uphill slog to get back to its peak profit performance. Profits last year were helped by property sales, the recovery of the Dutch operations and cost reductions which will be difficult to repeat. The decision to go for volume and market share in the replacement tyre market means margins, which were already under pressure because of the shift in sales mix, will be lower. The move into the brake repair and replacement market could enable the group to make better use of its fixed cost base, but Kwik-Fit has yet to demonstrate that it can win a sizeable share of the market. Pre-tax profits this year should be about Pounds 23.5m, producing earnings of 9.6p. The shares are trading on a forward multiple of 17.4 and look fairly valued.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Wednesday [8 Jun] rejected a call from the primary opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for an extra 1.9 trillion yen to  be added to the fiscal 1994 budget.    "The government-proposed budget program is insufficient as a  means of boosting the nation's economy," LDP President Yohei  Kono said at a news conference after meeting with the premier in  the Diet building.    Citing the shortage of time for Diet deliberations, Hata  refused to comply with the LDP's request for the extra money,  Kono said.    "The government should take more active economy-spurring  steps," the LDP chief said, adding, "I am a little concerned as  to whether (Hata) really understands the importance of  pump-priming measures."    The LDP, toppled from government last summer for the first  time in 38 years, will submit to the Diet a motion calling for  the additional 1.9 trillion yen in the government's 73.1  trillion yen draft budget for the current fiscal year, which  started on April 1.    The long-overdue budget is scheduled to clear the decisive  House of Representatives on Wednesday evening.    The LDP's modification plan will demand additional spending  on public works projects, subsidies to private schools and  financial assistance to small and medium-sized companies, among  other things, LDP officials said.    It will also call for 800 billion yen in additional outlays  for public works and 900 billion yen to support small  enterprises, the officials said.    Under the proposal, the extra money should be financed  through dipping into reserves, the issuance of public bonds and  by cutting administrative costs, they said.    Kono has repeatedly warned the LDP will file a no-confidence  motion against the Hata cabinet once the budget wins Diet  approval.</p>

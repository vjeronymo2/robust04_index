			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by Hsu Chen (1776 4176): "The Truth of </F> the `Henan Incident'"]    [Text] Recently seven Hong Kong Christians headed by an  (American) "pastor" named Balcombe were handled according to law  by a mainland public security department for engaging in illegal  activities in Henan. After their return to Hong Kong, they  provided television stations with videotapes on the one hand and  held a press conference on the other to distort the facts and  make trouble.    An informed source disclosed that the seven Hong Kong  Christians were "charismatic" extremists with a U.S. background.  Balcombe had been to the mainland many times, during which he  conducted activities in violation of Chinese law. After  repeated education and warnings, he still showed no sign of  repentance. From 9 February to the early morning of 11  February, the seven people including Balcombe organized more  than 80 people for overnight gatherings inside and outside a  citizen's house in Fangcheng County, Henan Province. They  preached the Bible among the local people, taught them to sing  religious songs, prayed, and disseminated religious material  they had illegally carried into the mainland. They yelled  recklessly, made audio and video recordings, and took pictures,  seriously disturbing the people in the surrounding areas and  undermining social order. They conducted activities  incompatible with their status, thus violating the relevant  mainland law. The Henan Provincial Public Security Department  summoned the seven people for investigation, during which no  compulsory measures were taken against them, nor was any of them  beaten up. The Public Security Department confiscated the  things (including religious material totaling 40 kg) five of  them used for illegal activities; Balcombe's stay in China was  shortened and the other six were given a warning. Balcombe et  al. admitted that they had violated Chinese law, and promised  not to engage in such activities any longer.    This incident was purely a political incident deliberately  created by some people by means of religion. After their  arrival in Henan, Balcombe et al. videotaped the scenes of  people participating in religious activities and arranged  someone to carry the tapes back to Hong Kong before they left  Henan. Subsequently they intentionally waited for public  security personnel to appear for intervention. After their  return to Hong Kong, they provided the videotapes for television  stations on the one hand and held a press conference on the  other to distort the facts. Their purpose was, first, to use  religion for political activities to expand their influence.  Honest Christians in Hong Kong call this "bringing disgrace on  religion." Second, they wanted to collaborate with foreign  human rights organizations, use religious issues to create  incidents, and link religious issues to the human rights issue  and the most favored nation status to exert pressure on China.  The U.S. Department of State immediately commented on this.  What a fast response. What does this indicate!?    Most Christians in Hong Kong were indignant about their  behavior. They said that the illegal behavior of Balcombe et al.  has undermined normal and friendly exchanges between Hong Kong  and mainland Christians; more seriously, Balcombe et al. have  used this incident to attack China; this is utterly wrong.  Honest Christians should not make friends with "brothers" like  Balcombe. It was right for the Chinese public security  department to detain Balcombe and the others.</p>

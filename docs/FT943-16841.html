			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Confusion ushers in Brazil's Real Marcia sleeps on the streets of Sao Paulo and feeds herself and her six-month-old baby by begging. Yesterday, sitting in front of the shops along Avenida Brigadeiro, she had her best day ever. 'People keep giving me all their change. It's because of the new currency,' she said, leafing though a wad of grimy banknotes. She was happy, but most Brazilians were confused. The new currency, the Real, came into force yesterday to replace the inflation-plagued cruzeiro at a rate of 1 to 2,750. This awkward figure was chosen as it sets the Real at parity with the US dollar, where the government hopes to keep it. But for people queuing in banks to swap currencies, or doing their weekly shopping, pocket calculators were essential. Shopkeepers and restaurants were providing machines to customers having difficulty understanding the exchange rate, and there were complaints that some prices were too high in the new currency. 'They've converted to the Real then added 50 per cent,' said one elderly man as he left his usual lunchtime restaurant without eating. Customers stood quietly in line at banks to cast off their dirty notes and receive crisp ones in return. There were nervous smiles as the new notes were inspected, then held up to the light. New currencies, and their rapid demise, are common in Brazil. The Real is the fifth switch since 1986, all the others having been sullied by inflation, now running at 50 per cent a month. The dollar link, and a better-planned price stabilisation programme, have prompted hopes that the Real will last longer than its predecessors. Inflation is expected to fall to single figures by August. Mr Antonio Delfim Netto, an economic commentator and former planning minister, says inflation will stay low for about six months but he does not believe the Real is the 'strong' currency Brazil has been promised. 'This currency is so 'strong' that ever since we announced its link to the US dollar, the dollar has been falling against the yen,' he said sarcastically.</p>

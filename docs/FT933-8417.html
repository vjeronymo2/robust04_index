			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Construction Contracts: International concert hall LAING NORTH WEST has been appointed to build Manchester's international concert hall, the new home for the Halle. Work is due to start on site today with completion scheduled for February 1996. The total cost of the project will be around Pounds 42m. The company's bid for the main building contract was accepted by the partners in the venture, Manchester City Council and Central Manchester Development Corporation, who are jointly funding the project with the aid of a 40 per cent grant from the European Regional Development Fund. Laing North West won the contract in competition with four other large construction companies, shortlisted from 30 leading companies who expressed an interest in the project. Preparation work has been completed by P Casey (Civil Engineering), which has removed 26,000 tonnes of soil to make way for the concert hall. It has also put in the foundations for the building, including more than 150 reinforced concrete columns. One of Laing's first jobs on site will be to install vibration isolation bearings on to the columns - creating a foundation of springs - to isolate the hall from passing traffic, including Metrolink trams.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> WRONG BRINK'S CAR ROBBED, POLICE SAY  </P> <P> San Francisco police believe that the two gunmen who attacked a Brink's Inc.  armored car three months ago, killing a company messenger and escaping without  any money, mistakenly attacked the wrong vehicle. Another armored truck  carrying more than $500,000 was scheduled to arrive at the Bank of America  branch about the same time on Sept. 7, but was delayed by traffic,  investigators disclosed. "It looks like they may have been planning to hit that  one but got it confused with this one instead," said Lt. John Brunner of the  robbery detail. The Brink's employees had just delivered more than $5,000 in  Canadian currency when they were attacked. One of the robbers shot and killed  one of the messengers and wounded his partner and a bystander who came to the  Brink's employees' aid. The robbers escaped on bicycles.  </P></p>

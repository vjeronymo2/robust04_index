			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Materials demand widens trade gap The UK's visible trade deficit with countries outside the European Union widened slightly last month, as the recent manufacturing growth sucked in more raw materials. But export volumes rose to a new record, and the underlying trade pattern continued to point to a relatively benign trend. The Central Statistical Office yesterday said the trade deficit with non-EU countries - which account for almost half of all UK trade - was Pounds 410m in October, up from a deficit of Pounds 333m in September. A surprising deterioration in the oil balance accounted for some of the increase. In the three months to October, compared with the previous three months, the value of oil exports fell 17 per cent. The CSO said the drop partly reflected the fact that oil exports to North America had surged in the summer. Measured without oil, the trade deficit fell slightly in October. Excluding both oil and erratics, and calculated on a three-monthly basis - a measurement that represents the best guide to the underlying trend - the deficit was Pounds 1.09bn in the three months to October, down from Pounds 1.44bn in the previous three months. A rise in imports was the other reason for the deficit widening. The total value of imports rose 1 per cent in October, compared with September, while import volumes grew 4 per cent. The total value of exports fell 0.5 per cent in the month, while export volumes grew only 2.5 per cent. The rise in imports was primarily generated by increased demand for industrial raw materials, which reflected the broader recovery in manufacturing in recent months. Imports of pulp, paper, textiles and other raw materials grew in the month, the CSO said, with overall imports of basic materials running 6.5 per cent higher in the three months to October compared with the previous three months. Compared with the same period a year ago, imports of raw materials were 16 per cent higher. Imports of consumer goods dropped significantly, running 6.5 per cent lower in the three months to October compared with the previous three months. Analysts yesterday said that the fall in imported consumer goods reflected weak consumer demand and possibly some import substitution. Economists were divided about the broader implications of the rise in industrial import volumes. Mr Jonathan Loynes, economist at Midland Global Markets, pointed out that rising imports of basic materials suggested that industrial production would rise in the months ahead, and said that the downward trend in the deficit was continuing. But Mr Chris Dillow, economist at Nomura, Japanese securities house, said the deficit was likely to deteriorate further, as rising demand sucked in more imports, while the recent strengthening of sterling could reduce exports further.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VALUE OF TRADE WITH NON-EU COUNTRIES Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted (Pounds m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               Ex oil and erratics*             Exports   Imports   Balance   Exports   Imports    Balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993         57,469    66,724    -9,255    50,036    57,415     -7,379 1993  Q4     15,235    16,856    -1,621    13,583    14,969     -1,386 1994  Q1     15,323    17,430    -2,107    13,263    15,217     -1,954       Q2     15,665    17,166    -1,501    13,571    15,178     -1,607       Q3     16,210    17,207      -997    14,005    15,096     -1,091 May           5,126     5,768      -642     4,494     5,053       -559 June          5,289     5,697      -408     4,566     5,046       -480 July          5,445     5,803      -358     4,616     5,013       -397 August        5,412     5,718      -306     4,672     5,040       -368 September     5,353     5,686      -333     4,717     5,043       -326 October       5,333     5,743      -410     4,758     5,158       -400  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CSO.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Doctors said the prognosis was good for a 7-year-old boy who fell through ice  and was submerged in 40-degree water for nearly 20 minutes on Presque Isle Bay  near Erie, Pa. Dwayne Peterson, in intensive care at St. Vincent Health Center,  was fishing with his father when he fell through ice into the bay. He had no  heartbeat when he was eventually pulled from the bay by John Wronek of the Erie  County Sheriff's Department Search and Rescue SCUBA Team.  </P></p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Television (Sunday): An in-depth look at the Channel tunnel Serious Money presents a discussion about the future of the Channel tunnel: will it revolutionise trade and travel or (given that everyone you speak to says the same thing: 'I wouldn't dream of using it unless it was much cheaper than the alternatives') is it doomed to economic failure? Among the participants are Alistair Morton, Chairman of Eurotunnel, and Bob Reid, Chairman of British Rail (5.15 C4). Though Pie In The Sky is not the most zippy or compelling detective series it has quickly become a regular fixture in our household. Mrs D. (caterer) approves of Henry Crabbe's approach to catering and Mr D. (greedy pig) imagines he would like Crabbe's cooking. Both enjoy the foodie jokes, and the police element is proficient enough yet satisfactorily secondary. Merely watching Richard Griffiths move about is rather wonderful (7.30 BBC1). Did presenter Pete McCarthy dream up Travelog In France? Visiting four contrasting regions, we are told, he starts his search for 'the real France' in the local bar in each instance. 'I've got this idea for a series: I nip across the Channel and lounge about in the boozers soaking up the atmosphere. What do you think?' Brilliant Pete (8.10 C4). Today's drama in the Arena Relics series is based upon the bizarre case of Charlie Chaplin's disappearing coffin: in 1978 it was stolen from his grave in Switzerland and a ransom was demanded from his widow (8.35 BBC2). Best movie of the day is The Maltese Falcon, John Huston's 1941 thriller with Bogart as gumshoe Sam Spade and the villains played by Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet (11.00 BBC1).</p>

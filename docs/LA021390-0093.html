			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COLORADO;  </P> <P> ASPEN FUR BAN PLAN GOES TO THE VOTERS  </P> <P> A record voter turnout is possible in the swanky ski town of Aspen today for a  referendum on proposals to ban the sale of fur and cut the size of a proposed  $80-million hotel.  </P> <P> Kathy Strickland, deputy city clerk, said she expects the two issues to draw  out a large majority of the resort's 3,739 registered voters. If approved, the  fur ban pushed by Mayor Bill Stirling would prohibit the sale of wild-animal  furs, which would shut down the town's four fur-clothing stores. Opponents of  the proposed Ritz-Carlton Hotel at the foot of Aspen Mountain want the 292-room  hotel cut in size by one-third.  </P></p>

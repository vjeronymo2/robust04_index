			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Commonwealth Bank profits fall COMMONWEALTH Bank, the leading Australian financial institution, has announced a big fall in earnings in its first full-year as a publicly-quoted company. The federal government-controlled bank, which floated 30 per cent of its capital last year, sustained a 54 per cent slide in net profits to ADollars 408.8m (USDollars 292m) for the 12 months to June from ADollars 883.3m the year before. However, the figures released yesterday suggest underlying profits improved. Excluding abnormals, net profits rose to ADollars 455.2m from ADollars 279.9m. The distorting factor was an ADollars 608.8m abnormal profit in the previous year. The directors announced a 20 cents a share final dividend, bringing the bank's first annual payout to public shareholders to 40 cents a share and making a dividend ratio of 82 per cent. Commonwealth Bank maintained its 'conservative' image by reporting sharply lower bad debt write-offs and problem loans than its long-standing public rivals, Westpac, ANZ and National Australia Bank, which all recently reported for the first half to March. The Commonwealth bank reported reduced bad and doubtful debt write-offs, down to ADollars 843m from ADollars 1.03bn, with total problem loans easing to ADollars 3.41bn from ADollars 3.45bn. Mr David Murray, managing director, said the bank's capital adequacy ratio had improved to 9.9 per cent at the latest balance date, from 8.73 at June 30 last year - before the flotation, but just after the bank acquired the State Bank of Victoria. This compares with an Australian Reserve Bank minimum ratio of 8 per cent. Mr Murray sought to distancehis bank from the property valuation problems besetting other leading Australian banks. He said a review of its commercial property exposures, involving about ADollars 8bn worth of property, had confirmed the adequacy of values and provisions. 'The bank does not have any material involvement in property development activities, either directly, through subsidiaries, or through joint ventures in Australia or offshore,' he said. But he said the bank's results continued to reflect the effects of the deep and widespread recession in Australia. 'Economic recovery is weak and patchy,' he said. 'The current year is likely to feature continuing low demand for lending business, making our commitment to cost control, improved efficiency and enhanced customer service critical to better profit performance.' A divisional earnings breakdown showed banking operations lifted their contribution to ADollars 385.5m from ADollars 207.4m, and the financial services division boosted its result to ADollars 11.8m from ADollars 6.2m. The New Zealand-based ASB Bank turned in an almost static profit of ADollars 28m from ADollars 28.4m. Westpac has brought forward the date of its annual meeting by almost a month to January 19. The bank has also changed the requirement for removal of directors from a 75 per cent majority to a simple majority.</p>

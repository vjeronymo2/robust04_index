			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST EXECUTIVE'S BOND PORTFOLIO IS AVERAGE JUNK;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: COMPANY PRESIDENT AND CEO FRED CARR USED TO BOAST ABOUT HIS SAVVY  BOND BUYS. NOW HIS HIGHLY PROFITABLE PORTFOLIO HAS PLUMMETED BY $1.9 BILLION.  </P> <P> Fred Carr was once lauded for providing his insurance company's policyholders  and shareholders with heady returns through his active and savvy management of  a massive pool of risky investments.  </P> <P> But an analysis of Carr's investment portfolio reveals that he has done no  better than the average junk bond buyer -- which is dismal now that the junk  bond market has gone into the tank.  </P> <P> Carr, president and chief executive of First Executive Corp., has been one of  the nation's biggest buyers of this high-yield debt since it became popular in  the early 1980s. He's boasted in the past about cleverness in weeding through  the issues to pick only the very best bonds.  </P> <P> But, almost overnight, Carr's gone from hero to bum. His company's profits have  evaporated. His policyholders are abandoning First Executive's operating  subsidiaries, Executive Life Insurance Co. and Executive Life of New York, in  droves. And his biggest shareholders are talking about an ouster.  </P> <P> The reason for the turnaround? Carr's once highly profitable bond portfolio has  declined in value by at least $1.9 billion. And the future performance of the  highly volatile and risky junk bond market is pivotal to the Los Angeles  insurer's very survival, industry experts said.  </P> <P> "There are two things that can do them in: a large number of defaults in the  junk bonds they hold or a run on the bank, which would force them to realize  some of the unrecognized losses in their junk portfolio," said Frederick  Townsend, president of Townsend &amp; Schupp, a Hartford, Conn., research firm.  </P> <P> Still, according to industry experts and an analysis of a segment of First  Executive's high-yield bond portfolio by the Los Angeles Times, he's done no  better or worse than the average junk buyer.  </P> <P> The Times examined Executive Life's investment portfolio, as described in state  Insurance Department filings and selected a group of 30 bonds in an attempt to  reflect the overall package, both good and bad. The criteria for choosing the  bonds was that they are actively traded and purchased by First Executive in  relatively large quantities. The company's purchases and sales of these 30  issues were then tracked through the third quarter of 1989, the most recent  period for which data is available, to determine performance.  </P> <P> Overall, the market value of this sample portfolio has slid about 20%, to less  than $1.1 billion from $1.38 billion. Industry experts caution that the  company's total portfolio probably would have deteriorated more because this  analysis does not include rarely traded issues, which generally sell at steeper  discounts. First Executive has a wide variety of these hard-to-sell bonds, but  they were not included in the sample because it is virtually impossible to get  accurate market prices for them.  </P> <P> First Executive has said its total portfolio has declined in value by $1.9  billion -- roughly a 30% drop.  </P> <P> But a 20% to 30% decline is not unusual these days, said Michael Singer,  president of R. D. Smith &amp; Co., a New York firm that specializes in buying  and selling securities issued by troubled companies. Some of the publicly  traded mutual funds that invest in junk bonds have seen asset values decline as  much as 40%, he said.  </P> <P> First Executive's junk bond portfolio reflects the market as a whole, added  another industry expert.  </P> <P> "They haven't done a particularly bad job or a particularly good job. They've  just ridden the market down," he said. "I don't believe they've suffered  disproportionately."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, it is a far cry from Carr's claims of only six years ago, when he  was taking bows for First Executive's financial successes and fast growth. At  the time, Carr maintained that the generous yields on junk bonds were more a  product of inefficiencies in the marketplace than real credit risk.  Additionally, he said he was able to wade through the junk issues to find the  gems.  </P> <P> The Times' review of Executive Life's $10.6-billion bond portfolio revealed a  number of gems and plenty of junk.  </P> <P> First Executive, through its insurance subsidiaries, has invested heavily in  now bankrupt companies such as Hillsborough Holdings, Allied Stores, Federated  Department Stores and Southmark Corp., but it also has bought the securities of  thriving firms such as Holiday Inns, Viacom and FMC Corp.  </P> <P> To be specific:  </P> <P> * The company assembled a $155.5-million stake in Hillsborough Holdings, a  bankrupt firm that issued bonds in connection with a Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  &amp; Co. buyout of the former Jim Walter Corp. Hillsborough's bonds are now  worth about 15 cents on the dollar, leaving Executive Life with roughly $116  million in paper losses.  </P> <P> * It bought $26.75 million of Integrated Resources' debt. Integrated, a  financial services and limited partnership concern, is now so troubled that its  debt sells for about 2 cents on the dollar. First Executive's paper losses  amount to just over $26 million.  </P> <P> * First Executive also snapped up nearly $130 million of E-II Holdings' bonds.  E-II debt, which is controlled by Meshulam Riklis, now sells for 60 to 65 cents  on the dollar, even though Riklis has extended a tender offer that would pay  bondholders slightly more. First Executive's paper losses: about $46 million.  </P> <P> On the other hand, even in the currently depressed junk market, First Executive  can point to a handful of success stories.  </P> <P> * For example, First Executive spent about $30.4 million on Multimedia Corp.  bonds. When the insurer bought its stake, Multimedia's debt was depressed,  selling for about 54 cents on the dollar. It has since recovered, and First  Executive has a paper profit of about $20 million on the holding.  </P> <P> * It also bought a $108.3-million stake in Holiday Inns' senior notes. Holiday  has offered to buy back its debt at a premium. First Executive should post a  $4.3-million profit on the deal.  </P> <P> * The company's $64.9-million holding in Occidental Petroleum's senior  subordinated notes has also appreciated, although more modestly. It is now  worth about $670,000 more than First Executive paid.  </P> <P> A number of other issues in First Executive's portfolio are extremely healthy  and have declined in value only because of the market's malaise, industry  experts said. If the company can wait to sell these issues until they mature or  the market recovers, it should do well. Among those issues are Healthtrust  Hospital Corp., McCaw Cellular, Mattel and Viacom.  </P> <P> Yet some big institutional holders of First Executive stock are critical of  Carr's portfolio management, partly because he acknowledged as much as two  years ago that the junk bond market was getting overvalued.  </P> <P> "Fred has mentioned in many public forums over the past two years that junk  bonds were overpriced," said the owner of one big East Coast money management  firm. "But there was no recognition on his part of the desirability of selling  them."  </P> <P> Now, opportunities to sell the bonds are limited and investors are angry that  Carr bet the company on such a speculative investment.  </P> <P> Moreover, they point to Carr's past claims that his active management of the  portfolio would guide the company through hard times. Carr has also been openly  critical of other insurers in the past, maintaining that their conservative  investment philosophies left them with low-yielding securities that, if written  down to current market values, would wipe out the net worth at a number of  these companies.  </P> <P> Instead, he said, insurers should trade their investments to generate  investment gains.  </P> <P> In a 1984 interview with The Times, for example, Carr said: "If your portfolio  doesn't generate capital gains consistently, if investors are not interested in  buying what you have, then you are not buying the right things." Capital gains  are generated when a company sells an investment at a profit.  </P> <P> Ironically, if Carr were forced to mark his investment portfolio down to  current market values, it would wipe out First Executive's net worth -- a  scenario he once described as "not just bad but catastrophic" when speaking of  his competitors.  </P> <P> And recently, First Executive has been better at damage control than generating  capital gains.  </P> <P> The company had a $30.1-million stake in Southmark Corp. at year-end 1988, for  example. But sensing severe problems at the company, First Executive began to  unload the bulk of its Southmark holdings last year. Southmark filed for  bankruptcy protection earlier this year, and its bonds now sell for about 16  cents on the dollar. Although First Executive has recognized losses of about  $14.5 million on the investment, its losses would have surpassed $25 million  had it held onto the bonds.  </P> <P> The company also sold its Allied Stores senior notes last year, which cut its  losses to $5.4 million, compared to the potential loss of $8.3 million if those  bonds were still in its portfolio.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, industry experts are uncertain about First Executive's  future, which they say almost completely hinges on the future performance of  the junk bond market.  </P> <P> "We would still say there is a fairly low chance of a meltdown" at First  Executive, said Weston Hicks, vice president and associate director of Moody's  Investors Service in New York. "But that's not to say there is no chance."  </P> <P> FIRST EXECUTIVE HOLDINGS: A SAMPLER  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.31IN:2.66IN:2.55IN:2.55IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW>

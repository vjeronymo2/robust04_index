The hike is the lowest since a 1.55 percent increase  implemented in 1987, when the Japanese economy was hit by a  recession induced by a strong yen.    Major electric machinery makers also decided on a 3.1  percent  wage increase, down 0.5 percentage point from the previous year  and their lowest ever.    The sources said management at the firms originally tried to  curb fiscal 1994 wage hikes as much as possible but finally  became more concessionary.    They said steelmakers softened their stance because of  planned large-scale restructuring involving labor cuts. Nippon  Steel Corp., Japan's top steelmaker, for instance, plans a cut  of 7,000 employees.    Managers of electric machinery firms, meanwhile, have taken  into account a firm business showing in recent months,  especially for microchips and heavy electric machinery, the  sources said.    Unions with electric machinery firms and steelmakers both  belong to the Japan Council of Metal Workers' Unions. The car,  shipbuilding and heavy electric machinery industries, also  council members, are still in the middle of negotiations on the  monthly wage hikes.    Shipbuilding and heavy electric machinery firms originally  demanded a 3.41 percent, or 10,000 yen, rise in the monthly  wages, citing a relatively healthy performance of the industry,  but management has maintained that a high wage increase would  undermine the industry's international competitiveness.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Feudal system in the sky: The obstacles to restructuring and profitability at the airline In putting off the radical restructuring of Air France, the French government is taking an enormous gamble. According to Mr Bernard Attali, who quit as chairman of Air France on Sunday, the government has simply lost its nerve. The airline union had strongly opposed Mr Attali's restructuring plan, involving 4,000 job cuts, a reduction in routes and capacity, and the sale of non-core assets including a stake in the Meridien hotel chain. The survival of Air France is not at risk, so long as the French government continues to see it as a strategic national asset. But its viability as a profitable international airline is in the balance. Lean and aggressive US carriers have whittled away at Air France's share of the North Atlantic routes. Between 1991 and 1992, Air France increased its north Atlantic capacity by 8 per cent. The US carriers increased theirs by 30 per cent. This is also evident in airline growth measured by revenue passenger kilometres, the most common industry measure - the number of fare-paying passengers multiplied by the number of kilometres flown. European deregulation took off at the start of this year, giving carriers new freedom to operate in other European countries. Lufthansa has launched a low-wage-cost subsidiary for short-haul routes as part of a programme that includes 8,000 job losses. BA, too, pays lower wages on its BA regional operation which works out of non-London UK airports. A year ago, it also took over the low-cost operation of Gatwick-based Dan-Air, and has a stake in budget French carrier, TAT. This shows up in productivity figures. Between 1988 and last year, Air France's sales per employee rose 12 per cent to Dollars 168,000. At Lufthansa, the rise was 22 per cent to Dollars 173,000; at BA, the increase was 32 per cent to Dollars 190,000. Mr Attali conceded two weeks ago Air France had been slow to address its cost base - one of the heaviest in the industry. The risk was the airline could be left behind when its main competitors were already well down the road of restructuring and were showing improvements in profitability. Even Lufthansa of Germany, with its own difficult labour situation, has won important concessions from its union and is showing signs of improvement. For Air France, the old 'fortress France' strategy is beginning to show deep cracks. Government protection has been increasingly undermined by the global nature of the airline business and the European Commission's resolve to open up European skies and clamp down on state subsidies. Air France has recently lobbied the EC's committee of 'wise men' investigating the problems of the European airline industry, pleading for a return to controls on capacity and fares and for EC funding for troubled airlines. This has been rejected, under pressure from a powerful lobby of more liberal member states including the UK and the Netherlands. As Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, told the EC wise men, if an airline was unable to restructure itself to become competitive it should be allowed to go out of business. All airlines have been hit by overcapacity and prolonged recession. Air France has been worse hit because the French market, now in deep recession, accounts for about 40 per cent of its traffic. Mr Attali's strategic acquisitions and marketing partnerships have strengthened Air France's international reach. But underlying problems must still be addressed. Apart from entrenched union opposition, it has lacked strong management. This reflects its political nature. Air France has been run more by civil servants than by professional airline managers. Mr Attali was no exception. He took over four years ago because he was strongly favoured by the Elysee palace, where his brother, Mr Jacques Attali, had long been a close confidant of President Mitterrand. Air France has been a feudal barony, with management factions fighting each other, with the sides being decided by political and civil service colours. Mr Attali accepted the need for change, but attempted a delicate balance between restructuring and maintaining the political consensus to enable him to run the airline. Market pressures forced him to act vigorously. Indeed, he claimed the government had been closely consulted in his latest restructuring plan and that he had its full backing until a few days ago. The risk now is that, as the rest of the industry starts to recover, Air France will still be shackled by its past and will fail to take advantage of the eventual recovery cycle in the airline industry. Even if the government is prepared to pay this price, it may find it particularly difficult to continue supporting the airline when state aids are coming under attack from Brussels and other big international carriers are turning themselves into fitter competitors.</p>

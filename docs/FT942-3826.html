			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Recovery may prove a moving experience - NFC NFC's performance is viewed as a bellwether indicator of economic activity, so the transport and logistics group's interim results due out on Wednesday will be carefully scrutinised. In March the group, which reports its results on a quarterly basis, reported an 11 per cent increase in underlying growth. At that stage the company, which derives around two thirds of its revenues from the UK, said the domestic economic recovery remained variable, and noted there were no signs of recovery in continental Europe. The second quarter is traditionally the weakest for NFC and year-on-year comparisons this time around will be particularly onerous because the year-ago figures were flattered by the Pounds 50m profit on the sale of the group's waste management arm. Reflecting this, first half pre-tax profits on an FRS3 basis are likely to fall from Pounds 86.6m to Pounds 53m. However they should show healthy growth from Pounds 37.5m to about Pounds 49m on a normalised basis as the recovery in the US and UK economies begins to pull more consumer goods through the distribution pipeline serviced by NFC's logistic operations. Meanwhile the upturn in the housing markets should help Pickfords moving services but investors will also be looking for further clarification on the future of Lynx, the loss-making parcels business. Earnings growth will continue to be held back by the dilutive effects of the Pounds 263m rights issue completed in January which has nevertheless removed balance sheet pressures and provided additional flexibility to expand the distribution and removal businesses internationally. NFC has already used some of the resulting Pounds 89.4m net cash to fund a handful of modest-sized acquisitions including several overseas.</p>

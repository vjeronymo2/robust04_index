			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Hopes for end to Malaysian ban There was growing optimism last night that the Malaysian ban on government contracts with British companies would soon end. Mr Mohamad Mahathir, the Malaysian prime minister, said in Paris yesterday that the ban would continue for the foreseeable future, but only selectively. 'Trade goes on as usual, but we will not give any more government contracts to British firms,' he said at the start of a three-day visit to France. The Department of Trade and Industry confirmed the growing optimism, although it made no comment about Dr Matathir's statement. Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, told the British Overseas Trade Board earlier this week that British business in Malaysia was 'returning to normal'. However, a growing number of Malaysian officials and businessmen are talking to British companies behind the scenes on the expectation that the ban will be lifted soon. This is in spite of a strong minority of nationalist opinion in Kuala Lumpur against resuming any links with the UK. 'There is no longer the same degree of nervousness as there was before,' said one UK banker. In spite of the ban on government contracts, two British companies have announced Malaysian deals this week. Wilton Group yesterday unveiled a joint venture to build and operate a chain of multi-screen cinemas in Malaysia. On Wednesday, Trinity Holdings announced a deal to supply and build buses. The Malaysian cabinet is known to have agreed two weeks ago that the ban on government contracts with British companies could be lifted, but that the precise timing would be left to the prime minister. Given the unpredictability of Malaysian government decisions in the past, some trade sources urged caution. British officials appear to be marking time, drawing back from making any provocative statements that might endanger the prospect of a rapprochement. The continuing vulnerability of some British companies because of the partial ban was underlined last month when a planned joint venture between Rolls-Royce and Malaysia's EPE Power Corporation was suspended. The ban on Malaysia government contracts with British companies was announced in February because of Mr Mahathir's anger over UK press reports alleging corruption in the granting of some contracts.

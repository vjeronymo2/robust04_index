Guatemalan society rejects corruption, deceit, schemes, and  fraud, and it refuses to continue to live with the impunity with  which those state organizations act.    The 30 January referendum plans to legitimize the despicable  political and moral conduct that has prevailed in the state  branches for years.    The announced constitutional reforms are not the ones  Guatemala needs and demands; they are schemes hatched behind  civilian society's back that deliberately intend to worsen the  national crisis.    The causes that led to the May 1993 coup d'etat remain  unsolved. In-depth reforms, based on a different project for the  construction of a new nation, are necessary to solve the  institutional crisis.</p>

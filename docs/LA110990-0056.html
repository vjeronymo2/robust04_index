			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LETTERS IN VIEW;  </P> <P> MAX THE MOUTH FROM THE N.Y. TIMES  </P> <P> The New York Times' editor Max Frankel should be forced to wear a muzzle for  his own safety. How can he possibly edit others when his own mouth is a  disaster area? If it is indeed true that his women and black employees are  given the "nod," and "put on the fast track," he shouldn't rub the white males'  noses in it.  </P> <P> JOHN DEGATINA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Personal pensions - predictions, incentives, and now a compensation loop? (1) Sir, I imagine that few tears are being shed for the life insurance industry as it contemplates the compensation bill for the personal pensions scandal ('The high cost of bad advice', October 26). However, there is an unfortunate tendency in the media to talk about the 'pensions' industry when reporting the issue. This risks further damaging the already somewhat tarnished image of occupational pension schemes in a way which would be completely unfair. It is very easy in these situations to be wise after the event. However, in this case - and it makes the scandal much worse - the pensions industry predicted that this would happen. During 1986 and 1987 pension scheme trustees, employers and advisers fought a campaign to warn government of the consequences of unleashing a commission-hungry salesforce on vulnerable people faced with complex financial choices. Self-regulation never stood a chance, but government, fired with ideology about personal choice and encouraged from the sidelines by a life insurance industry smacking its lips, dismissed this campaign as paternalistic vested interest. The rest, as they say, is history. While it must now be the responsibility of the life insurance industry to foot the bill, it is to be hoped that occupational pension schemes will co-operate fully in the process of repairing the damage by re-admitting those who have lost out. And may the UK working population then recognise who its friends really are. R S Parkin, White Holm, Pebble Hill Road, Betchworth, Surrey RH3 7BP</p>

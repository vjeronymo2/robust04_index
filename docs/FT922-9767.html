			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: ITT to repurchase shares ITT, the US conglomerate, said yesterday it had authorised a new share buyback programme, covering up to 25m shares. The company started the previous repurchase programme in 1987, and has bought in 20.3m ordinary shares and 1.2m preferred shares to date. Mr Rand Araskog, ITT's chairman, told the annual meeting that shareholders would 'see a good deal of action intended to accomplish our goal of a better share price'. According to agency reports, he said the restructuring moves should simplify the company and improve its focus. Shares in ITT rallied earlier this year after it announced it was selling its remaining 30 per cent stake in Alcatel, the French telecommunications group, to partner Alcatel Alsthom, and following publication of an interview with Mr Araskog in the Financial Times. This quoted Mr Araskog as saying the company wanted to make itself more exciting to investors. ITT later denied that spinning off its Hartford insurance company as a separate unit was a likely option.</p>

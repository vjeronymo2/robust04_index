			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Daf vans staff accept pay cut to aid buy-out WORKERS at Leyland Daf's van plant in Birmingham agreed yesterday to accept a pay cut of up to 8 per cent and longer hours to help a management buy-out of the threatened plant. Most of the 1,000 employees, who accepted the deal by a large majority in a secret ballot, will have their wages cut by 5 per cent - a Pounds 12.50 reduction in the average weekly wage of Pounds 250. But some staff who received a 3 per cent rise in January, before the company went into receivership, will lose that increase as well as the 5 per cent cut. The pay cut will hit everybody at the Birmingham plant from the boardroom to the shopfloor. Directors stand to lose Pounds 3,000 a year as a result. Trade union negotiators were reluctant to agree to the deal, which involves longer working hours, a deterioration in the value of pension benefits and lower levels of redundancy payment. Mr John Allen, chief negotiator of the AEEU engineering and electrical union, said yesterday: 'We only see this as an interim measure to help the buy-out team. We will be back as soon as the company shows signs of profitability to seek a restoration of salaries.' Mr Tony Woodley, chief negotiator for the TGWU general union, said that the cut in pay was designed to help in the 'successful launch' of the new Daf operation. He added that his union was also looking forward to restoring the cut 'as soon as possible'. The pay cut is being linked to an element of profit-related pay, although the details of this were not revealed. Leyland Daf said yesterday: 'A profit-related element is one way that all the employees can contribute to the success of the new company. We have to remain competitive and cut every cost we can. It will be reinvested in the future of the company.' Union officials privately see the pay deal as a model for what may be needed to save the other Leyland Daf plants which are in the hands of the receiver. These include the truck plant at Leyland in Lancashire, the warehouse operations in nearby Chorley and the axle plant in Glasgow. The details of the management buyout at the Birmingham plant are expected to be announced this Friday. Leyland Daf's receivers have reached a settlement with Automotive Products, part of the BBA group, allowing a resumption of the supply by AP of brakes and clutches. A legal dispute had threatened to halt production at the van and truck plants. AP had refused to supply components pending settlement of its claim for the Pounds 758,000 it was owed when Leyland Daf went into administrative receivership in February. AP has also reached agreement with the management buy-out teams at both plants on long-term supply contracts.</p>

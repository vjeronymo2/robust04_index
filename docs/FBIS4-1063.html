			<p>BFN     [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi says the party has no plans to enter into an alliance  with another party. Speaking to reporters on his arrival at a  rally outside the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly at Ulundi, Dr.  Buthelezi admitted that there was little time left for the IFP  to campaign. He said this would make it difficult for the party  to reach out to all its followers and that it could be a  setback. Tens of thousands of IFP supporters are gathered  outside the assembly to listen to Dr. Buthelezi.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Anglovaal's global issue oversubscribed The first international equity offering for a South African company since the recent elections - Dollars 68m of N shares for Anglovaal - was three times oversubscribed. S. G. Warburg, the UK investment bank which was bookrunner for the underwriting group, described it as 'a landmark issue that bodes well for South Africa's future in the international capital markets'. Mr Basil Hersov, chairman of Anglovaal, a diversified industrial and mining group, said the placing 'has shown that premier institutions in Europe and the US are not just interested in learning more about the South Africa story but are also willing to take the step to invest'. About half the demand for shares came from the US. The Anglovaal shares, to be listed in South Africa and London, were priced at Dollars 27.33 each share or American depositary receipt, which, when translated at the rand exchange rate at the time of pricing, represented R129. This compared with a closing bid price on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange of R130.</p>

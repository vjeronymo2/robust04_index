			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency believes that the best way to resolve this potential problem is to specify simple procedures concerning the determination of value added in the U.S./Canada. NHTSA notes that the total value of an item of passenger motor vehicle equipment is determined under &sect;583.6(b). The relevant issue, therefore, is what part of that total value represents value added in the U.S./Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA agrees with APMA that the basic way suppliers add value in the U.S./Canada is by producing or assembling passenger motor vehicle equipment within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada. The simplest method of determining the value added in the U.S./Canada for equipment produced or assembled within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada is to subtract from the total value of the equipment the value of any foreign materials used in such production or assembly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The clarifying procedures therefore specify that, in determining the value added in the United States or Canada of passenger motor vehicle equipment produced or assembled within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada, the cost of all foreign materials is subtracted from the total value (e.g., the price paid at the final assembly plant) of the equipment. The procedures also specify that material is considered foreign to whatever extent part or all of the cost of the material is not determined to represent value added in the United States or Canada, traced back to raw materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this approach, neither suppliers nor anyone else is required to trace the value added in the United States or Canada back to raw materials; however, any portion of the cost of a material which is not traced to value added in the United States or Canada is considered foreign. NHTSA believes that this approach is consistent with section 210(f)(16), which specifies that ``foreign'' or ``foreign content'' mean ``passenger motor vehicle equipment not determined to be U.S./Canadian origin.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The clarifying procedures also provide that for any material which is imported into the United States or Canada from a third country, the value added in the United States or Canada is zero, even if part of the material originated in the United States or Canada. For purposes of simplicity and consistency, NHTSA believes it is appropriate to deem any materials which are imported in the United States or Canada from a third country as foreign. The agency believes that any attempt to separate out the possible portion of such materials that may have originated in the United States or Canada would involve extremely complex issues concerning how various costs are attributed to different countries. This would not provide significantly more useful information to the consumer, but would require a much more complicated regulatory scheme. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA notes that APMA recommended a somewhat different approach with respect to the treatment of foreign material. Under its suggested provision, foreign material would be limited to materials which have been produced or assembled outside of the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada and which have not undergone any further production or other operation within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada before being received by such supplier or an affiliate of such supplier. The problem with this recommended provision is that the entire value of foreign material which has undergone further production or other operation within the U.S./Canada would be transformed into value added in the U.S./Canada. This would create a giant loophole by which foreign material could be transformed into U.S./Canadian content. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The above discussion has primarily concerned determining the value added in the United States or Canada of passenger motor vehicle equipment produced or assembled within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada. For equipment which is imported into the United States or Canada from a third country, the clarifying regulations specify that the value added in the United States or Canada is zero. The agency is taking this approach for the same reasons discussed above with respect to imported material that is used to produce or assemble passenger motor vehicle within the United States or Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The clarifying regulations also specify that the payment of duty does not result in value added in the United States or Canada. While it may be necessary to pay duty as a condition of an item crossing a national border, such payment does not add any value to the item in the country to which duty is paid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA is also including a provision which specifies that if a manufacturer or allied supplier does not receive information from one or more of its suppliers concerning the U.S./Canadian content of particular equipment, the U.S./Canadian content of that equipment is considered zero. While the agency does not believe that this situation will occur very often, the provision ensures that U.S./Canadian content is not overstated as a result of the manufacturer or allied supplier simply assuming that equipment is of U.S./Canadian origin in the absence of information from the supplier. The provision does not affect the obligation of manufacturers and allied suppliers to request this information from their suppliers or the obligation of the suppliers to provide the information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the total value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GM stated that the agency had proposed that the proper method to establish the U.S./Canadian content for a carline is to estimate the installation rates for all equipment options and choices offered on that carline multiplied by the U.S./Canadian content value for each option or choice divided by the total value for all equipment, domestic or foreign. That company stated that it has found for cost management and planning purposes that the use of a high volume configuration carline model results in better management control of the assembly process than the so called average equipped carline model. GM stated that such a model has found wide acceptance in calculations made for corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) emission testing configurations, and most recently, for vehicle configurations under NAFTA. That company recommended that the agency permit manufacturers to use established carline cost management models for establishing the percentage U.S./Canadian content required to be included in the AALA domestic content label. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> JAMA stated that it understands that it is NHTSA's intention that manufacturers project the sales mix of all of the potentially many models within a carline, including differences in series, engine type, transmission type, and other optional equipment, and to perform the weighted average carline calculation based on this model and equipment mix. That organization stated that it believes this calculation method would impose an unnecessarily great burden on manufacturers without a significant increase in the accuracy of the computed percentage. It recommended that agency permit a manufacturer, at its option, to use the U.S./Canadian parts content of a specific model, e.g., the best selling model of a carline, on a projected sales basis, which is considered to reasonably represent the entire carline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

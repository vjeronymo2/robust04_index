			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Names deal more likely Hopes rose yesterday for an out-of-court settlement in a legal action involving 366 lossmaking Lloyd's Names - individuals whose assets support the insurance market. The Names, members of Pulbrook syndicate 334, face losses of more than Pounds 44m on business underwritten in 1985. Their case, which began in the High Court last week, is the first of more than two dozen planned by lossmakers scheduled to come to court over the next few years. Most of the lossmakers blame negligence by their agents for losses of more than Pounds 3bn. An offer to the Pulbrook Names - which is understood to be under consideration - would need be to more attractive to the Names than the Pounds 2.5m offered them as part of Lloyd's overall settlement package, rejected last month. One possibility is that the money could be used to buy a reinsurance policy allowing the Names to cap losses that have still to emerge on syndicate 334. Chatset, the company which monitors Lloyd's, estimates that syndicate 334's losses could ultimately exceed Pounds 100m. According to one estimate, a policy to reinsure such liabilities could cost between Pounds 21m and Pounds 27m. Separately, it is understood that the House of Lords has agreed to hear an appeal in a case by Lloyd's agents on a preliminary issue affecting dozens of cases at the market: the liability of members' agents - who handle the affairs of Names - for the alleged defaults of managing agents who administer syndicates.</p>

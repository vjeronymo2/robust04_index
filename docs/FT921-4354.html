			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / US 'shared Iran intelligence with Saddam Hussein' THE Bush Administration shared sensitive US intelligence on Iranian military operations with Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi president, until just months before Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The disclosure was made yesterday by Mr Henry Gonzalez, the Democratic chairman of the House banking committee who has been investigating US-Iraqi relations in the context of the scandal over Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.32bn) of improper Iraqi loans made by the Atlanta, Georgia office of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). Mr Gonzalez yesterday released declassified secret documents from the National Security Council, which he said provided proof that the Bush Administration engaged in a policy of permitting intelligence sharing between the US and Iraq until May 1990. Mr Gonzalez said he had forwarded the documents to the Senate intelligence committee, which last October, in its own report on the nomination of Mr Robert Gates as director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), stated: 'Intelligence sharing continued on a sporadic basis until 1988 when the Iran-Iraq war ended.' Mr Gonzalez termed the Senate report 'misleading'. The documents include an Iraqi options paper prepared for a White House meeting in May 1990 by Mr Gates, then deputy national security adviser to President Bush. A section entitled 'intelligence co-operation' notes that intelligence exchanges had waned since the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq of 1988. In favour of continuing such co-operation the argument is made that 'they still provide Iraq with limited information on Iranian military activity that would be missed.' The section goes on to state: 'Ending this contact would close off our very limited access to this important segment of the Iraqi establishment.' A Congressional investigator said the Gonzalez committee had received independent confirmation of US-Iraqi intelligence sharing that went beyond the documents released.</p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Leading Article: End-game on enlargement Today in Brussels, negotiations on admitting four new members to the European Union enter what should be their final lap. Foreign ministers from the 12 existing members and the four would-be entrants - Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria - have every incentive to make this round conclusive. If the talks do not show decisive progress in the next week, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the four applicants to hold their planned ratification referendums and join by the target date of January 1995. As important, the whole enlargement process may lose momentum. The result would be further damage to the EU's battered effectiveness and self-esteem - and further delay on the equally pressing question of bringing in the nascent market economies of central Europe. Fortunately, the hopes for a breakthrough are now better than at any time since the negotiations were seriously joined last year. Public opinion is moving in favour of entry even in the most sceptical candidate country, Norway. Opposition among the Nordic states to the EU's terms on the stickiest problems still to be resolved - agriculture and the budget - appears to be softening, assisted by figures from the European Commission indicating that their net contributions to the Union budget will be even more modest than previously thought. It is too soon to celebrate, however. The EU's bargaining position could yet be thrown into confusion by additional budgetary demands from the poorer southern states, led by Spain. The issues of how to align the applicant countries' farm protection regimes with the Common Agricultural Policy, and how to compensate farmers who stand to lose in the process, still present obstacles that will only be surmounted with creative thinking from both sides. Volatile electorates The challenge is to produce enlargement agreements attractive enough to secure acceptance by the volatile electorates of the four applicants, without destabilising the delicate web of budgetary and other agreements between the existing 12. Even on agriculture, where Finland, Austria and Norway currently guarantee their farmers prices 25 to 100 per cent higher than under the CAP, that should not be beyond the negotiators. The EU's proposal, for a 'big bang' realignment of prices, compensated through direct payments to farmers threatened with reduced incomes, is sensible. The alternative - a phased transition, during which price differences would be ironed out with border levies - would generate prolonged uncertainty, interfere with the single market, and further complicate the still problematic task of CAP reform. What is more, the EU proposal offers applicant governments powerful ammunition with which to sell an agreement to their voters, in the form of sharply lower food prices for consumers. Frozen north Their core problem is how to deal with their seriously disadvantaged farmers  -those who toil in the frozen north and on Alpine pastures. Understandably perhaps, the candidate countries are balking at the EU's suggestion that they fund compensation payments themselves: they want assistance in doing so from the Union, as well as generous treatment for their poorer areas under EU regional funds. This is where the haggling will focus over the next few days, with Spain and its southern allies pushing a hard line on the regional funds and other EU governments withholding budgetary concessions until the last possible moment. While most of Spain's demands can be dismissed as predictable special pleading, the EU as a whole is wise to adopt a hard-nosed approach on the budget. The countries seeking membership are all at the upper end of the EU's income scale and, if they choose for cultural, environmental or other reasons to subsidise agriculture in regions where it is manifestly unprofitable, they should contribute towards those subsidies from their national exchequers, subject to EU control. Equally, it is strongly in the EU's interests to bring these negotiations to a brisk conclusion. If the price of doing so turns out to involve a modest top-up for such national assistance, that should not be an insuperable obstacle to reaching a final agreement.</p>

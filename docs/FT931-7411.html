			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China becomes biggest user of gold CHINA EMERGED as the world's largest gold consuming country last year, according to estimates from the American Precious Metals Advisors consultancy organisation. It suggests China may have consumed more than 800 tonnes of gold or 26m troy ounces in 1992. APMA says in its latest MetalsFAX newsletter that China probably imported 500 tonnes to satisfy demand from private gold consumers and another 35 tonnes of domestic gold production was also absorbed. China's central bank possibly bought another 300 tonnes, either for additions to its reserves or to help satisfy raging domestic demand, the newsletter says. Mr Jeffrey Nichols, managing director of APMA, says some market observers are sure that a substantial part of the 400 tonnes of gold disposed of by the Dutch central bank last autumn was taken by China's central bank - perhaps 150 to 200 tonnes (4.8m to 6.4m ounces). He estimates that central bank net gold sales last year reached 650 tonnes. In addition to Holland, the big sellers were Belgium (202 tonnes) and Canada (about 100 tonnes). Other sellers included Iraq and Abu Dhabi, both making 'distress sales', according to Mr Nichols. Iraq sold about 175 tonnes to keep its economy going while Abu Dhabi sold 125 to 150 tonnes to cover its losses in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, APMA suggests. It says that, apart from the central bank sales, downward pressure was put on the gold price in 1992 - pushing the price to its lowest level in seven years - by disposals by the former Soviet Union and short sales by speculators. On the other hand, investors are estimated to have bought about 1,000 tonnes of gold last year compared with 620 tonnes in 1991 and 435 tonnes the year before. This is 'in stark contrast to the myth presented over and over again in the media that investors are disinterested in gold and that dishoarding is driving down the metal's price', Mr Nichols points out. APMA estimates that the total supply of gold to the market last year - from the mines, from net central bank sales, producers' forward sales and scrap - was about 3,750 tonnes (up from about 3,140 tonnes in 1991) while some 2,634 tonnes (2,380 tonnes) was absorbed by jewellery fabricators, industrial consumers and in coinage.

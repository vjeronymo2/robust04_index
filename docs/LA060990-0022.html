			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRAUDE PLAN TO BAN SMOKING IN RESTAURANTS  </P> <P> In reply to Ellen Goodman's column "Free Advice to a Tobacco King: Wise Up,"  Commentary, May 29:  </P> <P> My husband smoked three packs per day and at age 58 had his first heart attack.  </P> <P> Doctors warned him that smoking was elevating his blood pressure. They told him  that if he continued smoking he would surely have another heart attack --  perhaps fatal. He came home, sat down on the sofa and lit a cigarette. He said  the doctors were just "alarmists." He passed away five days later.  </P> <P> ADELENE R. CRAIG  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

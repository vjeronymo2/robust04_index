They also sent a strong message of warning to the  forces of Western arrogance and vanity through the decision  taken by the Libyan Arab people for steadfastness, defiance, and  readiness for confrontation and defence for the revolutionary  orientations of the Jamahiriyah without any abdication of these  orientations or compromise as far as the national sovereignty  and laws are concerned.    O great leader, at a time when the Arab political map is  being dominated by the abandonment of the liberation orientated  national civilisational project, the following current policies  of reversal, the series of concessions and promotion of the  defeatist slogan land for peace, but your principled, sincere  and firm nationalist stance will remain the hope of all Arab  masses throughout the greater Arab homeland, in adherence to the  Arab national cause without any abdication. History will record  proudly the dignified stand which you took enabling us, we the  generation of Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, to stand tall like the palm  trees of our country who strength is well entrenched in the soil  and the branches freely extending towards the sky.    Certainly the Great Jamahiriyah will remain under your  leadership, the heaven on earth in which no one who betrays it  would live and its people will remain the freest and kindest of  all peoples.    Allah endowed us with you as a steadfast and sincere leader  accustomed to advocating justice, and repulsing falsehood. So  let us go forward under your leadership and we are with you on  the path of revolution and defiance.    Rely on Allah and you will always remain the conscience of  the nation and the teacher of generations to come.    Allah willing we rely on you and we will be victorious.  Forward and [words indistinct] revolutionary the struggle will  continue.    Signed: the General People's Congress</p>

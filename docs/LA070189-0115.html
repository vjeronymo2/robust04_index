			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DEDICATED DIGGERS AND PLANTERS  </P> <P> For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of  Nurserymen:  </P> <P> Feed vegetables periodically with a mild, balanced fertilizer for bigger and  better harvests.  </P> <P> Many insects are at their peak during hot weather. Consult a nurseryman for  tips on controlling aphids, cutworms, white flies, ants, earwigs and snails.  </P> <P> If berry vines have finished producing, cut off the old canes that bore fruit  this year and loosely twine new growth onto the trellis.  </P> <P> Now is an excellent time to plant almost anything from containers or flats,  just don't let the plants dry out before or after planting. A little Vitamin  B-1 will help them overcome the transplanting shock.  </P></p>

(NSSI) and Mr. Robert C. Dailey, challenging two enforcement actions issued by the NRC Staff on March 22, 1994. The enforcement actions were published at 59 FR 14429 (March 28, 1994) (NSSI) and 59 FR 14688 (March 29, 1994) (Dailey). The first of these actions would order NSSI to remove an individual from NRC-licensed or regulated activities for five years; the second would prohibit that same individual from participating in NRC-licensed or regulated activities for the same period. In each case, the issue for hearing, as specified in the respective enforcement actions, is whether the particular order should be sustained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By Memorandum and Order (Consolidating Proceedings and Granting Extension of Time), dated May 4, 1994 (unpublished), the Licensing Board granted the hearing requests and consolidated the two proceedings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice is hereby given that the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will conduct a prehearing conference in this consolidated proceeding on Tuesday, July 12, 1994, beginning at 2:00 p.m. The conference will be held in the new Commission hearing room, 3rd floor, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, North Bethesda, Maryland.

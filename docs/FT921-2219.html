			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television As often as not Tomorrow's World seems like a programme for the sort of know-all child scientist who used to irritate me at school, but two of the subjects tonight might interest many of us. The first is a cheap method of making high quality paper out of corn (feed it to animals when you have finished with it) and the second is the world's first 'virtual reality' theme park which has opened in Nottingham (7.30 BBC1). C4's series of documentaries made by directors new to television, Short Stories, follows two elderly members of the British Communist Party to the 43rd Congress in November 1991 where the party voted itself out of existence (8.30). The most famous zoo animal of all time was probably Jumbo. In my lifetime it would be difficult to decide whether the greatest stir was caused by Brumas (a baby polar bear of such popularity that you could buy replicas not only in the normal soft toy material but also in soap and white chocolate), Guy the Gorilla, or Goldie the golden eagle. All seem to me more interesting than Chi-Chi, the sulky giant panda who became involved in the cold war and east-west diplomacy, yet Chi-Chi is the subject of today's Arena (9.30 BBC2).</p>

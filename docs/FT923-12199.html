			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Ceasefire in Rwanda fails to hold RWANDAN rebels attacked government positions yesterday, shattering a midnight ceasefire which was supposed to end a 21-month tribal conflict, Reuter reports from Kigali, Rwanda. The defence minister, Mr James Gasana, said groups of Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) insurgents raided communes along Rwanda's northern border with Uganda, where the government claims the rebels are based. In Uganda, a Rwandan embassy official said the rebels had also attacked Byumba district, north of the capital, and fighting was still going on. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni called on both sides to observe the truce. The ceasefire was to have taken effect at midnight on Sunday and to be followed on July 13 by the deployment of a 50-man military observer force from Zimbabwe, Nigeria and Senegal.</p>

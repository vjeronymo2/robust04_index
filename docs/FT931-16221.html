			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Clinton's first big challenge: meet Salinas and save Nafta - The two men have much in common ON his maiden foray into international diplomacy, President-elect Bill Clinton is going only one state away - to Austin, Texas, where he will today meet Mexican President Carlos Salinas. The two presidents will find they have much in common. Both attended university abroad (Mr Clinton in the UK, Mr Salinas in the US) and became young government reformers with pro-business views. Both are 'policy wonks'  -fascinated with the technicalities of making government work. They are both 'baby boomers' and know that unless they 'bond' swiftly, the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement - involving the US, Mexico and Canada - is at risk. However, Mr Clinton assured Canada's Prime Minister Brian Mulroney by telephone yesterday that he would not be left out of any serious discussions with Mexico on Nafta. The meeting with Mr Salinas would only be a 'get-acquainted session'. It was Mr Ross Perot, the independent presidential candidate, who fanned the burning coals of public doubt about Nafta into blazing opposition during the televised campaign debates. The quirky Texas billionaire repeatedly claimed to hear 'a sucking sound' to the south, drawing US manufacturing jobs out of the country. Those who opposed the agreement - carefully cultivated by grassroots environmental, labour and citizen groups - had little difficulty in extracting promises from numerous congressmen to oppose the treaty. It stands in danger of defeat. Mr Clinton should have already won favour with the Mexican president, by agreeing not to demand a renegotiation. Instead he promised to negotiate 'supplemental' agreements to protect the environment and labour standards and guard against import surges. Among Mr Clinton's Democratic supporters are three factions: business groups, which care only that Nafta offers opportunity for new investment, markets and cheap labour; the opponents, who believe the pact can be improved with tough enforcement measures; and those - many in unions - who will work to kill any deal. There is also organised opposition in both Canada and Mexico, and the citizens from the three countries will marry their views in a common paper to be delivered this month. Although there are some differences in interpretation of the Nafta text, most opponents say the current version would depress wages and employment levels, diminish labour rights and standards, degrade the environment and promote massive migration and human rights violations. 'Nafta is by no stretch of the imagination free trade,' says Ms Thea Lee of the labour-supported Economic Policy Institute. 'It is an investment agreement and a sophisticated form of managed trade for the multinational corporations.' The Economic Strategy Institute, in a recent report called 'Nafta: Making it Better', concluded that the pact as it now stands would stimulate foreign investment in Mexico, but at the expense of US industry. The opposition has grown so strong that Washington lobbyists acknowledge the necessity of negotiating the side agreements and presenting them as a 'new' Nafta, different from the one savaged by Mr Perot. 'We have to reposition the issue to take the focus away from the loss of manufacturing jobs and focus on the overall closer economic and political relationship between two neighbours,' says Mr Harry Freeman, a trade lobbyist. Those willing to accept a 'new' Nafta want one which would encourage pollution clean-up in Mexico, raise standards of food safety, and boost the living standards of Mexican workers. Their goal is 'the EC model' under which countries were only admitted after democratic reforms took root and the poorer countries are given compensatory payment for social programmes. Mr Clinton has promised to establish a strong environmental protection commission with substantial powers and resources to prevent and clean up water pollution and encourage enforcement of air pollution laws. But he has been vague about the relationship between the side agreements and the original Nafta text. The critics will insist that this linkage be formalised, so failure by any of the three governments to meet their obligations on environment and labour could be punished by higher tariffs. Mr Clinton will also have to make changes to the proposed dispute settlement mechanism, according to Mr Alex Hittle, a spokesman for Friends of the Earth, who is willing to support 'a Nafta with teeth'. The president-elect apparently envisions a process under which citizen groups would take their complaints to US officials, who would then pass them to their Mexican or Canadian partners. Environmentalists want the process opened to public participation. The current text says both sides in a dispute must agree before outsiders are brought into the process. Mr Clinton will be leaned on hard, and he will have to press Mr Salinas, who in turn has signalled that the price of new negotiations could be a multi-billion-dollar fund to help pay for Mexico to develop infrastructure and clean up its environmental. He may also reopen talks about labour mobility.</p>

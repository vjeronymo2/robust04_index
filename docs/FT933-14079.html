			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Europe company chiefs optimistic Chief executives of west European companies are more optimistic than their US counterparts about economic prospects on both sides of the Atlantic, according to a survey by Conference Board Europe, Reuter reports from Brussels. The Board, part of an organisation linking companies worldwide, said yesterday that 54 per cent of European executives believed economic conditions would improve over the next four years in western Europe and 74 per cent thought the outlook would get better in the US. US executives were less optimistic on both counts, 48 per cent seeing an improvement in western Europe and 56 per cent forecasting better conditions in the US. Less than half US and EC executives were seriously concerned about competition from each other but a majority were worried about competitive threats from Asia over the next four years. National budget deficits and spiralling health care costs topped both the European and American worry lists.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Letter: Monarchy - political dimensions of a show that will run and run Sir, How very extraordinary of the Financial Times, normally a solid and worthy purveyor of information, to give half a page to a wholly spiteful article written by an outsider on a event which, though constitutionally tricky, was inevitable. Why pontificate at all? The FT would be wiser to stick to its own (superior) staff writers with their sensible tongue-in-cheek views, and to consider this: regular FT readers who would tend to avoid reading tabloid nonsense would have had their senses jarred by such a silly and unnecessary article. A brief mention in the Observer column would have done it. Caroline Walcot, 285 chaussee de Drogenbos, 1620 Drogenbos (Brussels), Belgium</p>

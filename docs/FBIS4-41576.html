			<p>BFN     [Text] The State Duma group of Yegor Gaydar's Russia's  Choice rejected proposals that the term of the Federal Assembly  be extended. It insisted on holding parliamentary and  presidential elections as specified by the constitution.    In its statement made public in the Duma Friday the group  said that its members could not agree with the proposal made by  Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko.    The statement said that Russia's Choice was giving priority  to legality and morality over political expediency. It cast  doubt on the desirability of what Shumeyko had proposed. The  Russia's Choice group considers that instead of consolidating  political stability it would destroy the weak saplings of civic  accord, trust between political groupings and respect for the  law that had emerged in Russian society recently.    The group is not convinced by Shumeyko's argument that the  extension of the terms would save much funds. It states that  society had paid dearly for every short cut of democratic  procedures. What is more, it would be members of parliament who  would make a decision on extending their own terms, which would  place them in a delicate moral position.</p>

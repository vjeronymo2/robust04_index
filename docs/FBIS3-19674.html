			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, March 21 (AFP) -- France urged here Monday  [21 March] that the principle of reciprocity should be strictly  applied during negotiations to include financial services within  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    In a memorandum given to its European Union [EU] partners  during a meeting of finance ministers, France said the EU should  pursue "resolutely offensive" policies in concert with the  United States.    Financial services were excluded from the Uruguay Round GATT  trade accord wrapped up in Geneva last December, mainly because  of what the United States judged to be insufficient offers from  Japan and other Asian countries.    Negotiations will resume in 1995. The U.S. authorities, in  the meanwhile, are following a policy of opening up the American  market only to financial services from countries offering  similar access.    The French memorandum said the EU should maintain similar  reciprocal pressure in financial services. If the Union failed  to do so, it would lose a lever to open up foreign markets and  lose ground to U.S. competition, it said.    "We should use the threat of reciprocity to incite countries  which have commitments to open up their financial services  markets to undertake the appropriate reforms and indulge in less  protectionism," it said.</p>

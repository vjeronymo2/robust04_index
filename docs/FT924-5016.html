			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The cheaper way of insuring your treasures - Scheherazade Daneshkhu finds that specialists often can offer policies to cover high-value possessions at lower rates than elsewhere THE PLEASURE of acquiring a pair of Art Deco vases, some Persian carpets or a little Hockney sketch can be ruined by worries about the cost of insuring them. Most home contents policies restrict what they will pay out - usually, to no more than Pounds 1,000 or Pounds 1,500 - on any single personal possession unless it has been specified separately. The type of extra insurance you need depends very much on the items you have. Jewellery, unless antique, normally can be covered adequately under a conventional home contents policy by describing the pieces and submitting a valuation. (If you do not wear the jewellery often, of course, a cheaper alternative is to keep it in a bank vault). But if you are a collector, or own a variety of valuable furniture and paintings, you could find it cheaper to consult a specialist fine art insurer. The choice of these has increased in recent years. Fine art broker Richard King says this is partly because insurance companies are losing less money from this part of their business - known as the 'high net worth' sector - than on claims arising from subsidence and theft. King  - who works for Artscope, a division of broker Leslie and Godwin - estimates that people with fine art and antiques can, in some cases, get wider cover at a third of the price charged by a high street insurance company if they go to a specialist insurer. He adds: 'We have a client whose insurance company was charging him Pounds 6,000 in premiums this year for the contents of his London home. But he has switched to a specialist and is paying Pounds 4,000.' Hiscox Underwriting Ltd deals with high-value household business for Syndicate 33 at Lloyd's of London, and claims to give more competitive rates than others. The minimum sum insured for house and contents is Pounds 250,000; but if you already have satisfactory building insurance, the minimum sum insured for contents is Pounds 75,000. The minimum annual premium is Pounds 500. The policy has a specialised all-risks section for fine art, with no maximum item limit for objects other than gold, silver and plate. Hiscox does not insist on valuations but encourages a schedule to minimise the risk of dispute when a claim arises. Nor will it necessarily survey every house, relying instead on the potential client's background before taking on risk. Nigel Prescot, of Hiscox, explains: 'The person is more important than the security of the house. Then we make a judgment.' Wellington Personal Insurance, a Lloyd's-approved service company, also provides a high-value buildings and contents service. The minimum sum insured on both is Pounds 150,000 but Steve Windich, the managing director, says the average is Pounds 300,000 with average annual premiums of Pounds 1,100. 'The package is designed along North American lines,' says Windich. 'We automatically include contents cover worth 50 per cent of the buildings insurance. In most cases, this provides more than enough insurance and the customer does not have to worry about being under-insured all the time.' If your house is insured for Pounds 400,000, you will be entitled to Pounds 200,000 of contents cover. But items excluded are jewellery, silver and furs. The standard excess on the policy is Pounds 500; thus, if an item worth Pounds 2,000 is stolen, the insured would get Pounds 1,500 from the company. The excess is waived on claims over Pounds 10,000, though. Wellington does not require valuations but it does demand a list of items worth more than Pounds 10,000. Although the package is not cheap, it is competitive for those with many valuables who want to combine contents insurance with buildings. Another combined package was launched at the end of September by Sun Alliance and Chubb, which have produced a policy called Masterpiece providing an all-round service. Marketing manager John Spink says Masterpiece is aimed at 'the top 5 per cent of wealth-owning people in the country.' The minimum annual premium is Pounds 1,500 a year for building and contents but the average, Spink adds, is Pounds 3,000-Pounds 4,000. Masterpiece is an all-risks building and contents policy and includes world-wide cover on contents; a 24-hour help-line facility; payment for loss of market value of a valuable item (more than Pounds 2,500) following damage; and a broad 'pairs and sets' clause for valuable articles. This means you could claim for the set even if only one item was stolen or destroyed. The policy involves a full appraisal, and the home and contents are surveyed before the risk is taken on. Full valuations are required. Collectors may prefer a policy provided by Star Assurance, which is owned jointly by Eagle Star and Nordstern, a German insurance company. It does not cover buildings or general contents but concentrates on fine art and antiques. The minimum sum insured is Pounds 50,000 of contents; the minimum annual premium is Pounds 175. Star's Clare Pardy says the policy, which provides all-risk cover within the premises, is aimed at collectors rather than wealthy individuals. 'We employ people with a fine arts background and are able to give the client advice on the value of their items,' she says. 'We would expect a professional valuation but there would be no need for the client to have subsequent valuations, which are an expensive business, since we could advise them on the present-day value of the collection.' Like Masterpiece, the policy also includes depreciation following damage. So, if your prize painting fell off the wall, you could claim for the cost of the repairs and the loss in market value. These policies are sold mainly through insurance brokers, who receive commission from the companies but are able to get a variety of quotations and help to determine which policy is suited best to the individual case.</p>

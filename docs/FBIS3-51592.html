			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 22 Jan (NA) -- Former Colonel Mohamed  Ali Seineldin, the mastermind of the last military uprising, has  cautioned about the possibility of renewed social turmoil  prompted by the current socioeconomic program, and asked for a  change in the policy implemented in this area by the national  government.    The former colonel described himself as "a soldier of our  fatherland who did not want to shirk his responsibility." He  championed the establishment of the Movement for National  Identity and Ibero-American Integration (MINII) as "a  possibility for an appropriate and genuine alternative."    The leader of the 3 December 1990 uprising expressed these  ideas in a self-made interview distributed by his supporters and  signed by former Captain Gustavo Breid Obeid, who is also under  arrest at the Magadalena Prison and is the MINII secretary  general.    Seineldin made it clear that MINII "is a patriotic movement,  and not a partisan political movement." He rejected the claim  that he is heading MINII, asking himself: "What kind of  leadership may one exercise in prison?"    Seineldin explained: "Given the current crisis situation  experienced by nations, arising from the decadence, corruption,  and inability of the partisan leaderships that constantly  jeopardize republican life, the movement must act as a  reassurance and guarantee for continuity."    Seineldin also rejected any similarity with Modin [Movement  for Dignity and Independence], headed by Aldo Rico. Describing  Modin, Seineldin said: "By joining the `partisan game,' it will  end up as a small party, engulfed by the `big ones' through  negotiations, transactions, and deals."    Asked whether MINII's relationship with the Army might not  be  incompatible, Seineldin made it clear that the Army's interests  "go well beyond individuals and the circumstances in which they  find themselves." He emphasized: "There is unity and there  will always exist unity whenever our fatherland is in jeopardy."    Moving on, Seineldin cautioned about the possibility of a  repetition of the serious episodes that had occurred in Santiago  del Estero Province "as long as the economic policy remains  unchanged." He believes the government "is in a blind alley."    Seineldin said: "If the government keeps the adjustment  policy there will be social turmoil, and if the government keeps  this program and does not implement an adjustment, the economy  will sink. The only possibility is to definitely change the  course, implementing a stability program, but with growth."    Seineldin also rejected "the balancing of accounts at the  expense of the hunger of millions of families" and the solution  "of reinstating economic anarchy." He called attention on the  existence of "impoverished provinces because their funds are  administrated by a central administration that 'monitors' their  economies."    In conclusion, Seineldin opposed constitutional reform,  describing it as the result of "an ill-fated maneuver right from  the beginning, because it is based on a spurious and shameless  pact" and because the Constitution is "something too serious to  be changed by mere personal appetites."</p>

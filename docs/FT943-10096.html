			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / The French choose their words carefully: Not everyone is enthusiastic about France's attempt to preserve its language. David Buchan hears both sides of the argument 'If it should happen that French loses its present place as Europe's premier working language, then Europe will never be totally European' President Georges Pompidou, 1972 'French must not become to English what today Latin and Greek are to French' Jacques Toubon, culture minister, 1994 Paint out those 'exit' signs and replace them with 'sortie'. Remember, when publicising your latest car model, that it has a sac gonflable, not an air bag. And, while planning that conference in Nice, do not forget to budget for the expense of interpretation and of producing at least a resume or precis in French of all those papers on applied widgetry. If you fail to heed these cautions in France, it could cost you up to FFr20,000 (Pounds 2,400) in fines under the country's new Loi Toubon. According to Jacques Toubon, the culture minister, his law is designed to restore French to its proper place 'as the language of our culture, cement of the nation and the flag under which we sail in the world'. Put rather more simply, it is to ensure that French remains what is spoken and read predominantly in public in France. Its opponents in France, however, have denounced it as linguistic totalitarianism. They include libertarians in general, and the advertising and scientific communities in particular. And on July 29, France's constitutional court struck down two provisions of the law. It complained that the law infringed the constitutional freedom of expression by covering private citizens as well as public officials or those performing public services, and by making too unconditional the denial of state research money to scientists publishing their work in a language other than French. But Toubon reacted by calling the court's ruling 'generally positive' in endorsing the government's right to require the use of French in most aspects of French public life. His ministry says it will now simply amend the law slightly during the Parliament's autumn session. Judging by the original law's easy passage this spring, it should not have much difficulty in getting its way. Few politicians want to be seen opposing such a motherhood issue as protection of the French language. The Loi Toubon coincides with an upsurge in French cultural nationalism. Indeed, the issue on which the Gatt world trade talks nearly foundered last December was the French government's determination to resist US objections to its subsidies to things French. At the same time, the French parliament passed a measure requiring the country's radio stations, to their great irritation, to broadcast a minimum 40 per cent of French songs by January 1996. This cultural nationalism has political, as well as trade, consequences. President Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur insisted on retaining a French speaker at the helm of the European Commission: both their first preference, Belgian prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, and eventual choice, Luxembourg prime minister Jacques Santer, are francophones. Luxembourgers, half of the Belgian population and some Swiss speak French, which means French is spoken as a first language by more Europeans than English. (German, the muttersprach of 80m in the federal republic, is ahead of all.) But the French refuse to settle for being a regional culture and still set out 'universal' claims for their language (as well as for the political values of the French revolution), while acknowledging such pretensions are becoming increasingly phoney. There are, for instance, 49 countries which belong to la Francophonie (the community of French speakers). Some member countries, such as Bulgaria, seem to have joined as much for political as for cultural reasons. Even without the Bulgarians, a recent French Senate report estimated the number of 'nominal' French speakers at 120m. But the number of 'real' French speakers was far fewer, said the report. It said only 10 per cent of north and sub-Saharan Africans actually spoke the language and that this ratio was declining rapidly under the twin impacts of Islamic (anti-western) fundamentalism in the Maghreb, and of the growing appeal of black American music to black Africa. In Asia, the report admitted that for all the fanfare of France's recent political and economic 'return' to Indochina, French was now used or understood by just 0.1 per cent of the population in Vietnam and Laos. Ironically, the only region where English is in slight retreat is North America, where the Canadian province of Quebec has taken draconian action to forbid public use of English and where several US states have in recent years made English their 'official' language, to blunt growing Hispanic influence. Toubon cites these moves to justify his law, the aim of which, he says, is to ensure the right of his countrymen to use the one language they all understand. Will it work? Linguistic legislation has a long history in France. In 1539, French was declared the language of justice. In 1635, that watchdog of linguistic purity, the Academie Francaise, was established. And in 1975, a law was passed requiring advertising, job offers and product labelling to be in French. This was billed mainly as a consumer protection measure, enforcement of which was left to a division of the finance ministry. But no one took it very seriously. In some years, no convictions resulted; in others, about a dozen. Typical was the FFr2,600 fine which a Cherbourg tribunal imposed on a company in 1992 for selling windsurf boards with instructions only in English. In another case, the French subsidiary of Quick, the Belgian fast food chain, countered a charge of giving its wares foreign (English) names by arguing that consumers were perfectly well informed of the products through accompanying photographs. When that argument failed, Quick began trying to register its 'cheeseburgers' and other products as trademarks. This technique was exploited by Nike, the sports equipment chain, which included in its trademark the advertising slogan: 'Nike. Just Do It]' One of the aims of the Loi Toubon is to put a stop to such moves. But the culture minister says he is not trying to stamp out Franglais, a bastardised form of English. It would certainly be difficult as stamping out some Franglais terms would be killing something indigenously French. For example, the term 'le smoking', for formal men's evening wear, has never existed in English. Another example of an English word used in a sense that would mean nothing in England is 'tilt'. 'Ca me fait tilt' is a common French phrase for 'I suddenly realised', with 'tilt' taken from pinball-machine parlance. Generally, though, the new law forbids official use of foreign words where French equivalents exist. Where they do not, they are being invented by 19 ministerial committees which, this spring, published their lexicon of 3,500 official Gallicisms. Progress has been rather quicker than the Academie Francaise's revision of its dictionary. Work began in 1935 and has reached the letter F. Part of the Loi Toubon is designed to give new bite to old law. It allows, for the first time, various unofficial associations to initiate court action. It is promised that this power will only go to 'approved' associations - but these linguistic vigilantes have proved unnerving already. One of the associations' targets will undoubtedly be the advertising industry. Dominique Mauduit, vice-president of Publicis, a large advertising agency, says it is 'intolerable and imbecile' to legislate on the everyday language which his industry uses to put its message across. 'Publicity is the language of the street . . . and we don't use any more Franglais than already exists in common French usage,' he says. Toubon explains the main aim of his law as being to 'forbid the forbidding of the use of French'. His culture ministry claims an increasing numbers of employees have complained they are getting important internal company documents in foreign languages. Henceforth, these will have to be in French, as work and commercial contracts have had to be since 1975. While the law applies to internal company documents, Toubon says he does not intend to apply it to external company document such as annual reports to shareholders. It is not surprising that his ministry should shrink from trying to cut France's financial community off from 'le bottom line' and 'le cash flow' to which they have become firmly attached. The attachment is not surprising when you consider that cash flow becomes 'le marge brut d'autofinancement' in French. So the culture ministry is only planning to establish 'cercles de reflexions' with the banks and the Bourse to discuss ways of gallicising their terminology. The law stipulates French as the language of teaching, but an increasing number of French business schools teach courses in English, as does Patrick Messerlin, a trade specialist at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris. He says he has Korean students who want to work in English, and 'if they can't they will simply go to Brussels', a more accommodating francophone university centre. 'I'll just keep on in English, and let them fine me,' he says defiantly. But scientists are even more strongly opposed to a law which they feel has been passed by politicians in wilful ignorance of the fact that English has become the language of international scientific publications and conferences. Toubon's law requires that conferences must print their programmes in French (in addition to any other language), that all working papers must be accompanied by at least a resume in French, and that interpretation must be provided. In a fruitless appeal to deputies in April, the Academie des Sciences said that at large conferences 'it would be materially impossible to ensure French resumes and financially impossible to provide simultaneous translation'. The law also makes state money for research dependent on the fruits of that research being published eventually in French. 'A French researcher does not have to publish his work first in French,' says Toubon. 'He can put it first into Nature or the New England Journal of Medicine. But at some point or other, the French taxpayer ought to be able to read what he pays for.' In reply, three particle physicists wrote recently in Le Monde: 'We are grouped in laboratories whose number can be counted on the fingers of two hands. Obviously there is no public in France to publish our work to, because it would only sell 20 copies . . . How can a discipline of several thousand people on the whole planet publish their work in 20 languages?' It would be far better, says Paul Germain, secretary to the Academie des Science, for politicians to subsidise the writing of indigenous French schoolbooks on, say, biology, instead of just translating American ones, because these are read by hundreds of thousands of children and not just a handful of scientists.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: SAVING DOWN UNDER VIA NEW BACKPACK GUIDE  </P> <P> Travelers planning shoestring-budget adventures Down Under can consult the new  "Australian and New Zealand Backpackers Guide."  </P> <P> Young Australians are masters at traveling on tight funds. When they travel  abroad they tend to stay away for long periods, often circling the globe.  </P> <P> The bonus for Americans is that many young Australians have returned home with  lots of firsthand knowledge and ideas, and have created their own budget-travel  businesses.  </P> <P> The 248-page first edition of this magazine offers budget-travel information,  plus background information on the various regions of the country. Only eight  pages cover New Zealand.  </P> <P> The publishers plan to produce new editions quarterly, updating basic  information and adding special features on seasonal destinations.  </P> <P> The magazine's major drawback is its size. The information on budget  transportation, accommodations and sightseeing is good for pre-trip planning,  but the guide is similar to a thin telephone book -- a bulky product for  backpackers to carry.  </P> <P> Whether you want to investigate the Northern Territories of "Crocodile Dundee"  fame, cuddle a koala, snorkel on the Great Barrier Reef, relax in a rain  forest, find a temporary job or search out ski slopes, the guide helps with  information on how to get around, where to stay and whom to contact.  </P> <P> Accommodations listed vary from budget hotels and youth hostels to other  low-cost options.  </P> <P> For example, in the Whitsunday Island area an island resort is restricted to  travelers of between 18 and 35 years.  </P> <P> The Contiki Resort, on Long Island, was created as a special stop for Contiki  tour groups.  </P> <P> According to the guide, independent budget travelers also can stay there in a  special backpackers' lodge, sharing four-bunk rooms for $15 Australian (about  $12 U.S.) a night.  </P> <P> In Cape Tribulation National Park in northern Queensland, budget travelers can  explore the lush rain forest, using Crocodylus Village as a base.  </P> <P> According to the guide, the village offers "moderate creature comfort in a  safari-style complex" using "hut accommodations set high off the ground."  </P> <P> The listings for caravan (trailer) parks can be helpful even if travelers  aren't carrying camping equipment. In Australia, many trailer parks offer vans  or cabins as alternative accommodations.  </P> <P> The magazine lists the popular sights in each region of the country. In some  cases, special discounts are offered.  </P> <P> For example, backpackers are offered special standby rates for cruising Sydney  Harbor aboard a full-scale replica of the Bounty.  </P> <P> There is also special transportation fares. There's a 25% reduction for buying  the standby version of Deluxe Coachlines' Koala Pass, which is good for  unlimited travel.  </P> <P> To travel on the nationwide network of services, standby costs $299 Australian  (about $25 U.S.) for 15 days. A 21-day pass is $404 A, 30 days costs $544, 60  days are $749 and 90 days are $1,049.  </P> <P> Backpackers Guide magazine is not being distributed in the United States, but  you can write directly to Australia for a copy. It costs $2 U.S. plus $6 for  airmail postage. Write to Backpackers Guide, Thomson Media Group Pty., Suite 3,  2nd Floor, 575 Pacific Highway, St. Leonards, Sydney, N.S.W. 2065, Australia.  </P></p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / PolyGram to buy Motown POLYGRAM, the Dutch-controlled music group, is to pay Dollars 301m (Pounds 202m) for Motown, the US record label which gave the world Diana Ross, Lionel Richie, the Four Tops, Smokey Robinson and a host of other black stars. The acquisition gives PolyGram, based in London, copyright more than 30,000 Motown albums, which include such hits as Marvin Gaye's 'I heard it through the grapevine', the Temptations' 'Papa was a rollin' stone' and the Supremes' 'Stop] In the Name of Love'. Polygram is financing the deal through the issue of 10m new shares - worth Fl 595m (Pounds 207m) at yesterday's closing price. Philips, the Dutch electronics group which controls PolyGram, will not take up any shares. Its stake in PolyGram will fall from 79.4 per cent to 75 per cent. Mr Alain Levy, PolyGram's chief executive, said he hoped to exploit the Motown name through merchandise sales. Other possibilities included restaurants and theme parks carrying the Motown name. Mr Levy said these attractions would be run by licensees. 'We don't intend to become Disney.' Following financial difficulties experienced by Euro Disney, near Paris, Mr Levy said he thought any Motown theme park would be based in the US. Mr Berry Gordy, who founded Motown in Detroit in 1959, will become chairman emeritus of the label. Mr Jheryl Busby will remain Motown's chief executive. Mr Levy said he had no intention of moving Motown from its Los Angeles headquarters. It would retain its creative independence: 'I will leave it to be American.' Motown's artists roster still includes Diana Ross and Stevie Wonder, along with new acts such as Johnny Gill, Another Bad Creation and Boyz II Men, whose album Cooleyhighharmony has sold over 6m copies. The label has been owned for the past five years by Boston Ventures, a private investment group which specialises in media companies. Motown appointed PolyGram its exclusive US distributor in 1991 and its licensee for the rest of the world in January 1992. Mr Levy said both agreements were due to end in about a year. 'After that the company would have been available to everyone and I thought it better to make a pre-emptive offer.' Lex, Page 14; Results, Page 19</p>

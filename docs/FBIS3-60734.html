			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Olivier Provost report: ``Francois Leotard Revives Issue </F> of Exocet Successor'']    [Text] Defense Minister Francois Leotard has just asked  his office to plan the successor to the Exocet antiship missile  for the next decade. This is a huge stake because Exocet,  produced by Aerospatiale from 1972, has reached sales of 3,000  missiles, and more than 2,500 exported to 32 countries, bringing  in orders worth 40 billion francs [Fr]. There is no question of  the public authorities not taking advantage of this legacy with  a new missile. But nor is there any question of reviving the  ANS, the supersonic antiship missile--a product which emerged  from cooperation between Aerospatiale and the German DASA  (Deutsche Aerospace). This missile, which was to replace the  Exocet, was halted in 1992 by the public authorities, which had  funded part of its development, for budgetary reasons and  because of a production price which was deemed to be too high.    The official departments then asked the industrialists to  resubmit proposals between now and spring 1994. Three options  have emerged. First, it is possible to continue to optimize the  Exocet. The sea-to-sea [MM] 38 type missile of the seventies was  thus followed by the MM-40 around 1980 and then the MM-40 ``bloc  2'' for the nineties which, faced with the American Harpoon  (McDonnell Douglas), won the last six export competitions,  notably in Malaysia, Oman, the Philippines, and Qatar. But a  mere modernization of the Exocet would not prevent this subsonic  missile--it attacks at Mach 0.89, in other words at around 980  km per hour--from being outclassed in the year 2000 by naval  defenses. Hence the idea of enabling the Exocet to take a  technological leap forward, for instance by equipping it with a  new radar. Dassault Electronique could then offer the automatic  guidance system of the ANS missile which is ready now. But this  would not make the Exocet either more rapid or more agile.    Aerospatiale is therefore to suggest building a new missile  but with very much reduced costs and timetable. A new missile  usually takes 10 to 12 years to develop at a cost of Fr10  billion. The company could put forward a tender for less than  Fr2 billion and the product could be ready by the year 2000. It  would be a supersonic missile--``absolutely vital'' according to  Louis Gallois, Aerospatiale's chairman and chief executive--with  a speed of around 2,500 km per hour, equipped with the ramjet of  the medium-range air-to-surface missile--a technology which the  French alone have mastered in the West. The automatic guidance,  the military payload (the explosive), and the computer would  also be readily available. This combination of a naval  medium-range air-to-surface missile with an ANS--achieved by  off-the-shelf purchases--would be carried out by Aerospatiale  and its ally DASA which are planning the rapprochement of their  tactical missile activities for 1994. The 12 frigates planned by  France, Britain, and Italy in 2002, those planned by Germany  with the Netherlands and perhaps Spain by around 2007, and then  the modernization--halfway through their life--of existing  European naval armaments already represents a potential market  of around 1,000 missiles.</p>

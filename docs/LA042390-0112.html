			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIVE CREW'S 'NASTY' MAY BE CINCINNATI'S NEXT TARGET  </P> <P> The Hamilton County Sheriff's Department in Cincinnati has initiated an  investigation to determine whether "As Nasty as They Want to Be," a sexually  explicit album by the Miami-based rap group 2 Live Crew, violates obscenity  codes in Ohio. The investigation was prompted by a complaint from Florida  anti-obscenity crusader Jack Thompson, who faxed a transcription of six 2 Live  Crew songs to Hamilton County Sheriff Simon Leis and to city police stations in  Cincinnati and Dayton on Thursday.  </P> <P> "All I can say is that the matter is under investigation," said Frank Wiekel,  director of relations for the Sheriff's Department. "The vice squad is looking  into it and I would think that sometime (this) week we should be able to  provide some sort of determination on it."  </P> <P> The rap group's "Nasty" album has been declared obscene in four judicial  circuits encompassing 13 counties in the state of Florida. The sexually  explicit record has been deemed to violate obscenity codes in some counties in  Indiana and Tennessee, while authorities in Pennsylvania and Washington have  issued opinions declaring "Nasty" harmful to minors.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Assn. of Art Museum Directors, which represents 153 of the  nation's largest art exhibition centers, will hold an emergency meeting of its  board of directors at Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center today. The New  York-based group said it would issue a statement after the special meeting, at  which Dennis Barrie, the local center's director, is to appear as an invited  guest.  </P> <P> The association is headed by John Walsh, director of the J. Paul Getty Museum  in Malibu, and was among the first establishment arts groups to take a strong  position opposing restrictions on artistic freedom when last year's crisis over  National Endowment for the Arts funding of controversial exhibits began. Walsh  said the emergency board meeting had been called to "discuss what action should  be taken by the directors of the nation's museums to defend First Amendment  rights."

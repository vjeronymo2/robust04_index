			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER CAPITAL GAINS TAX  </P> <P> With the capital gains fiasco, the majority of Democrats and Republicans have  at last shown their true faces and made it abundantly clear that, in order to  maintain their seats in Congress, they intend to cater to the rich and  powerful. All, of course, at the expense of us poor and middle-class citizens  and taxpayers.  </P> <P> The eloquent and grandiose phrases and speeches about the uplifting of the poor  and the minorities, the quality of life in general, and the overall betterment  of mankind are just grist for the mill.  </P> <P> Although historically third parties have had little political success in this  country, perhaps it is time to try again! For with the recent past and the  present leadership in both parties, we are in serious danger of rendering our  democracy useless and sinking to a fourth- or fifth-rate status as a nation and  as a world power.  </P> <P> RICHARD SEELEY  </P> <P> La Crescenta  </P></p>

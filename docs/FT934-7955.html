			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Belgian rates cut in wake of austerity plan THE BELGIAN government agreed early yesterday to a wide-ranging austerity plan, prompting a reduction in two leading interest rates and a euphoric reaction in Belgian financial markets. After 16 hours of talks, ministers backed a three-point package which imposes curbs on social spending and limits wage increases to the rate of inflation until the end of 1996. The pact also contains new measures to tackle rising unemployment, particularly among young people. The Belgian National Bank responded by cutting the discount rate from 6 per cent to 5.5 per cent, while reducing the money market rate from 9.4 per cent to 8.3 per cent. The Belgian franc strengthened against the D-Mark to close at BFr21.25 yesterday on hopes the rate cut would help revive the economy. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister, hailed the agreement as good for Belgium and good for Europe. The plan draws some inspiration from the forthcoming European Commission White Paper on competitiveness, growth and employment which will be the centrepiece of next month's EU summit in Brussels, to be chaired by the Belgian presidency. Among the social pact's chief points are a planned reduction of around BFr75bn (Pounds 1.4bn) in spending on health care, family allowances and pensions. The most sensitive proposal is to reduce family allowances in relation to family income, starting at a threshold of BF750,000 a year. In order to promote job creation, the government proposes to reduce sharply the costs of hiring labour. Businesses will be fully exempt from paying social costs in the first year when employing people under 26 years old, sliding down to 75 per cent and 50 per cent exemptions in the second and third years. It also proposes job-sharing to expand the number of people in work. To raise revenue, the government proposes to raise withholding tax on interest income from 10.3 per cent to 13.39 per cent. The witholding tax on dividends is planned to fall from 25 per cent to 13.4 per cent. The fate of the package will depend partly on whether Mr Dehaene's fragile centre-left coalition can win support among opposition parties and blunt opposition within Belgium's public sector trades unions. This week, rolling strikes took place in Belgium in protest against the pact. Initial reaction among potential opponents was guarded. The Socialist party declared that it had helped to make the austerity plan more equitable, but it would remain vigilant on the application of the planned measures. The Belgian economy is expected to shrink by 1.5 percent this year. It has the highest public debt in the EU as a proportion of GDP. Worries about this indebtedness have unnerved financial markets, and damaged confidence in Belgium's claims to be part of a hard-core currency club built around the D-Mark, particularly after the collapse of the exchange rate mechanism on so-called Black Wednesday, September 16, last year. On the markets yesterday, Belgian government bonds climbed nearly a point following the cut in interest rates. The Bel-20 index of leading shares jumped 21.8 to close at 1,397, despite earlier worries that the effect of new taxes might undermine the positive impact of lower interest rates.

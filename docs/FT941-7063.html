			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: MAI cashes in Havas stake MAI, the broadcasting and moneybroking group, is cashing in its stake in Havas, the French media combine, some four years earlier than anticipated. The move eliminates the last vestiges of MAI's links with Mills &amp; Allen, the outdoor advertising company which gave the UK group its name and was merged into the French company in 1989. MAI announced yesterday that it had sold its 3 per cent convertible bond holding in Havas - which represents a 1.5 per cent stake in the French group upon conversion - in the market for FFr391m (Pounds 44.8m). The stake has risen in value by 17 per cent over the last year, as falling French interest rates increased the attraction of convertible bond investments. MAI is thought to have decided that it would derive greater benefit from the cash, as further substantial progress was considered unlikely before the redemption date. The stake was redeemable in December 1997 for about Pounds 50m. MAI said proceeds would be used for 'general corporate purposes'. However, if applied to reduce debt, the deal will leave it virtually ungeared after its Anglia Television bid, which was given the go-ahead this month. MAI's stake in Havas is the legacy of the 1989 merger by the two groups of certain media interests into Avenir Havas Media. In 1992, MAI swapped its 15.2 per cent stake in Havas for the convertible bond holding.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Kuwait defence spending likely to jump KUWAIT's long delayed first budget since the Gulf war is expected to allow for a steep rise in defence spending to Dollars 9bn (Pounds 4.9bn) from Dollars 1.55bn in the last budget and an outlay of more than Dollars 10bn on war-related expenses. The figures, disclosed in the Middle East Economic Survey (Mees), are in a planned budget that covers the year from July 1 last year. They were delayed because of post-war disarray among Kuwait's government departments. The planned budget is being reviewed by committees of the National Council, the emirate's interim and purely advisory assembly, before publication in its final form, which diplomats expect early next month. The present draft projects an overall 67 per cent rise in government spending for the year to Dollars 20.99bn, according to Mees. Revenues are expected to reach Dollars 3bn, mostly from oil sales as output is planned to accelerate towards pre-war levels of 1.5m barrels a day by the end of this calendar year. Part of the remaining deficit will be made up by income from Kuwait's overseas investments, though no estimates for these are disclosed in the plan. Before the Iraqi invasion in August 1990, investment income on Kuwait's estimated Dollars 80bn to Dollars 100bn overseas assets often exceeded incomes from oil. However, Kuwaiti economists estimate that Gulf war costs may have run these assets down to less than Dollars 50bn. Extraordinary, non-recurring costs related to the war are put at Dollars 10.28bn in the present budget draft - including Dollars 7.31bn in payments to Desert Storm allies and Dollars 1.34bn to pay for a write-off of consumer loans to Kuwaiti citizens. This spending, on top of the likely deficit for the present fiscal year and estimates which put the cost of restoring oil production and refining capacity at Dollars 10bn-Dollars 15bn over the next three years, may force Kuwait to return to international markets for finance.</p>

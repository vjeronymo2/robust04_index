			<p>BFN     [Text] The Croatian delegation was one of the most active  at the nonaligned conference. This is demonstrated by the  numerous bilateral talks -- with Cyprus, Malta, China,  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Italy, Greece, Angola, Tunisia, Kenya, Costa  Rica, Venezuela, and Morocco.    [Begin Foreign Minister Granic recording -- not introduced  by  announcer nor identified by screen caption] I have used my time  in Cairo to hold a number of bilateral talks with countries from  Europe, Africa, and Latin America primarily about the peaceful  reintegration of UN Protected Areas [UNPA's] into Croatia's  legal system.    As has been announced, Croatia will demand that the UN  General Assembly discuss an additional item at its session in  September -- the UNPA's and the problems of their reintegration.  We received firm support on this from many countries and a high  degree of understanding from all countries for Croatia's just  demands.    I also discussed the establishment of diplomatic relations  with Angola and Kenya. I had very important talks with the  heads of the Greek and Italian delegations, where we discussed  problems between Italy and Croatia which must be resolved in a  good-neighborly manner, without any tension. Italy reiterated  its position on the inviolability of borders. I believe that  the prime ministers and foreign ministers will meet during the  conference of the Central European Initiative in Trieste in  mid-July.    As regards Greece, we expect that as the country currently  chairing the European Union [EU], in the next few days it will  reply to Croatia's demand to have talks with the EU on economic  cooperation and on joining the PHARE program.

It  provides that "industrial enterprises and organizations can put  on the market at free (negotiable) prices raw materials,  additional compounds and, with the consent of the respective  organ of the major state administration and of the State  Property Fund, equipment and transport means not engaged in the  technological process, taking into account their real value.  Means obtained from their sale will be added to the circulating  means." Article 2 of the decree stipulates that "industrial  enterprises and organizations not subjected to privatization, as  well as those proposed for partial privatization through the  vouchers of their employees, are allowed to market unfinished  non-productive objects, with the consent of the State Property  Fund."

It also stipulates that "until June 1st 1994 excises  for Moldovan production are levied at the level of 50 percent of  the established rates." Enterprises and organizations should pay  salaries to their employees according to the situation on March  1st. The Moldovan National Bank, "together with the  government," should elaborate and present proposals on the  manner of reciprocal compensation of debts between Moldovan  enterprises and organizations; this should include the mechanism  of their amortization through the promissory note system.

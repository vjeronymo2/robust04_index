			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / County Hall buyer threatens to pull out SHIRAYAMA Corporation, the Japanese company which bought County Hall, headquarters of the former Greater London Council, has threatened to pull out unless the government clarifies its stance on the future development of the site. The company's plan to turn County Hall into a hotel and leisure complex has drawn wide criticism since it bought the site in March from the London Residuary Body, the organisation responsible for winding up the affairs of the GLC. A Shirayama official in London said yesterday: 'We have made it clear that unless the government makes public its policy on the issue, we cannot go on like this.' Shirayama has faced a vigorous campaign against its proposals by the London School of Economics, which wants to relocate to the site. If the company is forced to give up its plans, under a termination agreement included in the deal, it will be seen as an important victory for the LSE and those who say that public benefit should be the main consideration in the sale of such a historically important site. Such a move, however, would be a blow for the government, which aims to get the best price for its assets. Nor would it help to increase the appeal of London to international commercial property developers following the shock to the property market of the failure of the Canary Wharf development in Docklands. Shirayama is believed to have paid Pounds 60m for the main building alone. How much more it is paying for the entire site, which includes three smaller buildings, is not known. Last week, Shirayama submitted plans to the English Heritage watchdog in which it made a number of concessions to local considerations in the hope that they would ease criticism of its proposals. Initial plans to use half the site for luxury flats, for example, were scrapped, partly for commercial reasons, but also to allay concerns raised by the local authorities that the privacy requirements of luxury flats would restrict public access to the site. The hotel complex, with conference rooms, 24-hour restaurant and health centre, would also house a children's education centre, art gallery, library and a central chapel.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Central TV hits record Pounds 41m Central Independent Television, the second largest ITV company, yesterday announced a 68 per cent increase in 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 41.1m. The record performance, which benefited from a reduction in Exchequer Levy worth Pounds 8.5m, gives an early indication of the splits that are likely to widen this year in the ITV system between companies generating considerable profits and those who bid high to retain their franchis-es. Mr Leslie Hill, Central's chairman and chief executive, said: 'I find it difficult to understand how they (a number of high bidders) will be viable but that is for them.' Earnings rose to 94.4p (56.1p). A final dividend of 28p makes a 38p (30.5p) total.</p>

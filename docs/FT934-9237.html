			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Value assets rise SCOTTISH Value Trust, an investment trust which takes substantial stakes in other trusts in order to provoke restructurings, announced a 62 per cent increase in net asset value per share over the year to September 30. The trust has more than doubled its share price and net asset value since launch in July 1991. Over the past year there were restructurings at four of its largest 10 holdings, in particular at Drayton Consolidated and the Independent Investment Company, which became Second Consolidated and Ivory &amp; Sime Enterprise Capital respectively. Mr Bob Borthwick, chairman, said 'despite a narrowing of discounts, the company's investment portfolio as a whole still represents an above average discount to the underlying asset values. I am confident there remains within the sector considerable opportunity for Scottish Value Trust.' Net assets per share at end-September were 97.34p (60.08p). The final dividend is 0.95p for an unchanged total of 1.8p. Earnings were 1.76p (1.78p).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Miguel Angel </F> Burelli Rivas by Manuel Abrizo; place and date not given --  first paragraph is EL NACIONAL introduction]    [Text] Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas has only been able to  fulfill his role as foreign minister during the last week of the  10 weeks he has been in his post. He said during the first  weeks, he had to deal with the post seekers who want to join the  foreign service. The 10 weeks were filled with "little things,"  like explaining why a passport was issued to former Defense  Minister Radames Munoz Leon and explaining to why the appointed  ambassadors have yet to travel to their posts. He considers his  frustrated attempt as OAS secretary general as a closed case.  "I have already said what I had to say."    [Abrizo] And how did you find what they left you?    [Burelli] Fine, in general terms. A gentlemen occupied this  post, and the mess I found was not his; it is old and  accumulated. The Foreign Ministry is not an exception. The  whole country is upside down.    [Abrizo] In 1968, when you were a Tripartite Front  presidential candidate, you said, at the Caracas Metropolitan  Theater, our diplomacy should be substantially modified because  it is inhibited, backward, bogged down by bureaucrats, to give  the world an approximate idea of the country. Has the outlook  changed since then?    [Burelli] It is even more bogged down now. Since then,  foreign service and civil service laws have overlapped, making  it impossible for personnel to move about with the necessary  freedom. That is one aspect; the other, everyone wants a post  abroad, now that officers are paid in dollars. Even the lowest  grade officer earns 400,000 bolivares, which is four times my  salary. Political influence peddlers seek this refuge.  Embassies often have as many as nine times the amount of  required staff. I have asked many Caracas officers to collect  their pay and not come to work bcause they only get in the way  of those who do work. Therefore, we are like it was 26 years  ago. Venezuelan diplomacy is bogged down, and the minister's  duties have dwindled to the point of only dealing with the  lesser issues, not with what concerns international diplomacy,  which should be cared for in the country's best interest.    [Abrizo] You were appointed to solve problems. How will you  face the situation?    [Burelli] I am working on it. I am not here to make another  entry in my resume because I am too old. I am here to do  something, to help President Caldera, who needs not a friend in  this post, but a helper who honors the intention of changing the  country.    [Abrizo] But a strategy is needed to solve these problems.  What is yours?    [Burelli] First, to step on a few toes, and I am willing. I  have requested legal help to comprehensively deal with the  problem. I am asking directors to utilize the powers the law  gives them to dismiss the good-for-nothings. I do not want to  be remembered only as the minister who fixed the personnel issue  but, rather, as the foreign minister who relaunched Venezuela  into the world.    [Abrizo] It so happens we have heard the same speech from  previous foreign ministers.    [Burelli] I need to be given a chance. As I was saying, I  did not come here to add to my resume. I have been a  jack-of-all-trades in this country, and if I cannot do it I will  have failed. I have come to leave my mark. What favor would I  be doing President Caldera by being just another minister who  says silly things he knows he cannot carry out?    [Abrizo] This week, a U.S. official said corruption,  bureaucracy, and deprivation block Latin America's progress.  How can Venezuela's image be sold abroad when it is afflicted  by all this?    [Burelli] Tell me which country does not suffer from at  least  two of these.    [Abrizo] That is no excuse to....    [Burelli] Seen in that light, there could be no agreement  with anyone. Political systems have collapsed in Europe because  of corruption. Those countries have existed for two or three  thousand years. This is a problem from north and south, east  and west. We are attempting to wipe out corruption.  Undoubtedly, we have a president who is above reproach.    [Abrizo] The problem are the vultures [zamuros] flying  around.    [Burelli] But why do we only see the problem, not looking at  who scares away the vultures? Before, there was no one to scare  them away, and the vultures were left guarding the meat.    [Abrizo] Many believe the Foreign Ministry's efforts to  sell Venezuela's image abroad are mere public relations. Is  that a mistake?    [Burelli] It is not a matter of mere public relations. The  issue is if we want to sell Venezuela's image abroad, we must  first improve our image here. It is impossible to sell  something we do not have. What are we going to do if the only  thing that prevails here is chaos, discouragement, and contempt  for the country?    We can cry out to the world and invite them to come to a  fun-loving, investment-safe country, but Caracas television  images travel to other countries, and scenes that can unnerve  anyone are broadcast. We will be saying one thing, and the  media will be saying another. What we are applauding here are  instincts. Venezuela is being associated with the instincts of  the worse segment of its population, exactly the way it is not.    We are in a crisis, but we are not penniless. The price of  crude may have fallen, but it is still priceless as a resource.  We also have gas resources we still have yet to exploit. We  have aluminum, the price of which is beginning to rise on the  world markets. We have iron, and there is untapped gold, which  could be this country's future.    What is missing here is faith in Venezuela's future and  unity. There is also a lack of ethics. We must revert to more  positive values. The private and public sectors have  anticipated getting rich even if it was done the wrong way. The  prevailing factor here is a prey and plunder mentality, as if we  were living in an occupied and beaten country where everything  is booty and we all can get something from somewhere. That is  the type of situation we are in, and it is very difficult to  rectify.  <H5>  To Scare the Brazilian Gold Seeker </H5>   [Abrizo] It has been argued the powers that be act according  to concrete interests, leaving such intangible questions as  principles to Third World countries. Do you think we should be  more realistic?    [Burelli] I said that before, and I did not cite former  British Prime Minister Pitt (William, 1708-78) who said states  have interests, not friendships. We basically have interests,  which we deal with in accordance to the degree of friendship  those interests will allow. We cannot discuss the same question  with a distant nation as we do with a neighboring one. We act  according to our interests. We are facing the world with such  issues as fuel emulsified with water, also known as Orimulsion,  dolphins, and Brazilian gold seekers, just to mention four  [number as published] cases to which the media have referred.  You should find out what has been done regarding those four  problems so that you may realize what the country had to do.  Had we made the wrong decisions, the media would be full of  comments, but because we have made the correct decisions, so  far, there is not even one line.    [Abrizo] It seems the solution to the case of the Brazilian  gold seekers has been to sow seeds fear along the border so that  they will not trespass.    [Burelli] And what do you think should be done? Not even 100  million soldiers would be enough to cover the border. What  would you do? Is it bad we scare away the looters who come to  threaten our natural resources?    [Abrizo] No.    [Burelli] Then?    [Abrizo] The gold seekers claim insofar as there are no  visible borders, there will be problems.    [Burelli] They know better than you and I where the borders  are. Why isn't Brazil protesting our bombing of the landing  strips? Brazil is very grateful of how we have managed the  situation.    [Abrizo] That was a Venezuelan sovereign decision (to bomb  the landing strips).    [Burelli] Oh, good. And then? I do not know what we will  have to do. We will have to send the archbishop, the cardinal  to convince them, to spray them with holy water. It is entirely  untrue the gold seekers do not know the borders due to a lack of  boundary markers. A meeting between the Brazilian and  Venezuelan militaries will be held on 21 April (tomorrow) to  outline future courses of action because Venezuela has stopped a  second bombing on the condition Brazil destroy the strips on  their side of the border. Not even they (gold seekers) believe  the story they are unaware where the boundary markers are.  <H5>  Cuba </H5>   [Abrizo] When you were a candidate, you mentioned the need  to  maintain diplomatic and commercial relations with all countries,  despite their ideological trends. Why is Cuba denied bread and  water?    [Burelli] We have an embassy in Cuba. We have sold them oil;  therefore, we have not denied them bread and water.    [Abrizo] Those are diplomatic formalities.    [Burelli] We might have done for Cuba more than any other  nation on this continent. A three-tier system existed with the  Soviet Union until recently. We sold oil to Cuba, and in  exchange the Soviet Union sold oil for us in Europe.    [Abrizo] But that was merely business.    [Burelli] It was a business that conveyed friendship. It  was not just cold business. Even the Venezuelan Government had  to pay huge costs due to that.    [Abrizo] Every time the topic of Cuba's reincorporation into  the American community is discussed, such questions as liberty,  democracy, and human rights emerge. How do you view Cuba's  reincorporation into the American community?    [Burelli] It cannot be any other way. We want Cuba's  reincorporation into the community, but the community has game  rules.    [Abrizo] And do you believe in those game rules?    [Burelli] Yes I do. Freedom of expression is extremely  important. There are political prisoners, and I wish that there  were no political prisoners anywhere and that all citizens had a  passport to be able to enter and leave their country. That is  all.    [Abrizo] Do you believe Venezuela has any moral authority to  demand compliance with those principles elsewhere?    [Burelli] It has the freedom to allow the people to do  anything they want: to write, talk, and say what they want.  They have the freedom to demonstrate without the threat of  imprisonment. In short, these are the game rules in America.    [Abrizo] Many people in Venezuela would change some of those  freedoms for a piece of bread.  <H5>  Colombia </H5>   [Abrizo] When you resigned from the post of Venezuelan  ambassador to Colombia, people in Santa Fe de Bogota almost  cried over your departure. It was even said you were the best  Venezuelan diplomat assigned to that country. Twenty years  later, after the Colombian Government refused to vote for you in  the OAS, did you feel somewhat hurt?    [Burelli] That means nothing, and you should ask Colombia.  What happened was that I was too young and had much strength and  fervor. I might not have as much strength now, but I do have  the same fervor. I see my friendship with Colombia as a way of  serving Venezuela. I cannot imagine a hateful or hostile  attitude toward Colombia. Whatever they did to me, whatever  they do to me, my interest is for Venezuela and Colombia to  march together always. Our industry is already expanding in  Colombia, and Venezuela's best interest lies in integration.  Colombians regarded me with much sentiment after only four  months of living in Santa Fe Bogota because I founded the Andean  Pact. The Andean Pact was my brainchild, my blood child, the  child of my dreams as a politician. Years after that pact, they  wanted to stone me under the argument that the pact constituted  an act of treason against Venezuela and that I had sold the  Venezuelan market to low-cost foreign labor. Then, the only  author of that pact was Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas. The Andean  Pact has many authors now, and I am very pleased no one  remembers I was its founder.    [Abrizo] Why discuss the revision of relations with  Colombia?    [Burelli] We have not discussed a revision. What is  happening is that relations that are so close, so energetic, so  dynamic need constant changes due to the same divisions they  prompt. Each government imparts a more subtle or marked nuance  to its foreign policy.    [Abrizo] What is yours?    [Burelli] The one I mentioned. Our priority regarding  foreign relations lies with Colombia, Brazil, and the United  States. Concerning Colombia, we will bolster relations in all  areas. Two cabinet members, the Caracas governor and the  development minister, visited Bogota last week. I asked them to  convey a message of friendship and integration, which symbolizes  Venezuela's attitude toward Colombia.    [Abrizo] Do you believe the problem of delimiting marine  waters with Colombia will be solved during this period?    [Burelli] That would be ideal because this is a problem that  has substantially hindered both countries' functions in America.  Our integration has given us considerable strength. Imagine  what we would become had the dispute not cast a shadow upon our  relations.    [Abrizo] Do you see a light at the end of the tunnel?    [Burelli] I see neither light nor darkness. I see real  situations, and we will handle them as the real situations they  are: without sentimentalism or biases. We will try to have a  day for agreements that honor both countries during negotiations.    [Abrizo] But that is too abstract.    [Burelli] And what do you want me to tell you? Do you want  me to tell you to divide this table into two? First, it was the  word, and the word remains the only way to communicate with each  other. We have often discussed specific solutions. In a series  of solutions that result from a long negotiation, one must  choose one of them at some point.    [Abrizo] What is the status of the negotiations?    [Burelli] We have resumed them. No rapprochement had taken  place until this government took office, and it has already  happened.</p>

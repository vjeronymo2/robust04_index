			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (9): Transports of despair - Luisetta Mudie sums up the advantages and disadvantages of Taiwan TAIWAN'S capital, Taipei, has little to recommend it. It combines the traffic problems of Tokyo and Bangkok with precious little of Hong Kong's efficiency; it is the capital of an island, recognised by very few governments, which is forever being confused with Thailand; it is the third most expensive city in Asia; it is harder to get a traveller's cheque cashed in Taipei than in Beijing; just to breathe the air is a health hazard . . . the list is endless. However, Taiwan in general and Taipei in particular do have their advantages. The people are helpful, friendly and well-educated - many speak English. When the defeated Kuomintang troops fled to Taiwan in 1949, they brought with them some of the best chefs in China, and that culinary tradition is still upheld. The city's young, increasingly well-heeled population creates a stimulating atmosphere with an abundance of night-life; the streets are safer at night than in most western cities, and traditional Chinese culture and festivals are still observed. One of the first things a visitor to Taipei notices is the traffic. The explosion in transport occurred mostly over the past five years, when increasing prosperity began to mean crippling import tariffs were no longer a curb on demand for flashy cars. Status is emphasised, rather than utility, so Taipei's narrow back alleys can often be completely blocked by a monster of a Buick or Mercedes negotiating the gap between parked cars. A six-year infrastructure development plan is intended to relieve Taipei's chronic problem, but the city's first Mass Rapid Transit urban railway system is not due for completion until next summer, and the entire network will not be in place until 1997. Until then, the ubiquitous yellow Taipei taxi will continue to be the main form of transport for foreign visitors, and still subject to the twice-daily rush-hour nightmare. Dining out in Taipei is never a problem. China's regional cuisine is well-represented, as well as most western fast food and 'informal dining' chains. There is a large choice for top-end diners, but don't be surprised if dishes are taken away before you think you have finished. Lavish spending has become a way of life in Taiwan, and staff at expensive restaurants have been trained to give the impression that the customer is far too wealthy to want to clean off every plate. Most of the international hotels have a good selection of restaurants, often with all-you-can-eat deals, or set menus. The Lai Lai Sheraton's Teppan-yaki is a good example of this. Wine has hitherto been pricey as a result of a government monopoly on imports, but these were liberalised last month. For an informal dining experience, Taipei's Indian Beer House is a must. It serves Taiwan's favourite dishes, that is, seafood and the delicious 'three-cup chicken' with draught Taiwan beer to wash it down. Located on Pa Teh (Baa-der) Road next to the 24-hour filling station, it is easily recognisable by a dinosaur skeleton protruding from the roof. Away from the smog, to the north of Taipei, sits the largest collection of Chinese art and antiques outside China. Brought to the island by Chiang Kai-shek's defeated Nationalists in 1949 after being carried the length and breadth of China by 'coolies', the collection is housed in the National Palace Museum. It is so large that it takes about 10 years to rotate all the pieces stored in the vaults under the mountain. Other worthwhile tourist attractions are the central cross-island highway, which runs through some stunningly beautiful scenery in the Taroko Gorge National Park. The eastern coastal town of Hualien is the best staging post for this trip, but check conditions during the summer typhoon season. The Yangmingshan National Park, not far from the Museum, offers scenic hikes, sulphur baths, and speciality free-range chicken restaurants every 100 yards. Kenting, at the southernmost tip of the island, offers good seafood, sandy beaches and warm seas, which the locals put down to the proximity of Taiwan's third nuclear power station. Sun Moon Lake, near Taichung in central Taiwan, is to be avoided: the only amazing thing about it is that its water is clean. Despite the economic miracle and the fact that Taiwan is fast approaching developed nation status, it is still only possible to exchange foreign currency into Taiwan dollars at hotels, or specially designated branches of the Bank of Taiwan. Travellers' cheques can also be a problem if they are in sterling - usually all but the issuer will refuse to cash them. Exchange receipts should be kept - tourist visa holders cannot buy US dollars on leaving Taiwan without them. The foreigner's answer to the question of Taiwan's identity varies from day to day, depending on who you talk to. The ruling KMT, which still exerts control over the electronic media, does its best to make Taiwan sound and look as Chinese as possible. But beside the staunch KMT supporters there is a subculture of Taiwan nationalism, which ranges from older Taiwanese who remember the 'good old days' under the Japanese, to the younger generation, which feels no cultural attachment to China. Betel nut chewing, once confined to peasants and long-distance lorry drivers, is now becoming popular among white-collar professionals, intellectuals and teenagers, as an expression of something peculiar to Taiwan. Although the three main Chinese traditional festivals: New year, the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Autumn Moon festival are still observed, and Beijing opera is on offer in Taipei's Hsimenting district, films by directors such as Hou Hsiao-hsien (City of Sadness, Dust of Angels) and work by the Cloud Gate dance company have a uniquely Taiwanese feel, which has in the past been regarded as subversive by KMT elders.</p>

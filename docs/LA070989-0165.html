			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS TO SHUT DOWN 5 REACTORS USED FOR A-ARMS  </P> <P> The Soviet government has decided to shut down all five nuclear reactors  producing plutonium for nuclear weapons at this top-secret military center in  the Ural Mountains, idling two more reactors than originally announced by  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev three months ago in London.  </P> <P> The decision was revealed here by Boris V. Brokhovich, the center's director,  during an unprecedented two-day visit by a group of U.S. congressmen and  independent scientists to this vast city with no official name.  </P> <P> In the latest example of the Soviet defense establishment's increasing use of  openness, Brokhovich guided the group on a lengthy tour of his nation's first  military reactor and allowed his aides to release detailed new information  about Soviet weapons production.  </P> <P> He said in an interview Saturday that two of the site's reactors are shut now,  a third will be closed next month and the remaining two will cease operating in  1991.  </P></p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Sweden tries again to beat the budget deficit: The fourth financial package in a year WHEN Ms Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, presents the country's 1993-94 budget today there could be a strong sense of deja vu about its contents. This, after all, will be the fourth package of financial measures to be proposed by the minority coalition government since this time last year - if you include two crisis packages in September and a third, later withdrawn, when the krona was floated in November. As before, the emphasis will be on cutting public spending, however unwelcome this might be for the government when its counterbalancing tax-cutting plans have been stymied by deep recession. In reality it has little choice but to cut further, despite the spending reductions of SKr68bn (Pounds 6.3bn) it announced last year, as the budget deficit is still growing. With gross national product set to decline for the third consecutive year in 1993, the government knows that if it cuts benefits too heavily it risks a further drop in private consumption and a delay to economic recovery. It also knows that if it tries to spend its way to recovery it might inflame the deficit further. Hence it is likely that the package will have a longer-term flavour to it, incorporating both a strong savings element and measures that accord with the government's free-market strategy to encourage private initiative. The trick will be to minimise the near-term impact on demand while doing enough to convince nervous markets that Sweden is still serious about tackling its budget deficit. According to one leaked report, a total of SKr90bn in savings will be outlined, but only SKr10bn-12bn of this will take effect in 1993-94, while a further SKr20bn a year will be enforced over the following four years (well after the government's current mandate expires) when the economy should be in better shape. But many observers feel that even cuts of this order are not sufficient, in the context of a budget deficit which this fiscal year (1992-93) will reach SKr200bn and is unlikely to be much lower next year. Even SKr10bn in savings next year is only equal to the amount the government was forced to provide in guarantees to just one of its stricken banks last week. If the government is not tougher, it is partly because of political realities. Its measures need the support of either the Social Democrats or the populist right-wing New Democracy party. The Social Democrats, who now command 45-46 per cent popularity ratings in the polls, supported the first two crisis packages but refused to back the third. In addition, the government has to take account of the effect its actions will have on interest rate and currency movements. Interest rates have come down since the devaluation, with the central bank's key marginal rate of 10.5 per cent now 2 percentage points below what it was before the krona was freed. However, this is still high by international standards and the pain in the domestic economy is considerable. The scope for further reductions is being undermined by the steady weakening of the krona, which has now fallen by 20 per cent against the dollar since the devaluation. The government is determined to maintain its anti-inflation credentials, not least as part of its strategy of participating in European monetary union. But worries over the size of the government's borrowing requirement saw market interest rates edge higher last week. The main worry remains the budget deficit, which is now nearly three times the SKr70m level predicted a year ago, having been exacerbated by falling tax revenues, rising unemployment and the cost of bailing out the crisis-stricken banking system. Funding the interest on its debt is now the government's single largest outlay. The government will be hoping its calculations are more accurate this year. However, its sums could easily be thrown out by developments within the domestic economy - with unemployment set to rise further from its current 7.2 per cent level and the banking crisis yet to show signs of bottoming out  -as well as abroad. In any case, it will be desperately hoping for some signs of economic recovery during 1993, an election year, and the last thing it will want to do next January is to present another austerity package unrelieved by any handouts.</p>

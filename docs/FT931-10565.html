			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / US oil group in Yemen warned of risk to staff A SPATE of kidnappings and hijacks in Yemen has prompted the oil minister to ask the biggest foreign oil company in the country to close down operations for the safety of its foreign staff. Mr Saleh Abu Bakr bin Hussainoun told executives of Hunt Oil, the US oil group which pumps 170,000 barrels a day of Yemen's 200,000 b/d output, that increasing lawlessness among some Yemeni tribes meant he could no longer guarantee the safety of its 300 expatriate employees. The oil minister's request follows an outbreak of gunpoint hold-ups of expatriates in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, the kidnapping and release of a Japanese expatriate and the abduction on January 24 of Mr Mike Schmitz, a Canadian employee of Sterling Air Services. However Hunt Oil said it would continue operating. Mr Schmitz is still being held by a Yemeni tribe, apparently as a bargaining chip in a land dispute with the government.</p>

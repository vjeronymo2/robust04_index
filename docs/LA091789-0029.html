			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE JIM BAKKER SAGA  </P> <P> Regarding "Amazing Disgrace" by Garry Abrams, Sept. 1: Amazing disgrace -- a  cute play on "religious" words. The media, particularly newspapers, are full of  them these days.  </P> <P> The "second coming," referring to the second time Jesus Christ will come to  Earth (for those with no knowledge of the original context), is another one.  That theme's been used to report everything from the repopularization of motion  picture characters to the comebacks of sports celebs.  </P> <P> There are other examples, left unmentioned for the sake of brevity, all with  religious overtones. Although trite, I'd stop short of calling it cheap  journalism, even for subjects of such cosmic significance to mankind. There is,  however, an inherent disregard (at the very least thoughtlessness) for the  sacred in all of this -- ultimately to our discredit and misfortune.  </P> <P> JOHN E. HUBBARD, La Crescenta  </P></p>

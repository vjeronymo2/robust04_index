			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / IMF staff draw up plans for SDR fund INTERNATIONAL Monetary Fund staff are working on proposals to make substantial sums available to Russia and other post-communist states via new allocations of Special Drawing Rights, the IMF's own currency. Leading IMF constituent members - the US, Japan and Germany - are believed to harbour various reservations on what would be a first general issue of SDRs in 12 years. But its broad outlines were discussed in Hong Kong last weekend at the meeting of G7 'sherpas' convened to discuss assistance to Russia, according to a G7 official in Moscow. Under the proposal, which is said to have the support of Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director, the IMF's richer member states would return their share - amounting on one estimate to around Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn - of an SDR allocation, which would go towards a trust fund for support of the post-communist states. In the case of Russia, much of the money earmarked would be used to provide a social safety net for those made unemployed by the economic reforms, and for pensioners and others on low incomes. The attraction of the initiative for the IMF - still the principal institution for the transfer of assistance to Russia - is that it could be presented as a technical decision of its own, rather than as a measure quickly cobbled together to answer to the political demands of the moment. In addition, the risk of default would be borne by the countries which contributed to the trust fund, rather than by the IMF itself.</p>

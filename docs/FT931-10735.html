			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Markets: Helmut, the charge is 'adventurism' - London the charge levelled against the Russian central bank this week by President Boris Yeltsin - was also the theme of an attack on the Bundesbank by the German chambers of commerce. For most European businessmen, Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, has been the architect of an intolerably high level of interest rates. For them, the cut in German rates on Thursday came not a moment too soon. Even the London stock market, less sensitive to the level of German interest rates since sterling's departure from the ERM, rejoiced. It rose to a new intra-day high after the cut, with the FT-SE 100 index passing briefly through 2,900 for the first time. Yet the German chambers of commerce felt impelled to criticise the Bundesbank not for tightness but for excessive laxity. The eventual, essential conquest of inflation was threatened by the cut in rates, they argued. Prof. Mervyn King, the economics boss at the Bank of England, has argued in the past that merely making a central bank independent does not deliver truly independent monetary policy; you also need a consensus about the importance of monetary stability. That comment from the German chambers of commerce gives you some idea what such a consensus means - and just how far Britain is away from achieving it. Indeed, to judge from the behaviour of the UK stock market all this week you would think inflation was a new wonder-drug. On Monday, the market seized on a report in the press that John Major had personally taken control of monetary policy and planned to cut base rates by two more percentage points by the summer. Even though Downing Street went out of its way to deny this story, the markets decided it was basically correct. Sterling fell sharply. In spite of the threat of higher prices on imported goods, the FT-SE 100 index rose 1.6 per cent, to close at 2,851.6. Interest-rate sensitive stocks were among the big gainers. Tuesday was calmer, and the index dropped back slightly. But by Wednesday, with fresh pressure on weaker European currencies and a growing expectation that the Bundesbank would ease rates the next day, the onward advance of equities resumed. Blue chips did particularly well, and the FT-SE index more than made up the previous day's losses, closing at a new high of 2,873.8. On Thursday, when the German announcement finally came, equities moved up again, then dropped back. They fell further on Friday, with the index closing the week at 2,862.9, for a total rise of 55.7. Volume was high - on Thursday, trading by clients was over Pounds 2bn, its highest since the day sterling left the ERM. This enthusiasm for equities came against a steady rumble of worrying comment from analysts. One theme was the fact that British companies are paying out a higher proportion of their earnings than at any time since the mid 1960s. For the market as a whole, dividend cover - the ratio of companies' dividends to after-tax earnings per share - has fallen below 1.8 times in recent weeks. For most of the 1970s and 1980s, it ranged between 2.2 and 3.0. The figure highlights the extent to which companies have been prepared to keep dividend payouts high despite the impact of the recession on earnings - a fact that will be rammed home when the results season gets under way next Thursday. The low level of dividend cover is ominous for equities, some analysts argue, because it implies that companies will be keen to rebuild cover as their earnings recover in the next few years. A recent survey of company finance directors by James Capel showed that they hoped to rebuild cover over time to 2.3 times. To do this, says Capel's Paul Walton, 'earnings have got to be growing a little bit faster than dividends for a considerable period of time.' Dividend growth is particularly important to the actuaries who calculate the adequacy of pension funds. Slow dividend growth will lower the likely return from equities relative to bonds, making institutions keener to buy gilts. Such a trend would be good news for the Treasury and the Bank of England, faced with the task of selling record amounts of gilts this year. But it would be bad news for equities. Sushil Wadhwani and Mustaq Shah of Goldman Sachs reinforced this theme with a weighty piece of research examining the relative attractions of gilts and equities. They concluded that equities are likely to outperform gilts by less than in the past; and that pension funds are likely to regard equity investment as 'riskier' because of a need for steady income flows to pay the pensions of the growing proportion of retired members. Equities would still remain the preferred investment, but would form a smaller proportion of assets than in the past, say the authors. This could be a medium-term drag on the performance of the stock market; shares would rise by less than would be warranted by improvements in earnings and interest rates. Such thinking failed to influence institutional investors this week. Private clients have been bullish for months, according to David Jones, chief executive of the Sharelink dealing service. His figures show that trading by private clients has been high, and biased towards buying, ever since October. 'We've only had one or two days in the last few months when we've had a 'normal' ratio of buys to sells,' he says. For private clients, buying is now stronger than ever in the past five years, and it is widely spread: 'They're buying everything, right across the market.' In Russia, they would probably call that adventurism.</p>

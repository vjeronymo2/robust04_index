Kamberova: ``Treatment in Wrecked Premises''] </F>   [Text] Patients who must be treated in a sterile  environment are being treated in humid areas. Health inspectors  demand improvements in the overall condition of the clinic.    For several months, the Hematology Clinic of the Skopje  School of Medicine has existed in a situation bordering on the  absurd. Patients who must be hospitalized and treated in sterile  premises are being treated in hospital rooms that not only are  not properly sterile, but are in ruins. They are perennially  humid and quite frequently the sewage pipes leak.    The Hematology Clinic of former Yugoslavia was one of the  top  clinics in terms of technology and personnel, says Docent Doctor  Nikola Siljanovski, its director. Currently, it can boast only  of its personnel who, he claims, meet all requirements of  contemporary hematology and bone marrow transplants. This is the  only Macedonian institution to treat blood and blood generating  organs (erythrocytes, leucocytes, thrombocytes...). More than 60  percent of hematological diseases of the blood consist of  malignant hemopathies. Patients suffering from such afflictions  become immunodeficient, Doctor Siljanovski explains. They lack  white blood cells, which protect the body. This means that the  very methods for the treatment of such patients, at a specific  phase in the development of the disease, requires specific  conditions, such as treating them in separate wards, isolated  and sterile, thus ensuring a high degree of protection from  infections. In the past, in the good old times, the proper  conditions were observed and the personnel treating such  patients were thoroughly protected with special masks.  Unfortunately, this is now part of the past. Today there is  moisture everywhere, particularly along the walls, broken tiles,  and water seeping, most probably from sewer pipes. The premises  smell of moisture and rot and, in general, hygiene in the  premises is exceptionally poor. The treatment standards are  below all standards. Under such poor conditions for treating  patients, the logical consequence is worsened health and  increased cases of hospital infections. Most of the findings of  the inspectors confirm that the sanitary and hygienic conditions  of the Hematological Clinic are poor. The inspectors have  repeatedly pointed out that the overall working conditions in  the clinic, particularly in the test laboratories, must be  improved. The inspectors issue their orders to the clinic, which  is unable to resolve the problem for the simple reason that such  improvements require funds.    In addition to the ``communal'' problems, the work of the  Hematology Clinic is also made more difficult because of the  obsolete equipment, long years of failure to invest in equipment  and in building repairs, and the frequent shortage of reagents,  substrata, and markers required in genetic methodology.    I believe, Doctor Siljanovski said, that hematology has been  unfairly neglected. It must be considered part of internal  medicine and developed the same as all other medical  disciplines. The current inadequate handling of it compromises  the exceptionally complex treatment of blood diseases.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> USC;  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME HAS HAD ITS WAY IN SERIES  </P> <P> The USC-Notre Dame series, which resumes Saturday night at the Coliseum, has  been dominated in recent years by Notre Dame, which hasn't lost to the Trojans  since 1982.  </P> <P> "It's been a great seven years if you're a Notre Dame fan," Irish nose tackle  Chris Zorich told Frank Welch of the San Gabriel Valley Tribune after last  year's 28-24 victory at South Bend, Ind.  </P> <P> "It's the kind of streak where the other team thinks it's jinxed. We've had  some lucky breaks, but don't the great teams get most of the breaks, anyway?  </P> <P> "It's fun because our beating them has become an annual thing."  </P> <P> All but overlooked in USC's 45-42 victory over UCLA was a third-quarter field  goal by Quin Rodriguez, which provided the margin of victory and enabled  Rodriguez to set a school record with the 52nd field goal of his Trojan career.

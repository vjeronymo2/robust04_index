			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO BRUINS REPORTEDLY WILL TRANSFER  </P> <P> Two UCLA football players, including a potential defensive starter, have  announced plans to transfer, a spokesman for UCLA's sports information office  said Monday.  </P> <P> Fred Gilbert, a sophomore flanker from Huntsville, Tex., will transfer to  Houston.  </P> <P> He played sparingly as a redshirt freshman last season, failing to catch a  pass.  </P> <P> Patrick Bates, a 6-foot-4, 215-pound sophomore strong safety from Galveston,  Tex., has not announced his plans, but told the Galveston Daily News that he  has visited Houston and has scheduled visits to Miami and Texas A&amp;M. He  also is considering Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana State.  </P> <P> Bates, who two years ago at Ball High in Galveston was considered the nation's  No. 1 safety prospect, was expected to play next season behind junior Matt  Darby and senior Eric Turner.  </P> <P> But Coach Terry Donahue said at the end of spring practice: "We're  (alternating) three safeties and Bates is right in the hunt for a starting  position."  </P> <P> Bates, one of only two Bruins to play last season as a true freshman, told the  Galveston Daily News: ". . . The bottom line was, UCLA was not the place for  me."  </P></p>

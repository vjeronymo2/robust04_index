			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORD MAY TAKE $500-MILLION CHARGE  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co. disclosed Tuesday that it may take a charge of up to $500  million against 1989 earnings because it sold its Rouge Steel Co. subsidiary  for less than book value.  </P> <P> In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ford also said it is  projecting North American production for the first quarter of 1990 to be off  25% from the same period in 1989, following a 13% decline in the quarter just  ended.  </P> <P> Ford also said it would increase borrowings "substantially" this year because  of two recent acquisitions.  </P> <P> The disclosures came in a filing by a wholly owned Ford subsidiary, Ford Motor  Credit Co., seeking SEC permission to offer $2 billion in debt securities from  time to time over the next two years.  </P> <P> Ford Motor Credit provides wholesale financing and capital loans to franchised  Ford dealers and makes loans to vehicle leasing companies.  </P> <P> As part of the SEC's required disclosure to potential investors, the  registration filing revealed several situations at the parent company:  </P> <P> * Ford's Dec. 15, 1989, sale of all the outstanding stock of Rouge Steel Co. to  Marico Acquisition Corp. "was below book value. The amount of the charge to net  income has not yet been determined, but could range up to $500 million for the  fourth quarter and full year 1989."  </P> <P> * Marico was merged into Rouge Steel and Ford acquired 20% in the resulting  corporation but also is committed to indemnify Rouge Steel for "environmental  matters" prior to the sale. "Ford is unable at this time to determine the  amount of its potential responsibility for such environmental matters; however,  such costs could be substantial."  </P> <P> * On Jan. 12, Ford announced plans to sell Ford Aerospace but "it is uncertain  when, or at what price, such sale may occur."  </P> <P> * The acquisition of Associates, a major consumer loan concern, and Jaguar PLC,  the British luxury car maker, "have used and will continue to use substantial  amounts of available cash. Consequently, it is anticipated that Ford and its  affiliates will substantially increase borrowings in 1990."  </P> <P> * Ford estimated its North American vehicle production in the fourth quarter of  1989 was "13% below the fourth quarter of 1988."  </P></p>

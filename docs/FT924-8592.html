			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Midland pulls out of sterling CP market MIDLAND Bank yesterday pulled out of the sterling commercial paper (CP) market, signalling further concentration in a market already dominated by its rivals BZW and National Westminster. 'We've had a thorough review of this area and concluded that we can't generate a sufficient return out of it to make it worth carrying on,' Midland said. The bank began dealing when the sterling commercial paper market opened in 1986, and had become the third most active bank in the area. However, the sector has never developed as strongly as some other areas of the Euro-CP market, leading to a succession of withdrawals - including those of S. G. Warburg and Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant banks - in recent years. This year, the amount of paper outstanding in the market has remained generally flat, at between Pounds 4.1bn and Pounds 4.8bn (Dollars 6.35bn-Dollars 7.44bn). Mr David Knight, head of CP at BZW, said Midland's withdrawal would not undermine the sterling CP market. 'We're still very much committed to it,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 26 Apr (INA) -- Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the  UN Special Commission, has described his talks with Iraqi  officials over the past two days as good and constructive.    Ekeus told the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY his talks addressed  political and technical points. He called the talks a  professional and ongoing exercise.    Asked whether the talks sought to work out a timetable for  long-term monitoring and the implementation of Paragraph 22 of  Resolution 687, Ekeus said the subject was discussed in detail.    It is up to the UN Security Council to lift the sanctions,  since such a move is a political decision, Ekeus said.    Iraqi officials and the Special Commission, he said, are now  drafting a joint statement about the result of the latest talks.    The IRAQI NEWS AGENCY has learned that subcommittees on both  sides began holding closed sessions to prepare the statement.  Rolf Ekeus is due to hold a news conference this afternoon at  the al-Rashid Hotel where he is staying.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Giving CFCs the cold shoulder  -Peter Knight asks why domestic refrigerators are still not free of dangerous chlorofluorocarbons If it is possible to make a CFC-free domestic refrigerator, why don't we find them in the shops? 'Technically, there is no reason why a CFC-free refrigerator cannot be produced now. The reason why there is none on the market has something to do with the cost and perhaps the manufacturers' view of the market,' says Jane Gartshore of the UK-based consultants Cool Concerns. While most industries that use CFCs have reduced their dependence on the ozone-depleting chemicals, the EC's refrigeration sector has increased their use by 4 per cent during 1986-91, according to CEFIC, the European chemical makers association. The slow progress of domestic refrigerator makers towards eliminating their dependence on CFCs is a case of commercial hedging in the face of, some say, minor technical difficulties and major economic uncertainties. EC countries have agreed to cease CFC production by 1997, three years before the date stipulated by the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement reached originally in 1987. The protocol is about to be re-negotiated and the phase-out date in the US and EC is likely to be brought forward to the end of 1995. 'But those dates are a long way away for people caught in a recession,' says Mike Harris of ICI, which supplies CFCs and some alternatives (see box, right). Domestic refrigerators use CFCs both as a coolant and to make the foam insulation. (The foam, which is made by blowing CFCs into polyurethane, also helps to support the refrigerator's structure.) Refrigerator makers wanted a 'drop-in' chemical replacement that they could use without incurring heavy retooling costs. This proved impossible. CFC makers quickly produced replacement refrigerants, notably HCF-134a, but the chemicals could not be used until changes were made to compressors and a new lubricant found. The technical problems associated with 134a have now been overcome but only one domestic product in the UK, a Danish-made chest freezer sold by Iceland, uses 134a. Refrigerator makers have rejected other coolants - such as propane and ammonia - on health and safety grounds. Ammonia is toxic and propane is highly flammable (it is used as bottled gas). Manufacturers are worried about the risks of using these alternatives in the factory, and they are concerned that there will be consumer resistance to their use in domestic refrigerators. There are, though, technical difficulties in producing an insulation foam which is as efficient as that made with CFCs. Yet refrigerator makers have some 25 potential solutions to insulating their products. These can be divided roughly into three groups of options. First, a reduction in CFCs. Manufacturers can use a blowing agent that is far less harmful to the ozone layer (made with a small amount of a chemical from the CFC family, R22). Bosch produces three free-standing refrigerators with such foam, although the appliances still use CFC as the coolant. Environmentalists reject this foam technology and point to the second option, CFC-free alternatives. Pentane has been promoted in Germany by chemical maker Bayer, but manufacturers have rejected it because of flammability problems. Manufacturers do not think the CO technology is good enough to use on big production lines. Furthermore, they say they cannot afford to add extra insulation because they have to make fitted refrigerators to standard kitchen design sizes, or risk losing custom to those that do. For the same reason they do not want to reduce the capacity of the refrigerator by encroaching on its inner dimensions. But just how much extra foam is needed is in dispute. John Missenden, of the Institute of Environmental Engineering at London's South Bank University, says it is 'a matter of millimetres'. Missenden's department produced a propane-driven refrigerator with CO-blown foam insulation, commissioned by Greenpeace. The prototypes worked well, but no manufacturers have shown an interest in using the technology. 'There's been polite applause but no manufacturers take it seriously because they don't take technology seriously,' says Missenden. The third possible foam alternative is being developed by ICI, the leading European producer of CFC substitutes. It is trying to use 134a to blow polyurethane and a product is promised in a few years. There are other forms of insulation. These include fibre wool, expanded polystyrene and vacuum panels. The wool and polystyrene are generally rejected for being too bulky and the panels are not yet commercially available. If these alternatives were to be used, the refrigerator design would have to be changed and might need strengthening with other materials. While a CFC-free refrigerator could be made today, manufacturers feel that the technology would only be an interim solution. Such a refrigerator will also be more expensive to make (134a is five times as costly as CFC) because of the cost of development and retooling. Dorothy Mackenzie, of the consultancy Dragon International, says the environmental performance comes low in the ranking of consumer decisions when buying white goods. This provides insufficient stimulus for manufacturers to risk the cost of launching a new, and probably more expensive, product. 'Manufacturers were once sold the idea that people would pay a premium for green goods. They are now waking up to the fact that these premiums won't be paid,' says Mackenzie. And CFC suppliers are caught in a difficult commercial position. They do not want to transfer pressure from the environmental lobby on to their customers, because that could ruin business relationships. But they need to sell more of their alternatives to recoup the enormous development costs. 'There is a general disappointment that the market has not developed as we would have liked. But the best thing for us is to do everything in our power to ease the change-over for our customers,' says Harris. 'But the carrot is not there and neither is the stick. There's not much more ICI or other suppliers can do at the moment.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CFCs in use Amounts compared with 1986 base Source: EFCTC report to EC Commission                     1986    1987    1988   1989    1990    1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aerosol              100     100      80     35      15      11 Refrigeration        100     102     103    108     100     104 Foams                100     112     120    111      97      87 Solvents and         100     104     111    100      90      76 Miscellaneous  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                100     104      98     73      58      51  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

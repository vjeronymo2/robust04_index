			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Menem warns over economy President Carlos Menem has warned governors of Argentina's 23 provinces against inserting clauses into the country's new constitution that could destabilise his economic policies. Most of the provinces are controlled by Mr Menem's Peronist party and are in serious financial trouble. They intend to insert a clause in the constitution ordering the federal government to transfer half its tax revenues to the provinces. But Mr Menem told them in a radio interview on Wednesday 'to be quiet and try to contribute to reforming the constitution without introducing destabilising elements.' A constituent assembly is rewriting Argentina's 1853 constitution to allow Mr Menem to run for re-election to a second four-year term next year, in addition to strengthening the legislature and the judiciary. The assembly is also considering additional reforms, including the relationship between local and federal governments. Mr Menem warned that interfering in current tax-sharing mechanisms would undermine federal finances and destabilise the economy, as has happened in Brazil under its 1988 constitution. Under the current system, the provinces receive 56 per cent of selected taxes, such as value added tax. But they do not have a right to other taxes, notably customs revenues. In May, the provinces got an estimated Dollars 424m (Pounds 279m) in federal transfers, while the federal government's total tax revenues were Dollars 1.86bn. However, many provinces have signed agreements with Buenos Aires entitling them to larger, fixed transfers in exchange for economic reforms at local level.</p>

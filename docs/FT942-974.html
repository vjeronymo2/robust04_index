			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Ashdown attacks 'fuzzy words' of Blair Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, yesterday launched an attack on the 'warm fuzzy words and soft-focus policies' of Mr Tony Blair, the front-runner for the Labour leadership. In a speech to the Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors Mr Ashdown attempted to head off the threat of a Blair-led Labour party by emphasising the differences between the two main opposition parties. Mr Ashdown said there was a clear distinction between the Liberal Democrats and socialism - 'even the socialism of Tony Blair'. He said Mr Blair's starting point was society, the collective, while the Liberal Democrats stressed the role of the individual. Mr Ashdown accused Labour of centralising power and serving its 'client groups' in the public sector and trade unions. In contrast, Liberal Democrats decentralised and handed back power to 'a community of individuals'. When asked during the Eastleigh by-election campaign earlier this month about the threat posed by Labour's shadow home secretary, Mr Ashdown said he never gave it 'a second thought'. It is clear from his speech that Mr Ashdown shares the growing concern among Liberal Democrats that Mr Blair poses a serious threat of winning over centrist voters without making any policy statements. Mr Ashdown said: 'I have this warning for Labour - you cannot win the next election by warm fuzzy words and soft-focus policies. You cannot win by attacking the government and putting nothing in its place. Governing Britain is a serious business and it demands serious ideas.' Mr Blair sought to set out his policy themes yesterday by calling for a fairer taxation system. He cited the example of some utility companies that pay their directors 'large sums of money' and pay big dividends while 'paying very little tax at all'. In an interview with BBC Television's On the Record, Mr Blair said he believed that parents should be given as wide a choice as possible - which meant they should know how schools ranked against one another and how well their children were performing. 'I have no problem at all in comparing schools, I think it is entirely sensible and natural - where I disagree and where the party disagrees is with the notion of the government's rather simplistic league tables. In relation to this and testing, of course you have to have proper appraisal systems.' Mr Blair said opted-out schools, which are currently answerable directly to Mr John Patten, education secretary, should be redirected to local education authorities.</p>

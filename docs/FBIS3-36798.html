			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to Seimas </F> session in Vilnius -- live; in Ukrainian with  sentence-by-sentence translation into Lithuanian]    [Text] [Words indistinct] friendly relations between our  two states will become an important political step aimed at  strengthening and widening of mutually beneficial bilateral ties  in all areas of our mutual relations. The people of Ukraine  have great esteem for the friendly Lithuanian nation with which  we share ancient historical ties dating back to ancient times.    Our relations trace their roots from the times of Kiev Rus  which played a significant role in the establishment of  Lithuania. In its turn, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania helped  Ukrainians to a great extent in preserving their traditions,  language, and religion, and keeping the original culture of our  people from extinction. It was during that period close ties  between our states and our people originated, now adopting a new  nature.    Who knows whether linguists are right in asserting a  similarity between our languages? But when we hear the  melodious Lithuanian language, it is indeed reminiscent of our  native Ukrainian. At any rate, the name Kravchuk in Ukraine is  usually followed alphabetically by names like Lytvyn,  Lytvynchuk, and the like.    A notable event in the history of our relations was the  peace  treaty between Ukraine and Lithuania signed in 1921, according  to which the then Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and the  Lithuanian Democratic Republic recognized each other's  sovereignty and independence. A qualitatively new stage in the  relations between our countries began in 1991, after Ukraine and  Lithuania acquired state independence. It is symbolic that  Ukraine was among the first to recognize Lithuania as an  independent state, while Lithuania was among the first to  recognize Ukraine's political independence.    We attach priority significance to our relations with the  Lithuanian republic. They benefit not only from the old  historical ties, but also from the common positions and views  shared by our countries on a wide range of international and  regional issues. A    factor which brings our people closer is the presence of a  large Ukrainian community in Lithuania. I would like to take  advantage of this opportunity and express through the esteemed  Lithuanian Seimas our deep gratitude to the Lithuanian people,  the president and the government of Lithuania for the attention  they give to the national and cultural needs of Ukrainians.    Lithuania is one of Ukraine's biggest trade partners.  However, the development of trade and economic ties between our  states has not yet achieved its full potential. Ukraine and  Lithuania could cooperate to mutual advantage in practically any  area. This includes export of ore, coal, coke, rolled metal and  metal products, electronic technology, and machine-building  products from Ukraine. For its part, Ukraine expects to receive  various products from Lithuania including consumer goods such as  footwear and clothing, as well as products of the chemical and  the electronic industries.    We have broad possibilities for cooperation in the area of  transport. For example, Ukraine is interested in having access  to the Baltic Sea and at the same time Lithuania could use the  potential of Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea.    I cannot omit to mention the broad perspectives for the  development of cultural cooperation between our countries that  have ancient traditions. It was here in Vilnius that Taras  Shevchenko, the great Ukrainian poet, artist and thinker, took  his first steps in art and literature. Lesya Ukrayinka, the  distinguished Ukrainian poetess, was in the famous resort of  Druskininkai. And the eminent Lithuanian poet Jonas Maironis  worked in Kiev.    In my opinion we are obliged not only to preserve these  traditions but to multiply them in every possible way and pass  them on from one generation to another. In the period that has  passed, a great legal foundation was laid on bilateral relations  between our two states along diplomatic channels. Today we will  sign a treaty on friendship and cooperation with President  Brazauskas and I am convinced that it will open a new stage in  the development of equal and friendly relations between our  states. There is much that unites our peoples.    Unfortunately, today we have common problems. The transition  to a market economy is quite a difficult and often painful  process and we have felt this. However, Ukraine and I am  convinced that Lithuania also, have consciously chosen this path  and we will move step-by-step, by means of economic reform and  interaction and one state helping another.    We are gradually carrying out privatization and  demonopolization, are putting in order the financial and banking  system and have adopted a program of anti-inflationary measures.  Obviously, we have not managed to do all this quickly and  effectively. There are factors, both internal and external, that  stimulate this process and there are objective and subjective  factors. Despite this we regard the future with optimism and are  convinced that with time we will overcome these difficult times  and these difficult processes because there is no other  alternative. We hope to have mutually beneficial cooperation  with all other states including with the Republic of Lithuania.  Our emerging from the economic crisis will significantly speed  up this process. As the Lithuanian popular saying goes, more is  done when two people are at work.    Both Ukraine and Lithuania were always considered to be  European states and we link our future with the new Europe and  for this reason we aspire to be integrated with the European  political, economic and other structures. Ukraine views  positively the partnership for peace programme which was  recently adopted at a NATO session in Brussels. We consider that  an important step has been made in the area of building a new  system of general European security and bringing Eastern Europe  closer to the West.    In connection with this, we welcome the signing of this  important document by the Republic of Lithuania and on our part  we are preparing to carry out corresponding measures in the near  future. Today our minister of foreign affairs is in Brussels.  From the point of view of the mentioned special urgency, in our  opinion Ukraine could put forward an initiative on the creation  of a zone of stability and security in the Central and Eastern  European region which would include all the countries of the  Baltic and Black Sea region. It is possible that this initiative  to some extent coincides with other projects regarding the  general European security system.    In its declaration of state sovereignty, Ukraine proclaimed  its intention to adopt a non-nuclear status, thus becoming the  first state to voluntarily give up the nuclear arms it  inherited. By this, it proved once again the peaceful nature of  its foreign policy aimed at defusing tension in Europe and the  entire world. An important step towards strengthening of  international security and stability was the recent signing by  Ukraine, the United States and Russia of a trilateral statement  which envisages elimination of the nuclear arms deployed on the  territory of Ukraine.    Esteemed ladies and gentlemen! Our peoples had to suffer  bitter times and injustice on their road to freedom and  independence. But in spite of that, we are building our  statehood, reviving national culture and spirituality, we and  look to the future with hope. I am convinced that this can be  greatly helped by the development of friendly and mutually  beneficial relations between Ukraine and the Lithuanian  Republic, and by constant contact between the leadership of our  countries, including that at the top level.    In conclusion, I would like to wish the esteemed Seimas  fruitful work, and the friendly Lithuanian people - happiness,  peace and prosperity on the road of independent development. I  sincerely hope that relations between our states will develop  and strengthen for the benefit of our peoples. Thank you for  your attention.</p>

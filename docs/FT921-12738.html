			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Major defends vocational qualifications THE PRIME MINISTER yesterday announced a new set of vocational qualifications which will be available as an alternative to A-levels from September. Mr Major, speaking at a conference organised by the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, said good vocational education was not inferior to a good academic education. He said that old-fashioned prejudices and snobberies could have no place in the world of education and should have no place in society. Mr Major said general national vocational qualifications (GNVQs) would be available for schools and further education colleges to teach from this autumn. The qualifications are based on the new system of vocational qualifications but will be less job-specific than the national vocational qualifications (NVQs). He also said that from 1994, 'advanced diplomas' will be awarded to students with three A-level passes or 'equivalent' vocational qualifications. GNVQs and diplomas were outlined in the education and training for the 21st-century white paper. The prime minister also endorsed the target for 1m people to have achieved NVQs by 1995, a target set by the National Council for Vocational Qualifications. At present, about 100,000 people hold such qualifications. Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman of the national council and chairman and chief executive of the Post Office, called on Britain's top companies to become the first 1,000 to take up the challenge. Last year the Confederation of British Industry, with the support of the government, the Trades Union Congress and several other bodies set voluntary targets for the proportion of people gaining NVQs. Mr Jack Straw, Labour education spokesman, said Mr Major's speech was 'pathetic' and offered nothing new. 'This confirms the government has run out of ideas about how to improve sorely needed skills in education and training,' he said.</p>

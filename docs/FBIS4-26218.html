			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 18 (CNS)--There are some facts summed  in ten points about employment in China.    --As the idea on employment sees some change, the  "life-long"  employment receives great impacts. A survey shows that a mere  one third of respondents have not yet changed their jobs. There  was so much transfer of jobs last year which hit a record in the  history of employment in China.    --Sense of value regarding employment strengthens to a  certain extent and income differences widens. Employees tend to  choose business entities which show great economic results and  put emphasis on value of human resources.    --Autonomy of job seeking is rather strong. Individuals tend  to choose career according to one's own desire and ability,  reversing the job allocation employed under the planned economy.    --Quality of employees improves at a rapid pace. Vocational  schools across the country offer job training while special  training is also available for workers who want to find a job in  another field.    --The number of employees working for enterprises of non  public ownership hit the record high. There were about 24.67  million workers with individually run business and 2.318 million  workers with private business by the end of the previous year.  The total number of such employees made up 4.5 percent of the  gross work force across the country. Employment in individual  and private business tend to go upwards this year.    --Competitiveness for employment tends to increase. The  employment rate rose as the result of rapid economic  development. Consciousness of stiff competitiveness for a job is  therefore strong [sentence as received].    --Sideline career becomes popular and such trend grows at a  fast speed. There is nearly half of the work force in some main  cities in southeastern part of China having sideline career.    --The wave of labour work force sees no sign of recession  while the job seeking consciousness stands high in urban area.  Those jobs in which work force is in great demand for their job  nature and for low income offer more chance to labour workers.    -- Unemployment rate is low in southeastern part of China  and  high in northwestern area and such a gap tends to grow bigger.  Nearly half of 500 cities across the country saw an unemployment  rate not more than two percent in 1992 but there were some 50  cities having an unemployment rate of over four percent and  seven others even registering an unemployment rate as high as  over ten percent. High unemployment rate is mainly centred on  northwestern area.    --Re-employment of workers who were made redundancy by  state-owned enterprises has become a serious problem.</p>

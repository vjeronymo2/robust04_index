			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OLD HOTEL TO BEGIN A NEW LIFE  </P> <P> When Los Angeles' "newest downtown hotel" opened in December of 1927, it was  hailed as "another Mayflower landing."  </P> <P> The 12-story, steel-reinforced Class-A Mayflower Hotel was described as  overlooking the "verdantly green Library Park with its new $3-million library  building" at Grand Avenue and 5th Street and as having a choice location across  from the Biltmore Hotel.  </P> <P> Today, the landmark structure at 535 S. Grand Avenue, built by William H.  Anderson and originally operated by Charles De Long on property leased for 99  years, has been extensively renovated and will reopen in mid-March as the new  Checkers Hotel.  </P> <P> Checkers is a joint development of Ayala Hotels Inc., a division of Ayala  International of Hong Kong, headed by William F. Wilkinson, and Treptow  Development Co., a Houston-based diversified real estate firm.  </P> <P> Charles F. Whittlesey, who designed the original building, had a challenge in  terms of light and air courts in working out something worthwhile on a lot that  was only 60 feet wide and 160 feet deep.  </P> <P> On the exterior, the structure retains its "Spanish Moorish design" with  cornices, stylized gargoyles done in sandstone and two carved ships, embedded  on the sides of the main entrance, depicting the Mayflower which brought the  Pilgrims in 1620, and Columbus' Santa Maria.  </P> <P> The structure originally had 348 rooms (now reduced to 190 suites), each with a  private bath; room rates ranged from $2.50 to a whopping $7.50 a night. In the  1950s, it was part of the Hilton hotel chain.  </P> <P> The Mayflower later was owned and operated by William and Monte Mallet until it  closed in 1985. The building was sold and its gradual transformation into the  European-style luxury Checkers Hotel was started.  </P> <P> More than $49 million and four years of work have been spent on the hotel  building. The interior has been completely changed. Two floors were added on  top of the building to house the physical plant, as well as a health spa for  hotel guests, in addition to a Checkers Restaurant and adjacent Checkers Bar  off the main lobby.  </P> <P> The guest rooms have been enlarged and turned into luxury accommodations that  range from one- or two-bedroom suites with marble bathrooms, to two luxury  penthouses, each with fireplace, living room, bedroom and dining area.  </P> <P> A library/lounge and four board rooms on the mezzanine are available for  business meetings or private dining.  </P> <P> The hotel has a concierge as well as 24-hour room, maid and valet service, and  its room rates are $190 for suites to $850 and $975 for the penthouse units.  </P> <P> The new facility will be operated by Ayala Hotels Inc., of which William F.  Wilkinson is president. Ayala also operates Campton Place Hotel off Union  Square in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Charlene Nagel, former general manager of the Santa Barbara Biltmore, was  appointed general manager for the Checkers Hotel, and Patrick C. Willis,  previously with Hyatt Hotels and more recently corporate food and beverage  director for Rosewood Hotels, is the hotel manager.  </P> <P> Holtsmark Architects of San Francisco is the project architect and  Kaplan/McLaughlin/Diaz of Los Angeles is associated architect. The latter has  been involved in the restoration of 13 buildings on the National Register of  Historic Places.  </P> <P> Prime contractor is Nishimatsu Construction and the general contractor is  Linbeck Construction Corp.  </P></p>

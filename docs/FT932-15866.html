			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Sherwood Computer Sherwood Computer yesterday announced pre-tax profits up 23 per cent from Pounds 2.45m to Pounds 3m for 1992. Turnover fell to Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 21.7m) mainly because of the transformation in 1991 of a former subsidiary into a joint venture, Guardian, with ICL. Sherwood gained Pounds 285,000 income from its stake in Guardian. An increased final dividend of 5.25p brings the total for the year to 7p (6p), payable from earnings per share of 34.1p (24.7p). The results were prepared using FRS 3 guidelines. Operating costs fell to Pounds 19.4m (Pounds 20.1m). The company made a Pounds 1.2m charge for the BS5750 quality certificate - mainly comprised of employees' time and external consultants. It also incurred a Pounds 500,000 charge through switching the company pension scheme from a final salary scheme to a group money purchase scheme. Mr Richard Guy, chairman, said the new scheme was more suitable for the young, mobile staff employed by the company.</p>

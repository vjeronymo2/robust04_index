			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Swiss leaders want to delay vote on EEA Swiss political leaders want the referendum on joining the European Economic Area postponed to next spring, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. The poll has been scheduled for December 6. Postponement would mean that the EEA, a free trade treaty between the European Community and the seven members of the European Free Trade Association, could not start at the beginning of next year as planned. Leaders of the four coalition parties want more time to convince Swiss voters of the merits of the EEA. To comply with the treaty, Switzerland has to amend 60 laws in the next few months, many impinging on citizens' rights. But politicians have yet to begin explaining the merits of the EEA. The party leaders will put their views to the cabinet on August 24 at the beginning of a special parliamentary session to deal with EEA-related legislation. Other Efta member countries, especially Sweden, have been pressing Switzerland not to delay ratification.</p>

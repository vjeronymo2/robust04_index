			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RANCHO SANTA FE PAIR ARRESTED, ACCUSED OF MASSIVE BANKRUPTCY FRAUD  </P> <P> A couple who allegedly moved hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of  furniture, wine, furs and other property from their Virginia home to a rented  house in Rancho Santa Fe have been arrested on charges of attempting to defraud  the bankruptcy court in Alexandria, Va.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Thursday that David and Annette DeFusco, who have been living  in the exclusive North County community since they fled Virginia last April,  were being held in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in San Diego pending a  bail hearing today.  </P> <P> They also face mail fraud charges in Texas in connection with their direct-mail  solicitation business, which purportedly made false promises of expensive gifts  such as automobiles and gold bullion to prospective buyers of time-share  resorts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Awakened by FBI  </P> <P> The high-living pair was arrested Wednesday morning by FBI agents, who awakened  them and took them away in handcuffs, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. Cynthia  Bashant. In California, the DeFuscos alternately have been using three last  names, Brown, Hagen and Stone, Bashant said.  </P> <P> Annette DeFusco, 28, wept openly when she was taken into court Wednesday,  Bashant said. U.S. Magistrate Irma Gonzalez ordered her and her 34-year-old  husband held without bond until today's full detention hearing.  </P> <P> The DeFuscos have pleaded not guilty to the Texas charges and were free on  $50,000 bond in that case, but were arrested on new charges filed Monday by  federal prosecutors in Alexandria, who also obtained a search warrant for their  home in Rancho Santa Fe, Bashant confirmed.  </P> <P> The new complaint charges that the DeFuscos illegally concealed expensive  assets from the bankruptcy court in Alexandria and shipped them out of the  state under assumed names.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Charged With Lying  </P> <P> The DeFuscos are also charged with lying to the bankruptcy court, Bashant said.  They allegedly had told the court that they had never before filed for  bankruptcy, when they had done so at least twice under different names and in  different places, she said.  </P> <P> Prosecutors will seek permission from a magistrate in San Diego to remove the  couple to Virginia to face the charges that they violated bankruptcy laws for  personal gain, Bashant said. They also are under investigation for running a  mail-solicitation scheme in the state of Washington, she said.  </P> <P> The couple were paid by companies that ran time-share resorts for each person  who responded to a solicitation. Because the DeFuscos promised potential buyers  expensive gifts, they were able to deliver a high volume of responses,  prosecutors said.  </P> <P> The DeFuscos, who ran their direct-mail business from offices in Manassas Park,  Va., filed for bankruptcy in 1987 and owe creditors $1.3 million, according to  bankruptcy court filings. The Washington Post reported that the DeFuscos are  indebted to almost 100 Washington-area merchants who supplied them with  everything from the stationery they used in their mailings to the $102,000  Rolls-Royce automobile they drove between their Great Falls home and their  Fauquier County farm. The figures are contained in their 13-volume filing in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Alexandria, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cars Valued at $257,000  </P> <P> Their cars alone were valued in 1987 at $257,500, according to bankruptcy  affidavits, including one Mercedes-Benz registered to Annette with the Virginia  license plate "EVIL ONE," the Post said. Despite the bankruptcy filing, they  continued to spend lavishly, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> The newspaper quoted Henry E. Hudson, the U.S. attorney in Alexandria, as  saying the DeFuscos masterminded "one of the most aggravated cases of  bankruptcy fraud that I have ever seen."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, FBI agents seized dozens of expensive items from their house in  Rancho Santa Fe, including a wine collection insured for $50,000, a coin  collection, an Audi automobile, "lots of jewelry," at least 10 furs, leather  furniture and marble bookcases, according to Bashant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> From Virginia  </P> <P> Most or all of the items were believed to be from the DeFuscos' Virginia home,  she added.  </P> <P> Attempts to reach the DeFuscos' San Diego attorney, Michael Littman, were  unsuccessful Thursday.  </P> <P> In the Texas case, which is scheduled for trial next month, more than 2,000  written consumer complaints have been collected by the prosecutor, who alleges  that the DeFuscos' mailings promised recipients gifts such as BMWs and gold  bullion but actually delivered dime-store products such as bathtub bubble  machines.  </P> <P> The assets seized Wednesday could be used to pay off creditors in the  bankruptcy, prosecutors said.  </P></p>

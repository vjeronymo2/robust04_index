			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL SPILL OFF HUNTINGTON BEACH  </P> <P> How ironic the juxtaposition of the news can be. On Feb. 9 the big story,  nearly filling the first section of the paper, is the 394,000 gallons of oil  spilled off the Orange County coast.  </P> <P> A disaster that has all the politicians and conservation groups up in arms  calling for new regulations.  </P> <P> And then on Page 2 of Metro is a short little compilation put together by AQMD  listing the 20 top releasers of hydrocarbons in the Air Quality Management  District. The total annual release from just these few amounts to about 3.3  million gallons or the equivalent of one spill the size of the one off  Huntington Beach every 33 days! And because AQMD estimates that the majority of  hydrocarbon release is from our autos, this is only a fraction of the oil spill  that Southern Californians create everyday.  </P> <P> These smaller, less dramatic spills end up in the same places as the big one,  our air and water, and have greater effects on health and the environment.  Certainly we should work to prevent major releases of hydrocarbons, yet at an  accident rate of once every 20 years, the offshore spill pales in comparison to  our everyday bad habits.  </P> <P> ROBERT P.

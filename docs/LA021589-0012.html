			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-REPORTER MACDOUGALL  </P> <P> David Shaw's story on the former Los Angeles Times and Wall Street Journal  reporter, A. Kent MacDougall, attempted to discredit MacDougall's recently  published boast that he had insinuated material promoting his radical beliefs  into the stories he wrote for those papers ("A 'Closet Socialist' Stirs Furor  Over News Stories," Part I, Jan. 31). Shaw perceived that MacDougall's  confession that he had been a media mole provided strong support to those who  charge that journalists let their views influence what they report and how they  report it. Shaw did his best to prove this wasn't true.  </P> <P> In doing so, Shaw demonstrated the truth of the charge almost as well as  MacDougall had done in his Monthly Review articles. Shaw's story revealed his  liberal bias just as clearly as MacDougall's stories in The Times and the  Journal had revealed his.  </P> <P> Shaw didn't even consider the possibility that MacDougall got away with his  deception at The Times and the Journal because of, not in spite of, the fact  that some of his editors shared his ideological views.  </P> <P> REED IRVINE  </P> <P> Chairman  </P> <P> Accuracy in Media  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

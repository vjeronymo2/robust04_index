			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Observer: Old Lady's last choice Changing a tried and trusted company chairman in advance of a stock market flotation is not always the best way to reassure the punters. So Sir John Cuckney's resignation as chairman of 3i may come as a surprise to the lay public. City onlookers, however, will note that his departure will give the Bank of England a last chance to exercise one of its remaining droits de seigneurie in its relations with British industry. True, 3i has its own board. But in practice the chairman of the company, hugely influential as the venture- capital market leader, has been picked by the Old Lady, a shareholder from the outset. That prerogative will end when the Bank sells its 14.7 per cent stake in 3i in the flotation, scheduled for the autumn. This is therefore its last opportunity to make the choice, which will be done in consultation with Barclays and National Westminster, two of 3i's shareholders planning to retain holdings. Sir David Walker, the former Bank director just resigned as chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, is the obvious frontrunner. Indeed, there is even a school of thought which suggests that the Bank feels it has to find Walker a proper job following his own unexpected departure from the SIB. The snag, according to his friends, is that the soon-to-be vacated chairmanship of Lloyds Bank is more to his liking.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): Hans de Gier to get Asian experience In the past couple of years, Swiss Bank Corporation has become a power in London investment banking and solidified its position in the US with a couple of eye catching acquisitions, writes Ian Rodger. Now Hans de Gier, one of the SBC directors who has been in the thick of these developments, is off to Singapore to assess how the bank can build up its relatively small business in the fast growing Far East. Is he being sidelined in favour of his long-time partner, Marcel Ospel, at the top of SBC's international business? Not at all. Promotion comes with the job - to deputy group chief executive, a uniquely elevated position for a non-Swiss (de Gier is Dutch) in a big Swiss bank. 'We feel Asia is the most exciting part of the world, and we have to build a meaningful presence there, so we need a commitment at senior level,' says de Gier. But it does not sound as if the bank will be making the kinds of brash move there that it has in London and the US. 'I know Asia very superficially. My job will be to listen carefully,' de Gier says. In fact, he has already made waves in the region, poaching most of the equity research staff from WI Carr in Tokyo and Hong Kong in 1986 for SBC. 'We want to strengthen our product base and distribution and build a quality investment bank,' he says. de Gier, 49, who joined SBC in 1980 along with two other Orion Bank colleagues, is less forthcoming about the career implications of the move. 'I am excited about Asia per se. I am not taking it for internal career reasons.' But he makes clear that he does not expect to stay forever in the Far East.</p>

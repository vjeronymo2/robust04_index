			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Mogadishu food aid put off THE UN abandoned plans to distribute food in the backyard of its chief foe in Mogadishu yesterday, when Pakistani troops supposed to guard it said they feared coming under sniper fire, Reuter reports from Mogadishu. This would have been the first hand-out to areas controlled by the warlord General Mohamed Farah Aideed since his militia attacked and killed 24 Pakistanis on June 5, provoking a military showdown with UN troops and an arrest warrant for himself. A UN spokesman said distribution was postponed until today because of 'misunderstandings'. Pakistani troops assembled to guard the food drop said they feared distribution points had not been cleared of snipers. 'I'm responsible for my 20 men,' said Pakistani Captain Zahid Hussain at Mogadishu port, where 170 tonnes of grain had been assembled to give to the needy. 'I have to get them home alive, and there are some feeding sites where adequate security can't be provided because they're surrounded by high ground. I don't want a repeat of the June 5 incident.' Gen Aideed disappeared on Thursday when the UN said it wanted to arrest him, but his gunmen have carried out daily sniping on UN positions. The UN accuses him of masterminding the ambush and violating a series of agreements to place his heavy weapons in areas open to inspection, and to disarm his militia. US officials said they thought his command centre was wrecked in bombings and ground attacks last week but that he might still be dangerous while at large. 'I suspect that he still has the capacity to act. I think it has been reduced, but he still has the capacity to do more damage,' said one US official. Gen Aideed's supporters in southern Mogadishu have tried to whip up feeling against the UN, the US and Pakistan over the deaths of 80 Somalis in street protests. The food hand-out was supposed to refocus the attention of Mogadishu's 1m people on the relief role which brought the UN to Somalia and to douse controversy over the killings of civilians by UN peacekeepers. A small amount of food, guarded by troops from the United Arab Emirates, was distributed yesterday to areas on the green line between the city and Gen Aideed's fiefdom and that controlled by his rival, Ali Mahdi Mohamed. 'It's very important that we deliver food to the south. Many of the displaced haven't received food for 14 days,' said Mr Mark Mullen, field co-ordinator for UN operations in Somalia.</p>

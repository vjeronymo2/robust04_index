			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Tory setback as warning sounded on Scots support THE SCOTTISH Conservative party suffered a new setback last night after a recently resigned official warned that the national party needed a radical change in its attitude to Scotland. Mr Brian Townsend, the former head of information who resigned last week after only seven months in the job, said the Tories' best hope was to capture 30 per cent of the vote by 1996. In a leaked memo to Lord Sanderson of Bowden, the chairman of the Scottish Conservative party, Mr Townsend was reported to have said that only a 'constructive and conciliatory' approach would revive the party's fortunes north of the border. Also last night Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary and MP for Edinburgh Pentlands, condemned Scottish nationalists as 'selfish, misguided and shortsighted'. He said at an Institute of Petroleum dinner in London that Scotland's ties with England were a natural partnership that had brought benefit to Scots for more than 250 years, and warned that North Sea oil would not last for ever. Mr Rifkind, a former Scottish secretary, said nationalists' assumption that North Sea revenues would be there for the asking were 'selfish, misguided and incredibly shortsighted'. His attack came as leading Scottish financial institutions expressed strong misgivings about the possible effects on their business of a devolved Scottish parliament of the kind proposed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. According to a survey published yesterday almost all believe it would be of no benefit to the financial sector, and most think it would be damaging. However, a small minority thought a Scottish parliament would bring benefits if it adopted fiscal and legal policies that helped Scottish business. Their views are expressed anonymously in a survey of leading members of Scottish Financial Enterprise, the trade association to which most members of the Scottish financial community belong. It was carried out by Professor Andrew Bain of Glasgow University, and did not address the possibility of Scotland becoming independent. The Scottish financial sector makes up 15 per cent of Scottish gross domestic product and employs 187,000 people, nine times as many as traditional industry. Prof Bain said the institutions surveyed feared that: They would face higher operating costs because of the taxes a Scottish parliament might levy. There would be resistance to Scottish financial products aroused by resentment about devolution among customers in England. Devolution would be seen as a step towards Scotland becoming independent, which would frighten customers. A Scottish parliament would be more leftwing. Under Labour's proposal a Scottish parliament would be able to vary the rate of income tax levied in Scotland. If this resulted in higher taxes the financial institutions fear staff would ask for higher pay and it would be more difficult to recruit top staff from outside Scotland. The political effects of devolution aroused the most concern. Scottish financial institutions feared that English people would say the Scots were getting a better deal by having their own parliament while still receiving subsidies from London. The worst fear was that devolution would be seen in England as a staging post to independence. This would particularly affect the life-assurance sector, which receives 90 per cent of its new business from south of the border. The arguments reported by Prof Bain were not fully borne out by senior figures in the Scottish financial establishment yesterday. Mr Malcolm Murray, chief executive of Scottish Life and chairman of the Associated Scottish Life Offices, said that the life assurance sector's main fear was independence. 'There are not too many fears on devolution at this stage. If (a Scottish parliament) went too far on taxation, it would be hard to get good staff. But if anyone was pushing for independence it would cause problems.' The Scottish National Party said the survey was ridiculous because it had not asked about full independence and accused it of recyling old 'fears and smears'.</p>

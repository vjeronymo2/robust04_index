			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FATAL O.C. FIRE STARTED BY CHILD WITH A LIGHTER  </P> <P> A child playing with a cigarette lighter ignited the intense blaze that killed  two infants and seriously injured another at a day-care home in Huntington  Beach, fire officials said Friday.  </P> <P> While Pat Orozco was in the bathroom, one of four children in her care began  playing with a disposable lighter in the living room, said Martha Werth, a  public information officer for the Huntington Beach Fire Department. The  lighter ignited an overstuffed chair, and the blaze spread quickly to an  adjacent playroom.  </P> <P> Both Orozco, 49, and Heidi Sartain, 25, a daughter who lives in the home,  smoke.  </P> <P> "I lost my lighter, and I'm a smoker," Sartain said. "It could have been my  lighter, it could have been my mom's lighter, it could have been anybody's."  </P> <P> Investigators speculated that if Orozco had installed smoke detectors in her  home, "none of this would have happened," Werth said. "At worst, they would  have gotten out with a few bumps and bruises."  </P> <P> State fire officials said Friday that the tragedy has prompted them to review  sometimes contradictory fire safety requirements regarding fire extinguishers  and smoke detectors in day-care homes.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach fire officials also released new details of how the blaze  started in the single-story, brown stucco house at 5122 Audrey Drive. Orozco  ran from the bathroom at the front of the house through the kitchen and into  the living room, where she grabbed 3-year-old Devon Strayer by the hand and  lifted 8-month-old Jessica Jordan from a swing, Werth said.  </P> <P> Orozco made her way into the playroom, but dropped Jessica near the doorway  after her arm caught fire, Sartain said. Unable to find the baby in the thick  smoke, Orozco picked up 6-month-old Nick Duncan and fled through a sliding door  into the back yard. Despite rescue efforts by Orozco and several passers-by,  Jessica and 13-month-old John W. Reilly IV died of smoke inhalation, Werth  said.  </P> <P> The Duncan baby remains hospitalized in serious but stable condition for burns  to about 15% of his body.  </P> <P> Because of laws that protect juveniles, Werth declined to identify which child  is believed to have started the fire. However, on Thursday fire officials said  Devon was the only child in the living room, which is where investigators  determined that the blaze began.  </P> <P> Orozco, who is hospitalized in fair condition with second- and third-degree  burns to her upper body, was not available for comment Friday. Sartain said her  mother remains distraught over the deaths.  </P> <P> "Her main concern is that the families (of the victims) find peace," Sartain  said.  </P> <P> Under state health and safety codes that govern licensing of day-care centers,  operators with six or fewer children have the option of equipping their homes  with fire extinguishers or smoke detectors, and an inspection by fire officials  is not required. Orozco, who is licensed, opted for the fire extinguisher,  which investigators think they have recovered in the kitchen.  </P> <P> But state building codes, enforced by the state fire marshal, require that all  day-care operators maintain both fire extinguishers and smoke detectors in  their homes, said Galen Miller, a supervisor of field operations for the state  fire marshal.  </P> <P> Officials conceded that the tragedy might have been avoided had discrepancies  in state licensing guidelines been resolved.  </P> <P> "It's unfortunate these questions are being raised after this tragedy. They  should have been answered before," Miller said. "I'm hoping an answer will come  out of this, and, between the state fire marshal and the department of Social  Services, we can agree on the proper application of regulations for these  facilities."  </P> <P> Frances Young, a supervisor in the Department of Social Service's  community-care licensing division, said her office had been unaware of the  inconsistency in state laws.  </P> <P> "It appears obvious that something was missed, and I am going to instruct our  policy people to take a look at this," she said.  </P> <P> But Young said the less-stringent regulations would continue to be enforced.  </P> <P> "We are not required to inform licensees of other regulations if they are not  incorporated into our standards," she said. "There are all sorts of building  codes and local ordinances; where would we draw the line?"  </P> <P> The official, supervisor Steve Viero, said that because of the Huntington Beach  fire, the state fire marshal's office will review existing fire safety  regulations to determine if they are adequate.  </P> <P> "Anytime we have a scenario of this type, a review is in order," he said.  </P> <P> Authorities said that under existing guidelines Orozco cannot be faulted for  installing only a fire extinguisher.  </P> <P> Dianne Edwards, director of adult and employment services for the Orange County  Social Services Agency, said county officials have no authority to require  regulations other than the less-stringent ones included in state health and  safety codes.  </P> <P> Young said that until regulations are amended, parents must determine for  themselves if they are comfortable leaving their children in a home with no  smoke detector.  </P> <P> "All parents who make use of any family day-care center should ask if there is  a smoke detector present if they feel that is the safest thing for their  child," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DAY-CARE LICENSING  </P> <P> Family day-care licensing agencies provide the following services:  </P> <P> Set standards that family day-care homes must meet.  </P> <P> Process fingerprint checks on all adults in the home for existing criminal  records.  </P> <P> Require tuberculosis tests of care givers.  </P> <P> Investigate complaints.  </P> <P> Visit each home upon receipt of a license application.  </P> <P> Visit 10% of all licensed homes annually.  </P> <P> Visit each home when licenses are renewed.  </P> <P> Deny applications and revoke licenses when necessary.  </P> <P> Source: state Health and Welfare Agency's Department of Social Services,  community care licensing division  </P> <P> </P> <P> DAY-CARE SAFETY CHECKS  </P> <P> Parents seeking a good child-care facility may check with one of the 65  state-funded child-care referral centers in California. To contact the closest  center, call the California Child Care Resource and Referral Network in San  Francisco at (415) 661-1714. Also, parents should visit prospective day-care  homes at various times during the day unannounced.  </P> <P> Some safety checks parents can make themselves when visiting day-care homes:  </P> <P> Pools must be surrounded by a fence at least five feet high with a  self-latching gate.  </P> <P> Homes caring for infants must not have stairways accessible to the children.  </P> <P> Food preparation areas must be clean and the food must be properly stored in  sealed containers or a refrigerator.  </P> <P> Toxic chemicals for cleaning and medicines must be stored in a secured cabinet.  </P> <P> There must be sufficient play areas for the number of children to be cared for  in the facility.  </P> <P> Homes should care for no more than six children unless the provider has an  assistant (infant ratios are stricter).  </P> <P> Homes should maintain a fire extinguisher or smoke alarm.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Bill Billiter contributed to this story.  </P> <P> 'DEVASTATING' -- Child's death strikes young couple hard.

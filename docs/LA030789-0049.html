			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA WINS TITLE IN OVERTIME;  </P> <P> LIONS GET 75-70 VICTORY, AUTOMATIC NCAA BID  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount left its start in San Francisco, but the Lions still won their  second straight West Coast Athletic Conference tournament Monday night, beating  Santa Clara, 75-70, in overtime.  </P> <P> It was the second straight season Loyola has knocked off the Broncos in the  final to earn an automatic berth in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.  tournament.  </P> <P> Loyola, which averages 114 points and has several times scored more than 75  points in a half, won this one the hard way, getting its lowest scoring total  of the season despite the overtime.  </P> <P> Junior guard Jeff Fryer, scoreless in regulation after halftime, scored the  Lions' first eight points in the overtime to lead the way.  </P> <P> Hank Gathers tied the game, 65-65, with 25 seconds left in regulation, and both  teams missed chances to avoid the overtime.  </P> <P> When Fryer and Bo Kimble missed free throws in the final minute of overtime,  Loyola got the rebound each time to protect the lead. Enoch Simmons hit two  free throws with 11 seconds left to clinch it.  </P> <P> After Fryer and Jeffty Connelly traded baskets to open the overtime, Connelly,  who finished with 23 points, made a steal and took off for a breakaway.  Loyola's Per Stumer made a controversial block from behind -- Santa Clara  wanted a goaltending call -- and Fryer made a three-pointer to give the Lions  the lead for good.  </P> <P> The Lions improved to 20-10 despite shooting only 33% in a game played more in  Santa Clara's physical style. The Broncos didn't shoot much better at 43%.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a pretty dance for us, but we can win in that style, we just don't  like to," Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said. "I think you saw the results of  playing three games in three nights. It's very demanding. The guys were at the  point of exhaustion."  </P> <P> Gathers, who had 30 points and 16 rebounds, was named the tournament's most  valuable player. Kimble, who scored 16 points, was also named to the  all-tournament team, along with Santa Clara forward Jens Gordon, who had 18  points and a career-high 17 rebounds, Connelly, and Bronco freshman guard  Melvin Chinn.  </P> <P> Fryer, who finished with 19 points, was conspicuously missing from the postgame  honors. "I'd like to nominate Jeff Fryer for a new category, all-overtime  team," Westhead quipped.  </P> <P> Loyola, which made only 24 of 72 shots and only four three-pointers, resorted  to its scrambling press to get back in the game after surrendering a 12-point  lead and falling behind by as many as six early in the second half.  </P> <P> "Both teams were pretty tired and missed a lot of shots," Santa Clara Coach  Carroll Williams said. "Our kids did a pretty good job of making them play some  defense. It's like going through a mine field, going through that press."  </P> <P> Loyola forced 26 turnovers. Santa Clara (20-10), which has appeared in all  three WCAC tournament finals, hopes to participate in the National Invitation  Tournament for the second straight year.  </P> <P> Loyola trailed, 38-37, at halftime and remained cold early in the second half  when Santa Clara forged a 44-38 lead paced by two drives by Mitch Burley.  </P> <P> Loyola, then made its move, scoring 12 consecutive points for a 50-44 lead. In  the run, Gathers scored eight points and Loyola's press forced two consecutive  turnovers.  </P> <P> Santa Clara tied the score, 63-63, with 2 minutes to play.  </P></p>

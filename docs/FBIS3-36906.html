			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Khots] </F>   [Text] Krasnoyarsk, 10 February -- Immediately after the  end of the "Ostankino" TV company's program, "Utro," Krasnoyarsk  communications workers switched off the transmitters. Neither  are Russian TV programs going out today in the town on the  Yenisey. Only the local independent TV company "Afontovo," with  its own transmitter, continues transmitting to Krasnoyarsk.    "We are not satisfied at the government's decision on a  stage-by-stage repayment of debts," the ITAR-TASS correspondent  was told by Aleksandr Molchanov, the head of Krasnsoyarsk Radio  and TV transmitting station. "We have heard more declaratory  statements not backed up by any specific deadlines. The debts  to our station alone in the last three months amount to 1  billion rubles, and it is not known when this money will arrive."    TV journalists reacted promptly to the communications  workers' threat. Last night they put more than 10 million  rubles in cash into the communications workers' coffers, and  local programs will go on the air this evening.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS instituted the LDP rule in the interim final rule to promote local community ownership of converting institutions, and to reward a group that, collectively, typically has made significant contributions to the financial success of the institution. The LDP rule sought to provide the opportunity for local depositors to participate more fully in the subscription offering without competition from large purchases by out-of-area depositors. The OTS has become aware in recent years of the evolution of a class of depositors, sometimes referred to as ``professional depositors'' or ``flippers,'' who have opened accounts in a large number of mutual associations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These ``professional depositors,'' who often reside outside the local community of the mutual savings association, make deposits in anticipation of the mutual savings association converting to stock form. Often, these depositors subscribe for a significant number of shares in the subscription offering phase with the intent of selling all or a significant number of the shares in a short period of time following the conversion to take advantage of a lucrative after-market. Once a conversion is complete, these depositors often withdraw their deposits and have no further relationship with the converted savings association.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Peter Lynch,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Beating the Street  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> (1993), p. 220.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed below, OTS continues to believe that local depositors should be given preference over out-of-area depositors in purchasing stock of a converting mutual savings association. Upon further consideration of the issues presented in this area and review of the comment letters, however, OTS has determined in the final rule to authorize, but not require, a savings association to give a conversion stock purchase preference to account holders residing in the local community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OTS has taken this position,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> making the LDP provision optional, for a number of reasons. First, the OTS does not oppose the full participation of those other than local depositors in the conversion process. The nationwide interest in thrift stock has enabled many thrifts to recapitalize, thereby preventing thrift failures and a burden on the taxpayers. In addition, the OTS notes that the conversion eligibility record date, the primary determinant for prioritized eligibility to purchase conversion stock, has always been keyed to the length of time a depositor has had an account with a converting institution, not to geographic location. Also, as noted below, many mutual associations have exercised their authority to accept deposit accounts only from persons residing in the association's local community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the foregoing, and in response to the comments noted above, the OTS believes that the LDP provision need not be a requirement of conversion; rather it should be at the option of each converting savings association which will decide whether its particular situation warrants its use. A savings association may conclude that an LDP for stock purchases is important to ensure ownership by local depositors who made significant long-term contributions to the financial success of the institution by virtue of their deposit and borrowing relationships, and who, it expects, will continue to maintain financial relationships with the institution after the conversion. The final rule includes the LDP provision as an optional provision in the subscription phase of the conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Kaufhof Holding plans sponsored ADR scheme KAUFHOF Holding, one of Germany's largest retailing groups, announced yesterday that it plans a sponsored American Depository Receipt programme for its shares in North America. The sponsored ADR programme is the second to be set up by a German industrial company. It falls short of the full listing obtained by Daimler-Benz yesterday, but the timing of the announcement suggests that other leading German companies have recognised the logic behind Daimler's move to the world's largest capital market. Volkswagen, the carmaker, is the only other German non-financial company to have a sponsored ADR programme. Kaufhof said that in setting up the programme it was reacting to US institutional investors' interest in buying US dollar denominated shares in German companies. It said 2 per cent of its share capital was owned by US investors, but it had no plans to raise funds directly in the US equity market. A sponsored ADR programme is one of three ways that shares in non-US companies can be traded in North America. Under such an agreement the company formally appoints a bank as trustee for its shares. These are packaged by the bank into dollar-denominated securities which are then available over-the-counter to US investors. The company undertakes to bear the costs of the programme. Foreign company shares can be traded via unsponsored ADR programmes: this takes place without the co-operation of the company and any trust bank can act as depository institution. A full listing, such as Daimler obtained for its ADR issue, is at the other extreme. Under this, the company has to comply with the strict disclosure requirements of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, the watchdog for the US securities industry. The sponsored ADR programme is a half-way measure: Kaufhof has obtained SEC approval for the move, but as the shares are not to be listed it will not be obliged to restate its accounts according to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as Daimler has done. The requirement to publish figures according to US rules is regarded with circumspection by German companies, many of which are angry at Daimler's unilateral move to the NYSE. Kaufhof said it expected sales this year to rise 8.3 per cent to DM22.2bn (Dollars 13bn).</p>

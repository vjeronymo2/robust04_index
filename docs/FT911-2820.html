			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / My wife, life and France: The difference between the French and the English and their most mysterious ways FOR THE first two or three years we were married, I thought I knew my wife. There is nothing for plumbing the mysteries of the soul like negotiating one's way through married life. Now, a decade later, I realise I may have plumbed the top quarter. Could it be because I am Anglo-Saxon and she is French? At the end of dinner, is dessert followed by cheese or cheese by dessert? When a man is visiting his wife's family at the weekend, does he, by way of greeting his father-in-law, simply say hello, or embrace him and kiss both whiskery cheeks? Just where, if you think you have a temperature, do you place your thermometer? These are some of the thousand daily questions, the lighter commerce of a vie-a-deux, that mark Anglo-French alliances. This is small beer, you say. People who live either side of London's Marylebone Road have different ways of doing things. So they may. But I know an Englishman, married into a clan of perfectly modern and charming Parisians, who swears that English perfidy and the battle of Agincourt are verbally held against him each time he tries to break with accepted family tradition. This is not personal tic, the expression of individual character. Nor is it family, background, money or class. This is history, a thousand years of skirmishing, sometimes bitter, sometimes light-hearted, between Gaul and Anglo. Politics, sex, food, manners, the exchange rate mechanism; no matter how you cut the gateau, these are two groups of people who see the world very differently. Three days after I arrived in France in 1979, for what was supposed to be a short Christmas holiday, the slim French woman I had met on holiday the year before took me to her family's Christmas dinner. Held every year at her uncle's farmhouse in the hills of the Vaucluse in Provence, it is a traditional affair that reunites every blood relative for 100 miles around, from Colette, who dabbles in left-wing politics in Marseille, to Jean-Jacques, who grows tomatoes outside Avignon. It was a splendid gathering, a tribal celebration at which a family of 25 sat down to a long, cloth-covered table and, for four hours, talked and feasted on food the likes of which I had never seen before. There were small, bright red crayfish, salads garnished with truffles sniffed out of the earth by a neighbour's spaniel, wild boar shot in the nearby hills, small thrushes neatly trussed in butcher's string, wines from the vineyard behind the house. Throughout there was talk - village gossip, the price of artichokes, hunting stories, wine lore, advice on goat's cheese, reminiscences of other Christmasses, hard times, the war. And throughout I was speechless, largely because I had a dozen words of French at easy command, but also because I was overcome; here was a whole universe of traditions, rituals, habits and gestures vastly different from my own. Understanding nothing, I was fascinated. More than 10 years later, I am still fascinated. My French is better, and I stayed beyond the Christmas holiday: I am now part of that family. But I am not sure I understand a great deal more. France remains what it was for me that day, a heady mixture of tribal traditions, an exotic affair. Every year, and on both sides of the English channel, there are thick books published about the French, their national identity and what makes them so different from the English. Some are affectionate. Others, behind a catty, chauvinist sort of humour, hide a mistrust of all things French. All, however, agree that there is a great deal more separating the English and the French than the channel. English opinion, both historical and tabloid, has it that the French are full of themselves. It is one thing to drink their wine but can you, as the Americans say, do business with them? They are arrogant, duplicitous and over-conscious of national glory. One moment they are blaming the English for burning Joan of Arc. The next they are trying to make Jacques Delors president of an emasculated Europe. Never, runs this conventional wisdom, turn your back on a Frenchman. There are entire theories, complete pub-lunch arguments elaborated as to why the French should be such a problem bunch. I like the popular one that places the whole long relationship in the Freudian category of problems. It runs something like this: Intellectually, aesthetically or in any question of the heart, the French believe themselves unparalleled. They pride themselves on philosophical thought and fancy themselves as good car designers, too. With women and la Patrie, no emotional depth can be too excessive. In matters of taste, style and panache, they will brook no questions. France may have lost battles and colonies, but honour is intact and the mission civilatrice proceeds apace. Paris, as far as the French are aware, is the centre of the universe. France's perception of itself, the theory runs, is really due to a massive inferiority complex. If the French are continually crowing their superiority, if they seek national greatness and dignity in Napoleons and de Gaulles, it is because they are a people whose roots lie deep in a rural peasant culture. Even the French, in their insecure heart of hearts, know this is true: 'What is France, I ask you? A rooster on a dung heap. Take away the dung and the rooster dies.' If Jean Cocteau could say it, who are the English to argue? There is, of course, an additional, unstated argument implicit in this line of thought: the English have no need for strutting, intellectual posturing, sexual bravado, rude displays of individualism or any other kinds of unbecoming behaviour - they just quietly get on with being what they are, superior. All this, as far as I am can make out, is intellectual flim-flammery. The English who compose these complex theories, write these erudite books, form public opinion, do so from farmhouses in Normandy and flats in Paris, where they have escaped to enjoy life. They enjoy the frog's-legs and baby quails that the offending French peasant culture produced; they enjoy French women, French coffee, French painting, French sophistication, French intellectual curiosity and freedom. Unbound, away from English tradition, they enjoy French life. Moan as they may about the nasty French, the English keep coming back for more. France is indeed a place of different values, manners, and attitudes. And there are things that foreigners in France are quite genuinely upset by or see no need for. Try living with French bureaucracy - post office, electricity board, telephone company, or any other state organ; petty officialdom has never been more obstructive. Have an impatient Citroen XM scream up to your rear bumper at 160 kms-an-hour on the autoroute, flash its lights, then sit on you until you move over; this is not just rude, it is lethal. Write the most ordinary of business letters and you might find that the concluding 'yours sincerely' salutation - 'Veuillez agreer, cher Monsieur, l'assurance de mes sentiments distingues' - is almost as long as the text. French social formalities can make easy chores preposterous. A hundred things like this make Englishmen fume. I have spent entire evenings listening to dinner-time diatribes against the French. The raving goes on, however, as cassolette d'escargots forestiere aux asperges sauvages rapidly disappears down English throats. Sworn blood enmity for life is one thing; dinner on the bay overlooking Villefranche is another. I have given up trying to wholly understand the teller at the Credit Lyonais, the garagiste down the street, or Jacques Delors. These days, when one functionary in the town hall tells me I cannot have my work permit until I have my residence card, and another at the police commisariat tells me I cannot have my residence card before I am granted my work permit, I merely sigh. I give, in fact, a Gallic shrug. I may have to wait until another Christmas dinner passes before the town hall and the commisariat sort out the problem. In the meantime there are a hundred other, more agreeable mysteries that need fathoming. The first is my wife.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Japanese closure in Sri Lanka Noritake, the Japanese ceramics group, has closed its Sri Lanka factory, one of the oldest foreign joint ventures on the island, amid a spate of industrial unrest which is threatening economic problems for the new government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga. The move by Noritake, which makes tableware in Sri Lanka and had been expanding its plant, follows an eight-hour siege by factory workers on Monday, during which three company executives, including one Japanese, were held hostage. They were eventually rescued by police. The company was quoted as saying that the plant would not reopen unless all labour issues were resolved. Korea-Ceylon Footwear, another foreign joint venture, has meanwhile seen its shares slide on the local stock market, after a wildcat strike by workers who demanded a 30 per cent pay rise and a large Christmas bonus. At a graphite mine, workers held a senior executive captive at the bottom of a graphite pit. An attempt last month by a cabinet minister to organise a trade union at Ansell, the Australian rubber products company, was halted by Mrs Kumaratunga after the Australian High Commissioner had intervened. Ansell operates in a free trade zone, where unions are prohibited. According to a leading trade chamber, more than 100 labour disputes are taking place this week. Most are connected with bonus demands, but unions have gained confidence from the inclusion of left-inclined parties in the nine-party People's Alliance coalition formed during the summer.</p>

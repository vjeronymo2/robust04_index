			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The first round of exploratory talks between the  Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] and the Civic Alliance  Party [PAC] concluded a short while ago at Elisabeta Palace.    We agreed that both political parties ought to contribute to  the lessening of tension in Romanian political life, not merely  at the parliamentary but also at the local administration level.  We also agreed to cooperate with respect to draft bill packages  and programs, stated PDSR Deputy Chairman Liviu Maior at a short  news conference that followed the meeting. The next round of  talks is scheduled for 29 March.    PAC Deputy Chairman Nicolae Taran stated that, quote, we  established what we could jointly do and how long it would take  us to achieve those things. The PAC is a member of the  Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] and therefore it cannot  decide in the name of the CDR, but merely pledge things that it  can achieve on its own. However, our position expressed today  actually outlined the position of the CDR, unquote, our  correspondent Florin Brusten reports.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Human Rights Vessel Ran Aground in </F> Beijing"]    [Text] After three days of talks with the PRC leaders in  which he tried unsuccessfully to impose the U.S. version of  human rights, the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  departed Beijing.    He failed to bring Washington's and Beijing's viewpoints on  human rights any closer. Contrary to his expectations, the U.S.  Secretary of State encountered firm and intransigent stances by  the PRC authorities in the course of his 10 hours of intensive  talks with them as they rejected his recommendations outright.    What is certain is that Christopher visited the PRC in order  to deliver a final warning to the PRC leaders and to convince  them to accept Washington's conditions on human rights issues.  He said: The issue of human rights and the Most Favored Nation  [MFN] status were the salient features of the talks between the  two sides. Christopher went to Beijing in order to exert  pressure on the basis of its chronic ploy, the MFN treaty which  the United States uses in its tactics to put pressure on the PRC.    Ever since the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989, the United  States has raised the extension of the MFN trade law and linked  it to progress in the field of human rights. In fact, it is  really seeking a way to extend it. The PRC has realized by now  that the United States stands to gain equally if not more from  the extension of MFN status. According to Li Peng, the PRC  prime minister, if the United States were to revoke this clause,  it would lose as much if not more than the PRC, and U.S.  companies would not be able to enter or remain in the PRC's  extensive and capacious market.    Accordingly, the PRC authorities, in an unprecedented  action,  very clearly and firmly stressed to Christopher that they will  not be pressured by the United States, particularly by  Washington's viewpoint on human rights and the MFN.    It is a fact that the United States is not really concerned  about the human rights situation in the PRC and merely intends  to use this ostensibly humanitarian issue to reap political and  commercial capital from Beijing. The U.S. mass media, which  acts as the right arm of the White House hierarchy in whipping  up a propagandistic atmosphere, had embarked on their campaign a  few days before Christopher commenced his trip and gave  extensive coverage to the talks between Assistant Secretary of  State John Shattuck and some opponents of the PRC regime on the  issue of human rights, including Wei Jingsheng and various  similar interviews. This was aimed at provoking the  sensibilities of the PRC authorities so that they would reveal  an absence of democracy in the PRC.    Following the meetings between the U.S. officials and the  opponents of the PRC government precisely one week before  Christopher's visit, the PRC security officials summoned Wei  Jingsheng and Wang Dan and some other dissidents who had been  released in the past six months; they were released again after  24 hours.    The news coverage by the U.S. satellite networks and the  swift reaction of the White House authorities, including  Clinton, against this move by the PRC Government proved that the  U.S. had acted solely to put the Beijing hierarchy on the  defensive, especially with regard to human rights issues prior  to Christopher's visit.    Simultaneously, the United States tried to motivate the UN  Human Rights Commission [UNHRC] in Geneva to make a fuss over  the human rights situation in the PRC on the eve of  Christopher's visit to Beijing, thus trying to internationalize  the PRC's human rights situation and to put the PRC at a  disadvantage before it came to the negotiating table with the  U.S. Secretary of State. Washington's plan to use the UNHRC to  exert pressure on the PRC also met defeat.    On the other hand, hardline PRC Prime Minister Li Peng's  articulate remarks in parliament only a day before Christopher's  visit with regard to the human rights situation in the PRC and  the meaningful statement by the PRC foreign minister rejoicing  at the West's defeat due to the [UN's] failure to approve the  plan to debate the human rights situation in the PRC portended  the fruitlessness of Christopher's visit beforehand.    However, at his very first round of talks with Christopher,  the PRC foreign minister, disregarding political considerations,  openly expressed his rancor and criticism of the meeting between  the assistant secretary of state for human rights, John  Shattuck, with Chinese dissidents. On the same day, two  American journalists were arrested in Beijing for a few hours on  charges of illegal activity.    The PRC security officials also tightened security around  the  U.S. Embassy and the residence of Warren Christopher before his  arrival and kept the comings and goings at these places under  strict surveillance.    The PRC's actions prior to the visit and during it confused  the U.S., according to a U.S. spokesman. However, it is certain  the Chinese authorities intended by these actions to show the  United States categorically that they would not succumb to any  kind of pressure from it.    Even though Christopher explained that his visit was aimed  at  insuring that the PRC comprehended the importance of human  rights from the U.S. viewpoint and in the context of the MFN,  the Chinese side stated that it had noted the U.S. stance in  this regard. However, it is obvious that U.S.  policies--especially with regard to exerting pressure on the  pretext of human rights in the PRC--ran aground and Warren  Christopher returned to the United States with nothing to  rejoice about.    During the course of his visit, Christopher handed to the  PRC  officials a list of Chinese political prisoners but he did not  receive an positive response in this regard. The PRC officials  stressed that their country has an independent legal system and  it acts according to its own laws.    Of course, it may be mentioned that the PRC does have some  problems related to its adherence to human rights with regard  some cases involving ethnic minorities.    Regardless of the human rights issue, to which the major  part  of Christopher's talks with the PRC officials was devoted, this  visit provided the two countries with an opportunity to discuss  topics of mutual interest such as trade and military cooperation  in arms control, especially of missiles, the DPRK's nuclear  program and other important regional and international issues.    In the course of this visit, the two sides signed a  memorandum of understanding on importing and exporting products  made by prisoners, which ensures the implementation of the  agreements reached in 1992. The PRC and the United States agreed  to resume their military contacts after a hiatus of five years  and agreed that a joint committee on the arms industry and for  transforming military industries into civilian industries will  be set up and its first session will be held in Beijing this  year.    In any case, Christopher's visit to the PRC and the defeat  of  his talks with the Chinese officials, especially with regard to  human rights--the main U.S. lever in pressuring the PRC for the  past few years--proved that even after more than a year since  his entry into the White House, Clinton has not been able to  formulate acceptable diplomacy toward Beijing and that  Washington-Beijing relations will encounter unforeseen highs and  lows in the future.</p>

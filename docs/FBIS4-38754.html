			<p>BFN     [Text] The expedition to the small Kuril island of Yuriy  (the Habomai archipelago, Far East) composed of representatives  of the U.S.-Russian committee for search for servicemen killed  during and after the Second World War, was in vain.    The expedition tried to find tombs of U.S. servicemen  supposedly shot by the Japanese during the war. A total of  three tombs were found. However, it turned out that these were  the tombs of people who had died before the war.    However, the expedition will continue the search. It will  come to Habomai in early summer, the SOVETSKIY SAKHALIN  newspaper announced.</p>

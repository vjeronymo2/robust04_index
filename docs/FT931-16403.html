			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / The Braer Disaster: Critics eye report by watchdog CRITICS of the government's response to the disaster will seize on a report about the Department of Transport's emergency provisions for oil and chemical spills at sea conducted two years ago by the National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog, Ivo Dawnay writes. The report, which may influence the inquiry into the spill, underlined that the department had not carried out a detailed evaluation of the costs and practicability of responding to oil pollution involving more than 10,000 tonnes. The report said the Transport Department had raised its stockpiles of aerial dispersant. But it added: 'They (the department) did not carry out a detailed evaluation of the costs and benefits of different levels of airborne response capacity. Nor was consideration given to the clean-up costs and environmental impact of larger spills.' The Department of Transport said last night that it was unable to give a detailed response but stressed that the NAO had no quarrels with its capability for spraying.</p>

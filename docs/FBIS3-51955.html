			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Managua, 27 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- The Nicaraguan  Government today deemed it has concluded all negotiations with  transportation organizations on the topic of fuel prices -- the  main reason behind a strike that has halted nearly all passenger  and freight service.    Meanwhile, five of these organizations issued an ultimatum  that negotiations should resume today by 1800 local (1200 GMT)  [times as received] after the dialogue reached an impasse on  Wednesday night.    In a communique, the organizations called on their "allied  forces" in seaports and at the international airport in this  capital to join the strike to support the protest staged by  members of the transportation sector over the past four days.    The Federation of Nicaraguan Passenger Carriers  (Fetracolnic), the Federation of Nicaraguan Cargo Carriers  (Fetracanic), the Nicaraguan Transportation Council, the  National Transportation Commission (CNT), and the National  Transportation Association (Anatra) signed the communique. The  communique, which was read by a transportation sector leader  over a local radio station, warned the transportation unions  would paralyze all traffic nationwide, as well as international  freight transportation, if a satisfactory agreement is not  reached tonight.    Meanwhile, Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo reiterated the  government's decision to continue talking with all groups on  strike. The official ruled out a bilateral meeting with the CNT,  the organization that promoted the strike which began at 0000  local on 24 January.    "We will meet with everyone, not just with one group,"  Lacayo  said in a meeting with journalists in front of the National  Assembly building.    The members of the transportation sector called on the  Catholic Church to ask the Nicaraguan Government to lay aside  its "hard-line" position on fuel prices in an effort to resolve  the costly crisis.    Construction and Transportation Minister Pablo Vigil, in  statements to LA PRENSA newspaper, ruled out the possibility of  negotiating fuel prices after the government released a  communique on Tuesday night, in which it announced the freezing  of gasoline prices, a slight decrease in diesel prices, and a  subsidy for the freight and passenger transportation sector.  Nevertheless, this moved failed to meet the strikers' demands.    In related news, the National Police have released 61 of 277  people who were arrested on Wednesday and Thursday during  operations conducted along the Northern Highway and in Ciudad  Sandino in Managua, according to CNT sources.</p>

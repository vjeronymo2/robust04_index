The situation in the northern central town crammed with  around 40,000 inhabitants and refugees was getting desperate,  Janowski said, adding that no convoys had reached the town since  October 25. Four U.S. planes dropped supplies over the town  overnight Wednesday, UNPROFOR said.    The UNHCR convoy, which is carrying flour, sugar and  medicine, is blocked at Novi Seher, around 10 kilometres (six  miles) southwest of Maglaj, Janowski said. The town is  surrounded on three sides by Bosnian Serb forces and on the  fourth by HVO troops.    UNHCR official Larry Hollingworth was trying Thursday  morning  to negotiate a passage for the convoy with local HVO commanders.  Bosnian Serb authorities had allowed the convoy to pass without  hindrance, Janowski added.    The spokesman added that the hold-up had persuaded the UNHCR  to delay the departure of another convoy destined for the Croat  enclave of Zepce around 15 kilometres (nine miles) south of  Maglaj.</p>

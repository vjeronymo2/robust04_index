			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): US worries drive Nikkei down Mounting concern over US share prices prompted arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking, and the Nikkei 225 average lost 1.4 per cent in spite of active buying by public funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. After ranging between 18,877.08 and 18,688.74, the index ended 261.75 off at 18,701.24, its lowest since a 18,648.36 close on January 25. Overseas investors took profits, while individuals who had bought shares on margin were forced to liquidate stock. A fall in futures prices prompted arbitrage-linked selling. The decline slowed in the afternoon, when share prices managed to recoup some of their loss thanks to buying by corporations and financial institutions, including public funds. However, selling continued throughout the day, and the Nikkei finally closed lower. More than 200 stocks hit new lows for the year, and some traders expect the next tech-nical support line to be around 17,600. The Topix index of all first section stocks retreated 18.76 or 1.3 per cent to 1,484.16, the lowest since January 7. The index fell through the 1,500 level for the first time since January 24. The Nikkei 300 dipped 3.15 to 272.67. Declines overwhelmed rises by 982 to 93, with 103 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 5.32 to 1,220.79. All sectors declined, with the retail group hit the most with a drop of 1.98 per cent, and warehousing falling 1.84 per cent. Steels were traded actively. Nippon Steel, the most active stock of the day, slipped Y2 to Y375, while Kawasaki Steel softened Y2 to Y410. Shipbuilders were also weak, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries down Y12 to Y727. Sony receded Y80 to a new low for the year of Y5,030, posting its fourth consecutive retreat. Other high-technology stocks were also weak, with Matsushita Electric Industrial down Y30 to Y1,490 and Hitachi off Y18 at Y940. Privatised companies were down sharply. Japan Tobacco relinquished Y18,000 at Y965,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y14,000 to Y829,000. Financials were down. Banks, which reported poor interim earnings yesterday, declined. Fuji Bank fell Y40 to Y1,900 and Sumitomo Bank lost Y50 at Y1,670. Brokers were also lower, on fears of poor earnings due to the weak stock market. Nomura Securities fell Y20 to Y1,890 and Nikko Securities dipped Y20 to Y1,000. In Osaka, the OSE average shed 313.97 to 20,789.81 in volume of 31.7m shares. Roundup The region's markets recovered from Wednesday's losses, although sentiment remained nervous. HONG KONG made a concerted early attempt to move higher, after the sharp losses of the previous two sessions, but gains were subsequently reduced by profit-taking and futures-related selling. The Hang Seng index, which rallied 2 per cent to a peak of 8,747.86, finished 71.83 ahead on the day at 8,647.86. Turnover came to a provisional HKDollars 4.38bn, compared with a revised HKDollars 6.08bn on Wednesday. Analysts noted that index futures remained at a discount to the cash market throughout the day, helping to drag it down during the afternoon. Shui Hing topped the net gainers, rising 30 per cent to HKDollars 13.05 in response to higher profits. Television Broadcasts added HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 31, while Swire Pacific 'A' rose HKDollars 2.95 to HKDollars 51.75. SINGAPORE was helped ahead by bargain hunting in blue chips, although dealers noted that a bearish mood still prevailed. European and Hong Kong funds were said to be buyers, with US funds still net sellers. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 18.59 stronger at 2,236.40, but was off a high of 2,244.64. KUALA LUMPUR also saw late buying of index stocks, taking the composite index 5.74 higher to 1,007.54. Several foreign funds were said to be switching out of equities and into the money market, however, and the rebalancing of funds' portfolios would continue to dampen the index in the days ahead. SYDNEY closed higher on bargain hunting, with the All Ordinaries index moving forward 28.6 to 1,885.7 to finish just off its high for the day of 1,886.6. Turnover amounted to ADollars 502m. Brokers said the cash market was led forward by strength in futures: the December futures contract advanced 35 to 1,870. The banks sector firmed following higher than expected profits from ANZ earlier in the week. ANZ shares climbed 18 cents yesterday to ADollars 3.93. NAB put on 18 cents at ADollars 10.72 and Westpac strengthened 16 cents to ADollars 4.28. TAIPEI was unable to maintain its advance as profit-taking in textiles and papers pushed the market lower. The weighted index dipped 31.46 or 0.5 per cent to 6,340.02. Turnover expanded to TDollars 47bn from TDollars 39.4bn. Among textiles, Shinkong retreated 40 cents to TDollars 31.80, but Hualon outperformed the market with a rise of 60 cents to TDollars 23.30. In spite of speculation that the government might support the stock market before the December 3 elections, brokers believed that equities would consolidate around the 6,400 level. MANILA was slightly stronger on local buying, the composite index firming 4.18 to 2,730.47. Turnover improved to 2.17bn pesos from 1.93bn pesos. The property sector led the advance, the sub-index adding 1.44 at 104.92, while the commercial and industrial group receded 4.06 to 4,046.30. BANGKOK settled at the session's high after bargain hunting accelerated in the afternoon. The SET index put on 24.44 or 1.83 per cent at 1,357.29 in turnover of Bt6.53bn. Local investors were seen buying banking, property and communication stocks, especially in the afternoon period, while foreign managers concentrated on blue chips. TelecomAsia appreciated Bt5 to Bt80.50, while Bangkok Bank moved up Bt3 to Bt192 and Bangkok Land added Bt4.50 at Bt57.50. SEOUL continued to fall for a sixth consecutive day, in spite of some late institutional buying of primary blue chips. The composite index declined 10.81 to 1,085.16. Brokers commented that the continued consolidation of blue chips and concern about a liquidity squeeze had taken their toll on the market. The central bank soaked up Won3,500bn on Wednesday by issuing repos. Profit-taking by foreign investors ahead of the lifting of the foreign stock ownership ceiling next month also put pressure on the market. In spite of the broadly based falls, some shares with good corporate earnings prospects continued to attract investors. Sanung Up Securities went limit up, advancing Won1,000 to Won26,800. BOMBAY rose towards the close on heavy buying by local mutual funds and on short-covering by investors on the last day of the account. The BSE-30 index closed 52.72 higher at 4,075.39 after funds and financial institutions picked up issues in the specified shares group. Foreign funds, which were net sellers on Wednesday, were inactive.</p>

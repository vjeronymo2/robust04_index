			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Letter: Power levy a political 'quick fix' that would endanger industry Sir, I was deeply concerned to read of proposals, reportedly gaining ministerial favour, to add a special levy to consumers electricity bills to solve the pit closure problem ('Pits rescue may need power levy', January 11). One can understand well the problem that miners and British Coal face, but to suggest that it can 'solved' by passing it on to others is almost beyond belief. It is no solution since: It will prop up the electricity supply industry which is already delivering the most expensive electricity in the European Community after Germany and Italy; It will give further credence to the fossil fuel levy - a charge which we have repeatedly urged should be transferred to the wider burden of taxation rather than to penalise a particular section of the community; It will impose significant extra charges on the paper and board industry as a big purchaser of electricity and coal; As proposed, it would appear an addition to the existing EC proposals to levy carbon based fuels (CO/energy tax); proposals which were originally believed to be part of the strategy to control climate change but are now unashamedly emerging as pure taxation and nothing else. It seems that the administration is prepared to prejudice other mainstream UK industry for the sake of the political 'quick fix' without the need for recognition or understanding of the long-term ramifications. Surely the factor is relative cost - industry and particularly large intensive users in competition with those abroad must have internationally competitive costs? Failure to grasp or act upon this simple imperative only encourages the demise of manufacturing industry in the UK.

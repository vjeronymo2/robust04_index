			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry today issued a  statement on the persisting tensions in the occupied territories  of Palestine. This alarming situation calls for active steps on  the part of Russia. The statement says Russia believes it  necessary for the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution with  a view to ensure security in that region of the world. The idea  of international protection for civilians merits the most  serious consideration; this protection could be carried out by  independent observers on the West bank of the river Jordan and  in the Gaza strip.    A new international impetus is needed for the cause of  reconciliation between the Arabs and the Israelis to proceed  further. Russia proposes that a second plenary meeting of the  Madrid conference on the Middle East at the foreign minister  level should be arranged. Moscow also favors the continuation  of bilateral talks at any venue convenient for those taking part.    This was a statement from the foreign ministry of the  Russian  Federation.</p>

Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua told the final day of the national  civil aviation conference in Beijing that the sector's leading  officials must be strict with themselves and their sub-ordinates.    He referred particularly to the air safety responsibility  contract signed between directors of the Civil Aviation  Administration of China [CAAC] and the CAAC's regional bureaus,  carriers, airports and pilot-training schools.    The contract is designed to stop accidents and it has set  safety targets for each unit, defining the penalties and rewards  their leaders face depending on their performance.    Zou said civil aviation made progress last year, but he also  criticized it for problems such as slack management, the risk of  frequent accidents and poor service.    And he called on delegates to find new ways to ensure safety  in a changing industry.    CAAC deputy head Bao Peide said the industry will spare no  effort to resolve four major problems--the lack of flight  facilities, the lack of ground facilities, the poor quality of  some workers, the quality gap between new jet airliners and the  country's sometimes obsolete airports.</p>

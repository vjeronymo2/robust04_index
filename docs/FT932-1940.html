			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / France's job creation programme is presented to parliament THE French government yesterday presented proposals to parliament for emergency measures to reduce unemployment, including a five-year plan to encourage job-sharing and part-time working which will be launched in September. Mr Michel Giraud, employment minister, told parliament that 'urgent action' was needed to 'put the brakes on the damaging increase in joblessness'. French unemployment now stands at a post-war record of 10.9 per cent. The first round of job creation measures includes reducing the social charges paid by employers for low-wage workers. Tax incentives will also be offered to companies taking on young trainees. Mr Giraud said the September legislation would involve making working hours more flexible by enabling employers to negotiate shorter working weeks. Unemployment is one of the most controversial political issues in France. It was one of the chief reasons for the defeat of the old Socialist government in the March elections and has already caused ructions within the new centre-right administration. However, the government's efforts to stem the rise in joblessness have been hampered by the fragile state of the French economy. The level of industrial output fell by 0.6 per cent in April, according to official figures published yesterday. This means that output declined by 5.2 per cent in the year to the end of April. Meanwhile, the latest Bank of France business survey suggests that output stabilised in May, although demand declined, particularly in export markets.</p>

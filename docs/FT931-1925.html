			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Observer: Russian roulette With little more than a month to go before Jacques Attali hosts the 1993 annual meeting of his European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London, Observer hears that the directors are already battling over where to hold their 1994 bash. Normally these sorts of event would have been sorted out some time ago, but the choice of next year's site has been delayed by behind-the-scenes bickering. Bulgaria thinks it should play host since it invited the bank to Sofia, its capital, as long ago as last April. However, Russia's St Petersburg has also thrown its name into the pot. Attali, who is spending an inordinate amount of time worrying about Russia these days, is reported to be keen on St Petersburg, whereas some of his fellow directors feel that since Sofia asked first, it should get the meeting. However, the dispute is not just about directors' egos. Sofia may have a wonderful conference hall, but the lights frequently go out. By the same token, St Petersburg's infrastructure is not on a par with that of Budapest which hosted the first meeting. If St Petersburg gets the go-ahead, then it will be a sure sign that Attali's personal power remains undimmed.</p>

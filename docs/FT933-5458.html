			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Greenpeace takes on the Goliaths THIS MORNING Greenpeace, the pressure group, will ask the Court of Appeal to halt radioactive tests at the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria until September 14, when the High Court will judge whether the tests are legal. In a separate action, Greenpeace has taken ICI, the chemicals group, to court for water pollution. Yesterday that case was adjourned until later in the month for Greenpeace to assemble more laboratory evidence. The group regards the ICI action as a test case on water regulation and says that if it is successful more prosecutions of chemical companies may follow. The two highly-publicised cases mark a new policy by one of Britain's largest environmental pressure groups to bring legal actions itself, rather than wait for government regulatory authorities to do so. Those watching this drama of David and Goliath may wonder, however, how Greenpeace is financing the its campaigning strategy. Its financial muscle has startled some court observers. On Wednesday it told the court that it would compensate British Nuclear Fuels - possibly several hundred thousand pounds, on BNF's estimates - if the tests were delayed until today. The offer was turned down, but it raised questions about the group's finances. The answer, according to Lord Peter Melchett, executive director of Greenpeace UK, is that annual revenue from subscriptions, contributions and merchandise accommodates the cost of lawyers and research. Although revenue has suffered from the recession, Greenpeace UK's income in 1992 was Pounds 4.1m net of fund-raising expenses, compared with Pounds 3.8m in 1991. Greenpeace says that legal costs have been small so far , partly because it uses an in-house lawyer. Lord Melchett acknowledges however, that 'it's expensive if you lose'. So far Greenpeace has not lost big cases. But it is defending a libel action by Rechem, the waste treatment company. The companies on its target list must wonder whether a court setback could hamper its ability to bring more prosecutions.</p>

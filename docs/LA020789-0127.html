			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANNEMEYER SHARPLY REBUKED BY COLLEAGUE FOR POSITION ON AIDS  </P> <P> In a highly unusual action, Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) has used the vehicle of  a "dear colleague" letter -- which goes to every member of the House -- to  launch a personal attack on California Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton)  over his position on AIDS policy.  </P> <P> The letter criticized Dannemeyer for consistently fighting AIDS proposals  advocated by public health experts and for defending his opposition by arguing  that health officials and House members are "out of touch" with the thinking of  the American people on AIDS.  </P> <P> "Dear colleague" letters traditionally are sent by lawmakers to the rest of the  House membership to drum up support for or opposition to legislation, or to  propose other initiatives.  </P> <P> Frank, who is an acknowledged homosexual, insisted in an interview Monday that  "I would not have used the 'dear colleague' system of the House purely for  polemics. I believe there is an important public policy point to be made here."  </P> <P> But he added: "There are rules of excessive civility around here to which I  generally subscribe. You do need a certain amount of courtliness in the system.  But that, in itself, can become a form of abuse. There are limits to when you  restrain yourself from calling a fool a fool."  </P> <P> Dannemeyer refused to comment on the letter, but an aide said that he had  drafted a private response to Frank. "We're not going to make it a 'dear  colleague' letter," a spokesman for Dannemeyer said. "Barney Frank is just  trying to goad us for personal reasons and we've advised him (Dannemeyer) not  to make a big deal of it. We've advised him to take the higher road."  </P> <P> In the letter, Frank pointed out that the recent AIDS initiative in California,  Proposition 102, which Dannemeyer sponsored, was a "test . . . of public  opinion" and was "very soundly defeated."  </P> <P> Frank wrote: "I eagerly await this year's debate on AIDS issues in which we may  well be told that the trouble with this country is that the people are out of  touch with themselves."  </P> <P> Proposition 102, similar to an AIDS initiative sponsored earlier by political  extremist Lyndon LaRouche, which was also defeated, would have required  physicians to disclose the names of people known to be or suspected of being  infected with the AIDS virus. Further, it would have required that those who  have had sexual contacts with AIDS carriers be traced and notified, and would  have repealed laws barring insurance companies and employers from using AIDS  test results.  </P> <P> In a similar measure defeated by the House last year, Dannemeyer proposed  mandatory reporting of all infected individuals. Further, he proposed  legislation, also defeated, that would have required AIDS tests for prisoners,  couples applying for marriage licenses and all hospital patients.  </P> <P> Dannemeyer also has opposed legislation that would protect AIDS patients and  those infected with the virus from discrimination and from violations of  confidentiality regarding their test results.  </P> <P> Federal health officials and other members of the public health community have  been united in supporting the enactment of confidentiality and  anti-discrimination legislation and in opposing such measures as Proposition  102 and those sponsored in the House by Dannemeyer.  </P> <P> Frank said he hopes the information about the California vote will prove useful  when Congress considers AIDS legislation during this session.  </P> <P> "Members want to do the right thing," he said. "It's very important for them to  know that Californians voted nearly 2 to 1 against this stuff. It says, look,  the demagogues can't fool the voters all the time, even though they wish they  could."  </P> <P> Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House energy and commerce  subcommittee on health, who has locked horns numerous times with Dannemeyer  over AIDS legislation, praised the Frank letter and said that it is important  that House members know "how thoroughly the views of Bill Dannemeyer were  repudiated by the voters of California."  </P> <P> Dannemeyer frequently has denounced homosexuality, saying: "I will not  apologize for embracing the heterosexual ethic."  </P> <P> Robert Bray, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign Fund, a gay political  action committee, said that Frank's letter represents a welcomed departure from  the typical congressional protocol. "The white gloves have been removed," Bray  said. "The slap has been made."  </P></p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / The solution is value added tax It will be fascinating to see how Mr Bill Clinton copes with America's fiscal mess. President George Bush's final budget projects deficits of Dollars 300bn or more for as far as the eye can see. And these figures assume a freeze on discretionary spending in cash terms from 1995 onwards. On more credible assumptions, the deficit could soar to more than Dollars 400bn towards the end of the decade. The US thus faces a gaping - and seemingly permanent - hole in the budget, equivalent to perhaps 4-5 per cent of national income. A gap of this size means that Mr Clinton cannot possibly honour all of his campaign pledges. He cannot apply a short-term economic stimulus, halve the budget deficit over four years, sharply increase federal investment spending, and reduce the tax burden on middle-income families. With economic recovery apparently more firmly established and retailers basking after a bumper Christmas, you might think the short-term stimulus would be dropped without hesitation. But Mr Clinton's advisers are aware that consumption cannot run ahead of incomes indefinitely. They were doubtless disconcerted by Friday's employment figures, which confirmed how pitifully few jobs are being created. Employment is such a delicate issue that Mr Clinton may feel he has to cover himself with a modest stimulus package - including an investment tax credit and accelerated infrastructure projects - even if the annual cost is restricted to only about Dollars 20bn. The longer-term imbalances are far trickier to handle, in part because Mr Bush indulged in his own, unsung brand of Clintonomics. In the past four fiscal years, federal spending has risen nearly 30 per cent, about twice as fast as revenues. This surge is not fully explained by growth of 'entitlements' such as federal healthcare (up 63 per cent). Mr Bush also spent generously on programmes dear to Mr Clinton's heart. Spending on education and infrastructure, for example, have gone up by 38 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively. This is far ahead of broad price indices which have risen by about 15 per cent over the four years. Mr Clinton will thus be forced to scale back plans for additional spending. This will be no bad thing. Infrastructure experts are already telling him that, with Mr Bush's transport projects coming on stream, it will be difficult to spend the extra Dollars 20bn a year promised during the campaign. But even if Mr Clinton scales back his spending plans, the fiscal dilemma remains. Given the range of social problems he hopes to tackle, he seems certain to spend more than allowed for in the final Bush budget. And he will not cover the excess by taxing the top 2 per cent more heavily. Moreover, Mr Clinton will not quickly be able to announce a scheme for capping the fastest growing portion of the budget - entitlements such as federal health spending. This will be feasible only after lengthy negotiations on national healthcare reform are completed, which may take a year or more. And the fact that Mr Clinton wants greatly to expand healthcare coverage means that the savings from new spending controls may prove disappointing. He thus seems to be left with only two courses of action. The soft option is to argue that Mr Bush left the shop in such disorder that a big reduction in the deficit over four years is, regrettably, impossible. A populist Mr Clinton would promise to hold the deficit at about the current level and explain that it would still fall steadily relative to national income. If the cyclical recovery takes hold, the economy may well grow at an annual rate of near 3 per cent over the next four years, which would bring down the jobless rate, considerably brightening the public mood. With prosperity seemingly restored, voters would probably forgive Mr Clinton for failing to reduce the deficit. But such a populist manoeuvre would ignore the crying need to raise the US national savings rate and be a cruel deception in the longer term. If Mr Clinton puts the nation's economic health first, he will not delay budgetary action yet again. Pushing ahead with the tough reforms needed to reduce the growth of entitlement spending is essential. But Mr Clinton also needs to build public support for new sources of federal revenue. There is obviously a strong case for a higher tax on gasoline but the political opposition to a sizeable increase would be intense. It would be easier to raise taxes a little on a wide range of commodities. The bold course would be to establish a bipartisan commission to assess the case for a national value added tax. A broad VAT levied at about 7 per cent would raise more than Dollars 150bn, enough to make a real dent in the deficit. Enactment of a VAT would reverse a decades-long slide in the relative share of consumption taxes, and belatedly move the US into line with other industrial countries, none of which could finance social programmes without the tax. It would be a levy on spending rather than income and thus minimise the disincentive effects on capital formation and growth. Deficit hawks on Wall Street would be delighted: the mere announcement of a VAT commission might slice half a point off long bond yields. And come 1996, Mr Clinton could claim to have dealt in statesmanlike fashion with the most pressing economic problem of his time.</p>

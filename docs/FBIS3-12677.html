The statement, which was issued by the parties today during  a  news conference held at the headquarters of the Liberal Party,  asked that the world conscience be addressed by sending cables  of protest to the member countries of the Security Council to  impose economic sanctions on Israel and force it to respect the  Palestinians.    The statement asked the Islamic Conference Organization to  convene an urgent conference in holy Mecca to discuss what the  Muslims are being subjected to in Palestine and all other  places, especially Bosnia-Herzegovina, and make practical  decisions to protect the holy Muslim shrines, especially inside  the al-Aqsa Mosque.</p>

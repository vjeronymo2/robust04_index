The French energy corporation Elf Aquitaine and the  Trust Agency agreed on a compromise on Friday [25 March]. Buna  GmbH, which is owned by the Trust Agency, is to take over the  shares held by Thyssen Tradition Union in 1997 and, in return,  will receive up to 33 percent of the Minol shares from Elf.    Elf Aquitaine has achieved its goal: The current majority  shareholder in the 4-billion-mark [DM] project in Leuna has been  able to reduce its shares from 67 to 43 percent. The Russian  company Rosneft will take over the relevant 24 percent in the  planned construction of a large refinery in Leuna.  <H5>  Minol Shares Thrown In </H5>   If Thyssen Trading Union -- which holds 33.3 percent in the  consortium -- leaves the project after the completion of the  refinery, Buna GmbH will take over its shares. In return, Buna  is to "get up to 33 percent of the Minol gasoline station  network from Elf," Trust Agency Wolf Schoede announced on Friday.  <H5>  Prospects for Buna </H5>   Thus, the path has been paved for the construction of the  large refinery. However, according to Schoede, the board of  governors of Elf Aquitaine still has to take a vote on the  result in Paris on Monday [28 March]. If the body were to  oppose the compromise, against all expectations, the Trust  Agency will demand -- as has been agreed by contract -- the  return of the Minol gasoline station network and, at the same  time, call for a contractual penalty of DM1.5 billion.    The new refinery, with an annual capacity of about 8 million  tonnes, is a decisive pillar for the preservation of large  chemical industries in the central German triangle. Above all,  for Buna GmbH "the privatization prospects have improved  further, since Buna will get an attractive share in Minol," as  Schoede said. In addition, Buna, which is the largest buyer of  refinery products in the region, can build raw material  deliveries on a secure basis.    On Wednesday [23 March] Trust Agency President Birgit Breuel  signed a declaration of intent with representatives of Thyssen  and the Russian Gazprom AG, according to which the two take over  the management of the polyolefine chemical industry in Buna and  Boehlen for five to seven years. According to the Trust Agency  concept, in the future Buna is to be supplied directly with  natural gas from the Siberian field of Yamal. The natural gas  is to be transported with tanker ships from Arkhangelsk to  Rostock and then be provided to Buna through a pipeline from the  Baltic Sea coast, which is still to be built.  <H5>  Land Provides Financial Aid </H5>   The Thyssen Tradition Union welcomes the compromise. A  Thyssen spokesman said that if construction begins after Easter,  the refinery will be completed on time at the end of 1996 or the  beginning of 1997.    FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said that Elf  Aquitaine is "now all the more obligated to act." Saxony-Anhalt  Economics Minister Rainer Lukowitz announced that the project  will be supported with approximately DM1 billion from the land  and the Federal Government.</p>

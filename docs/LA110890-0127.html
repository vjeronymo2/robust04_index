			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READING FOOD;  </P> <P> COOKBOOK FAVORITES -- THE VOLUMES THAT CHANGED OUR LIVES  </P> <P> I was at a loss to come up with a favorite cookbook until a co-worker posed the  following question: "If you were moving to some obscure place and could take  only one cookbook, what would it be?" It took me only minutes to decide on  "Cooking A to Z" (Ortho Books, 1988: $32.95).  </P> <P> This volume -- edited by Jane Horn, with recipes created in consultation with  the chefs of the California Culinary Academy -- is an encyclopedia of terms,  techniques, ingredients, equipment and more than 600 recipes. It's one of the  books I use extensively in researching my weekly Back to Basics and You Asked  About . . . columns.  </P> <P> The book is anything but trendy. But by using its solid base of information, my  past experience in recipe development and testing, and observations of current  trends, even if I lived in a remote area, I'd still have an edge on keeping up  with the culinary scene.  </P> <P> Take the pate maison recipe, for example. It uses classic techniques:  </P> <P>  -- Lining the pan with pork fat  </P> <P>  -- Mixing the forcemeats with herbs and spices  </P> <P>  -- Layering the ingredients  </P> <P>  -- Baking the mixture in a bain marie  </P> <P>  -- Weighting the cooked pate  </P> <P>  -- Storing the finished recipe a day or more before serving.  </P> <P> By applying these guidelines but substituting ingredients currently in vogue,  you can create variations that might show up on some of the hottest menus in  town.  </P> <P> PATE MAISON  </P> <P> 1/2 medium onion, minced  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons butter  </P> <P> 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons Cognac or Armagnac  </P> <P> 1 pound ground pork  </P> <P> 1 pound ground veal  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> 2 eggs, slightly beaten  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon dried thyme  </P> <P> 1 chicken breast, boned and skinned  </P> <P> 1 pound pork fat, cut into 1/8-inch slices  </P> <P> 2 ounces pistachio nuts, shelled  </P> <P> Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small skillet saute onion in butter over  medium-high heat until translucent. Pour in 1/2 cup Cognac. Cook until Cognac  is absorbed into onion (mixture will measure about 1/3 cup). Remove from heat  and place in a large mixing bowl.  </P> <P> Add pork, veal, garlic, eggs, salt, pepper and thyme. Mix with hands until  thoroughly blended, or blend in food processor until light in texture and well  blended.  </P> <P> Cut chicken breast into 1/2x3-inch slices. Put slices in a small bowl and add  the remaining 2 tablespoons Cognac.  </P> <P> Line a 2-quart terrine or (12x4 1/2-inch) loaf pan with slices of pork fat.  Press one half of ground meat mixture into pan. Cover with Cognac-soaked  chicken, then pistachios. Press remaining ground meat mixture on top. Cover  with another layer pork fat.  </P> <P> Cover terrine with aluminum foil. Set in a pan of boiling water. Place on rack  in center of oven. Bake until juices run clear yellow and pate has shrunk from  sides of pan (about two hours).  </P> <P> When pate is done, remove terrine and set on cooling rack. Place another loaf  pan on top of pate; fill with 3 to 4 pounds of weight (canned good or bricks  work well). Let pate cool at room temperature several hours, then pour off  liquid, recover and weight. Refrigerate 2 to 3 days before slicing. To serve,  unmold and slice. Serves 10 as a first course.  </P> <P> Note: Sliced bacon may be substituted if pork fat is unavailable.  </P></p>

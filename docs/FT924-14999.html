			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: Bush fuels support by backing ethanol Faced with threatened loss of support from farmers in key Midwest states, a hard-pressed President Bush last week announced a plan to allow ethanol (grain alcohol) to be used in reformulated gasoline sold in the nine smoggiest American cities starting in 1995. With the president still trailing in the polls behind governor Bill Clinton, it was a victory for the forces of maize over the combined lobbying efforts of environmentalists, the oil and natural gas industries. Farm groups were overjoyed. Ethanol has long been seen as potentially their most lucrative remaining market, a solution for burdensome global maize surpluses and a means to reduce US dependence on foreign oil supplies. It had been a severe setback when the US Environmental Protection Agency discovered that the ethanol-blended gasoline increases smog, unlike its closest competitor - methanol. Unless there was some way around it, the EPA would have favoured methanol for use in the reformulated gasoline programme which the Clean Air Act designed to clean up the smog in the nine dirtiest cities. Methanol is made from wood, natural gas, coal, and even rubbish. But with the White House at stake, there is always a will and a way. Bush granted a waiver of requirements for gasoline blended with ethanol so it could be used in 30 per cent of the reformulated gasoline in the smoggy northern cities. Dirty southern cities can use it in 20 per cent of the market. The decision, said Tim Trotter, chairman of the National Corn Growers Association, 'truly brings about the full promise of clean air legislation passed two years ago'. Another spokesman for the Corn Growers acknowledged that while ethanol gasoline could probably meet new Clean Air requirements in the north, it still would be 'a challenge' in the south where the warmer air (which has an evaporative effect) would make it difficult. To further encourage ethanol, Bush said he would ask Congress for an increase in subsidies. According to Raymond Lewis, president of the American Methanol Institute, the federal ethanol subsidy could rise to 82 cents a gallon in addition to some state subsidies, which range from 20-50 cents a gallon. These make ethanol competitive with methanol, which sells for 40 cents a gallon. The unsubsidised cost of ethanol is 120 cents a gallon. The president infuriated the oil industry which, in any case, has been angry about other perceived slights. In order to use ethanol, they said, they would have to make a costlier, cleaner base fuel and spend millions of dollars reconfiguring their refineries. The industry said it has already spent Dollars 500m (Pounds 280m) since 1990 to increase methanol production capacity. Even more facili-ties are planned and ready to start construction as soon as the EPA regulations are finalised. 'This politically motivated decision further rewards the highly subsidised ethanol industry, whose profits are at a two-year high,' said Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute. 'It hurts oil industry workers whose numbers have declined by 450,000 over the last 10 years. It does nothing to improve air quality.' Angry methanol producers immediately appealed the decision to Congress, urging it to reject Bush's proposal to give more subsidy proposals. Lewis fired off a letter to members of a Senate and House tax conference committee and warned that 'spending federal tax dollars to subsidise an uneconomic product will discourage private capital investments in unsubsidised products that can clean up the air in American cities'. He vowed to continue to fight for methanol. Congress still has to find a bill this session on which to attach the subsidies, he said, and Bush's proposal must go through a month-long formal regulatory process in the EPA. By then the election will be long past.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAY WHALE ENTANGLED IN GILL NET IS RESCUED BY SPORTFISHING VESSEL  </P> <P> A California gray whale found entangled in a commercial fisherman's gill net by  a sportfishing boat captain Thursday morning was rescued and appeared to have  survived the ordeal.  </P> <P> Ray Duane, owner-operator of the Matt Walsh out of L.A. Harbor Sportfishing,  said he noticed the whale floundering in what he said was a halibut gill net  about 1 1/2 miles southeast of the harbor's breakwater.  </P> <P> Duane dropped anchor through the net and circled the whale, then pulled up  anchor and, while the crew held the whale's injured fluke, cut the mammal  loose.  </P> <P> The National Marine Fisheries Service's Terminal Island office confirmed that a  whale had been rescued and said that although it can't recommend that boaters  coming across similar situations attempt such a rescue, in this case Duane did  the right thing.  </P> <P> "The safety of the animals is the top priority," said Joe Cordaro, a service  biologist stationed at Terminal Island.  </P> <P> Cordaro added that the gill net was in legal waters, "but because it involved  an endangered species we can issue a fine if we can trace the (identification)  tags on the net. Unfortunately, this net had no tags." PETE THOMAS  </P></p>

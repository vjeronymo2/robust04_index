			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: No link between pay and performance Sir, The chairman of British Gas (Letters, December 1) bases his argument for the increases in directors' salaries on two premises, performance and comparability - both of which provide shaky foundations for his case. The chairman writes: 'It is his performance that counts.' All the evidence so far published in the UK and in the US demonstrates zero linkage between directors' pay and the performance of their companies. Also widely recognised is that lack of performance never leads to reduced pay. The 'significant annual cash compensation' which the chairman refers to will ensure that pay at the top of British Gas is kept high regardless of the future performance of the company. Private shareholders object strongly to this. The comparability argument will not carry any weight with the majority of private shareholders, because the remuneration of the highly paid executives of other UK companies, which British Gas now wishes to emulate, has been fixed by a close-knit group of directors. Result? Top pay increases far exceed increases in company profits, in overall output of the economy or in the pay of other workers. The chairman refers to the planned 'dramatic' Pounds 600m reduction in costs. British Gas's operating costs excluding exceptional charges have increased from Pounds 6.9bn in 1990 to Pounds 9bn in 1993, a 30 per cent increase. The planned reduction is, therefore, some 6 per cent of present operating costs. Dramatic? British Gas should put this remuneration package to the vote at the next AGM. This would at least, if carried, bestow some legitimacy on the company's intended action. Private shareholders who do not support the company's intended action may choose to give us their proxies. Donald B Butcher, chairman, UK Shareholders Association, 12 Burgh Heath Road, Epsom, Surrey KT17 4LJ</p>

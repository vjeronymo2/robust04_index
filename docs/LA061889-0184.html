			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: A MAJOR WIN WOULD BREAK KITE'S STRING  </P> <P> If you saw Tom Kite hanging around the clubhouse or first tee at your club,  chances are you'd try to get a game with him. You might even be tempted to  offer him shots.  </P> <P> I mean, he doesn't look like a guy you'd call The Hawk, or The Slammer. He's no  Golden Bear. What he looks like is a guy who might yip a three-foot putt. Who  might choke if the press bets get in double figures.  </P> <P> First of all, there are those glasses. They're just smaller than truck  windshields or department store windows. He has this curly red hair and  freckles. He grins a lot. If he had a dog, he could play Little Orphan Annie.  </P> <P> You wouldn't want him for a partner in a four-ball at Wilshire or even a  Saturday scramble on your home muni course.  </P> <P> He's one of the best golfers in the world but don't tell anybody. He's a  well-kept secret. Tom cooperates with that image. Tom likes to creep up on you.  Also, on a golf course or a tournament. He doesn't like to wake it up and have  it fight back.  </P> <P> He's leading the U.S. Open as the sun sets over the hills of western New York  and the storm clouds continue to hover over the Oak Hill site of the  tournament.  </P> <P> Tom is not supposed to be leading tournaments. He's supposed to finish second.  He does that better than anybody this side of the German Army. He's the  Second-Hand Rose of the game.  </P> <P> He is the third-leading money-winner of all time in the game, topped only by  Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson. He is not flashy, charismatic, just good. He is  so steady and consistent and unassuming, you'd hand him your coat at a party.  Hollywood would cast him as the best friend.  </P> <P> In a sport filled with club-throwers and tantrum-throwers, he is so  good-natured you might ask him to watch your dog while you made a phone call.  Some people at a Masters once asked him if he would mind taking their picture.  He didn't.  </P> <P> When most golfers win nearly $5 million, 12 tournaments, and finish in the top  10 in 21 out of 26 tournaments in one year, people want them to write a book,  go on the Tonight Show, give them instruction or design a line of clubs or  clothes. With Kite, they say, "How come you never won a major?"  </P> <P> It comes up to haunt Tom Kite. It's almost a standing lead: "Tom Kite, who has  never won a major . . . " It may be on his gravestone.  </P> <P> It's probably an historic injustice. Few players strike the ball with the  consistent excellence of a Tom Kite. Few players have won as many tournaments.  Only two have won more money. Almost none make the top 10 as regularly.  </P> <P> But when he comes into the press tent at the U.S. Open here this week, the  general questioning begins with a reporter tactfully clearing his throat and  trying not to look insincere as he asks: "Tom, do you think a career can be  fulfilled when you haven't won a major?"  </P> <P> No one quite says: "Tom, do you choke when it's the Open or the Masters?" They  don't have to. Kite knows where they're coming from. He's been there all his  life.  </P> <P> When he first came out of Texas as a young collegian, Tom Kite wasn't the  hopeful of every locker room from Ft. Worth to the Rio Grande. Ben Crenshaw  was. Tom got used to playing in the shadow.  </P> <P> What he never got used to was the notion he was playing for money, not history.  His style of play, so methodical if impeccable, created the suspicion that Tom  Kite was a guy who would go for a sure four if the alternative was to risk an  eight. They said he would go for the fat part of the green, the safe side of  the fairway, the lag putt. He would make 72 if to try for 67 might lead to 79.  </P> <P> A generation weaned on an Arnold Palmer, who played every hole as if he would  make a two or a 12, quickly relegated Kite to a spear-carrier role.  </P> <P> Was it a bum rap? Well, Tom Kite is not your basic Arnold Palmer athlete.  Arnold was built along the lines of your stronger middleweight contender. He  went after a golf course like Roberto Duran against a guy with a cut over his  eye.  </P> <P> Kite doesn't exactly romance the golf course but at 5-feet-8, 150 pounds, and  with eyesight just good enough for the big E on the chart without glasses, Kite  can never go the caveman route or for the one-round knockout. Kite is out to  out-think the golf course. He can't cover up mistakes hitting a three-wood out  of deep rough with a blacksmith's arms like a Snead or Palmer.  </P> <P> He's not exactly defending himself against a golf course. He's just not trying  to drag it back to the cave by the hair.  </P> <P> It would be so fitting for him to win a National Open, it probably won't  happen. Majors have been won by guys who seldom win anything else.  </P> <P> The guys in the hunt with Kite as this Open goes into its final round include  some who are as qualified and deserving as he -- but they also include two guys  who have never won anything, two guys who have never won in this country, a guy  who has already won his Open but only half as many tournaments as Kite.  </P> <P> But who says a U.S. Open is fair? It's as full of malice as a park mugger.  </P> <P> Kite sighs and admits he probably won't light up the course in the final round.  "I'll probably come out there in some really flashy outfit," he grins. "A nice  bold gray and a white visor. Black shoes, Navy slacks. I'll dazzle 'em."  </P> <P> He'd really like to bore people to death. With a nice, undramatic, bogey-free  round just good enough to win a U.S. Open by a shot.  </P> <P> Not that he expects it to re-do his image. The line will then say: "Tom Kite,  who has won over $5 million but only one major. . . . " Tom will smile sweetly.  He always does.  </P></p>

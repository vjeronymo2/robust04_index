			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLACENTIA'S CHANG WINS FRENCH OPEN  </P> <P> Seventeen-year-old Michael Chang of Placentia became the youngest player to win  the French Open men's singles title, defeating Stefan Edberg of Sweden, 6-1,  3-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, in the final Sunday.  </P> <P> Chang is the first American to win the French Open men's title since Tony  Trabert in 1955 and the youngest player to win a Grand Slam men's singles title  (victories in four major international tennis tournaments).  </P> <P> Chang's victory capped an amazing run in which he upset top-seeded Ivan Lendl  in the fourth round Monday after being down two sets and suffering from painful  leg cramps in the fifth set.  </P> <P> Chang, who was seeded 15th in the tournament, defeated Ronald Agenor Wednesday  in the quarterfinals and Andrei Chesnokov Friday in the semifinals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Memorable Two Weeks  </P> <P> Sunday against the third-seeded Edberg, he faced 10 break points in three games  during the fourth set but never buckled. He repeatedly scored with passing  shots, drop shots and volleys to win the set.  </P> <P> When Edberg hit a forehand into the net to end the 3-hour, 41-minute match,  Chang threw up his arms, smiled broadly and turned to his family and coach  sitting in the stands.  </P> <P> "These two weeks, regardless of what happened today, are going to stay with me  throughout my whole life," Chang said.  </P> <P> At 17 years, 3 1/2 months old, Chang is six months younger than Mats Wilander  when that player became the youngest Grand Slam men's champion by winning the  French Open in 1982.  </P> <P> Chang's title also is the first Grand Slam singles title for a U.S. man since  John McEnroe won the U.S. Open in 1984.  </P> <P> Along with the U.S. and French Open, the Grand Slam title includes victories at  Wimbledon and the Australian Open.  </P> <P> Details in Sports.  </P></p>

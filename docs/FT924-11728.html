			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Polish car industry investment delayed FOREIGN investment in Poland's motor car industry is being delayed by a lack of agreement between Warsaw and the European Community on the distribution of 30,000-vehicle tariff-free annual import quota worth Ecu100m into the country. Yesterday, Mr Louis Hughes, the head of GM Europe met with Ms Hanna Suchocka, Poland's prime minister and confirmed his company's continuing interest in assembling Opel Astra cars at Warsaw's FSO factory. But GM, who agreed a letter of intent with the Poles last February, are waiting to see what share of the quota they will get before going ahead with the agreement. GM also wants to ensure that car imports will continue to be regulated to minimalise competition from other car makers. Volkswagen who are planning to assemble delivery vans at the FSR factory near Poznan are also waiting for the outcome of the car quota talks with the EC. Only Fiat have disregarded the quota issue and gone ahead with their Dollars 2bn takeover of the FSM small car factory in southern Poland. Ideally the Poles would like to distribute the quota equally between those companies investing in the country but this is being resisted by other car makers in Germany and Holland who are eager to secure access on equal terms. Imports of new and used cars into Poland fell this year with the introduction of a 35 per cent import tariff.</p>

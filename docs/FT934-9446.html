			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (5): State ventures flounder - Ian Rodger examines industrial policy WHATEVER shreds of credibility Austria's nationalised industries retained, following the financial collapse of the old Voest-Alpine steel and engineering group in 1985, have been ripped away in the past few months. Even partially privatised OMV, the previously high performing and much respected integrated oil and chemicals group, has come unstuck. A forecast of modest profits made by management at the end of April had to be withdrawn in early September, when it became obvious that a Sch4.7bn loss for the full year loomed. But the worst disaster has been at Austria Metall (AMAG), the integrated aluminium group within the Austrian Industries combine. Given their heads in the late 1980s, AMAG managers invested heavily in both upstream and downstream ventures, leaving themselves with no resources to cope with the slump that has hit the world aluminium sector in the past two years. Over the past year, assessments of the scale of the debacle at AMAG have risen by the month. In the typical Austrian way, these have trickled out by way of leaks to the press. First, it was Sch2bn, then Sch4bn, then Sch7bn. The final bill to close down most of AMAG - for that is the only solution - seems to have topped out during the summer at Sch13bn. The throughly embarrassed government - both its Democratic Socialist and Conservative wings - now seeks only to get rid of the albatrosses that still cling heavily to its neck as quickly and quietly as possible. 'What was an asset for the trade unions and the Democratic Socialist Party has become a burden,' Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the socialist finance minister, admits. Believers in state involvement in industry in Austria are now exceptionally thin on the ground. Mr Lacina makes no bones about his own crossing of the ideological Rubicon. 'I have to confess that I really changed my mind,' he says. The minister responsible for state industries in 1985, when an over-exuberant Voest-Alpine trading subsidiary lost Sch1bn speculating in oil contracts, Mr Lacina has come to believe that the state is inevitably handicapped as an owner of industry. 'It is not easy for the government to have an arm's length relationship with these companies. No politician could have assessed the value of AMAG's investments. But now politicians are blamed,' he says. It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of this watershed. State ownership of industry has been a way of life in post-war Austria, initially because it was the only way the Russian occupiers, fearful of re-nazification, would allow the country to recover control of its production assets. Thus, virtually every key industrial sector has been controlled directly by the government or by one or more of the leading banks, which themselves have been controlled in the public sector. Gradually, enterprise became part of the infamous Proporz system, by which the Socialists and Conservatives shared out jobs among their supporters, and thus a way of life. Today, while the Proporz system is still in effect at the highest levels of industry and finance, it has collapsed at most other levels. In a cold world of free and open competition, competence and qualifications have come to be seen as more important than political affiliation. Thus, the political parties have less and less interest in clinging on to these businesses, regardless of their financial performance. Privatisation has been a live theme in Austrian politics since the mid-1980s. An initial wave saw the flotation of significant minority stakes in Creditanstalt, the former Landerbank, OMV and the utilities Verbund and EVN. But a nervous Austrian establishment made sure that the state remained firmly in control. Hopes for a more substantial push were vested mainly in Austrian Industries, the vehicle that had been established in 1986 to recapitalise and restructure Voest-Alpine. AI had a very good run for a few years, eliminating thousands of redundant jobs, selling off several non-strategic holdings and emerging into profit for three years up to 1991. As early as 1989, plans for privatisation were being prepared, and even a convertible bond issue was launched. Then suddenly all went sour again; first, because OMV, which had also been put under AI's wing, tumbled into loss in the first half of last year. Officials hoped they could preserve AI's potential saleability by putting OMV back under the direct control of the Austrian state holding company, Oesterreichische Industrieholding (OIAG). But then came the AMAG debacle. Now the rush is on to sell off whatever can be sold. In the past year or so, two sparkling subsidiaries of AI, Voest-Alpine Eisenbahnsysteme and Austria Mikro Systeme, have been successfully floated on the stock market, as has a minority of shares of Flughafen Wien (Vienna airport). Negotiations are at an advanced stage for a foreign government or integrated oil company to take a strategic stake in OMV, although putting a valuation on it has become problematic in the wake of the oil group's latest setbacks. And a sale of the government's 49 per cent stake in Creditanstalt is thought to be imminent. AI itself is being readied for flotation. Stripped of its AMAG burdens and other non-core subsidiaries, it would be a strong steel and steel-engineering business that could attract international investment interest, London investment bankers SG Warburg said last month. The key, however, is for the government to underwrite the AMAG burdens until proceeds from the sales of other assets can cover them. That is a hot potato in Austrian politics, as Conservatives fear that the Socialist-led coalition government will go back on its promise not to pour any more public money into the nationalised industries. 'It is very clear that there is a credibility gap,' Mr Lacina says. We well have to make sure that the guarantee is written very carefully.' Even when and if all these privatisation projects are completed, much more needs to be done to untangle the close links between Austrian industry, banks and government. The national government still owns a tobacco monopoly, a casino operator and the national telephone and railway systems. The big banks still have controlling stakes in several leading industrial companies, although Creditanstalt has recently committed itself to getting rid of most of its holdings over a five to 10 year period. Then there is the city of Vienna with vast holdings in a bizarre mixture including Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, and chains of cinemas and restaurants. Vienna is still run by old-style socialists and shows no sign of bowing to the privatisation fad.</p>

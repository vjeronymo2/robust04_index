			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Banker's claim of unfair dismissal fails MR KEN Ellis, who was sacked as head of the foreign-exchange department of merchant bank Robert Fleming in June 1989, cannot make a claim that he was unfairly dismissed, a London industrial tribunal ruled yesterday. The tribunal said his claim should have been made within three months of his dismissal. Mr Ellis told the tribunal that his career was in ruins. He said he could not get a job in the City because of 'gossip' about his role in an al-leged fraud at Robert Fleming. Mr Craig Hope, solicitor for Robert Fleming, said Mr Ellis had been dismissed for breaches of staff dealing rules and other irregularities. Mr Ellis denied he had breached bank regulations. In 1989 Robert Fleming called in the Serious Fraud Office to investigate irregularities discovered in its foreign-exchange dealings. The bank confirmed yesterday that the investigation had not resulted in any prosecutions.</p>

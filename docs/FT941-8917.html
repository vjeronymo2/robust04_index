			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Observer: Naked ambition Don't cry for John Major, Britain's unpopular leader. On a scale of one to 10, his party's sex scandals hardly get on the score sheet when compared with the brouhaha surrounding the first entry of Brazil's President Itamar Franco in Rio de Janeiro's recent carnival. Franco's problems started when Lilian Ramos, an actress and Playboy model, managed to sneak into the president's box during the parade. The couple were obviously taken with each other, since they were soon exchanging glances, kisses and phone numbers. Unfortunately for the president, a 63-year-old divorced father of two, several photographers had already spotted that Ramos was even more scantily clad than some other carnival-goers. 'When I took my panties off I didn't know I was going to meet the president,' admitted the publicity-hungry samba dancer. Apparently unaware of the shocking photos which were about to appear in the Brazilian papers, the president phoned his new-found friend on Monday, only to find later that his calls had been taped in the presence of journalists - who make The Sun's newshounds look like angels . . . Carnival is a time when normal rules of behaviour are broken in Brazil. However, the Catholic church said that the spectacle of the country's head of state dallying with the dancer was doubly regrettable because it occurred on the eve of a national campaign to encourage family values.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PALMDALE TO CONSIDER OUTLAWING FIREWORKS;  </P> <P> FIRE FEARS: THE MAYOR PREDICTS THAT UNLIKE AN EARLIER ATTEMPT, A BAN ON SALES  WILL BECOME LAW WITHIN SEVERAL MONTHS.  </P> <P> Fear of brush-fire disasters has spurred the Antelope Valley city of Palmdale,  last holdout for legal fireworks sales in northern Los Angeles County, to again  consider outlawing them.  </P> <P> Palmdale Mayor William "Pete" Knight said Friday that he has asked city staff  members to draft a fireworks ban for the City Council to consider, predicting a  law will be adopted within several months despite the failure of a similar city  move two years ago.  </P> <P> "We've never gotten the public input and support for it like we did this year,"  the mayor said, crediting the sense of fire danger created by a fourth year of  drought that has left the area tinder-dry, and concern over a recent rash of  arson brush fires in nearby areas.  </P> <P> The city's move, disclosed just two days after the traditional Fourth of July  celebration, sets the stage for a battle between county fire officials and  anti-fireworks residents, and many local service organizations that rely on  fireworks sales to raise money.  </P> <P> "Great. That's wonderful. I'm encouraged," said Jim Daleo, an assistant county  fire chief, when told of Palmdale's proposal. "I see a trend of cities slowly  getting out of the fireworks business. I think the benefits of outlawing them  outweigh the advantages of keeping them."  </P> <P> Under state law, cities may choose to allow the sale of certain fireworks,  referred to as "safe and sane." But fire officials say even those are unsafe,  and a growing number of cities have outlawed them in recent years. Fireworks  sales are now banned in 47 cities in Los Angeles County and permitted in 39.  </P> <P> But Jim Hull, recording secretary for the Palmdale Knights of Columbus, said  his group and other organizations in Palmdale likely will protest the proposed  ban. The Palmdale Knights of Columbus have been selling Fourth of July  fireworks from the same site for about 30 years.  </P> <P> "I think it comes down to the bottom line that safe and sane is safe and sane,"  Hull said, blaming safety and fire problems more on fireworks such as bottle  rockets that are illegal in California. The Knights depend on fireworks sales  to raise money for their scholarship programs, Hull said.  </P> <P> Palmdale became the north county's last legal fireworks outlet when the city of  San Fernando, under pressure from the city of Los Angeles, banned them in 1988.  Other cities with fireworks bans include Lancaster, Burbank, Glendale, Los  Angeles, Hidden Hills, Santa Clarita and Agoura Hills.  </P> <P> On the Fourth of July this year, county fire officials, who serve 48 cities and  all unincorporated areas, blamed fireworks for 119 fires, with damage estimated  at $485,000, and eight injuries. Of those fires, 33 involved houses or other  structures, 52 involved other property, and 34 were in brush.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD;  </P> <P> CITY WEIGHS FUNDING FOR VISITORS BUREAU  </P> <P> The Oxnard City Council on Tuesday will consider three options to provide  financial support for the Convention and Visitors Bureau to prevent it from  being closed.  </P> <P> Former City Manager David Mora had recommended several months ago that the city  eliminate its $398,000 contribution to the bureau as a way to reduce a  projected $2.8-million deficit in the 1990-91 budget.  </P> <P> Instead, the City Council voted to contribute half of the amount to keep the  bureau open until December.  </P> <P> The action was intended to give the city time to identify new ways to pay the  salaries of the bureau's six full-time staff members without draining the  city's coffers.  </P> <P> Robert D. Varley, executive chairman of the bureau, had warned the City Council  that closing the bureau would have a devastating effect on the tax revenues  generated for the city by hotels, motels and other tourism-related businesses.  </P> <P> One of the options that the council will consider is formation of an assessment  district of motels, hotels and other businesses that benefit from the bureau's  activities.  </P> <P> Another option would be to require hotels and motels to pay a visitors' fee,  which would not to exceed the cost of the services provided by the bureau.  </P> <P> A third option is to ask the city's voters to approve a 2% increase in the  transient occupancy tax, which is charged on all hotel and motel rooms in the  city.  </P> <P> The tax increase would require approval of a majority of the voters.  </P> <P> However, if the City Council decides to earmark the tax revenues to finance the  bureau's activities, adoption would require approval of two-thirds of the  voters.

Viktor Yerin, Russian minister of internal affairs, met Moshe  Shahal, Israeli minister of police, energy and infrastructure.  As a result, a protocol was signed on talks about cooperation  between the two ministries on combatting international crime.  Our correspondent Georgiy Sovtsov reports.    [Sovtsov] The main themes of the protocol are the prevention  of crime in the sphere of law enforcement, public safety, the  prevention of the illegal narcotics trade with the cooperation  of police forces at lower levels. Viktor Yerin, the Russian  minister, confirmed that at present work is being actively  conducted to conclude a full-scale agreement between Russia and  Israel, but as this is being done at government level, the two  countries' police ministers can for now sign only the present  protocol.    Viktor Yerin also stressed that the restoration of  diplomatic  and economic relations with Israel made it necessary to draw  closer on questions of operational and criminal pursuit work and  there are cases of this happening already; for example, in 1993  Israeli police seized over 100 kg of narcotics.    Moshe Shahal cited one of the points of this protocol, on  confirming the posts of liaison officers under the ministers of  each country to provide operational information. Israel has  already established such relations with the United States,  France, Turkey, Ukraine, and Russia. Asked whether a Russian  mafia existed in Israel, Mr. Shahal replied that the level of  crime among former emigrants from Russia and other CIS countries  was no different from those living permanently in Israel.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oleksa Kurpas: "Monetarism: `Pros' and `Cons'"] </F>   [Text] Over the last quarter of 1993, the prices in  Ukraine rose by 89 percent and the amount of money in  circulation -- by 17 percent. This is the government's monetary  policy, when uncovered karbovantsi are not issued. Acting Prime  Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy is the country's chief monetarist.    Mr. Zvyahilskyy says that, owing to the introduction of the  financial rate of currencies and the stringent monetary policy,  inflation could be curbed and that now it amounts to about 20  percent a month (against 300 percent last year).    However, monetarism is a double-edged weapon. Ex-prime  minister Leonid Kuchma stresses that it is such a policy that  has led to the crisis in industry. As of today, the debts of  our enterprises in credits amount to 134.1 trillion karbovantsi  [K] and in debits to K101.4 billion. In order to emerge from  this situation, bills of exchange should have been introduced.  However, for some reason, this procedure is being delayed. The  Ministry of Finance, with Hryhoriy Pyatachenko at the head,  refuses to redeem those bills of exchange that enterprises or  private persons hold.    Chairman of Ukraine's National Bank Viktor Yushchenko is yet  another advocate of monetarism. It still remains a mystery on  what principles he distributes the credits. It was only under  the pressure of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs [USPP] (with Leonid Kuchma as president) that  industry received from Ukraine's National Bank K5.4 trillion in  stabilization credits and K5.5 trillion in assistance. However,  today's needs are much greater. To be sure, the karbovanets of  the unpaid wages results in two or three karbovantsi of  nonpayments. Because of this, members of the USPP are  threatening to disband Ukraine's National Bank and instead,  create some mysterious institution that will grant credits to  everybody.    Minister of Economics Roman Shpek says that this policy is  meant for stabilizing the economic situation. However, in  reality, it turns out that enterprises are becoming hostages to  Zvyahilskyy and company. In the opinion of Volodymyr Lanovyy  [former minister of economics], monetary policy is necessary,  but only under the conditions of a stable economy, or else the  state is simply covering up truly bankrupt enterprises, replaces  real unemployment by a hidden one, and will lead the economy to  total collapse.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Volker Fink: "Start in the Mass Market"] </F>   [Text] The connection of ISDN [Integrated Services Digital  network] had developed into a sought-after product on the German  telecommunications market. The official startup of Euro-ISDN in  December will give the digital network an additional boost.    In the past years a number of countries have introduced  ISDN.  But there were no extensive ISDN standards, so that various  performance characteristics and features were being used for  connections in the individual countries. Above all, local ISDN  terminal equipment and applications were confined to use in each  country, so that each country developed its own terminal  equipment. The result of this greatly limited the marketing  opportunities, which also led to low production numbers and  relatively high unit prices.    In order to counteract these problems, 26 network operators  from 20 European countries have committed themselves to  introduce an ISDN based on a uniform European standard by the  end of 1993. Telekom has also signed this agreement. It was  determined that every network operator should offer both basic  and primary multiplex connections. In addition, a minimum of  services and performance features must be supported. Beyond  that, however, every network operator is free to offer  additional performance features, but he must use the  international standards. The minimum range includes:        -  64 kbit/s transmission service (transparent  transmission of 64 kbit/s without limitation),    -  3.1 kHz audio transmission service,    -  transmission of the calling number to the subscriber called,    -  suppression of transmission of the calling number    -  digital information display through to the extension in  telecommunications facilities,    -  multiple number dialing    -  interchanging at the passive bus of the multiple equipment  connection.       With Euro-ISDN the user thus has the advantage in the future  of being able to use a large, high-capacity, and inexpensive  international range of terminal equipment.    It has already been established that this is not just a  future vision. Thus, as of January 1994 Telekom will offer a  modern Euro-ISDN telephone at the cost of not quite 300 German  marks [DM], which can be used with all current Euro-ISDN  performance features. Small ISDN telecommunications facilities  at a cost of DM 1,000 will be available approximately in  mid-1994, and many experts anticipate that the price of passive  ISDN PC adapter cards will shortly drop to about DM 200.    Another important advantage with Euro-ISDN lies in the users  being able to employ their ISDN applications and communications  solutions without change in various countries, which greatly  simplifies international communication.  <H5>  Introduction of Euro-ISDN in Germany </H5>   Telekom began to implement Euro-ISDN in its network in  August  1993. The only thing needed to make Euro-ISDN available is to  change the software at the switching center. Hardware changes at  the switching centers or the subscriber's network end is not  necessary. The introduction of Euro-ISDN is so simple because  international compatibility involves only signalling on the  access line, the D-channel protocol.    For technical reasons the introduction of the new software  can only take place in stages, however, so that Euro-ISDN will  not be available nationwide until April 1994. In regions where  the work has been completed, customers can already be connected  before that. The startup of regular operation took place on 1  December 1993.    With the introduction of Euro-ISDN, Telekom will offer both  the national (1TR6) and the European D-channel protocols (DSS-1)  in its network. Each user can then decide whether he wants to  use an ISDN connection with the national or the European  standard. This applies to both existing connections and to new  installations. The conversion takes place individually for each  connection at the switching center. No changes are necessary at  the network port. For connections between ports with various  protocols, the conversion is carried out by the network.    How long national ISDN will remain part of the features  offered will be determined mainly by market requirements.  Telekom plans to offer the choice between ISDN connections with  national or European protocols until the year 2000.  <H5>  `Bilingual' ISDN Base Terminal </H5>   Due to the different D-channel protocols, a 1TR6 terminal  unit cannot be operated with a Euro-ISDN port. Conversely, it is  also not possible to operate a Euro-ISDN terminal unit with a  1TR6 connection. Since Telekom will offer both D-channel  protocols simultaneously in its network, and the customer  himself can decide which standard he wants to use, this  limitation is not significant with only one end unit. This  applies in particular to ISDN connections of telecommunications  facilities and computer centers.    With Euro-ISDN Telekom will also offer a bilingual basic  connection for multiequipment configuration (basic connection  with passive bus), in which both standards are available  simultaneously. For this a modified network port must be  installed at the subscriber's which uses the European D-channel  protocol toward the ISDN switching center and at the subscriber  network interface (S[.sup]0[/] interface), in addition to the  European D-channel protocol, also the 1TR6 protocol. This makes  it possible to operate terminals with the national and European  standard at the same time with one and the same basic connection.    Bilingual primary multiplex connections are not possible for  technical reasons and are therefore also not planned. If a  telecommunications facility is connected through several ISDN  ports, however, some of the ports could use the European  D-channel protocol and the other ports the 1TR6 protocol.  <H5>  Services and Service Features with Euro-ISDN </H5>   With the introduction of Euro-ISDN, Telekom offers a  spectrum  of services and service features which are clearly above the  minimum range required. There will be many performance features  which are not in the national ISDN and which make new  applications possible. Some performance characteristics will  also have new properties which permit even more comfortable  communication. An example of this is "multiple dialing."    This feature replaces the previously well-known "terminal  selector character." With the terminal selector character it was  possible to select each equipment specifically in the event  several terminals are connected to an ISDN port. While in  1TR6-ISDN exactly 10 numbers are available in ascending order at  a multiequipment port with the addition of another position to  the ISDN call number, in Euro-ISDN up to 10 numbers can be  defined as multiple call numbers. These can be any free numbers  from the volume of call numbers at the switching center. This  means that when changing over to Euro-ISDN the customer can keep  his previous call number if he is already connected to a digital  switching center. Basically, one can say that the service  features of the national ISDN are connection-related, while in  Euro-ISDN they are call number-related. For the user this has  the advantage that he can use the service features for each  multiple call number separately. Example: In rerouting a call,  the entire connection is no longer transferred; instead, various  rerouting destinations can be entered for each multiple number  dialled.    Additional features will be added over the next few years.  In  addition to three-party conferencing, special mention may be  made of "partial rerouting" which will be available after  1994/95. With this feature rerouting calls from  telecommunications installations will be possible for each  individual extension.    The "reserved permanent connection" feature (old name:  semipermanent fixed connection), for which there is still no  European standard at this time, will not be offered so far.  "Three-party conferencing" will not be possible to use until the  end of 1994.  <H5>  Euro-ISDN Rates </H5>   Regarding ISDN rates it is necessary to distinguish between  connection rates for basic and primary multiplex connections and  for traffic rates. The traffic rates correspond to the normal  analog telephone connection. For that it does not matter whether  you call or send text, images, and data. There will be no  service-based rates. Telekom thereby differs from some other  countries, in which non-voice communication carries different  and in part higher charges than voice transmission.    However, the Euro-ISDN connection involves a new product  with  new features. That is the reason why Euro-ISDN rates are  different from the rates for national ISDN. Basically, there  will be separate tariff items for a Euro-ISDN connection without  features, as well as for all features which can be switched on  separately. Telekom is obligated to do this based on directives  from the Federal Ministry for Posts and Telecommunication and  the EC Commission. For reasons of handling and clarity, two cost  packages are planned in which ISDN connection and features are  bundled. The two packages offered are called ISDN Standard  Connection and ISDN Comfort Connection and are offered in the  basic connection variant at DM 64 and 69. At these rates the  basic Euro-ISDN connection is DM 10 cheaper than the national  connection variant.  <H5>  Access to X.25 Networks </H5>   Euro-ISDN will not only offer new performance features but  also the foundation for flexible and inexpensive communication.  An example of this is access to X.25 networks over the B and D  channel of the ISDN connection, for which Telekom will create  the preconditions based on Euro-ISDN. Access through the D  channel of the basic connection is particularly attractive for  many applications.    The D channel is basically reserved for the signalling of  the  connection. Information transmission in this channel is  packet-oriented and takes place with a transmission speed of 16  kbit/s. Only a part of this transmission capacity is needed for  signalling, so that the rest is available for transmission of  "useful information."    An ISDN customer can thus operate his basic connection  independent of the use of the B channels as a X.25 connection.  The access through the D channel is suitable for transmission  speeds of up to 9600 bit/s. For higher speeds a B channel must  be used.    If a user would also like to utilize his ISDN connection as  a  packet network connection, he must pay for the use of this  feature in addition to the monthly base rate for the ISDN  connection. Connection charges in ISDN are not included in the  present concept, but the rates for each X.25 network are added.  Access through the D channel of the basic connection will  presumably be very inexpensive. As of right now, operation is  likely to begin in the second quarter of 1994.    The intended technical solution primarily offers advantages  for applications in which only small data quantities must be  transmitted per connection and which also have other  communications needs. Among them may be mentioned the electronic  cash systems in retail sales or booking systems in travel  agencies. The advantage is that the users do not have to acquire  several different telecommunication ports for language  communication and data transmission, which leads to more  flexibility and, above all, savings.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Permanent Secretary of the Interior Ministry Ari  Wong-araya granted an interview to newsmen at Government House  this afternoon. Asked about the Iranian Government's protest,  through the Thai ambassador to Iran, about Thailand's arrest of  Iranians suspected of preparing and transporting C-4 explosive  for sabotage at the Israeli Embassy, the permanent secretary  said it was difficult for him to comment since this might affect  relations. Besides, the permanent secretary said he still knew  nothing about the protest.    Asked whether it would be possible for Iranian diplomats to  meet the suspects, he said this would be up to the police. He  said the diplomats can call on the suspects to provide them with  a lawyer should he be arrested. However, he said, he was not  sure if there really had been a protest as he had seen nothing  to that effect.    Ari said legal proceedings against the suspects will be  based  on Thai law because the incident took place in Thailand. He  said the suspects might not be granted bail if there is no  guarantee of security. He said that under Thai law, Iran cannot  seek extradition for trial in Iran. He is confident the police  will adhere to Thai law, particularly as the case is considered  an important one involving national security. He noted that the  police have followed quite proper and thorough procedures. The  police are speeding up the investigation for the result of the  case.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Savoy may deny Forte full victory The Savoy hotel group is expected to emerge from its board meeting tomorrow as an independent company. Plans to merge Savoy's hotels with Forte's luxury establishments are likely to be shelved for the time being. The board hopes instead to appoint a new chairman and managing director, who will be charged with improving Savoy's profits as a stand-alone company. This outcome will not give Forte the complete victory it has sought. Mr Rocco Forte, the group's chairman, had previously said he wanted a majority stake in a company which combined the Savoy group with Forte's top hotels. Forte is, however, expected to be given greater participation in the management of Savoy. Savoy die-hards still hope that a white knight might offer to buy the stakes of one or more small Savoy shareholding trusts, thereby pushing Forte even further away from outright control. Their interest has been raised by a planned meeting today between Sir Anthony Tuke, Savoy's chairman, and Mr Jay Pritzker, the Chicago financier whose family owns the Hyatt hotels group. Mr Pritzker was unavailable for comment. Savoy directors hope to announce on Tuesday that Mr Ramon Pajares, general manager of London's Four Seasons hotel, will replace Mr Giles Shepard, the Savoy managing director, who is expected to resign today or tomorrow. Sir Ewen Fergusson, chairman of Coutts, the private bank, and former British ambassador to France and South Africa, is the leading candidate to succeed Sir Anthony, who wishes to retire. The directors' endorsement of Sir Ewen and Mr Pajares would represent a truce in the 13-year-old feud between Savoy loyalists and Forte. A takeover battle which lasted for much of the 1980s resulted in Forte owning 68 per cent of the shares but only 42 per cent of the vote. Forte has for several months been talking to shareholding trusts controlled by the family of the late Sir Hugh Wontner, Savoy president until his death in 1992. There has been speculation that the trusts might be prepared to align themselves with the Forte camp. Instead, there has been a recognition by both sides that the Savoy hotels - which include the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught - have performed poorly under Mr Shepard. Last year, the group made pre-tax profits of only Pounds 725,000 on turnover of Pounds 83.3m.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Markets: Traders drop the baseball and hit the dollar - Wall Street It has been one of those rare weeks when traders and investors on Wall Street have to turn away from the charts of bond yields and interest rates, the tables of corporate earnings, and the latest baseball scores, and start paying attention to something they spend most of the year happily ignoring: the dollar. Unlike in the UK, where the value of sterling is closely watched because the economy is seen as vulnerable to imported inflation, in the US, currency rates are rarely of interest to the stock market. Except, that is, when the dollar moves in such a fashion that the Fed is forced to lead 17 other central banks into the international foreign exchange markets to buy dollars. When the Fed has to ask the Bank of Moldova for help in defending the US currency, Wall Street sits up and takes notice. Admittedly, investors are not so much worried about what the recent decline in the value of the dollar against the D-Mark and the Yen might do to the profits of companies with overseas earnings to repatriate, as they are worried about what a desperate Fed might do to get the groggy dollar back on its feet. For if the concerted efforts of 18 central banks, and the application of what one assumes must have been billions of dollars, could not stem the US currency's decline, what can the Fed do to achieve its aim but raise US interest rates one more time? And if the Fed is forced into raising rates to defend the dollar, it must know that another quarter point on the federal funds rate would not do the trick. In all likelihood, the discount rate - untouched at 3 per cent during recent monetary policy tightening - would have to go up, and probably by as much as 50 basis points. Anything less, and the foreign exchange markets are unlikely to start taking the US government's talk of defending the dollar seriously. The only problem with this scenario is that a quick hike in the discount rate could inflict another devastating blow on the still vulnerable US bond market, and a fresh sell-off of bonds could trigger another sharp decline in the equally vulnerable stock market. From the dollar to the discount rate to bond prices to share prices, the dominos would tumble. The great irony in all of this is that one of the reasons the US government is unhappy about the dollar's fall is the impact it has had on the bond market - foreign investors have been reluctant to buy Treasury bonds for fear of seeing the value of their investment undermined by a depreciating dollar. Yet, if the Fed raises rates to boost the value of the dollar, bond prices will probably drop, which will only make the market more unattractive to overseas investors. No one, of course, ever suggested the job of a central banker was easy, but the people at the Fed must be extremely unhappy that the delicate task of holding off inflation without undermining the economic recovery has been made that much harder by the dollar's travails. However, if the Fed has been hesitating over a dollar- inspired rate increase because of what it might do to the bond and stock markets, its hand may be forced into another tightening once yesterday's April employment report has been fully digested by the policy makers. Anticipating a rise in non-farm payrolls during April of somewhere close to 195,000, Wall Street analysts were shocked yesterday when the Labor department announced that payrolls had jumped by 267,000 last month. The drop in the national unemployment rate from 6.5 per cent to 6.4 per cent also caught the markets by surprise, as did the upward revision in the already extremely strong March payroll numbers. The reaction from the bond market was instantaneous - the price of the benchmark 30-year bond dropped over 2 points, and the yield climbed to more than 7.5 per cent - and indicated that investors believed the data would push the Fed into another interest rate increase. Share prices quickly followed bonds lower yesterday, and by midday it appeared likely that the Fed would tighten policy again - if not immediately, then probably some time around the May 17 meeting of the central bank's Open Market Committee. If the employment report spooked the stock and bond markets, it at least allowed traders and investors to forget temporarily their worries about the dollar. After an initial burst of activity, following the release of the jobs figures, trading on the currency markets in New York was relatively quiet, with the dollar slipping slightly from its overnight levels. Any support the currency might have received from the likelihood of an interest rate increase was offset by the unwillingness of foreign investors to buy dollar assets such as US stocks and bonds.

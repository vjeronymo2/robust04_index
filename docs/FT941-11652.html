			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Book Review: When neighbours are not good friends ETHNIC SELF-DETERMINATION AND THE BREAK-UP OF STATES By Kamal S. Shehadi IISS/Brassey's Pounds 10/Dollars 17, 90 pages NATION AGAINST STATE By Gidon Gottlieb Council on Foreign Relations Dollars 22.95/14.95, 148 pages NEW APPROACHES TO MINORITY PROTECTION By Asbjorn Eide Minority Rights Group 20+viii pages Old states have split up, and new ones are unable to agree on their frontiers. Ethnic conflict rages in the former Yugoslavia and in many parts of the former Soviet Union. And there is almost certainly more to come. As Kamal Shehadi warns, in his Adelphi paper published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, 'self-determination conflicts are likely to continue to plague the Russian federation and many of its surrounding states, as well as the Balkans, China, India, Burma, Indonesia, Iraq, Turkey, Ethiopia and the rest of the Horn of Africa, Sudan and South Africa'. In all those places, people are asserting a national identity which they feel is not reflected in, or recognised by, the state of which they are citizens, or subjects, or at least residents. Many of them are asking for a new state, or for the territory where they live to be transferred to another existing state with which they identify. Almost always this demand is resisted by the state they now belong to, and frequently the result is bloodshed, culminating in the forced displacement of populations. This process is destructive of international order. The flood of refugees; the power of example; the danger of contamination if weapons of mass destruction are used: all these, as well as humanitarian revulsion, make it impossible for great powers to ignore the problem. Traditional responses are clearly inadequate. The hunt is on for a new approach. Shehadi's paper, along with Gidon Gottlieb's Nation Against State and New Approaches to Minority Protection by Asbjorn Eide are all contributions to that search. Shehadi looks at the process of self-determination, and argues that it is 'a dynamic process, not an end'. Self-determination 'makes the people the source of state sovereignty and thus implies a democratic form of government'. This does not follow automatically from national independence, nor is national independence the only way to achieve it. But democracy is a necessary, not a sufficient, condition for genuine self-government. Where politics is polarised on ethnic or communal lines, majority rule gives ethnic minorities no say in how they are governed, unless there are special provisions to that effect. So Shehadi devotes much of his argument to recommending ways in which states can ensure that their ethnic minorities do not feel obliged to seek self-determination through secession. There is thus a considerable overlap between his paper and the Minority Rights Group pamphlet by Eide, a Norwegian human rights specialist. Eide's approach is more theoretical, Shehadi's more pragmatic. But both make a distinction between the 'common domain' - decisions affecting all citizens, in which the minority must be given an effective share - and the 'separate domain', where minorities can run their own affairs through autonomous institutions. Where the minority forms a local majority in a given region, autonomy can take the form of territorial 'arrangements' (Shehadi) or 'subdivisions' (Eide), in some cases extending even to a federal or confederal system - though this is often resisted by the majority, out of fear that it will lead to secession. Shehadi also observes that self-determination has an 'external' aspect - the right of a community 'to shape its ties, legal and otherwise, with other political entities, be they sovereign states, ethnic minority groups or international organisations'. This thought is taken further by Gottlieb, a US lawyer, who proposes divorcing the idea of nation from that of state, so that 'nations and peoples that have no state of their own can be recognised as such and endowed with an international legal status'. Such non-state nations could even, Gottlieb suggests, be associated with a 'national home', which would sometimes stretch across state boundaries. An Irish national home, for instance, 'could provide a framework for a new all-Irish national authority, with authority over matters of common concern to the republic and to the Catholic inhabitants in the North who wish to be included', but 'would not affect the Protestant majority'. Security would remain a British responsibility, but 'it should be possible to construct arrangements to devolve jurisdiction over police matters, for example, to the local and sub-municipal levels'. That sounds uncomfortably like the 'no go' areas of the early 1970s. But Gottlieb, to do him justice, is not claiming to have found the solution to conflicts as bitter and complex as that in Northern Ireland. He merely suggests a general approach which might help solve such conflicts, if and when the parties are genuinely anxious to do so. The essence of this approach is that all power does not have to be vested in a single sovereign state. Power can be divided into functions and distributed among different authorities, with overlapping jurisdictions - as already happens in the domestic affairs of most states. Such ideas are valuable, but more likely to work before violence breaks out, or when there has already been a longish period of peace. The power of the gun is the least easy to share, and the scope for ingenious power-sharing arrangements is much reduced when people are genuinely in fear of their lives. All that matters then is Lenin's question, 'Who Whom?', or Humpty Dumpty's 'Who is to be master?'</p>

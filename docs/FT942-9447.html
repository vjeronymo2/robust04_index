			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Arts: The Kirov Opera - Opera The energy of the Kirov Opera under the artistic directorship of Valery Gergiev seems to know no bounds. Plans for the link-up with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra show it venturing beyond the concert performances of Russian operas that one thought to be its limit to Wagner, Mahler and Berlioz in 1995. This year the operas of Rimsky-Korsakov are the Kirov's focus of attention, although that does not mean any less effort and activity. In June the company has the 'White Nights' Festival in St Petersburg. In July it is visiting the Mikkeli Festival in Finland and Istanbul. By late autumn it has reached Paris, where the Theatre des Champs-Elysees is presenting four operas, including Rimsky-Korsakov's Sadko and The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh. Do Gergiev and his team never tire? Friday's concert at the Barbican offered a foretaste of Kitezh. This was the second in the RPO/Kirov series (following their success with Tchaikovsky's Iolanta) and suggested that Gergiev and the orchestra have formed a good working relationship. A suite from the opera featured some delicately atmospheric sonorities and playing so quiet that it could have been Simon Rattle holding the baton. Rumours of minimal rehearsal time were not obviously borne out. Just as one can expect fairies tripping through Mendelssohn's music, so Rimsky-Korsakov invariably wallows in the high romance of fairy-tale. Give him a stage direction that calls for a snowstorm swirling around a castle in a magic kingdom and Rimsky-Korsakov will respond with mysterious divided strings and harps sweeping up and down glissandos. That is the opening tableau of his one-act opera Kashchey the Immortal. Its story of a captive princess rescued from the clutches of an ogre with supernatural powers is typical Russian folk-tale, for which the composer mixed a blend of his usual luscious orchestral colours with a distinct Wagnerian tint (especially the Walkure storm). This was said to be the first UK performance of the opera and Gergiev made it a vivid one. Whenever singers from the Kirov appear, there is one who makes a big impact. This time it was Larissa Diadkova, who delivered the goods in no uncertain fashion as Kashcheyevna, the Kundry-like figure who lures knights to their doom on her enchanted island; her Slavic mezzo has a bite and force with which one would not like to argue. The soprano Marina Shaguch sang a nicely wicked Lullaby as the princess who wishes everlasting sleep upon her captor. Konstantin Pluzhnikov was the Mime-like Kashchey, supported by Alexander Gergalov and Vladimir Ognovenko, the baritone and firm bass. The London Choral Society doubled for the Kirov Chorus - an uneviable task. Sponsored by The Regent, London</p>

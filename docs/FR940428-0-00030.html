			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both the inbound and outbound lanes for vessels drawing 45 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; feet of water or less measure 0.75 nautical miles (1500 yards) in width as determined by multiplying the published standard error of LORAN&hyph;C (0.25 NM) by three. Because of the low-lying coast of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the lack of prominent landmarks, LORAN&hyph;C remains an acceptable aid to navigation for use in these inbound and outbound lanes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The deep water route, for vessels drawing over 45 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; of water, measures 1300 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; in width and has a charted natural depth of 50 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; or greater. As currently planned, the COE will construct the Atlantic Ocean Channel in this location when funds become available in both the Federal and Commonwealth of Virginia budgets. Due to uncertain economic conditions, a dredging completion date is unknown. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments and Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Six written comments were received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking. Five comments fully support establishment of the traffic separation scheme and the sixth comment offered editorial suggestions. Specific comments pertaining to other aspects of the proposal are discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) advised that due to budgetary consideration in the Commonwealth of Virginia, dredging of the Atlantic Ocean Channel would be rescheduled to an indefinite time in the future. The COE also pointed out an error in one of the geographical positions for the inbound traffic lane. This information has been corrected in the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment, which is not adopted in this final rule, suggested that the draft limitation for use of the deep-water route be changed to ``vessels drawing 45 feet or more'' while four comments agreed with the proposal to provide vessels drawing greater than 45 feet exclusive use of the deep-water route. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Five comments strongly objected to the proposal to recommend that all vessels carrying dangerous cargo and petroleum distillates as cargo use the deep-water route. IMO's Subcommittee on Safety of Navigation also objected to this provision and amended the U.S. proposal to exclude it from consideration and adoption by the Maritime Safety Committee. Based on the comments and IMO's action, this proposed recommendation is deleted from this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three comments objected to naval aircraft carriers using the deep-water route. In response to the notice of study, the U.S. Navy requested that it be allowed to use the deep-water route to ensure the continued safe, uneventful transit of aircraft carriers to and from sea. The Coast Guard and IMO agree that aircraft carrier usage of the deep-water route will enhance navigation safety and therefore will be permitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment suggested placement of a buoy near latitude 36 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;54.43 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; longitude 75 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;53.2 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;W to mark lesser water depths adjacent to the inbound traffic lane. The 1500-yard inbound lane, with the use of LORAN&hyph;C or radar, is sufficient to allow safe passage through the area without the placement of a buoy. Therefore, this comment is not adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three comments disagreed with the proposed recommendation that vessels announce their intentions to use the deep-water route. One comment objected to Channel 16 VHF&hyph;FM usage because of frequency congestion by other users. Two comments recommended that vessels call at least one hour prior to entering the deep-water route instead of at the time the vessel approaches Chesapeake Bay Southern Approach Lighted Whistle Buoy CB on the south end, or Chesapeake Bay Junction Lighted Buoy CBJ on the north end of the route, as proposed in the NPRM. The Coast Guard realizes that Channel 16 is crowded, however it is recognized as the distress, safety, and calling frequency in the United States and internationally as evidenced by IMO's adoption of this recommended practice. If the exchange of additional information is required, shifting to another VHF&hyph;FM channel would be appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other minor editorial and administrative changes have been made to improve the clarity of this part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and non-significant under the DOT regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). Vessels have been complying with the requirements of this rule since IMO implementation on November 16, 1991. No additional costs are associated with this final rule. The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are no additional costs associated with this final rule as vessels have been using the newly configured southern approach lanes since it was implemented by IMO on November 16, 1991. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Collection of Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The authority to establish TSSs and shipping safety fairways, where necessary, to provide safe across routes for vessels proceeding to or from U.S. ports is committed to the Coast Guard by Federal Statute. Therefore, the Coast Guard does not expect this rule to raise any preemption issues with respect to state actions on the same subject matter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard has determined that this action will not have a significant impact on the environment and that an environmental impact statement is not necessary. A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is on file in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Comments received as a result of the NPRM did not address any environmental concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

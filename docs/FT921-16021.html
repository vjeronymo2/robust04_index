			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: Telebras confident of 15% growth in profits - A stellar stock market performance by Brazil's state-run telecommunications company which is expected to be fully privatised by 1993 WHILE most Brazilian companies are saying their 1991 results will be the worst in at least a decade, Telebras, the 20 per cent state-owned telecommunications company, is forecasting a 15 per cent rise in net profits to over Dollars 700m. The company has emerged as the clear rising star of Brazil's stock market, where about 80 per cent of its shares are traded. Foreign interest in Telebras pushed stock prices up nearly 11 times in dollar terms in 1991. From 11th place at the beginning of last year, the company has become the largest publicly-traded group in the country, with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 46bn, compared with Dollars 15.4bn at the end of 1990. Telebras also chalked up a stellar performance in the international capital markets over the past few months, easily raising Dollars 300m in Eurobond issues. The group plans to capture another Dollars 1.3bn in 1992 in American Depository Receipts. Behind the phenomenal rise in Telebras' share price is the expectation that the group will be fully privatised by 1993. Chile, Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela have already privatised their telephone systems with notable success. Brazil's constitution currently prevents such a move, but that may soon change. Brazilian public opinion and 55 per cent of the country's congressmen are behind a sell-off. Investor confidence also reflects some more immediate changes. The company has begun to tackle some chronic problems. One is a nation-wide shortage of telephone lines. Anyone wanting to sign up for service has to purchase Dollars 2,000 to Dollars 3,000 of Telebras stock, and even then faces a two-year wait for installation. Black market telephone exchanges have sprung up in Brazilian cities, where buyers pay up to Dollars 10,000 for a telephone line. In 1991, Telebras inaugurated a record 400,000 lines and began to contract out installation to private companies. Mr Jose Ignacio Ferreira, Telebras president, said on completion of a new telephone system in Minas Gerais by private construction groups: 'We will not only tolerate private investment (in the sector), we want to attract it.' According to new telecommunications rules, the private groups install the telephone systems at the request of a region or neighbourhood then deliver the completed system to Telebras for operation. Mr Delson Siffert, a telecommunications consultant, said: 'The private sector should be able to cover a lot of the demand for new lines that Telebras cannot meet.' Private companies have installed major systems in several Brazilian states, and are also getting involved in the building of data transmission and mobile telephone networks around the country. New instalments still fall far short of demand. There is an estimated backlog of 6m lines in Brazil, and demand is expected to increase by 1m new lines a year for the next decade. With an investment budget of Dollars 3.9bn next year, however, compared with an annual budget of just Dollars 2.5m over the past few years, telephone installation will continue to accelerate. And with the network expanding rapidly, the company can look forward to surging revenues from telephone usage. The company has also made headway in dealing with another long-term problem  -low local telephone rates. International telephone calls from Brazil are among the most expensive in the world, and domestic long-distance calls are higher-priced than average, but much of the revenue from these services is used to subsidise local telephone usage. In 1989, real local telephone rates were just 20 per cent of the level they were at in the 1970s. Overall tariffs more than doubled in real terms in 1990 and 1991, and should continue to rise in 1992. Telebras has also managed to improve significantly the quality of its service. Two years ago, Brazilian callers failed to get a dial tone one out of every three times they picked up the telephone. That rate is now just one in seven. The company also managed to reduce its workforce from 93,000 to less than 90,000 over the past two years. There's still plenty of room for improvement. Despite the lay-offs, Telebras is still one of the least efficient companies in the industry with 99 employees per 10,000 access lines, compared with 88 in Mexico and 93 in Chile. Quality of service is still inferior to international standards. Local rates are too low and international rates too high, and the group still faces an acute shortage of telephone lines. But the fact that the company is heading in the right direction will probably assure profit growth for some time to come. And if Brazil follows the example of its neighbours in privatising the sector, Telebras could become one of the biggest success stories of Latin America.</p>

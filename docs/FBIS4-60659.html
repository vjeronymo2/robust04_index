			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] A responsible source in the Command of the Armed  Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] has condemned  the dangerous escalation in the war by the gang of the bloody  al-Ahmar clan in Sanaa which launched four missiles on the city  of Aden early this morning. The calm and peaceful inhabitants  of Aden were taken by surprise by these four missiles, at a time  when the adventurist gang in Sanaa is shouting about its wish to  bring about a solution by way of a cease-fire. This shows not  only the insincerity of this bloody gang, but also once again  confirms its insistence on persevering with the destructive war  against our people in the DRY and with the lack of care for the  innocent victims and other civil losses resulting from this war.    The responsible source in the DRY Armed Forces Command  confirmed that our ground defenses succeeded in shooting down  one of the missiles, while another fell into the sea without  causing any material damage (?or) [word indistinct].

			<p>BFN     [Text] Within the framework of his eagerness to continue  the close contacts between the government and the various  political, economic, professional, and media organizations,  Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali today met with the chief  editors and columnists of the daily newspapers. Al-Majali  frankly and clearly answered their questions on all issues and  events, including the blockade on al-'Aqabah port, relations  between Jordan and the PLO, the economic and financial  situation, unemployment, the media, and other issues of interest  to the country and the people.    At the beginning of the meeting, the prime minister welcomed  the media figures and expressed his happiness for such meetings  to discuss all important issues. These meetings are a framework  to build bridges of trust between the government and the press  and will eventually benefit the homeland.    The prime minister reviewed the issue of the blockade on  al-'Aqabah port and the efforts exerted by the Jordanian king,  government, and people on all levels to solve this problem as a  result of which Jordan suffered immense material losses which  reflected negatively on the performance of the Jordanian  economy. The prime minister noted that His Majesty King Husayn  clearly stated that the blockade and harassment of Jordan  contravenes its historic role to realize security, stability,  and progress in the region and to defend itself against anything  that infringes on its dignity and rights.    On Jordanian-PLO relations, the prime minister described the  Jordanian-Palestinian relationship as distinguished and  brotherly. He said that Jordan has supported and will always  support the Palestinian brothers until rights are restored on  the Palestinian territories. Al-Majali emphasized that  Jordanian-PLO ties must be based on the principle of  coordination.    The prime minister dealt in detail with Jerusalem and its  religious importance to both Christians and Muslims, stressing  that there can be no genuine peace without Jerusalem. He said  that His Majesty King Husayn reaffirmed that rule over Jerusalem  will be for God alone and that his majesty's call did not  materialize from a vacuum but was in answer to Israel's claims  of sovereignty over Jerusalem.</p>

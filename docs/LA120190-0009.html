			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH VISITS U.S. TROOPS  </P> <P> With reference to your editorial "Are Hostage Families Right to Go to Iraq?"  (Nov. 19), Hussein's "hostage-taking policy" may be "cruel," but who can deny  that it is far less cruel than the death and destruction that would result from  a U.S.-led attack?  </P> <P> To point out that Hussein's invitation -- why "ghoulish"? -- to hostage  families was made for its propaganda value is to state the blatantly obvious.  </P> <P> But so what? Estimates of casualties in the event of war only mentioned  Americans, as though the presumably far larger Iraqi casualties were not a  consideration. Sort of reminiscent of Vietnam where life was "cheap."  </P> <P> Under the circumstances, I would do exactly what Hussein is doing -- doing his  best to deter attack and thus to keep the peace. And I suspect that Bush, were  he in Hussein's shoes, would do the same.  </P> <P> My sentiments also extend to Iraq's announcement that it will release all  hostages starting Christmas Day (Nov. 19). If this constitutes "cynical  manipulation," so be it. Although release of the thousands of hostages would  remove "a possible justification for an American-led attack," it might just  have the opposite effect -- removing a crucial factor which deters an  American-led attack. In any event, you can't fault Hussein for believing that  such might be the case.  </P> <P> ROBERT W. HAYES  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Welt-Nachrichtendienst" report: "Jutta Limbach (SPD) To </F> Succeed Herzog"]    [Text] Berlin -- Former Berlin Justice Senator Jutta  Limbach, Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], is to succeed  Roman Herzog, Christian Democratic Union [CDU], and become the  first female president of the Federal Constitutional Court in  Karlsruhe. Mrs. Limbach has been chairwoman of the Second Panel  and vice president since March upon the proposal of the SPD.    One day after Herzog's election as the new president,  Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the CDU/Christian Social Union  [CSU] Bundestag group, stated in Berlin yesterday that it is a  "tested tradition" that the highest-ranking post of the supreme  German court is alternated among the parties.    The CDU then has the right to suggest a new constitutional  judge to replace Herzog. In Bonn, jurist and former FRG Defense  Minister Rupert Scholz was named as a potential candidate.</p>

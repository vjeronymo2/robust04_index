			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Arts: The doors widen on a Sussex idyll - With 50 per cent more seats. Antony Thorncroft finds the interior of the new Glyndebourne theatre rather like a cosy bear pit Sir George Christie, the chairman of Glyndebourne, has rarely been portrayed as Robin Hood, robbing the rich to help the poor. More often he is criticised for creating the most elitist opera festival in the land, a musical picnic for the privileged. Yet as Glyndebourne prepares to open its new auditorium on May 28 with a performance of Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro, the opera with which Sir George's father launched his private divertissement 60 years ago to the day, there is the will to widen the doors of this Sussex idyll. The increase in the size of the theatre, from 830 to 1200 seats, with room for another 42 standing, makes it possible for Glyndebourne to entertain more patrons. But it has also changed its pricing policy for the 1994 Festival to attract the less affluent. The top price seats now cost Pounds 100, as against Pounds 90 last year, but there will also be on offer seats at Pounds 30 and Pounds 15 in addition to Pounds 10 standing spaces. 'In the past' says Sir George, 'around 10-15 per cent of the capacity was left over after our members had been taken care of. Now I reckon over 20 per cent of the seats will go to the general public'. And, of course, there are more seats available. This switch has been paid for by the rich, especially Glyndebourne's 230 corporate members who each gave up to Pounds 150,000 towards the cost of the new auditorium to guarantee the privilege of buying seats. Sir George has always kept his distance from his corporate friends. They were essential to keep Glyndebourne, which receives no subsidy for its festival, alive. But he is sensitive to criticism that the performances are just an excuse for boardroom junketings. No company will be able to buy more than 120 tickets a season at the new Glyndebourne and while, in the past, up to 35 per cent of the audience might consist of corporate parties, in the future they will make up little more than a quarter. The other misconception about Glyndebourne is that its productions are light and frothy, Mozart between meals. It would be an odd festival without Mozart, and this year, as well as Figaro, there is Don Giovanni. But this is a new production, directed by the unstuffy Deborah Warner. There is also a new production of Tchaikovsky's Yevgeny Onyegin, and the other revivals are both 20th century operas, Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress and Britten's Peter Grimes. This is a good mix of the safe and challenging, designed to help raise the Pounds 1.5m still needed, but hardly classic pops. Glyndebourne's very real commitment to commissioning new opera, invariably box office suicide, comes in the autumn when it presents the premiere of Harrison Birtwistle's The Second Mrs Kong before taking it on tour, and into the 1995 Festival. But what of the new building? Is a trip to Glyndebourne still an event? The first sighting is worrying: it seems as if some giant metallic beetle has descended upon the familiar Elizabethan manor house. But Glyndebourne folk, the 6,000 members who get first bite at tickets, will soon have their doubts resolved. The fly tower, clad in grey lead and towering obtrusively over the sensibly traditional red brick of the auditorium, is the grit in the oyster. Glyndebourne remains as delightfully illusionary as ever. The Pounds 33.5m investment (only Pounds 500,000 over budget) pays off handsomely. The previous theatre was claustrophobic, uncomfortable and utilitarian. Its only appeal was its familiarity. The new theatre looks as if it has stepped out of a Scandinavian forest, gleaming 150 year old pine everywhere, set off with coverings of that unobtrusive slate grey. The interior may resemble countless modern concert halls, but its four tiers provide intimate contact with the action: the distance from the back wall to the stage has been shortened by three metres. It is rather like a cosy bear pit. The outside ambulatories offer sensible mingling space and give the air of a smallish Spanish bullring. The lawns, and most of the formal gardens, were spared the re-development. Already new courtyards have been planted with flowers in readiness for the summer. The aspects that have been lost are the irritating, (or charming), the inconvenient, (or quaint), those utilitarian nooks and crannies which physically linked the Christie's family home to the auditorium. Now the Christies are detached again. The atmosphere of Glyndebourne used to suggest Society crammed together for an exclusive ritual: now it is more like a civilised outing to the opera. Glyndebourne remains a small opera house and the repertoire, based on ensemble works, will not change. Still no Wagner and little Verdi. But general director Anthony Whitworth-Jones plans a five year cycle of more Handel, more Rossini, starting with productions by both composers never seen before in the UK. Many wondered why Sir George Christie put himself to so much hassle, so much expense when the old formula seemed to tick over quite nicely. He believed that Glyndebourne must change, and the longer the transformation was delayed, the more expensive it would become. His timing was impeccable: he raised most of the money before the recession and then built in a buyers market. The new auditorium, with 50 per cent more seats, enables Glyndebourne to go some way towards shedding its image of exclusivity. It has speeded up membership for a few of the 6,600 on the waiting list - although if you put your name down now, at a cost of Pounds 50, it could still be 30 years before you get in. It raises the revenue by around 30 per cent, an important factor when costs continue to rise and even Glyndebourne finds it hard to attract sponsors. There has also been a great improvement in back stage facilities for singers. But really Sir George need give no excuses for his actions. As he says: 'Glyndebourne is a private opera company. Nothing wrong with that.'</p>

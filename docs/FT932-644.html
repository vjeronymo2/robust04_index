			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Tory MP attacks clearing banks THE main clearing banks are a 'menace to their staff, their customers, their shareholders and the national economy' and should be broken up to provide finance for industry on a more intelligent basis, says Mr Alan Duncan, a Tory MP, Peter Marsh writes. In a paper for Demos, the independent research group, Mr Duncan, MP for Rutland and Melton, says the banks were responsible for much of the 'disastrous' boom and bust of the 1980s. But they 'appear to have learned nothing' from this experience. The banks are 'alienating' many of the small businesses on which much of the expected UK recovery depends by 'increased lending spreads, reduced overdraft facilities, higher transaction charges and demands for additional security as asset values decline'. Mr Duncan thinks banks would assess lending risks more intelligently if they were 'unbundled' into smaller regional units which were less bureaucratic and closer to their customers. An End to Illusions. Demos, 120 Wilton Rd, London SW1V 1GZ. Pounds 5.95.</p>

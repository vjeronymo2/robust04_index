			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: French companies hit by slowdown THE SLOWDOWN in the French economy affected a number of large industrial companies in the first half of 1992. The Suez industrial group, the Thomson-CSF electronics company and the Lafarge Coppee building materials group yesterday reported reduced interim sales. France is still in stronger shape than many of its European trading partners, notably the UK and Italy, but the economy has slowed over the past year reflecting the impact of high interest rates on industrial investment and consumer spending. The CAC 40 Index - down sharply this week - yesterday slipped by a further 0.44 per cent to close at 1,722. Suez, with extensive investments in French finance and industry, said sales fell from FFr97.16bn (Dollars 19.47bn) in the first half of 1991 to FFr87.16bn in the same period this year. The fall is partly due to Suez' ongoing disposal programme, but comparable sales sales fell by 0.6 per cent. Thomson-CSF, recently clouded by controversy over the government's plans to create a French electronics super-group, saw first-half sales slide from FFr16.5bn to FFr14.76bn. However, the company detected an improvement in trading during the second quarter. Other large French groups fared better. Elf-Aquitaine, the energy concern, mustered a 6.6 per cent increase in sales to FFr98.86bn in the first half. Michelin, the tyre maker which has been rationalising its interests to try to return to profit, also increased sales ahead of inflation with a 5.4 per cent rise to FFr34.8bn. In the financial sector, Credit Local de France, one of the larger banks, reported a 22.5 per cent rise in turnover to FFr20.87bn. Two of the biggest insurers, Assurances Generales de France and GAN, also announced sales increases of 10.4 per cent to FFr29.92bn and 12.3 per cent to FFr21.75bn respectively. By contrast, a series of lacklustre sales figures from the construction industry, illustrated the sluggishness of that area of the economy. Bouygues, the world's biggest building group, saw sales rise below inflation at 1.5 per cent to FFr30.43bn in the first half. Lafarge Coppee's interim turnover fell by 1 per cent to FFr15.06bn. Poliet, another leading player in construction, mustered a meagre 0.5 per cent sales rise to FFr9.91bn. Fougerolle reported a sharp increase in first-half turnover from FFr5.65bn to FFr19.24bn, but this increase was solely due to its takeover of SAE. On a comparable basis Fougerolle's interim sales fell from FFr19.55bn to FFr19.24bn. Meanwhile, one of France's most colourful corporate figures, Mr Bernard Tapie, reported a 14.7 per cent fall in first-half turnover from FFr6.63bn to FFr5.65bn for Bernard Tapie Finance. BTF has since sold almost all its businesses. Mr Tapie plans to use his FFr1bn profit from the sales to buy new businesses.</p>

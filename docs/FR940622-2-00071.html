Townsend, D.D.S.; Denial of Application</DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 12, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Linwood Thomas Townsend, D.D.S., Respondent, at 1285 N.E. 148th Street, North Miami, Florida. The Order to Show Cause proposed to deny his application for registration executed on November 8, 1991, and filed with the DEA pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The Order alleged that Respondent's registration with DEA would be inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent requested a hearing and the matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held in Miami, Florida on October 13, 1993. On January 18, 1994, Judge Tenney issued his Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommended Ruling. Neither party filed exceptions to the administrative law judge's opinion and recommended decision and, on February 18, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Acting Administrator. The Deputy Administrator has considered the record in its entirety and, pursuant to 21 CFR &sect;1316.67, hereby enters his final order in this matter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge found that in 1977 Respondent obtained a license to practice dentistry in Florida. On May 30, 1980, Respondent was issued DEA Registration, AT9228708. On November 17, 1980, Respondent was issued a second Certificate of Registration. On November 30, 1981, Respondent's DEA registration expired, and was never renewed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From November 1981 through November 1991, Respondent issued prescriptions for controlled substances with the expired registration number. A DEA Investigator conducted a survey of 11 pharmacies in the Miami area for prescriptions for controlled substances issued by the Respondent. The survey included prescriptions issued between January 1989 and November 1991. The Investigator recovered approximately 575 prescriptions for controlled substances issued by the Respondent during that period. Respondent did not possess a valid DEA registration during that time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the DEA administrative hearing, Respondent testified that he thought his registration was transferable and that at that time he did not know that he was doing anything wrong. Respondent further testified that once he became aware of the need for a new DEA registration, he immediately submitted an application to DEA. Additionally, the Respondent said that he had not prescribed controlled substances since that time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent also represented that during the period in question, he was employed by institutions which were part of the public health service, and was therefore exempt from DEA registration under 21 CFR &sect;1301.25. The administrative law judge found that Respondent's claim was without any factual foundation. The Deputy Administrator agrees. The term ``public health service'' as set forth in &sect;1301.25, refers to the United States Public Health Service. None of the institutions at which Respondent was employed was part of the Public Health Service as contemplated by &sect;1301.25. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge additionally found that on February 4, 1988, in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in Dade County, Florida, Respondent was convicted upon his plea of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> nolo contendere  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to filing false Medicaid claims. He was placed on eighteen months probation and ordered to pay restitution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, as a result of the conviction, on May 13, 1988, the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services terminated Respondent from further participation in the Florida Medicaid program. By letter dated June 24, 1988, the United States Department of Health and Human Services excluded Respondent from participation in the Medicare program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7(a), for a period of five years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge further found that on November 3, 1988, the Department of Professional Regulation, Board of Dentistry (Board), filed an 18 count administrative complaint against Respondent. The complaint alleged that from March 1985 to May 1987, Respondent billed the Florida Medicaid Department for services that he did not render and filed false documents pertaining to the billing of these services to patients. With the exception of two counts, Respondent did not dispute the allegations in the complaint. Consequently, on February 27, 1989, the Board entered its final order in which it adopted the allegations in the administrative complaint as findings of fact. The order placed Respondent's state dental license on suspension for three months, two months stayed. Following the suspension, Respondent's license was placed on five years probation and Respondent was ordered to take 24 hours of instruction in ethics and perform 500 hours of community service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board filed an administrative complaint and an amended administrative complaint against the Respondent on March 14, 1990 and December 19, 1990, respectively. The amended complaint alleged that the Respondent failed to meet the minimum standard of care in diagnosis and treatment of his patients and failed to keep records which justified his course of treatment. A stipulation entered into by the parties was approved and adopted by Final Order dated August 13, 1991. As part of the order, Respondent was required to pay $1,000 and his license to practice dentistry was placed on probation for two years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge further found that Respondent filed a DEA application for registration, dated November 8, 1991, and indicated that he never had a state professional license or controlled substance registration revoked, suspended, denied, restricted, or placed on probation. In fact, Respondent knew that his dental license had twice been disciplined and placed on suspension and probation by the Board. Since DEA must rely on the truthfulness of information supplied by applicants in registering them to handle controlled substances, falsification cannot be tolerated. Any material falsification of any application for registration is an independent statutory basis for the denial of an application. Herbert J. Robinson, M.D., 59 FR 6304 (1994); John W. Wang, M.D., 57 FR 47869 (1992); Ronald H. Futch, M.D., 53 FR 38990 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge recommended that the Administrator deny Respondent's application for registration at this time. The administrative law judge further found that the circumstances are sufficient to support a recommendation to the Administrator that an application be looked on favorably after the passage of one year. The Deputy Administrator adopts the findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended ruling of the administrative law judge in its entirety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), the Deputy Administrator may deny an application for DEA registration if he determines that the registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. Section 823(f) requires that the following factors be considered: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Appointments: People potential at Laura Ashley Jim Maxmin, the energetic American chief executive of Laura Ashley, is continuing to make rapid headway in reshaping the company's image. Yesterday he announced the appointment of Denise Lincoln, 40, as global human resources director with effect from February 3. She becomes the first woman since the late Laura Ashley to sit on the board of the fabrics and fashion group. About 80 per cent of the company's staff are female. Her brief will be to help co-ordinate company training initiatives in the 27 countries where Laura Ashley trades. Maxmin said: 'I think in today's world no company can realise its potential unless its people do. Education and personal development will become one of our competitive weapons for the future.' Resources permitting, Laura Ashley is planning to establish an international training centre at Carno, in Wales, where the company was founded. Lincoln is currently group management development director at Grand Metropolitan and has had previous management experience in the US.</p>

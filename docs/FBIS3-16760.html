			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Russian president's press service distributed a  report today that says, in particular:    On 18 March, a number of newspapers published an appeal by a  group of figures who announced the creation of an association  that will be called Accord for Russia. The appeal was signed by  a number of people known for the fact that, until recently, they  held an irreconcilable stance vis-a-vis the president and his  policies. The president's administration expects the new  association to make a specific contribution to the preparation  of an agreement on civil peace in Russia, and afterward, to its  practical implementation. It is on the basis of these deeds  that society will judge whether the intentions of the appeal's  authors are sincere, the press service report says.</p>

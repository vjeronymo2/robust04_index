			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 5 (BTA) -- The government today asked  the Constitutional Court to rule on its powers to sanction the  transit and temporary stay in Bulgaria of equipment of foreign  states, government spokesman Raycho Raykov told journalists.    The issue of foreign troops transit is regulated by the  Constitution which empowers the National Assembly to take the  respective decisions. However, the Constitution makes no  provisions about the transit of foreign military aircraft and  vessels. This is regulated by the Civil Aviation Act and the  Sea Space Act authorizing the Council of Ministers. However,  the government's decision to allow a UN convoy of equipment for  peacekeepers in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] this April provoked heated debates in  parliament and the MP's came out with a declaration saying that  only they could issue such permissions.    The Constitutional Court is expected to rule on this issue  within three months, the government spokesman said. The  government has assigned experts of the Ministry of the Interior,  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Defence Ministry and of the  Transport Ministry as well as of the Legal Department of the  Council of Ministers to draft within two weeks temporary  regulations for issuing such permissions until the passing of a  final legislative decision on this issue. There are eight notes  requesting transit permissions, the government spokesman said.</p>

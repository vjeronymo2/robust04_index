			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): UK base rate cut fails to lift continental bourses NEWS of a further cut in interest rates in the UK failed to enliven continental bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT traded quietly as options expired, the DAX index rising 8.18 to 1,461.61, up 1.5 per cent on the week. In carmakers, where downgradings have been rife recently, Daimler led with a DM5.50 gain at DM528 but BMW got more comment with a rise of DM4.50 to DM458.50 as BZW put the stock on its 'buy' recommendation list after four weeks of relative underperformance. RWE, in utilities, closed DM4 higher at DM383.50, helped by Thursday's DM1 rise in its dividend. But in engineers, where the industry association was gloomy in statements both on Thursday and yesterday, MAN dropped DM8 to DM250 after news of a big fall in its order book inflow. PARIS rose to the day's highs on the back of the UK rate cut but reports, quickly denied, that President Francois Mitterrand had been taken ill and a poor start on Wall Street took it to the day's lows just before the close. The CAC-40 finally ended up 14.16 at 1,664.18 after a high of 1,683.73 and a low of 1,650.64, in improved turnover of FFr1.9bn. Euro Disney fell another FFr4.70 or 6.3 per cent to FFr69.75 on selling by UK traders following a negative report in a UK newspaper and a statement from Euro Disney's chairman that remarks about help from Walt Disney had been taken out of context. Moulinex dropped another FFr9.35, or 10.4 per cent to FFr80.65 as analysts decided that the company's real first-half loss was nearer FFr50m than the FFr11m reported late on Thursday and reduced their earnings forecasts accordingly. Dealers reported heaving selling from UK fund managers who had large positions in the stock. STOCKHOLM eased in thin trading and the Affarsvarlden General index fell 0.7 to 661.6, down just under 2 per cent on the week, in turnover of SKr282m after SKr364m. B shares in Modo dropped SKr17 or 17 per cent to SKr83 after the forestry group revealed an eight-month pre-tax loss of SKr811m. Trelleborg's eight-month pre-tax profit fall of 98 per cent to SKr11m was in line with expectations, and the B shares eased SKr0.50 to SKr49. BRUSSELS was supported by interest rate-sensitive shares but Petrofina weighed heavily on the market. Petrofina dropped as low as BFr7,470 on a series of negative news reports before closing down BFr130 at BFr7,600. The Bel20 index rose 2.66 to 1,094.45, little changed on the week. ZURICH was prepared to go higher but a weaker Wall Street opening brought the SMI index off its highs to close up 5.5 at 1,883.5, a fraction better on the week. MADRID's rise on the day, 2.78 to 193.96 in the general index, restored what it had lost earlier in the week. AMSTERDAM ended mixed in thin trading, as selling from the options market and Wall Street pulled some share prices down. The CBS Tendency index fell 0.6 to 105.5, down 2.1 per cent on the week. HELSINKI bought on the bad news, and on lower domestic interest rates, the Hex index rising 11.4 to 622.1, up 2.3 per cent on the week. The banks and finance index was up 6.4 per cent on the day after several banks reported large interim losses on Thursday. VIENNA's ATX index gained 3.31 to 783.01, up less than 1 per cent on the week. The expiry of October futures and options contracts enlivened the market.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- October 16                                       THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes            Open       11.30       12.00       13.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      994.01     995.35      996.51      995.82 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1066.47    1068.72     1067.37     1070.21  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Oct 15      Oct 14      Oct 13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100           986.39      992.09      999.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200          1061.28     1074.77     1085.38  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            14.00      15.00       16.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      995.82     994.96      996.07      996.54 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1067.61    1065.75     1066.34     1066.23  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Oct 12         Oct 9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100               984.55         987.08 FT-SE Eurotrack 200              1069.79        1070.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 997.59 ; 200 - 1071.31 Low/day: 100 - 992.79  200 - 1063.25  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Fnac Credit Lyonnais is grappling with some gargantuan challenges. But the bank still has time for the lesser things in life as its recent attempts to reclaim Mr Bernard Tapie's antique furniture show. The mooted sale of its 65 per cent holding in the books and records retailer, Fnac, could provide a more conventional means of raising some much-needed cash in a hurry. But the likely FFr2bn proceeds will not make much of a dent in its debt. Fnac has had a chequered history of ownership which has hindered its progress. It has also suffered in recession from fierce competition from Virgin and the hypermarket chains. Fnac's trading history has been undistinguished; its net margin remains less than 2 per cent. But that owes much to the costs of its uneven opening programme. The retailer certainly has its attractions as a seller of intellectual software in the dawning multi-media age. The application of committed management should enable Fnac to push volumes higher in a recovering economy and widen margins, too. Fnac could easily be embraced by the rapidly-expanding Pinault-Printemps-Redoute retailing empire. But it is not necessarily a done deal given that Generale des Eaux has pre-emption rights. Bertlesmann and Kingfisher have been rumoured to be interested and may be tempted to offer more. At a third of sales, the implied FFr3bn valuation for the whole of Fnac does not seem excessive.</p>

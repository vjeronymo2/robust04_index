			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Rao wins confidence vote comfortably INDIA'S prime minister PV Narasimha Rao reinforced his political authority yesterday when he comfortably survived what amounted to a parliamentary vote of no confidence in his government. His success removed the threat of a snap election which had surfaced at the end of last week as the Congress government and opposition prepared for confrontation. Winding up the debate yesterday, Mr Rao spoke of the 'tense situation' created by the opposition's combining forces to challenge the government on inflation and unemployment. He said he had not expected the government's majority to be tested when India was so vulnerable to its international creditors, and when it had been seeking to build a consensus over economic policy. 'This situation has been forced on the government. I did not think it would happen,' he declared. In crucial amendments to a motion of thanks on the president's address to parliament inaugurating the present budget session, the government won by 262 votes to 210. Many opposition members, including Mr Chandra Shekhar, the former prime minister who had said he would vote against the government, stayed away rather than cast a vote that could have precipitated an election. The challenge to the Congress government emerged when all the opposition parties, including the Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Janata Dal, and the left, decided to join forces to condemn the government. Until now the Congress party, just short of a majority in parliament, has survived by creating issue-related majorities. In diverting the attack, Mr Rao has shown his growing strength. He used the vote to rally his party, a reluctant supporter of the shift to more market-oriented policies, and humiliate his opponents. His strength derives from the belief that in a snap election the Congress party could well obtain an absolute majority. The opposition's fear of a Congress victory caused them to back away from bringing down the government.</p>

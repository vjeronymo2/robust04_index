USABC will invest a  total of $33 million over the next two years in the thin-film  lithium polymer battery.    Hydro-Quebec has concluded a contract with Yuasa Corporation  for the joint development of a next-generation thin-film lithium  battery. The potential has emerged of Yuasa joining indirectly  in USABC's development project.    Under the contract, 3M will provide thin-film lithium  polymer  to Hydro-Quebec, which will then laminate the film and make the  final product--the lithium battery. Argonne National Laboratory  will handle performance testing of the prototype battery.    Lithium batteries have energy density nearly three times  higher than the lead batteries presently used in electric  vehicles, but there are safety problems. Safety is said to  increase when the batteries are made thin-film ones.    In the United States, California, New York, and other states  are requiring that 2 percent of all automobiles sold by each car  company, beginning with the 1998 model year, be electric  vehicles. Yuasa reached an agreement with Hydro-Quebec in  January 1992 to develop jointly by 1998 a lithium polymer  battery.</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / UK plans to open market for international telecoms THE government is close to licensing a new type of international telecommunications operator which it hopes will undercut prices being charged on international calls by BT and Mercury Communications. The new operator could lease cable and satellite capacity in bulk from BT - previously British Telecom - and Mercury, and sell usage of it to customers. For example, an operator could lease circuits between London and New York, and use these to provide a cut-price phone service. Ministers are unlikely to allow new operators to build and own international networks. Sprint, the US telecommunications group, has already applied for a licence. The moves follow last year's telecommunications white paper which opened the door to domestic network competition but was vague on international communications, where BT and Mercury earn their highest rates of profitability. The paper said that resale would be allowed on international routes where the country at the other end had an equivalently open telecommunications market. No country has yet been considered to be sufficiently liberal. The Department of Trade and Industry now believes that several countries - including the US, Japan, Canada, Australia, Sweden and New Zealand - are likely to pass this test. Mr John Redwood, the telecommunications minister, has held meetings with US authorities to try to open up the market. A statement from the US Federal Communications Commission last month supporting further liberalisation of the US market is viewed as important by the UK but full clarification is being sought before resale to the US goes ahead. The government believes the international network is the part of the market where prices are most out of line with costs. Observers argue that, although resale will exert some downward pressure on prices, the full benefits will only come from network competition. But the government is concerned that a unilateral opening of the UK market could put British companies at a disadvantage unless foreign markets were also opened up. It also fears that foreign telephone companies could abuse their power in overseas markets to distort competition in the UK, if they were granted international licences. Ministers would have had to address similar concerns if American Telephone and Telegraph, the largest US telecommunications operator, were to take a stake in Mercury. The government would consider using its 'golden' share in Cable and Wireless, Mercury's parent, to ensure that any tie-up did not lead to a distortion of the market.

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / China to cut 8m bureaucratic jobs CHINA plans to cut staff in its vast bureaucracy and among bloated industrial enterprises by more than 8m, or 25 per cent of the total. It is also overhauling its entire bureaucratic structure, abolishing a number of ministries, bureaux and departments and creating new institutions to replace them. If Beijing presses ahead with staff cuts and alterations to ministries - previous grandiose plans for bureaucratic reform have foundered - it would amount to the most sweeping reorganisation of the state sector since the early years of the People's Republic. Ministers have also pledged to increase wages of state employees, partly to stem an alarming exodus of some of the government's more talented people to the private sector. The government's timetable for these changes has not been spelled out. Western officials note that Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's supreme leader, called for wholesale bureaucratic reform in 1979, but progress has been extremely slow because of resistance from entrenched interests. But the recent explosion in the Chinese economy - economic growth last year was close to 13 per cent - had strengthened arguments for accelerated reform of China's sprawling state sector. One official said that, while scepticism was in order about China's likely success in 'downsizing' its giant bureaucracy, 'what's going on here is not smoke and mirrors.' Perhaps the most important aim of the restructuring, apart from reducing numbers, was to strengthen policy-making departments at the centre, while hiving off sections of the bureaucracy engaged in commercial activities into decentralised corporations. Sketchy details of the government's plans to slash staff were disclosed at a Beijing press conference this week by Mr Zhan Dongwan, the minister of personnel, who outlined cuts of more than 25 per cent to state industrial enterprises, and 20 per cent to party and government agencies. He said government staff totalled 34m. Party employees and bureaucrats number 9.2m. The plans are being debated at the current session of the National People's Congress, or parliament. A number of deputies have opposed the changes. Mr Zhan pledged that the 'mass lay-offs' would not spawn unemployment. Redundant staff would find work in other areas such as the service sector, or would 'return to the grass roots.' Others would be retrained. The retirement age would be strictly enforced. 'Government organisations at all levels are overstaffed which runs counter to our market economy,' he declared. Among changes proposed to the ministerial structure are abolition of seven ministries: Energy, Machine Building and Electronics Industries, Aviation and Space Industries, Light Industry, Textile Industry and Commerce and Supplies. In their place the government is proposing five new ministries.</p>

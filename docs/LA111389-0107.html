			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HIGH COURT LETS DETROIT PAPERS JOIN  </P> <P> An evenly divided Supreme Court today upheld the planned partial merger of  Detroit's two daily newspapers.  </P> <P> The justices, by a 4-4 vote, affirmed a ruling that former Atty. Gen. Edwin  Meese III acted reasonably last year when he approved a joint operating  agreement for the two papers, the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News.  </P> <P> The federal Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 authorizes the attorney general  to give financially failing newspapers an exemption from federal antitrust  laws. Today's ruling was the court's first on a joint operating agreement  between newspapers.  </P> <P> The partial merger had been challenged by a group of Michigan advertisers and  readers.  </P> <P> Under the 100-year agreement, the two newspapers would combine their business,  advertising and production departments but maintain separate news and editorial  staffs.  </P> <P> The News would receive 55% of the merged company's profits during the first  year but that percentage would drop to 50% by the seventh year. Thereafter, the  profits would be evenly divided.  </P> <P> Today's 4-4 vote, which under the high court's rules automatically upheld a  federal appeals court decision, was set up when Justice Byron R. White  disqualified himself from the case for unexplained "personal reasons."  </P> <P> A split vote by the justices sets no binding precedent for similar  controversies in the future, mainly because there is no clue as to the  reasoning of any justice.  </P> <P> Today's ruling was announced in a one-sentence decision that did not divulge  which justices voted to allow the partial merger and which voted against it.  </P> <P> The Detroit News is owned by Gannett Co. Inc., the nation's largest newspaper  publishing group. The Free Press is owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., the second  largest. The organizations proposed the partial merger in 1986.  </P> <P> Opponents of the deal, calling themselves Michigan Citizens for an Independent  Press, contend that the Free Press is not a failing newspaper even though it  lost $10 million between 1981 and 1986.  </P> <P> The opponents say the Free Press and the News, which lost $50 million in the  same period, were unprofitable solely because both papers cut prices in an  unsuccessful effort to force each other out of business.  </P></p>

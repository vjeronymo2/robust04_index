			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Courtaulds rises Chemicals group Courtaulds benefited from a market reappraisal as one analyst saw it as a switch opportunity. Smith New Court has put flesh on the bones of its recent forecast upgrades with a piece of research pointing out the extent of the global recovery within the industry. Analyst Mr Charles Lambert said: 'We think the stock looks temporarily oversold and we would see a 10 per cent upside. It is a buy on its own merits but BOC looks well up with events, and investors who do not want to commit further funds to the sector might want to switch.' The shares ended 12 up at 497p and BOC eased 3 to 702p. BZW, the investment bank, was largely responsible for the strong outperformance of the merchant banks against the market, telling its clients that the sector had been oversold. Hambros and Kleinwort Benson were the two best individual performers, the latter closing 8 higher at 442p, after 447p, and the former 5 better at 276p, after 283p. BZW said Hambros was substantially oversold, underperforming by 13 per cent over one month and 25 per cent over the past quarter. The investment bank also pointed out that Hambros traded at a 10 per cent discount to its 300p a share asset valuation, and offered an attractive yield of 7.5 per cent and price/ earnings ratio of 9 times. Kleinwort, BZW said, offered good dividend cover and looked cheap on a price/earnings basis. SG Warburg, whose shares have been unsettled by Enterprise Oil's failure in its attempt to takeover Lasmo - Warburg advised Enterprise - edged up to 699p early in the session but later slipped back to close only a penny ahead at 694p. The insurance sectors burst into life, with Commercial Union following Monday's 11 gain with a rise of 18 to 536p amid strong suggestions that it is about to withdraw from or reduce the terms of its acquisition of Groupe Victoire, the French insurance group, from Compagnie de Suez, Victoire's parent. Dealers also said that there had been a split order in CU shares yesterday, which had pushed the stock price sharply higher. Elsewhere in composites, Sun Alliance held up well, closing only a penny off at 306p, with stories still circulating that a bid in the sector may not be too far away. HSBC eased 5 to 689p, with the market beginning to focus on the possibility that the bank could be lining up a sizeable overseas acquisition. There have been strong rumours that HSBC has taken a hard look at ANZ Bank. Another story suggested that HSBC was considering taking a sizeable stake in Nedcor, the South African bank. RMC was again the pacemaker in a building sector continuing to respond to Monday's good news from the Builders Merchants Federation. The stock was also given a strong push by James Capel, the leading UK agency broker, which increased its earnings forecast. For the current year Capel is going for Pounds 235m, up from Pounds 208m, and for 1995 for Pounds 275m, against Pounds 245m. RMC shares closed 15 higher at 878p. Builders merchants were featured by Meyer International, up 13 at 417p, after 419p, with BZW recommending the stock. CAMAS, the construction materials business demerged from English China Clays on June 1, rose 5 to 77p, helped by a broker's recommendation. Brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle was buffeted by differing opinions following Monday's figures. Two UK houses were advising clients to sell and one US investment bank was advising a switch into Bass, which rose 6 to 520p. Meanwhile, one of the City's leading securities houses took the opportunity to pick up 400,000 'special ex' shares for its own pension fund, and the support for a thinly traded stock saw Scottish rebound from its low of 492p to close 2 off at 499p. Unilever added 3 at 971p as one of its subsidiaries announced a disposal and SGST reiterated its long term buy stance. A stock overhang weakened several motor dealers. Cowie relinquished 10 to 249p, while Lex Service eased 8 to 421p. A squeeze boosted engineering group GKN, leaving the shares 5 ahead at 571p. A clutch of broker's recommendations helped components group T&amp;N gain 7 at 231p. News that GEC has reopened talks on buying Thorn EMI's defence businesses boosted trading in both stocks. GEC, which reports figures tomorrow, closed 3 ahead at 294p, while Thorn put on 2 to 1001p after trade of 1.2m. The honour of being the day's best performing stock in the FT-SE 100 went to British Airways, whose shares jumped 12 to 392p on volume of 6.6m, after it released better than anticipated traffic figures for the month of June.

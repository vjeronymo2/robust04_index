			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina April 18 (A.A.) --  Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on Monday said  that his country has been betrayed by the United Nations, adding  there is nothing to be done "as they (United Nations) do not  want to do anything. The West is afraid of Russia."    Silajdzic said the problem lies in the fear of the West of  Russia which wants a "greater fascist Serbia."    He said NATO can do whatever the United Nations wants, but  the United Nations is not doing anything.    "It is a vicious circle," Silajdzic said. "A scenario to  kill  Gorazde and give it to the Serbs."    Silajdzic said Bosnia is alone against the world, but  expressed belief Turkey is doing its best, adding he is  constantly in contact with President Suleyman Demirel and  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin.    On the latest developments in Gorazde, he said he contacted  the town half an hour ago and that the West has shown the green  light to kill the city and its inhabitants.    "It is proof that the West will not do anything to help and  will not lift the arms embargo," he said.    He said according to latest information from Gorazde, Serbs  are burning everything in the town and there is a massacre going  on.    Silajdzic also said that the Serbs want to take the  defenseless city after forcing UN observers and any other UN  officials out of Gorazde.</p>

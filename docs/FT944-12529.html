			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Heron's creditors stifle a yawn - Christopher Price finds financial interests have overcome apathy Boredom has been among the biggest problems faced by the corporate financiers trying to stitch together the offer for Heron, which was published yesterday after five months of careful negotiations. 'Heron has been through so many crises, restructurings and meetings over the past three years that everyone involved is frankly bored to death with it,' said one banker close to the negotiations. 'They just want the situation over with.' Not that any apathy over the proceedings interfered too greatly with the various parties' financial interests. Heron creditors are split into two basic groups. First, there are those who were the subject of yesterday's offer from HNV Acquisition - namely creditor banks, numbering around 30, several thousand bondholders and other shareholders of Heron Group. These are owed a total of Pounds 374m. The second group comprises creditors of Heron's subsidiaries, who are owed around Pounds 220m. HNV's bankers have secured the agreement of this group to the Heron restructuring, provided the main Heron creditors accept the offer on the table. This group is divided into UK and Spanish property interests. There are about 35 creditors to the UK side, owed in the region of Pounds 120m. The 18 creditors to the Spanish interests are owed the balance. The UK creditors to the subsidiaries were the easier of the two to bring on board, according to sources close to the negotiations - partly because their loans are secured on a strong portfolio of properties, and also because several bankers belonged to both sets of creditor groups. The offer document puts pro forma net assets for the UK business at Pounds 202m. However, the net asset figure for the Spanish side only reaches positive territory after an agreed injection of some Pounds 17m from HNV on completion of the deal. Negotiations on this part of the deal were politely described as 'strenuous' by one of the bankers present: 'The Spanish were worried that they might lose money on this. There was some tough talking.' That done, the deal must now be sold to the bankers, bondholders and shareholders of the parent company, some of whom face a second dilution of their investments in just over a year. Under a Pounds 1.3bn refinancing agreed in September 1993, the banks and bondholders had their debt converted into senior and junior debt. The senior bank debt is about Pounds 120m, while the senior bond debt amounts to Pounds 180m. There is also some Pounds 74m of junior debt. HNV is offering Pounds 450 in cash or 300 HNV shares for every Pounds 1,000 of senior bonds, Pounds 60 or 40 shares for every Pounds 1,000 of junior bonds and Pounds 7.50 or five shares for every 1,000 common shares. HNV says it is 'optimistic' partly because the banks concerned have been aware for some months of the terms proposed. A steering committee of the frontline lenders has been authorising Heron's banking facilities. It has also had access to the main details of the offer since the first document was published five weeks ago. The attitude of the bondholders is less predictable. It was their decision last April - insisting that Heron make a payment previously defaulted on - that precipitated the failure of the refinancing and the company being put up for sale. 'We will definitely be analysing this document and letting bondholders know exactly what they are getting out of this offer,' said Mr Gary Klesch, managing director of Klesch &amp; Co, an investment group. 'It still doesn't look very attractive to us.' However, there are signs here too of weary investors wanting it all to come to some sort of conclusion. 'Heron has been leaking so much money in fees while all this has been going on I'll be glad to get anything out of it,' said one bondholder yesterday. Privately both Heron and HNV are hoping, in the absence of more positive approval, that the apathy factor will play an important part in gaining approval.                        *      *      *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             PLIGHT OF HERON  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- August 1991: Gerald Ronson, founder, jailed for six months and fined Pounds 5m for his part in the Guinness fraud trial.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- October 1991: Bonds, which Heron issued extensively, reach trading lows in Zurich.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- January 1992: Ronson admits losing some Pounds 200m on US property market in past four years.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- March 1992: Debts reach Pounds 1.4bn on net assets of Pounds 585m.

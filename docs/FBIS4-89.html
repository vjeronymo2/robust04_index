			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President F.W. de Klerk at the Union </F> Buildings in Pretoria -- live]    [Excerpts] Good morning from my side, too, ladies and  gentlemen. My sincere apologies for having kept you so long.  Part of the delay was caused by the fact that meetings in which  I was involved took somewhat longer than expected, and,  secondly, I then felt it correct to communicate the announcement  which I am going to make to Chief Minister Buthelezi as well as  Mr. Mandela and we had some trouble in tracing one of them  before I could have the telephone discussion which I have just  had. I will read, firstly in English and then in Afrikaans, a  very short statement, and thereafter I will, off the cuff, add a  number of remarks.    After being briefed by the intelligence establishment and  security advisers I am of the opinion that circumstances have  arisen within the province of Natal, including the  self-governing area of KwaZulu, situated in the province of  Natal, which seriously threaten the safety of the public and the  maintenance of public order, and that the ordinary law of the  land is inadequate to enable the government to ensure the safety  of the public and to maintain public order. I have, therefore,  decided to declare, in terms of the Public Safety Act of 1953, a  state of emergency in the area mentioned. There are, however,  certain aspects regarding the emergency regulation that have to  be negotiated with the Transitional Executive Council and the  Sub-Council of Law and Order, Safety and Stability, in terms of  the act governing those institutions.    As soon as the regulations are finalized the necessary  proclamations will be published in the gazette. The state of  emergency shall come into operation as soon as the said  proclamations are published. I have reason to believe that that  will still be today, unless some unforeseen hitches occur.  [passage omitted on de Klerk repeating announcement in Afrikaans]    Now ladies and gentlemen, a lot of perceptions have already  been created with regard to the decision which I have this  morning only taken. Until 0930 this morning there was not a  decision by me, and it is only me, as head of government and  head of state who can declare a state of emergency. There was  no decision to do so. We were looking at all options. Our  looking at this possibility was not initiated by any outside  source, any other party or any other institution. More than a  week ago, some of you who were present at the press conference  will recall that I was asked, specifically: Are we considering  it. And I already then emphasized that, yes, we were looking at  all options on a continuous basis and that one of the options  would be a state of emergency, that we would like to avoid that  if at all possible, but that we would be continuing to look at  all options in the light of the serious situation in  KwaZulu-Natal.    We were, therefore, involved in a process and the first  perception that I would like to deal with is the perception that  I am now doing this because I was asked or ordered or requested  to do so by anybody or by any institution. The decision is not  at the behest of any party. It is not at the behest of the TEC  [Transitional Executive Council]. It is my decision based on  the advise and the analysis of the government intelligence  services and advisers in the security field and it is taken  within the framework of the law. The second perception that I  would like to deal with, which I have seen strongly reflected  this morning in the newspapers, it is to a certain extent  reflected in some statements, inter alia, of the DP [Democratic  Party], is that this is now a first step aimed at actions  against the kwaZulu government or aimed at the destabilization  of the kwaZulu government. This decision has nothing to do with  any such goal.    I am on record, and I want to repeat it again, that the  kwaZulu government has been lawfully elected and that in terms  of other legislation I will only make inroads on their authority  in terms of that legislation if, firstly, there is  maladministration and I have no evidence of anything like that.  Secondly, if that government does not cooperate in making free  and fair elections possible, and they have given and they are  giving their full cooperation, so this is not aimed at the  kwaZulu government. It is not aimed at the position of the  chief minister. It is not aimed to have any effect on the  position of the king. In fact, it will help to protect the  kwaZulu government against any threats, against any efforts from  whatever source, to destabilize their position as a lawfully  elected constitutional authority. Simultaneously, it is not  aimed at any other party or particular institution. The state  of emergency will be managed and implemented even-handed. It is  aimed at stabilization of the whole area, which specifically  includes the maintenance and the restoration of law and order,  which specifically includes the protection of life and property  of all the people. Actions in terms of the state of emergency  will be taken against anybody, irrespective of which party it  belongs to, irrespective of which party it supports, anybody  involved in any actions which constitute a threat to the  security of that area, of the people living in that area, which  constitutes threats of violence or involvement in violence, or  the instigation of violence -- those are the aims. We do not  have a political aim with this in any way, whatsoever.    It will also be aimed at ensuring that the election will  take  place. Political action will, therefore, in terms of the  regulations, be permitted but in such a manner that it will not  lead to conflict. The question might arise: Is free... [pauses]  a free and fair election compatible with the state of emergency,  and the answer is yes, because free political activity will be  allowed. Meetings as a right can be held. Notice will,  however, be required in terms of the draft regulation which I  have seen, notice so that the security forces can take the  necessary precautions to effectively protect that meeting and  ensure that it takes place. The state of emergency, I would  like to add, is also being declared in interaction with the TEC,  in terms of the legal prescriptions in that regard. It will  also enable the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] to be free to  continue democratic and peaceful opposition to the election, to  hold their meetings and to do their political thing to ensure  that they have the opportunity to convince people in terms of  their policy and their policy goals, not to come and vote. I  would like, therefore, to underline, even-handed, not aimed at  any party -- aimed at stabilization, aimed at safeguarding of  all interests, aimed at ensuring that the election will take  place -- the search for political solutions to the underlying  problems must continue.    It is crucially important that my scheduled meeting with the  king, the chief minister, and Mr. Mandela should continue, and I  sincerely hope that none of the parties involved will use this  decision which has no political basis, to stand away from that  meeting. It is fundamentally necessary in the interests of all  the people of this country, and specifically, of all the people  in kwaZulu-Natal, that that meeting should take place. I want  to reiterate, my commitment to the constitutional accommodation  of the position of the king of the Zulus. That is what we must  solve. It is one of the underlying problems, and I am positive  that dignified and full recognition should be given to the  traditional position of the king of the Zulus with regard to his  nation. Included in the search for political solutions lies the  necessity to address in the negotiations and at this forthcoming  meeting, the problem of Zulu self-determination and of  self-determination in general. I continue to remain committed  to participation of all major parties in the constitutional  process, and it must be promoted, and there is no connection  between this decision and the necessity for continued  discussions and negotiations aimed at reaching the accommodation  of those who are deeply concerned in a meaningful manner,  reaching agreements which can be implemented also after the  election, so as to ensure long term peace and stability to all  people. I believe that this decision actually creates the  opportunity for solutions to be found for the underlying  problems, and will hopefully bring about the type of atmosphere  which will be conducive for free and fair elections as well as  the type of atmosphere which is needed for political leaders to,  through negotiation, solve outstanding problems.    [Unidentified moderator] We have a link-up with Cape Town.  We'll take some questions from Pretoria, then we'll cross to  Cape Town. Linda van Tilburg?    [SABC correspondent van Tilburg] Mr. de Klerk, could we ask  you: What was Dr. Buthelezi's reaction when you informed him  about this and did he in any way indicate that it could  jeopardize (?the process)?    [De Klerk] I do not plan to in any way, whatsoever, to try  and relate what they said to me. I felt it was necessary that I  inform them and no doubt, having been informed they will react  and I leave it to them to formulate their reactions.    [Moderator] Enoch Sithole?    [Sithole] Mr. President, what is the position with the  kwaZulu Police, obviously they should be expected to apply the  state of emergency regulations? Did you get from Chief  Buthelezi an indication that he is going to get them to observe  those regulations, and if they don't, what is your next move?    [De Klerk] The management on the ground of a state of  emergency is a matter which will be in the hands of the security  forces, the South African Police. The South African Defense  Force will play a strong role, particularly in specific parts.  There will be deployment on an incremental basis from day to  day now of fairly large numbers of South African Defense Force  members and the arrangements of interaction with the kwaZulu  Police is best left in the hands of those who will be in charge  of the South African Defense Force side, and, where applicable,  the South African Police. I did not discuss this particular  aspect in detail or in any way really with the chief minister.  We had a short discussion, but can I say it really goes without  saying that cooperation will be sought and I'm sure will be  achieved, because surely the goal of the kwaZulu Police is also  to maintain law and order and to ensure stability and to protect  the life and property of people.    [Announcer] You have been listening to the state president,  Mr. F. W. de Klerk, speaking at a special news conference at the  Union Buildings in Pretoria.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Trouble in store for nuclear waste processor: The debate over BNFL's Pounds 2.8bn Thorp plant BRITISH Nuclear Fuel's unpublished report to the government claims that up to Pounds 200m a year of overseas revenues would be lost in the next 10 years if its Pounds 2.8bn Thorp plant were abandoned, with a total cost to the UK of more than Pounds 900m. The quarter-mile plant at Sellafield in Cumbria, which has taken nearly 10 years to build and is ready to start operation, is designed to reprocess 'spent' or used fuel from nuclear reactors in the UK and overseas into reusable plutonium and uranium, with a smaller amount of waste. Since the plant received the go-ahead from the 1977 Windscale inquiry, the environmental, economic and political arguments for reprocessing have changed, leading to fierce debate about whether Thorp should start operation. Without Thorp, state-owned BNFL has little long-term future. It has been anxious to argue in recent months that cancellation would also be a loss. Its claims are based on a complex model commissioned from consultants Touche Ross, which weighs up Thorp's costs in the first decade of operation against loss of revenue and extra expense if Thorp were abandoned. According to the model - which BNFL has refused to publish on grounds of customer confidentiality but which has been seen by the Financial Times - cancellation would cost the UK nearly Pounds 2bn in lost overseas income over the next 13 years. BNFL has said customers have signed contracts worth Pounds 9bn, but according to the model those in the the first decade are worth only Pounds 6bn. Of that, foreign customers represent some Pounds 4bn, mainly Japanese and German, but also Switzerland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, and Canada. They have paid about Pounds 2bn in advance, which BNFL has spent on building Thorp. The model has no provision for repaying that money if Thorp were cancelled. The model also estimates that if customers pull out or reduced shipments they would have to compensate BNFL fully. Environmentalists suggested recently that the Germans and Japanese are less committed to reprocessing than in the past - a claim BNFL rejects. A second politically controversial point, should Thorp be cancelled, is the fate of the several thousand tonnes of fuel from overseas customers stored at Sellafield. Thorp's critics have argued that the countries may be unwilling to have it returned. The report assumes that the costs of storing it would be Pounds 15m a year for most of the next decade. The costs of transporting it back would be millions of pounds a year more. The model shows that if the plant were cancelled, the UK would save - it estimates that Thorp's operating costs will range from Pounds 120m to Pounds 170m a year in 1993 prices over the next decade, comprising the wages of the 1,200 staff, energy for heating, and acid needed to fill pipes. The UK would save the costs of eventually decommissioning the plant, which becomes radioactive as soon as it starts operating. In its audited accounts, BNFL puts the decommissioning costs of the central Thorp plant at Pounds 750m. The model says Pounds 70m of that has already been incurred because 4,000 tonnes of fuel from customers has contaminated the storage ponds. Economists and environmentalists yesterday attacked many of the assumptions behind the Touche Ross conclusion of an overall Pounds 900m loss to the UK. They argued the figure would be lower if: Decommissioning costs rose. Some operating costs rose. Customer contracts for the first decade are believed to allow BNFL to pass on increases, but in some cases customers might challenge that, for example where costs have been caused by delay in starting Thorp. Foreign customers pulled out or reduced shipments and challenged their obligation to repay BNFL in the courts. Storage costs for unprocessed fuel proved cheaper than BNFL's assumptions. A higher discount rate than the model's 8 per cent was used to reflect higher risk. A figure of around 8 per cent is standard in Treasury models of state-owned companies, but lower than rates typically used in commercial projections. Mr Willian Walker, of the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University, said: 'Touche Ross seem to have assumed either that Thorp starts and runs at full capacity or it doesn't start. But I believe that if it goes ahead it could prove very difficult to send plutonium and waste back to overseas customers for political reasons, and Thorp would have to keep storing it - who knows what those costs would be?' He added: 'The decommissioning costs, and the costs of the ultimate storage of reprocessed waste are drawn from the air - no one knows with any precision'. Letters, Page 16</p>

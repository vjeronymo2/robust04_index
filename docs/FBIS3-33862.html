During this  session, amendments and supplements to the revenue section of  the budget bill, proposed by the Majles deputies and  commissions, were raised and some of the proposals were approved.    According to a report of the Central News Unit, the session  approved the ceiling for oil revenue income to $10,721,300,000,  equivalent to 17.652 trillion rials. [passage omitted]    In order to realize the income from the envisioned figures  of  taxation, direct tax exemption of state companies announced in  the years 1372 and 1373, except in certain instances, is no  longer valid.    The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is permitted to tax  the manufacturing units which fail to provide sports and  cultural facilities within their workshops for the employees.  The tax charge will be 12,000 rials per employee per year. All  the state companies affiliated to various foundations are also  dutybound to allocate at least two percent of their profit  before tax, from last year, to provision of teaching and  training centers and university grants for the children of their  employees.    The country's municipalities are dutybound to allocate two  percent of their income before tax for the year 1373 to  provision of teaching and training centres and university grants  for the children of their employees.    The Ministry of Education and Training is permitted to sell  all or parts of its lands, administrative premises or teaching  buildings at the market price; and deposit the income from the  sale to the Treasury account.    Our correspondent reports that according to one of the  sections on income in the ninth note of the national budget  bill, the law enforcement forces will be allowed to receive and  transfer to government purse up to 10 billion rials from the  sale of movable and immovable property.    They are also allowed to receive and transfer up to 15,000  rials from every vehicle through the program for the change of  vehicle number plates.    The law enforcement forces are allowed to issue vehicle  inspection documents and to receive and transfer to government  purse a minimum of 500 rials and a maximum of 3,000 rials for  each vehicle.    The customs office is also responsible to levy a 5 rial tax  on every imported cigarette and 200 rials on every kilo of  pistachio export.    The study of the budget bill will continue in today's third  open session which will start at 1900.</p>

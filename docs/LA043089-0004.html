			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> "The Wonder Years" is a wonderful program. I hope ABC does not discontinue it.  When the network advertised the premiere of "Have Faith," I was afraid it was  scheduled to replace "The Wonder Years." Fortunately, it did not. That was when  I decided to write. I don't want to feel guilty for not telling someone that  the high quality of "The Wonder Years" is appreciated.  </P> <P> Raymond M. Ingels, Monterey Park  </P></p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Political Notebook: The National Insurance fiction THE DEBATE about the welfare state will not go away. What started as a Treasury exercise to regain a grip on public spending after the excesses of the late 1980s and the recession of the early 1990s has become entwined inextricably in the internal politics of Mr John Major's government. No matter that the ambitious social engineering envisaged by one or two in the cabinet is regarded by most of their colleagues as wistful rhetoric - witness the latest furore over single mothers. Nor that more sober analyses about the future costs of welfare provision, such as this week's report from the Rowntree Foundation, invariably undercut the gloomy demographic projections of Treasury pessimists. Unemployment, not an ageing population, is the principal enemy of prudent control of welfare spending. But the government has more narrow perspectives. There is the pressing need to justify the harsh measures to contain public spending over the next few years. Whatever the prospects in 2020, the present Pounds 80bn social security budget is pre-empting what limited scope there is for higher spending elsewhere. Then there is Mr Major's search for a patch of political ground on which the still-disgruntled right of his party can stand. For those who have not forgiven him for deriding the 'golden age that never was' a debate on the role of the state has become the acid test of his commitment to reconciliation. So Mr Michael Portillo, the guardian both of the Treasury's purse strings and of the Thatcherite inheritance, is set free each week to ponder publicly about rolling back the frontiers of the state. During his latest appearance he worried aloud about the 'massive' amount of Britain's income being taken in taxation and spent by the government. By pre-empting 45 per cent of national income the state was threatening to strangle the wealth creation process and undermine fatally Britain's competitiveness. There were dangerous social consequences. An ingrained assumption that the state would provide was undermining the essential Conservative concepts of individual responsibility and self-reliance. There was no mention, of course, that this dire state of affairs followed 14 years of Tory government. Mr Portillo is as adept as any at drawing lines under the awkwardness of the past. Mr Portillo takes as an example the basic pension. Instead of paying into the National Insurance Fund and expecting a state pension on retirement, he suggests, people should use the money instead to buy their own insurance for old age. At first sight it seems an entirely reasonable proposition. No-one would be worse off as most people would simply collect their pension from an insurance company. A safety net system, of course, would remain in place for the disadvantaged. But then comes the political roadblock that even the bold Mr Portillo is not prepared to confront. His argument is built on the flimsy fiction that the National Insurance Fund is what it pretends to be - a fund. It is no such thing. The Pounds 38bn a year paid in National Insurance contributions by the present generation of employers and employees is not salted away to meet future liabilities. It is used to pay the benefits owed to a past generation. But to admit the fiction would be politically explosive. The price would be public acknowledgement that contributions are indistinguishable from income tax and that the basic rate of income tax is 34 per cent not 25 per cent - and that from next April it will rise to 35 per cent. Mr Portillo sidesteps the resultant flaw in his argument. The present generation of contributors could not replace their present National Insurance payments with private provision without impoverishing today's elderly. The chief secretary is instead asking the under-40s to continue paying the fund's past liabilities while foregoing any future benefits. Perhaps Mr Portillo believes that is unavoidable. The Treasury has been seeking anyway to undercut by stealth the contributory principle. Industrial disablement and death payments have been quietly dropped from the list of contributory benefits. The Treasury would like to do the same with sick pay, sickness benefit and invalidity benefit. Other universal benefits have long been outside the National Insurance net so are exempted from the constraints imposed by the contributory fiction. But Mr Portillo has stressed he wants an open debate encompassing all benefits. Fair enough, as long as he recognises he will only get one if the government owns up about National Insurance contributions.</p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Dartmoor inmates redecorating old phone boxes for charity Prisoners at Dartmoor are repairing and painting eight old telephone boxes to be auctioned for charity on September 1. The boxes, donated by British Telecommunications, date from the 1920s and 1930s and are expected to raise more than Pounds 1,000 each for the Prince's Youth Business Trust and local community work. Each will have a Dartmoor Prison brass plaque. There have already been a number of inquiries about the boxes, including some from Japan and the US. A local auctioneer will conduct the sale in the prison building. An earlier plan to stage the auction in the prison chapel had to be abandoned because of fears that the floor would collapse.</p>

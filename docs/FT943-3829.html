			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Tokyo Japan Telecom's listing last week has left many investors wary of next month's Japan Tobacco flotation, writes Emiko Terazono. Although the listing is still six weeks away, domestic institutions are expected to start hedging their positions by selling futures which is likely to prompt arbitrage unwinding, depressing cash share prices. Meanwhile, profit-taking by banks and corporations, wanting to boost profits ahead of the interim book closing at the end of the month, is likely to continue. Analysts say banks are especially reliant on profits from their stock holdings this time round since the recent fall in the bond market has constrained them from realising profits on bond portfolios.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TANKER OVERTURNS; TRAFFIC JAMS TIE UP SANTA CLARITA  </P> <P> Traffic was gridlocked for much of the day Saturday over a wide area of the  Santa Clarita Valley after a tanker truck carrying 8,000 gallons of pressurized  gasoline overturned on an on-ramp to the Antelope Valley Freeway.  </P> <P> A three-mile stretch of the freeway and sections of Sierra Highway and San  Fernando Road were closed for hours Saturday afternoon and evening after  officials, attempting to pump fuel from the downed tanker, discovered that it  was leaking.  </P> <P> The truck driver was unhurt, and no injuries were reported. But the Antelope  Valley and Golden State freeways were backed up for miles and traffic was at a  virtual standstill on numerous surface streets as vehicles detoured from the  Antelope Valley Freeway after the early afternoon closures.  </P> <P> "It's got to be the first time that a whole city of 140,000 people has been  closed down by a SigAlert," said Carl Boyer, a Santa Clarita city councilman,  who said traffic was stopped on streets near his home five miles from the  accident scene.  </P> <P> "All I can say is, thank goodness it's Saturday," he said.  </P> <P> The wreck finally was cleared and the roads reopened about 8:45 p.m., according  to the California Highway Patrol.  </P> <P> After the leaking fuel was discovered and strong gas fumes filled the air,  officials drew up a standby evacuation plan for a 1/4-mile area around the  wreck but did not implement it. Although the area is sparsely populated,  officials estimated that about 1,500 people live or work at businesses within  the evacuation zone.  </P> <P> The tanker overturned just after 7 a.m. on the San Fernando Road on-ramp to the  southbound Antelope Valley Freeway. Emergency crews erected a dike around the  tanker, but the leakage was not detected until about 1 p.m. as fuel was being  pumped to a second truck.  </P> <P> Vacuum trucks were called in to suck fuel from the pavement and to unload  remaining fuel from the tanker.  </P> <P> After 7 p.m., when as much gas had been removed from the tanker as could be  suctioned out, crews began using giant air bags and tow trucks to right the  tanker, while laying down fire-retardant foam.  </P> <P> The accident mobilized the state Department of Transportation, the CHP, the  county Department of Health Services and sheriff's officers, along with  hazardous-materials specialists, fire engines, a foam truck and about 70  firefighters.  </P> <P> An official with Hurt's Transportation, owner of the truck, blamed the accident  on driver error. Bud Kenneally, a vice president of the firm, said the driver,  Allen LeCain, 23, of Bakersfield, turned too wide on the on-ramp and struck the  curb with the left front of the truck, which overturned when he turned back too  sharply to the right.  </P></p>

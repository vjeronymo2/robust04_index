			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / BSkyB setback over pirate cards British Sky Broadcasting has suffered a serious setback in its efforts to prevent the distribution in Ireland and Continental Europe of pirated 'smart cards', which threaten to undermine the company's principal source of income. The High Court in Dublin yesterday rejected a claim by BSkyB for a temporary restraining order, pending trial, against Mr David Lyons, the managing director of Satellite Decoding Systems. Mr Lyons is distributing the cards from Birr, County Offaly. Mr Lyons' smart cards can break the VideoCrypt code used to scramble the satellite TV channels broadcast by BSkyB. BSkyB - in which Pearson the owner of the Financial Times has a substantial stake - claims that its code has been copied by Mr Lyons, infringing its rights under copyright law. The rejection was made because BSkyB had failed to produce sufficient evidence that there was an infringement of copyright. Mr Lyons says the microchips, software and algorithms - which give command instructions to the software in the chip - in his cards are different from those used by BSkyB. He had offered to have an independent arbitrator examine both types of card. BSkyB declined the offer. Mr Justice Flood said: 'The results of a (computer) programme must not be confused with copyright. The fruits of a programme are not direct evidence of any similarity (between programmes).' The judge ordered costs to be awarded to Mr Lyons. He also ordered the return of several hundred cards seized by BSkyB under an earlier court order. Mr Lyons said he might reconsider a voluntary undertaking, made to BSkyB last October, not to distribute his cards in the UK. The sale of subscriptions, for which BSkyB issues cards, forms 80 per cent of its income.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A U.S. Air Force plane carrying forensic experts, medical equipment and nine  coffins arrived in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to retrieve the bodies of Rep. Mickey  Leland (D-Tex.) and eight other Americans killed in an Aug. 7 plane crash. An  American official said it would probably take several days to identify the  remains, which were recovered Tuesday from the crash site in rough terrain in  western Ethiopia. Leland and the others were en route to visit a refugee camp  when their twin-engine plane crashed in poor weather. Seven Ethiopians also  were killed.  </P></p>

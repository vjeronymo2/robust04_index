			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE STAFF'S EARLY FUMBLES MAY BRING QUICK SHAKE-UP  </P> <P> That's John H. Sununu, the new White House chief of staff, coming down the  slopes on a late winter day in the mountains of New Hampshire, looking a little  like a friendly, bundled-up pear on skis. He pulls to a neat stop in front of a  waiting television camera crew to take questions about that weekend's charity  ski event.  </P> <P> But the reporter wants to know about a much less pleasant topic -- the failing  nomination of John Tower to be secretary of defense. In a minute and a huff,  Sununu skis away from the interview -- only to tumble into the snow 10 feet  away from the rolling camera. Wipeout.  </P> <P> Now, three weeks later, there is mounting concern that Sununu and his staff are  crashing into snowbanks of a different kind as they try to guide President Bush  through the political gates of the Washington slalom.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Criticism of Three Areas  </P> <P> In at least three crucial areas -- the personnel shop, the office directing  Bush's relations with Congress and the team responsible for communicating  Bush's message to the public -- the staff already has come under sharp  criticism.  </P> <P> "There has got to be some sort of shake-up," said one senior Administration  official who asked not to be named.  </P> <P> And one senior White House official, while acknowledging no major problems,  suggested that changes eventually may be made. "We went into this knowing that  at some point we might want to bring in a few (new) people," he said.  </P> <P> Bush's staff members and other supporters -- more than a dozen of whom were  interviewed for this report -- unanimously believe that the President and his  aides have ample time to recover.  </P> <P> "They've had a couple of stumbles," said one close adviser to the President,  speaking, like many others, on condition that he not be identified. "But  whatever mistakes might have been made will be corrected. It's a learning curve  for them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agreement Marks Progress  </P> <P> As one sign of progress, after weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations led by  Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Bush announced Friday an agreement with  congressional Democrats over renewed non-military aid for Nicaragua's Contra  rebels.  </P> <P> However, complained one former campaign aide as he reviewed the roster of  generally young and inexperienced White House staff members: "They've taken a  bunch of grade B ballplayers, and they've taken them to the World Series. They  have no long-ball hitter."  </P> <P> Staff shortcomings share the blame for a variety of problems that President  Bush has encountered in his first two months in office.  </P> <P> Most notable was the failure to mobilize quickly enough to save the Tower  nomination in the Senate. When Bush visited Asia at the height of the  confirmation battle, none of the most senior staff remained in Washington to  carry the President's message to Congress.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Upsetting'  </P> <P> One long-time Bush supporter, pointing in particular to the handling of the  Tower nomination, said: "George Bush's Administration is not going to rise or  fall over what goes on these first few weeks, but it is symptomatic. It's a  very upsetting thing."  </P> <P> Likewise, the Administration initially fumbled when the savings and loan crisis  landed at the White House like a greased watermelon in the opening days of the  Administration. When one of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's initial  plans -- a tax on savings and checking accounts -- bombed politically, Sununu  chose initially not to repudiate it but to say that it remained under study.  </P> <P> There are signs that the White House staff is beginning to react more sharply  to problems. A senior aide to a Cabinet member said that although the staff  members were late in focusing on the Eastern Airlines strike, "when they did,  they were ready to go."  </P> <P> More broadly, observers of the White House staff are quick to criticize what  they perceive as its failure to help Bush communicate a vision of what he wants  to do as President.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Calls Staff Ineffective  </P> <P> "The White House staff is inexperienced, remarkably ineffective in focusing  Bush, in setting an agenda that can be communicated easily to the American  public and the world," said a Republican who is well-placed to assess the  President's aides.  </P> <P> "There has been a sense of miscalculating, a lack of accurate information, an  inability to look forward, an inability to strategize on the mix of issues and  an inability to get Bush to play offense on the issues."  </P> <P> Sununu, at a recent weekend conference of senior Bush advisers and Republican  legislators in Charlottesville, Va., was asked about the President's agenda,  according to one person who was there.  </P> <P> "That's what we're here to find out," Sununu reportedly responded. "What do you  think it ought to be?"  </P> <P> Another Republican, whose job as a lobbyist puts him in contact with key  figures throughout Washington, complained that no one is overseeing the effort  to convey the President's message to the American public.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wants Efforts Concentrated  </P> <P> "That is the job that should shepherd the resources of the presidency and  marshal them on one, two, three or four big things until they are  accomplished," said this Bush ally. Instead, "they are doing 48 things and all  of them badly."  </P> <P> Reagan, said Michael K. Deaver, a former close aide, "had broad themes. He  didn't want to get stuck in the minutiae of how it happened. A lot of what  George Bush has to do is refine and clean up and extend what happened (under  Reagan). He might be the best guy to do that because he understands" how the  government works.  </P> <P> When Reagan assumed the presidency in 1981, he had the advantage of succeeding  a Democrat. And, for his staff, he had his pick of Republicans eager to press  ahead with his conservative agenda.  </P> <P> Bush, by contrast, has moved to the White House at a time when ideological  fervor has subsided. Consequently, said a former Reagan White House aide who  was closely involved in the Bush transition, the appeal of working in the White  House has ebbed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Begins With Roosevelt  </P> <P> The broad structure of the current White House staff dates back to the 1939  reorganization of the office of the presidency, which gave Franklin D.  Roosevelt six top-ranking assistants and about a dozen other aides.  </P> <P> Back then, in the words of Samuel Kernell, a UC San Diego political scientist  who specializes in the staffing of the presidency, the White House staff was  seen as "insignificant go-fers," described by the wheelchair-bound Roosevelt as  "my legs."  </P> <P> Now the White House staff numbers more than 300, with about 15 top-ranking  presidential assistants. "They have enormous power," Kernell said. "The  President needs them to make decisions for him. Otherwise, he gets  overwhelmed."  </P> <P> Bush, according to a senior adviser, made it clear that he wanted a Cabinet  stronger than his White House aides. He did not want the White House staff to  dictate policy to the departments.  </P> <P> "There are not a lot of heavy hitters over there" at the White House, this  adviser said when the President took office. "That's the way Bush wants it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sununu Says He's Satisfied  </P> <P> Sununu expresses nothing but satisfaction with the team assembled beneath him.  </P> <P> "I think things are going well," he said in an interview in his White House  office, just a few paces from the Oval Office. "I'm very happy with the staff.  They have brought the talent and the commitment and the energy I have  expected."  </P> <P> Others in the West Wing speak the same sentiments but with less assurance. "I  actually think it's going OK," said one senior Bush aide. He added, almost  apologetically: "I may be in a minority on that."  </P> <P> Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor who managed Bush's presidential  campaign during last year's crucial primary there, has a reputation as a  short-tempered autocrat. According to the well-placed Republican source, Sununu  is still learning that while "the governor is king" in New Hampshire, "here you  have the total opposite, especially in the fishbowl of the White House."  </P> <P> Sununu has become, in Kernell's words, "an easy target." But he has quickly  earned the loyalty of his staff and is given credit for using a puckish sense  of humor to "keep people from taking themselves too seriously," said one senior  aide.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Considered Smart Politician  </P> <P> Even his critics agree that he is a smart politician who is likely, one said,  to "get his act together eventually."  </P> <P> Regardless of how effective it has been, the White House staff clearly reflects  Bush's activist presidential style, said Thomas C. Griscom, a director of  communications in the Reagan White House who now teaches at the University of  Tennessee at Chattanooga.  </P> <P> "The White House staff isn't going to be the dominant player" that it was  during Reagan's eight-year tenure, Griscom said. "It will be a supporting  player. That works as long as there are no snafus."  </P> <P> "You've got to give the President and the President's team a chance to  function," he said. "The team right now is like a brand new car. You're still  kicking the tires. The tests are yet to happen."  </P> <P> Staff writers David Lauter and Cathleen Decker contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The First Floor at The White House  </P> <P> 1.

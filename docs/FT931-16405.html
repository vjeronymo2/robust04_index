			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / The Braer Disaster: Engine failure still a mystery SHIPPING industry experts were reaching a preliminary conclusion yesterday that the Braer suffered from a combination of mechanical failures and plain bad luck before it struck the rocks at Garths Ness. Mr Michael Hudner, chief executive of Bergvall &amp; Hudner Ship Management, operators of the tanker, said last night that a tug was ordered up to assist the stricken vessel at 5.19am, two hours before the first one subsequently set out after receiving clearance from the coastguard in the interim. There still should have been sufficient time for the ship to have been saved, but when the tug Star Sirius arrived, the crew had all been winched off, leaving no one aboard to fix a tow line. B&amp;H said the Braer's crew had been urged by a rescue helicopter to leave the ship. The captain chose to be winched off about half an hour before the Star Sirius arrived. Shipping industry experts defended the captain's decision to take the tanker through the 22-mile channel between Shetland and Fair Isle. Mr Michael Grey of Lloyd's List said: 'The ship would have been far more exposed had it sailed north around the island.' Mr Grey was uncertain as to exactly how the ship could have taken water into its fuel system so comprehensively that the engine failed and could not be revived. He said the severity of the Braer's trouble suggested that water had entered the engine itself. There are precedents for such an event, although rarely with such catastrophic consequences. Mr Grey speculated that water might have entered through a ruptured vent to one of the fuel tanks or at the time the fuel was taken on board. 'Fuel contamination is actually quite common, but what isn't common is that it leads to a ship being disabled for long enough for a ship to get washed up on the rocks,' he said. Fuel is drawn from settling tanks sited within the main tanks. Ordinarily - to give time for impurities to settle - one tank is drawn down while the other is refilled. In an emergency, it would be possible to take fuel from the other settling tank or even from one of the main bunkers, Mr Alec Bilney, a marine adviser at the International Chamber of Shipping said. Ships' diesel engines work like those for road vehicles in that, if the fuel supply runs dry, their feeder systems need to be bled or evacuated before they can be restarted. 'Don't forget they were working under extreme conditions,' Mr Bilney said. 'It was force 11, with very low manning levels that all ships have. 'They were working in this cathedral of an engine room with the whole ship lurching violently. The fact is that they kept on struggling for two or three hours. I have enormous respect for them.'</p>

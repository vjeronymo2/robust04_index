			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRUNK-DRIVER PUSH CITED AS O.C. TRAFFIC DEATHS DIP  </P> <P> Orange County had only one traffic death during the five-day Christmas weekend,  and law officials are crediting the stepped-up effort to arrest drunk drivers  as a major reason for the decline in holiday fatalities.  </P> <P> Other county officials said anti-drug and alcoholism programs that help people  recognize the danger of driving under the influence have had an effect.  </P> <P> "People don't want to go to jail," said Bill Edelman, manager of drug programs  for the county Health Care Agency. "I think people are beginning to look at the  consequences of getting into a car and driving under the influence of any  substance. Law enforcement efforts, especially sobriety checkpoints, have had  an impact."  </P> <P> Some jurisdictions, such as the California Highway Patrol, reported higher  numbers of drunk-driving arrests compared to last year. Other departments  reported a decrease, which they said may reflect more caution on the part of  drivers. Officials said these two trends are not contradictory -- fewer drunk  drivers are on the highways but concentrated efforts, such as those of the CHP,  sometimes result in a higher number of arrests.  </P> <P> Virtually all agreed that getting drunk and drug-influenced drivers off the  highway was a key to the county's relatively safe Christmas.  </P> <P> The Christmas holiday death toll was lower than it has been for the past five  years, according to the Orange County coroner's office. The county had four  highway traffic deaths during Christmas 1986, five in 1987, seven in 1988 and  five in 1989, the coroner reported.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, during the five-day Christmas weekend this year, 404 people were  arrested on drunk-driving charges in Orange County. The CHP arrested 152 of the  total, and the remaining arrests were by all other police jurisdictions in the  county. The CHP said its drunk-driving arrests in the county this year were up  36% compared to last year.  </P> <P> Lt. Richard J. Olson, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department,  said comparison data is not available for all other police jurisdictions  because he began assembling holiday drunk-driving arrest statistics this year  for the first time. Olson, however, said he thinks the number of drunk-driving  arrests is up this year compared to other Christmas holidays.  </P> <P> The sole traffic fatality between 6 p.m. Friday and 12:01 a.m. Wednesday was  the death of a 19-year-old Fountain Valley man at 5:30 a.m. Saturday on the San  Diego Freeway at the Magnolia Street on-ramp. Deputy Coroner William King said  the youth, Major J. Johnson, lost control of the car and crashed into a call  box. King said there was no indication that the accident was alcohol- or  drug-related.  </P> <P> Arresting alcohol-impaired drivers has been easier for police this Christmas  season. A new state law that became effective Jan. 1 lowered the legal  blood-alcohol level from the 0.10 to 0.08.  </P> <P> Some cities, including Fullerton, reported that increased efforts to halt drunk  drivers had led to higher arrest totals this year. Lt. Bud Lathrop said  Fullerton had 534 driving-under-the-influence arrests in 1989 and has made 619  such arrests so far this year.  </P> <P> But in Garden Grove, police reported that a sobriety checkpoint on Saturday  night stopped about 1,100 cars and did not find a single drunk driver.  </P> <P> Garden Grove Traffic Officer Fred McLean said the absence of drunk drivers at  the checkpoint indicated that people are being more cautious about drinking.  "It seems that if there's a lot of publicity that there's going to be a  checkpoint, more people are using designated drivers," he said.  </P> <P> In Huntington Beach, police arrested 11 suspected drunk driver during the  five-day holiday. Lt. Ed McErlain said he had no number for comparison purposes  but believes that the number of arrests is low compared to other years. He too  said this is a sign that fewer drunks are behind the wheel.  </P> <P> "We like to think that our enforcement, combined with education efforts, are  working," McErlain said.  </P> <P> "The thing you like is never getting (drunk-driving accidents) to begin with,"  added Sgt. Richard S. Zschoche of the Anaheim Police Traffic Bureau. "You're  looking for the deterrent factor."  </P> <P> Anaheim was among Orange County cities that stepped up roving police patrols  looking for inebriated drivers during the holidays. "We started this on  Thanksgiving . . . and will continue right through New Year's," Zschoche said.  </P> <P> The county's hundreds of Alcoholics Anonymous chapters aided the efforts to  keep drunk drivers off the streets by holding more meetings than during  non-holiday weeks. Some AA groups held what they called "marathon," or  round-the-clock, meetings so that people with alcohol problems had a place to  go regardless of the time of day.  </P> <P> Ron LaPorte, manager of alcoholism programs for the county's Health Care  Agency, said Wednesday that he feels certain that education and prevention  efforts are now paying off.  </P> <P> "I absolutely believe that we are having an impact," LaPorte said. "I also  believe that attitudes and social norms about drinking are changing. It's not  considered cool or a lot of fun now to get drunk during the holidays. And  people are being made aware of the consequences, such as getting arrested.  People are starting to think a little bit differently about intoxicants and  celebrations."  </P> <P> Edelman, manager of the Health Care Agency's drug programs, agreed that  education efforts are helping keep "high" drivers off the road. "I think we're  beginning to turn the tide and reach young people," he said.  </P> <P> Some cab companies reported Wednesday that they are taking part in a holiday  program to keep drunk drivers off the street. Bill Craig, manager of Coast  Yellow Cab, said that at participating taverns and restaurants, the bartenders  worried about a patron's ability will hand out a coupon good for a free cab  ride within a 20-mile radius. Craig said his company has been getting up to 50  such calls a day since Friday, when this year's holiday program began.  </P> <P> Edelman said the change in societal views about alcohol and drugs and the  diverse efforts to prevent impaired drivers are now bearing fruit in Orange  County.  </P> <P> "I do believe it's beginning to pay off," he said. "I think we're beginning to  see things turn around."  </P></p>

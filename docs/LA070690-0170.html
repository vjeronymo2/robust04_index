			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD CUP FINAL;  </P> <P> TEAM FACTORS THAT MAY MAKE THE DIFFERENCE  </P> <P> The teams are the same, yet vastly different, as Argentina and West Germany  settle the World Cup on Sunday.  </P> <P> Argentina won the cup in 1986 against West Germany, runner-up in the last two  world soccer championships. The coaches are the same: Franz Beckenbauer in his  last game as boss of the Germans, and Carlos Bilardo.  </P> <P> Some of the stars of four years ago remain, most notably Diego Maradona and  Jorge Burruchaga for Argentina, and Lothar Matthaeus, Rudi Voeller and Thomas  Berthold for West Germany.  </P> <P> The similarities, however, are overwhelmed by the contrasts. Such as the  Germans having the easier time getting to the final this year, and the  Argentines relying more on guile and luck than anything to get there.  </P> <P> In 1986, it was the exact opposite -- Argentina was expected to make the  championship game, West Germany was a bit of a surprise and not particularly  impressive in getting there.  </P> <P> This time, it is West Germany that has the powerhouse offense and Argentina  that needs to counterattack.  </P> <P> In Mexico, both teams used different goalkeepers. Harald Schumacher was kicked  off the West German team after a drug scandal, and Bodo Illgner took over in  1987. Argentina's Nery Pumpido came to Italy as the No. 1 goalie, then broke  his leg in the second game. His replacement, Sergio Goycoechea, has improved  with each outing.  </P> <P> For Argentina to spring an upset, Maradona must play at the level he reached in  1986. So far, he has been hobbled by a sore ankle, thwarted by tight defense --  with as many as two men shadowing him -- and repeatedly fouled.  </P> <P> "Watching Diego play on one leg has been an inspiration to all of us," said  Claudio Caniggia, the team's best scorer who is suspended for the final.  "Diego's leadership is more important than his goals."  </P> <P> Not only will Caniggia be suspended, but three other players won't be available  for Argentina -- defender Julio Olarticoechea and midfielders Sergio Batista  and Ricardo Giusti. That hurts Argentina's defense most and that is no way to  go into a match with West Germany.  </P> <P> The Germans have two major concerns in their third straight final, a record.  First, they have come up short in such situations before, and, should they  struggle, will the doubts begin to rise up again? Secondly, did they peak too  soon?  </P> <P> Beckenbauer's team surged through the first round, had little trouble with  strong Dutch and Czechoslovak teams in the next two rounds, then struggled  mightily against England. Sure, the Germans won the shoot-out, but they  sputtered in the semifinal and that's no way to approach the championship game.  </P> <P> Argentina played by far its best game in beating Italy in another shoot-out.  Both teams should approach the final with confidence, but Argentina's is  soaring and West Germany's a little shakier.  </P> <P> Prediction: Logic says West Germany. But logic has taken a holiday for most of  this tournament.  </P> <P> Argentina 2, West Germany 1.  </P></p>

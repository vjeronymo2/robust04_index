			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Finns set date for referendum on EU entry Finland yesterday decided to hold its referendum on European Union membership on October 16, making it the first of the three Nordic applicants to hold a vote on the issue. Sweden holds its referendum on November 13 and Norway on November 28. The east-west voting sequence is seen as the best way of getting all three countries into the EU because support for membership is strongest in Finland and weakest in Norway. Public opinion in both Sweden and Norway remains against membership, although polls show the 'yes' vote increasing if neighbours vote in favour. The three Nordic states and Austria are aiming to join the union next January. The choice of October 16 represents a setback for Mr Esko Aho, Finland's prime minister, who had wanted the referendum to be on the same day as Sweden's. But he was opposed by President Martti Ahtisaari and the Conservative party, the second largest in the coalition government. They both wanted September or early October. Mr Aho's Centre party is split over Europe as much of its support comes from the farming community; agriculture has become the main issue in the debate because farmers face overnight adjustment to EU price levels. The government yesterday tried to soften the blow by announcing a support package for the farming and food processing industries.</p>

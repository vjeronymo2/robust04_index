			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Campbell Soup plans large post-tax item CAMPBELL Soup, the US food group, has warned that its 1993 earnings would include significant after-tax charges to reflect new accounting standards. The company, which reports its fiscal year-end results in September, said it was adopting three new accounting standards. The cumulative one-time charge against earnings will be between Dollars 247m and Dollars 260m, or 98 cents to Dollars 1.03 a share. In addition, it will take its standard annual charge to earnings for employee medical benefits which will stand at Dollars 18m, or 7 cents, in 1993. Mr Frank Weise, chief financial officer, said Campbell would have a very strong balance sheet and credit rating even after the non-cash charges. In fiscal 1992, the company posted net earnings of Dollars 490.5m on sales of Dollars 6.26bn. Campbell's is adopting FAS 106 accounting for post-retirement benefits other than pensions, FAS 109 accounting for income taxes, replacing FAS 96 and FAS 112 accounting for post-employment benefits. Philips Electronics has filed a shelf registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for up to Dollars 1.5bn of debt securities. Net proceeds will be used to repay debt of the Philips Group and for general corporate purposes. No underwriters were listed in the filing.</p>

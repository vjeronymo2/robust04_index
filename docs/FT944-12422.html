			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Japan probes dumping charges Japan is sending two missions to Pakistan to investigate dumping charges made by the Japanese textile industry against exports of Pakistani cotton yarn, a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official said yesterday. Miti and the Ministry of Finance will send one mission in November and another in December. Both missions will check the accounts of Pakistani factories to see whether they are exporting cotton yarn to Japan at a lower price than that at which it sells domestically, the Miti official said. Japan plans to make a final decision on the case in February 1995. Reuter, Tokyo</p>

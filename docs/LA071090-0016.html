			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOUISIANA'S LOUSY ABORTION BILL;  </P> <P> MORE FALLOUT FROM CONFUSED HIGH COURT DECISION  </P> <P> What a creative bunch those Louisiana state legislators are. Instead of  spending their time shoring up a sagging state economy or increasing literacy,  a single-minded faction of the Legislature has fixated on laying down the law  on abortion.  </P> <P> Why go after issues that require complex thought and planning when the  political equivalent of a fistfight will do?  </P> <P> The proposed Louisiana law would outlaw abortion except in the cases of rape,  incest or when the pregnant woman's life is in danger, and would institute an  unprecedented penalty on doctors of up to 10 years in prison and a $100,000  fine.  </P> <P> It would be easy to disparage Louisiana for its backwardness. But actually,  this bill is merely the most radical example of the continuing fallout from  last year's confused Supreme Court decision on abortion. An indecisive high  court was not quite willing to overturn the landmark Roe vs. Wade case  legalizing abortion, but it was willing to throw it back to the states to renew  debate on abortion restrictions. So the attempts to restrict abortions keep  coming -- from Idaho, where a stricter law failed, to Pennsylvania, where one  succeeded.  </P> <P> The Louisiana law now is in the hands of Gov. Buddy Roemer, who said he favored  an anti-abortion law but who now questions the constitutionality of this one.  That's because the anti-abortion bill was transformed, whole cloth, from a bill  that would have allowed a maximum $25 fine for beating someone who burned the  flag.  </P> <P> "Only in Louisiana could you have a flag burning bill become an abortion bill,"  said one abortion-rights activist. Not so. Not anymore.  </P></p>

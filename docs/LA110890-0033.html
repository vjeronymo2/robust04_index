			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P>  ANGRY VOTERS EXPEL MANY INCUMBENTS ON SCHOOL BOARDS  </P> <P> Community college trustees Thomas M. Buchenau and Sydney P. Wiener listed  themselves as incumbents on Tuesday's ballot for reelection to the board of the  Grossmont-Cuyamaca district.  </P> <P> Rochelle T. Bastien, an appointed incumbent, decided merely to list her  profession, as a clinical psychologist.  </P> <P> Bastien was the only board member to survive Tuesday's election.  </P> <P> Throughout the county, from Poway to San Ysidro, from East County to the North  Coast, school board members found reelection tough sledding, with numerous  veterans being turned out by voters expressing anti-incumbent anger and  reflecting a national perception that too many things are wrong with American  public education. Out of 36 districts with elections, only Coronado, Borrego  Springs, Lemon Grove, San Dieguito, San Marcos and Santee returned all  incumbents to office. The anti-incumbent mood flared in district races with  sharp debates about locations of a new school or the value of a superintendent,  as well as in those districts where no burning issues existed.  </P> <P> In San Diego Unified, the nation's eighth-largest urban system, John de Beck's  razor-thin victory over Scott Harvey was due in part to De Beck's reputation as  an iconoclastic candidate unafraid to lock horns with the prevailing philosophy  of the existing board of trustees.  </P> <P> Observers even attributed the mild upset of Kara Kobey over longtime education  activist Yvonne Larsen for a San Diego Community College seat in part to  voters' feelings that Larsen's extensive resume as a past city school district  trustee and overseer for the California State University system gave her the  aura of an incumbent.  </P> <P> "There was an anti-incumbent mood, and the voters really took it out at (the  school) level," said David Feldman, a veteran pollster and vice chancellor for  development and community relations for the Grossmont-Cuyamaca system. "And add  to that the feeling that schools are problematic anyways."  </P> <P> Feldman said Wednesday no major issues divided candidates for the  Grossmont-Cuyamaca board.  </P> <P> Superintendents of various elementary and secondary school districts countywide  made similar points Wednesday.  </P> <P> "We've wondered about this all day," said Warren Hogarth, superintendent of the  La Mesa-Spring Valley district, where two of three incumbents lost, and where  the third finished last of the three elected. "I can understand an incumbent  being overturned here or there, but when it happens countywide . . . this is  just not normal."  </P> <P> All three incumbents were also-rans in Oceanside. "There were no particular  issues that were contested here, and we really have no idea of what happened,"  Assistant Supt. Joe Graybeal said. He and other superintendents noted that the  majority of voters do not have children in public schools.  </P> <P> "Maybe we have to raise the consciousness level of those folks and get them in  touch with schools so they will know" that educational quality does exist, he  said.  </P> <P> In the Sweetwater high school district, South Bay area voters had clear choices  between incumbents supporting embattled superintendent Anthony Trujillo and  those who feel he has poorly administered district finances and personnel  matters. The two long-time incumbents who supported Trujillo were pasted by  newcomers.  </P> <P> "There's a message there," said trustee Nick Aguilar, a Trujillo supporter who  was not up for reelection. He said that, although new board members will  probably moderate their views once they become part of the system, their  election will probably hasten Trujillo's expressed desire to retire by the end  of his contract next year.  </P> <P> Shirley Weber, a San Diego city school trustee who will head the board next  year, expressed sentiment for moderation about De Beck, whose views on major  educational issues in the city diverge sharply from those of current board  members.  </P> <P> "I know little about the man because I've never met him personally, but I think  you learn quickly as a new board member that, if you are going to bring about  positive changes, you have to be collaborative with your colleagues and work  with others who don't perhaps share your philosophy," Weber said.  </P> <P> De Beck himself said Wednesday that he hopes to sit down soon with trustees --  all of whom backed his opponent -- to "try and allay the fears they apparently  have of what kind of person I am. I want them to understand me better."  </P> <P> De Beck will be joined as a new trustee by Sue Braun, who trounced Lynette  Williams as expected for the other open seat. Braun, who considers herself much  more in the mainstream of district policies, said her initial efforts will be  to solve "nitty gritty problems" of skateboarding, new school openings and  other constituent matters in her Scripps Ranch-Mira Mesa-San Carlos areas.  </P> <P> Kobey will join fellow winners Maria Senour and Denise Ducheny on the San Diego  Community College District board of trustees. The three women won the open  seats and will serve alongside trustees Evonne Schulze and Fred Colby, who were  elected two years ago.  </P> <P> Schulze said that the Kobey name -- she is the daughter of the late swap meet  magnate Monte Kobey -- as well as her "freshness" compared to Larsen probably  helped Kobey over the top.  </P> <P> "But all six candidates who ran would have been very, very good," Schulze said.  </P></p>

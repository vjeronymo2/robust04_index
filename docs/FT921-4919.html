			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Venezuelan leader aims to defuse discontent VENEZUELA'S president yesterday announced a broad range of measures aimed at easing widespread discontent with his government and providing a stronger political base. Mr Carlos Andres Perez, in a nationwide address, said his government would call on Congress to organise a Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution within a short time. The new national charter will provide for regular referenda. A return to price controls on a limited number of items, such as basic food products, motor gasoline and electric power rates was also announced. The administration will ask Congress to approve a luxury tax and will revise certain other taxes. Measures, as yet unannounced, will be taken to control inflation and regulate monetary liquidity. Investors are worried controls may be applied to interest rates, which were freed from tight government regulation in early 1989. The number of ministers will be reduced from 26 to nine and a 'cabinet of national unity' named, Mr Perez said. In an effort to calm outcries over corruption, the president revealed initiatives including the replacement of five out of nine members of the Supreme Court, legislation on judicial reform and legal action against individuals believed to have defrauded past governments. Mr Alirio Parra, one of Venezuela's most experienced oil experts, has been appointed minister of energy and mines.</p>

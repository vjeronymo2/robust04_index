			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Moller consolidates lead in containers A. P. MOLLER, the Danish shipping, shipbuilding and oil group, is consolidating its position as the world's leading container carrier. The group announced last week that it had placed an order for five container vessels with its own shipyard, the Odense Steel Shipyard. Capable of carrying 4,800 TEU (standard 20-foot containers) each, these are the biggest container vessels yet ordered by Moller's Maersk Line shipping operation. Maersk passed Taiwan's Evergreen in terms of container carrying capacity earlier this year, when it took over nine vessels from its erstwhile Danish rival, the East Asiatic Company, which has withdrawn from liner shipping. Maersk's capacity on the group's 50 ships is about 140,000 units to Evergreen's 135,000, according to available estimates. Maersk also has about 20 ships on charter to its global liner services. With last week's order, Maersk has on order 10 new vessels with a total container capacity of 30,510. However, the expansion of the liner business is only one of the factors which has made the Moller group's twin parent companies, D/S 1912 and D/S Svendborg, two of the strongest shares on the Copenhagen stock exchange this year, with the B shares increasing by about 56 per cent. The most important factor behind the rise in the share price, Copenhagen analysts say, was a new contract for sale of natural gas from the group's fields in the Danish sector of the North Sea. The Moller group has a 39 per cent share in Danish Underground Consortium (DUC), in which it is the operating company for the North Sea oil and gas operations. Its partners in DUC are Shell and Texaco. DUC's production is relatively small - about 7.9m tonnes of oil and 3.6bn cubic metres of natural gas in 1992 - but this is about 110 per cent of Denmark's oil and gas needs. DUC and the state's oil and gas distribution company, Dansk Olie og Naturgas (Dong), earlier this year signed a contract under which DUC's deliveries of gas from 1997 will be doubled, taking them to 7bn cubic metres a year. On the management side, Moller is going through an interesting transitional period. Mr Maersk McKinney Moller, whose father founded the group at the beginning of the century, stepped down from the day-to-day running of the group on reaching the age of 80 in July this year. He remains chairman of the parent companies, but he made Mr Jess Soderberg, 49, the group's chief executive from July 1. Mr Soderberg's entire career has been with Moller, where he became finance director before being made a partner and chief executive. The Moller group's oil and shipping operations had a turnover in 1992 of about DKr23bn (Dollars 3.5bn) and reported net profits of DKr1.5bn.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> JOSTLING TO FIND A SISTER CITY;  </P> <P> SO YOUR TOWN WANTS TO SHOW ITS CULTURAL SOLIDARITY WITH A FLEDGLING LOCAL  GOVERNMENT IN EASTERN EUROPE? DON'T PUT YOUR HOPES ON PRAGUE.  </P> <P> The idea struck Redondo Beach Councilman Terry Ward last month like a peal from  the Liberty Bell: A constituent, a Czechoslovakian immigrant, had asked if the  beachside city might be interested in becoming a sister city of Prague, the  capital of his homeland.  </P> <P> "I thought, 'My God, what a terrific idea!' " Ward said, recalling his pleasure  at the thought of casting a local vote of confidence in the recent democratic  reforms in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "It touched me deeply. I wanted to move as fast as I could because I was afraid  some other city would get the idea, too."  </P> <P> Too late.  </P> <P> Even as Ward was firing off an invitation to the mayor of Prague -- a letter  studded with congratulations to him, his city and the whole nation of  Czechoslovakia -- Chicago was issuing a rival proposition to Prague to become  its partner in a cultural exchange.  </P> <P> Stirred by the developments that have swept the communist world in recent  months, U.S. municipalities nationwide are vying to establish city-level  diplomatic ties with the fledgling local governments of Eastern Europe,  according to the Alexandria, Va.,-based Sister Cities International, which acts  as a clearinghouse for the municipal affiliations.  </P> <P> "We're getting inquiries about Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, East Germany,"  said Tom Gittins, Sister Cities International executive vice president.  </P> <P> "Muscatine, Iowa, and Cedar Rapids want to develop Czechoslovakian  relationships, and Bloomington, Ind., has indicated they want a relationship  with an East German city. Chicago has a serious proposal out for Prague and  Cleveland is interested in Bratislava. The mayor of Fort Worth (Tex.) just got  back from Budapest, and Toledo, Ohio, and New Brunswick, N.J., are working on  Hungarian cities."  </P> <P> The heightened interest is the understandable byproduct of a year of  extraordinary change worldwide, Gittins and others say. To many, a link with  the communist world right now is a link with history, observers say. And in the  light of reform, governments that once seemed impenetrable now feel more  approachable to Americans.  </P> <P> Next month, he said, a team of Polish emissaries will visit 10 U.S. cities to  learn the rudiments of running a local government. Meanwhile, demand is  skyrocketing for affiliations with Soviet cities in the age of perestroika.  Only last month, for example, Los Angeles officially adopted Leningrad, and  Pasadena decided to pursue a link with Byurakan, a research center in Soviet  Armenia that once was closed to foreigners.  </P> <P> "Three years ago, there were only six sister cities in the Soviet Union. Today  there are 52, and we have about 60 pending inquiries," Gittins said. "As you  can well imagine, there's a lot of excitement and a lot of change."  </P> <P> Set up to promote cultural understanding through student exchanges and the  like, sister cityhood, although generally apolitical in theory, has over the  years shifted with changing global politics. When President Richard M. Nixon  visited China, for example, U.S. towns rushed to find partners in that country,  said Dick Oakland, director of member services for Sister Cities International.  Now, in the wake of last June's massacre at Tien An Men Square, China is out,  he said.  </P> <P> After Nixon's visit to China in the early 1970s, 40 U.S. cities established  ties with municipalities there. But in the wake of the Beijing bloodshed, no  new links have been forged, and 18 to 20 affiliations that were being  negotiated have been put on hold.  </P> <P> In 1979, during the American hostage crisis, Los Angeles unilaterally suspended  its sister city relationship with Tehran, and did not even bother to inform its  sister city's government.  </P> <P> "It's a matter of what's hot and what's not," Oakland said. "And, right now,  Eastern Europe is very hot."  </P> <P> An offshoot of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's mid-1950s "People-to-People"  initiative, Sister Cities International has linked about 870 U.S. cities with  about 1,400 sister cities in 91 countries, Gittins said. Los Angeles has 16,  more than any other city in the United States.  </P> <P> The relationships typically involve official visits, pen pal programs, zoo  exchanges and other symbolic gestures of friendship that give even the most  isolated U.S. towns a window on the world. In return, foreign cities -- which,  unlike U.S. cities, can have only one sister city at a time -- get the  advantage of direct medical, cultural and trade exchanges.  </P> <P> A handful of those partnerships are in communist Europe -- Chicago, for  example, has been a sister city of Warsaw since the 1960s. But most of those  relationships, including the Chicago-Warsaw link, have been dormant until now,  officials say, partly because the communist governments were uninterested or  wary, and partly because of U.S. opposition to human rights violations in the  Soviet bloc.  </P> <P> As recently as 1984, for example, the politically conservative City Council of  Vista, citing national security, turned down a local grandmother's emotional  appeal to take a Soviet community as a sister city. The woman ended up creating  a U.S.-Soviet pen pal program in her San Diego County city under the auspices  of a now-defunct pacifist group based in Portland, Ore.  </P> <P> In 1985, then-San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein was forced to take back her  city's invitation to Leningrad because of criticism from fellow Democrats and  her city's Jewish community. And in 1987, opposition from an anti-Soviet group  killed a proposal in Costa Mesa to make its first sister city the Soviet  community of Melitopol.  </P> <P> But in the wake of reforms, such relationships are now being sought by even the  most conservative cities, said Steven Kalishman of the Center for Innovative  Diplomacy, based in Washington, D.C., with offices in Irvine.  </P> <P> "The people who were interested before (in Soviet bloc sister cities) felt they  needed to do something because of the nuclear situation," Kalishman said.  </P> <P> "Now, people are interested for different reasons -- they want to be able to  tell their kids and grandkids that they were part of the revolution.  </P> <P> "Also, with Eastern Europe opening up, there is a lot of money to be be made,"  Kalishman said. "Through the sister city organizations, a lot of smaller  corporations will have the opportunity for trade."  </P> <P> Local officials, however, say that most recent efforts to link with Eastern  Europe are based more on emotion than economics. The majority, they say, have  been initiated by Eastern Bloc dissidents who emigrated here, and who are  hoping to re-establish contact with their homelands after being estranged for  years.  </P> <P> In Fort Worth, for example, the push to join with Budapest came at the behest  of a pair of Hungarian-born Texas businessmen, said Toni Brown, executive  director of the Fort Worth sister cities program.  </P> <P> One of the men was an old friend of the mayor of Budapest, who -- in the age of  Hungarian political reform -- was anxious for an alliance with a U.S. city,  Brown said. The businessman approached Fort Worth City Hall, got the go-ahead  to pursue the idea, and in early December a Hungarian delegation arrived in  Fort Worth.  </P> <P> "We took them to a ranch and a rodeo," Brown said, "and visited some schools  and companies. We met with the Chamber of Commerce, did some Rotary (clubs),  had a lot of private dinners and receptions."  </P> <P> At the end of the visit, the delegation from Budapest publicly invited Fort  Worth to be its sister city. But "the real shockeroo," according to Brown, came  at a private dinner held just after the announcement when the notoriously  reclusive pianist Van Cliburn, who lives in Fort Worth, disclosed that he  wanted to celebrate the new relationship by playing a rare concert this summer  in Budapest.  </P> <P> Brown said the union will become official with a signing ceremony the Fort  Worth City Council hopes to link to the Van Cliburn concert several months from  now. Meanwhile, in the spirit of the union, a delegation of Hungarian  journalists has scheduled a trip to Fort Worth to bone up on U.S. political  journalism.  </P> <P> "Hungary's going to have their first election ever and the reporters there  don't know how to cover one," Brown explained.  </P> <P> In Redondo Beach, which has no Czech community to speak of and which already  has two sister cities in Mexico, a similar personal contact prompted Ward's  invitation to Prague.  </P> <P> Josef Kubicek, a local developer who had defected from Czechoslovakia in 1964,  said the idea came to him after reforms brought his old friends from the Czech  resistance into power. Forty-one years of communist rule ended on Dec. 10, when  Czech President Gustav Husak resigned, swearing in a new 21-member cabinet with  the Communist Party in a minority role.  </P> <P> "When the revolution actually happened, I knew that people in Prague needed  emotional help more than anything else," said Kubicek, 55. He thought of  approaching the Los Angeles City Council, since Los Angeles is better known, he  said, but his City Hall contacts were all in Redondo Beach, where he has done  business for more than 20 years.  </P> <P> So he took his idea to Ward, hoping, he said, that it would "let the people of  Czechoslovakia know that people on the other side were thinking about them."  </P> <P> There were a few glitches: Ward speaks nary a word of Czech, and when he asked  a friend to help him find the name of the mayor of Prague, they came up with  the wrong mayor -- a Communist who had just been ousted.  </P> <P> By the time the letter was delivered to Prague, the old Communist mayor had  been replaced.  </P> <P> Kubicek said he ended by hand-delivering Ward's letter late last month to the  new mayor, Jaroslav Koran, who opened it on the day of his inauguration and  didn't seem to mind that it was addressed to his Communist predecessor.  </P> <P> Kubicek said Koran was "deeply moved," although "I don't think he ever heard of  Redondo Beach."  </P> <P> Koran sent back a letter expressing "great interest" in the offer and  authorizing Redondo Beach to make a formal application to Sister Cities  International. On Tuesday, Ward got a local go-ahead from the Redondo Beach  City Council.  </P> <P> What will become of the offer is unclear. Lois Weisberg, Chicago's commissioner  of cultural affairs, said Chicago has not yet had formal contact with Prague  but has already asked Sister Cities International for priority on the Czech  capital.  </P> <P> Who will get Prague will be up to the international group, but Weisberg said  Chicago is particularly anxious.  </P> <P> Initially, she said, her city had put in for Budapest, only to find that Fort  Worth had gotten there first.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Redondo Beach, Ward said he will fly to Washington next week to  lobby the Czechoslovakian Consulate.  </P> <P> "If we don't get Prague, I don't know what we'll do. Suck our thumbs and pout,  I guess," Ward said. "It doesn't mean we wouldn't be interested in reaching out  to another (Eastern European) city though. We've got to teach these people what  democracy's all about."  </P></p>

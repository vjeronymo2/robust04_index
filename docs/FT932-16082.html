			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Royal Oak Mines joins environment battle ROYAL Oak Mines, the aggressive Canadian gold producer, has bought control of Geddes Resources, a small exploration company which is engaged in a high-profile battle with environmentalists over plans to build a large copper and gold mine in northern British Columbia. Royal Oak will pay CDollars 10m (USDollars 7.9m) for the 39 per cent stake in Geddes currently held by Northgate Exploration. Royal Oak said the acquisition 'has significant upside potential and limited downside risk'. The deposit is estimated to contain 300m tonnes of copper ore with a grade of 1.38 per cent, as well as substantial quantities of gold, silver and cobalt. The British Columbia provincial government has come under strong pressure from environmental groups in the US and Canada to turn down Geddes' application. The environmentalists contend that the mine will do incalculable damage to the Tatshenshini River and the surrounding region, which is widely regarded as one of most scenic wilderness areas on the continent. Should the project not go ahead, Royal Oak is banking on suitable compensation.</p>

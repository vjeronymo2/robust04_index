The article headlined "Guarantee for Moving Up Bright  Future of Mankind" reads in part:    The great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year  address said if the progressive people of the world promote  historical development by strengthening their unity and  solidarity under the banner of independence against imperialism,  they shall soon be able to shape a bright future for humanity.    The imperialists are now intensifying political, economic  and  military pressure to stifle the countries going forward under  the banner of socialism and are intensifying their maneuverings  to dominate and interfere in the affairs of the developing  countries aspiring after socialism.    To strengthen unity and solidarity is a firm guarantee for  the world progressive people to smash the imperialists' moves.  It stands out with greater urgency because the imperialist  reactionaries are becoming undisguised in their attempt to beat  one by one the progressive countries advancing toward  independence, sovereignty and socialism.    Unity and solidarity are a most powerful weapon for the  cause  of independence, the cause of socialism, and a decisive  guarantee for victory. To strengthen it, it is essential to  adhere to the principle of independence, equality and mutual  respect.    It is necessary to strengthen the unity and solidarity of  the  revolutionary parties struggling for the victory of the cause of  independence, the cause of socialism, of the popular masses.    The Pyongyang declaration serves as a banner under which  international unity and solidarity can be strengthened in the  struggle for socialism.    Independence, peace and friendship are the basic idea of the  foreign policy of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Government  of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    The Korean people value their unity and solidarity with all  the progressive people of the world aspiring after  independence, sovereignty and socialism and will, in the future,  too, give strong impetus to the trend of history by  strengthening unity and solidarity with them.</p>

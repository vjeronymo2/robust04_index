			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] The Zionists have perpetrated another catastrophe by  attacking the worshippers in the Bab al-Zawiyah mosque in  al-Khalil and killing 20 of them. Observers say this Zionist  action is the biggest attack on the Muslims since the killing of  worshippers in the al-Khalil mosque.    The attack on the worshippers in Bab al-Zawiyah took place  when nearly 160 political observers were stationed in al-Khalil  to safeguard peace. This attack in the presence of  international observers exposes the reality that the Zionists  have no respect for international observers and, in view of  their racist characteristics, they capitalize on every  opportunity to suppress the Muslims.    This attack on worshippers in the Bab al-Zawiyah mosque took  place when U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived in  Tel Aviv within his Middle East tour and a visit to Jericho was  on his agenda. The objective of the U.S. secretary's visit to  Syria and Tel Aviv was to open the doors to negotiations between  them. With his trip to Jericho, he sought to convey U.S.  support for the compromising accord and for the progress of the  talks.    With the U.S. secretary's visit to the region and the talks  that took place, efforts were made to project the process of  compromise as a means of ending the Middle East crisis. But the  protest of the Muslims of the occupied territories and their  suppression by the Zionist regime has proved that signed accords  are of no use. Even though the accords are formulated by the  compromising leaders and were implemented from on high with the  support of foreign powers, the trend of the struggle continues  through the masses of the people of occupied Palestine. As long  as these protesting masses who are considered the true masters  of Palestine do not achieve their dreams, accords will produce  no results.</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Ministry acts to boost Japan's finance markets The Japanese Ministry of Finance yesterday announced a package of easing regulations for the domestic securities markets in an attempt to bolster Japan's ailing financial markets. The 70-point package includes the resumption of rights issues, which have been suspended since March 1990 when the Tokyo stockmarket started its descent. The announcement follows a 3.6 per cent fall in the Nikkei average on Monday. Officials hope that rights issues by blue chip companies will help attract investors to the sluggish Tokyo stockmarket. Mr Minoru Nagaoka, president of the Tokyo stock exchange, said the share offerings should be limited to companies ready to return profits to shareholders. The package includes an easing of investment curbs and simplification of administrative procedures required of brokers. Investment trust funds will be allowed to invest in interest rate and currency swaps, lend out securities and borrow short-term funds. The ceiling imposed on investment trust funds' investments in the unsecured call money market will be lifted. The ministry will also abolish the 'lock up' period for Euroyen bonds issued by sovereign borrowers starting on January 1. To protect the country's domestic corporate bond market, the ministry has prohibited Euroyen bonds from entering the country for the first 90 days of issuance. Japanese securities houses found their way around the restriction by agreeing to 'warehouse' the bonds for three months before selling the paper to Japanese investors. Market participants have been calling for the ban to be lifted. The rule, however, remains for bonds issued overseas by Japanese borrowers and overseas companies. For the corporate bond market, the ministry eased eligibility standards for issuing foreign and domestic yen bonds by Japanese companies to a minimum credit rating of triple-B from single-A. The ministry also confirmed there were no restrictions on the issuing of dual-currency bonds, and floating rate notes.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: 'Strategic move' by T&amp;N with east German buy T&amp;N, the UK motor components and engineering group, is buying a bearing manufacturer in the former east Germany. The acquisition, through the Treuhand privatisation agency, is small in financial terms - Pounds 2m - but was described by Mr Colin Hope, T&amp;N's chairman, as 'an important strategic move at little capital cost. The extra sales potential is considerable'. T&amp;N will acquire the site, production equipment and inventory of Gleitlagerwerk Osterwieck, based 50 miles from Hanover. The venture is being renamed Glacier Vandervell (Osterwieck) to identify it with T&amp;N's long established Vandervell and Glacier bearings and bushes subsidiaries. Initially the venture is employing 186 people. Its main customer is Volkswagen, already assembling cars from kits at the former Trabant plant at Mosel, near Zwickau, and which is setting up a new factory there to produce Golfs. Gleitlagerwerk, which has been a Glacier licensee, also makes a range of after-market parts for east European automotive and industrial bearing applications. The acquisition forms one of what is expected to be a string of such acquisitions in the region, as T&amp;N seeks to establish a firm foothold in growing east European markets. In June, T&amp;N became the first British company to acquire a controlling stake in a Czech company offered for privatisation by the Czech government when it invested in Osinek, the sole Czech producer of automotive brake and friction products.</p>

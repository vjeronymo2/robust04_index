			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Contenders lay claims to the title: The problems of deciding ownership of confiscated east German property The last chance to claim ownership of property confiscated by the Nazis and the former east German Communist regime ended on new year's eve. But the workload of the staff at Barby, a sleepy village south-west of Magdeburg, is unlikely to be affected. For the past two years, the 30 employees at Barby, the centre of eastern Germany's Grundbucharchiv, or land registry, have been inundated with tens of thousands of requests from people applying for title to property confiscated after the second world war. Now that the deadline has passed, the staff will spend several more years scouring the land registers to establish the whereabouts and status of the claimed property. Mr Manfred Kottke, who was seconded from the Justice Ministry in Bonn to oversee the process a year ago, says the task is enormous. 'One of the problems is that the vast land registers are not on computer. We computerise only the requests. It would take one year, and 300 people, to put the registers on computer. We haven't got the time, or the personnel.' After the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, east Germany's land registry was taken over by the federal government. Barby has received more than half a million requests from German citizens, emigres and foreigners seeking information about their confiscated property. Officials at the Justice Ministry in Bonn say the total number of claims could exceed 2m, and could take up to 10 years to process. Those whose property was confiscated between 1935 and 1945, and from 1949 until 1990, can seek compensation from local authorities and, in many cases, restitution of the property. But people whose property was taken from them during the Soviet occupation of 1945-49 cannot regain it. Instead, they can seek compensation based on the value of property in the 1930s. Mr Kottke said: 'Barby does not deal with the issues of restitution or compensation of property. It is our job to locate, if possible, the original land register for those who are able to identify where they held property before it was confiscated. Once we have done this, we send them a copy of the register so they can go through the courts or local authorities to follow up the claim.' Processing the claims can take as little as three weeks or as long as eight months. 'In many cases, we receive inadequate information about the whereabouts of the property being claimed,' said Ms Dagmar Schiffel, an archivist. 'Some of the requests come from very old people, or from their descendants and distant relatives who before 1989 had never visited the former German Democratic Republic.' Even if claimants can recall the exact location of their property, sometimes it is not recorded in the land register. This is because the Nazis frequently confiscated property from Jews forced to flee Germany or sent to their deaths in the concentration camps, and tampered with the registers. Many titles in the registers at Barby - the number is unknown - are covered in thick black ink, and in some cases the pages have been torn out. 'The Nazis were determined to show that these Jewish property holders never existed, and that their descendants would never return and reclaim their property,' explained Ms Schiffel. Once the Communists consolidated power in east Germany after 1949, all property was placed in the hands of the state, and the land registry was closed down in 1952. But now, in a curious twist of history, former Nazis are claiming property on the grounds that it was confiscated by the Communists - property they had earlier illegally confiscated from Jewish families - according to Justice Ministry officials and the staff at Barby. As a means of establishing the legitimacy of the original title-holder, the authorities at Barby have installed an infra-red machine, which can read through the black ink on the land registers. 'But we can do little if the page was torn out,' said Ms Schiffel. The registers - large tomes dating from 1769 - are housed in the cellars of a neglected, red-brick, 18th-century mansion, once owned by Prince Heinrich of Saxony. Stacked on high shelves, they would stretch more than 15km if laid out. Until 1979, the East German authorities used the mansion as a hostel for Cuban and Vietnamese Gastarbeiter (guest workers). Then the former Communist regime centralised at Barby the country's land registries, which had previously been held by the individual Lander, or states. 'The place, strictly controlled by the Communists, was completely closed off to the public,' said Ms Schiffel. 'Putting the land registers into some acceptable order was done in complete secrecy.' Thankfully, the German tradition of bureaucracy and order outweighed any temptation the Communists might have had to destroy them.</p>

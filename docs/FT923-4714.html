			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Bush backs indexing of capital gains THE US administration yesterday said that President George Bush would ask Congress to approve cutting capital gains tax by indexing gains for inflation. Mr Bush had hoped to boost the lagging economy by announcing the indexation of capital gains by presidential order, without seeking a legislative change from Congress. However, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater yesterday said Mr Bush had been advised by the Justice Department that the president needed to ask Congress before changing the tax law. 'We are disappointed that the opinion concludes that neither the president nor the treasury secretary nor the commissioner of the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) has the authority to act to revise the IRS regulations,' Mr Fitzwater said in a statement. Right-wing Republicans both in Congress and in the administration had for some time been urging Mr Bush to order the indexation, which would, they argued, have brought both political and economic benefits by offering a stimulus to investment, and simultaneously picking a fight with Congress. Mr Bush has repeatedly, though weakly, sought a cut in the capital gains tax rate from Congress, but has been rebuffed by Democrats, led by Senator George Mitchell, who argue that it would favour only the rich. Mr Fitzwater yesterday said that 'the president believes that such indexing of cost would be sound economic policy - and would be sound as a matter of fairness.' Earlier this year, the House of Representatives backed a proposal for indexing future capital gains as part of a Dollars 90bn tax reform package, but the bill was vetoed by President Bush because it also included an increase in the income tax rate levied on richer taxpayers. Indexation is reported to have been revived by Mr James Baker, the former secretary of state, when he returned to the White House in an attempt to salvage Mr Bush's re-election campaign.</p>

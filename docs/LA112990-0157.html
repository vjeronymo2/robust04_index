			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK;  </P> <P> THIS TIME, CHAPMAN WOMEN NEED TEAM EFFORT AGAINST SAN BERNARDINO  </P> <P> After Friday's game with Cal State San Bernardino, the Chapman College women's  basketball team will have played half of its six games against the Coyotes.  </P> <P> The Panthers (4-1) will face San Bernardino for the third time in seven days in  the first round of the Cal State Hayward tournament. Chapman won the first  meeting last Friday at the Hutton Center, 81-62, but lost, 80-68, the next day.  </P> <P> "Not a good scheduling move on my part, but I'm learning," Chapman Coach  Lindsay Strothers said.  </P> <P> The re-rematch, Strothers said, will give his team a chance to redeem itself  after a poor performance at San Bernardino, which will join the Panthers in the  California Collegiate Athletic Assn. next season.  </P> <P> "What happened there was we didn't play as a team," he said. "We played as  individuals."  </P> <P> Strothers said he was pleased with the Panthers' effort Tuesday in an 86-71  victory over Biola. Community college transfer Linda Kirby scored 25 points,  and Jackie Saunders had 19 points and 18 rebounds. Kirby is averaging 21 points  a game, and Saunders is averaging 19 points and 15 rebounds.  </P> <P> Limping Panthers: Chapman, which lists nine players on its roster, will suit up  only eight the next three weeks. Junior guard Missy Abraham, who played only in  the first game, will be out the next three weeks because of an undetermined  illness. Kim Rieff, a six-foot senior reserve center who scored 19 points in 24  minutes against Biola, is suffering from a back injury that may limit her from  playing two days in a row.  </P> <P> The Chapman men's team takes to the road for the first time with games Friday  afternoon at Hayward and Saturday night at UC Davis.  </P> <P> Panther Coach Bob Boyd said he was pleased with the team's play in three  victories at home. Chapman is off to its best start since winning its first  five games in 1983-84.  </P> <P> Added depth from transfers has allowed Boyd to give as many as nine players  significant playing time.  </P> <P> "I think you can really utilize nine people -- we used to say seven -- but I  think the game has changed," Boyd said.  </P> <P> Transfers Zlatko Josic (Clemson), Al Jackson (West Valley College) and Chuck  McGavran (Cal State Northridge) have contributed, and returning starters Rog  Middleton, Frantz Reyes and Andre Hill are averaging 20, 16 and 16 points a  game.  </P> <P> The Chapman women's volleyball team was eliminated from the NCAA Division II  playoffs Friday by West Texas State, the No. 1 team in the nation, 15-7, 15-10,  7-15, 15-7.  </P> <P> All things considered, Chapman Coach Mary Cahill was happy with the Panthers'  performance in the match played before a crowd of 2,392 in the 2,000-capacity  Tascosa High School gym in Amarillo.  </P> <P> "Last year (in the playoffs) we went to Riverside and lost three straight and  we played like we were nervous," Cahill said. "This year we didn't play that  way. The match lasted about two hours and we stayed with them. They didn't just  kill us.  </P> <P> "It's a great experience for the girls who are returning because that's  probably the largest crowd they will ever play in front of."  </P> <P> The only Panther player who won't return next season is setter Brooke Schakel,  who was an all-Southwest Region selection. Returning juniors will be outside  hitter Debi Waller, who was a second-team All-American selection by the  volleyball coaches and an all-Southwest selection; middle-hitter Rena Strange,  who was also all-Southwest pick; and Heather Mead, who was 10th in the nation  in digs (419). Waller and Strange were also first-team all-CCAA selections.  </P> <P> After losing its first four games, the Christ College Irvine men's basketball  team defeated Whittier College, 69-60, Tuesday to give Coach Greg Marshall his  first victory as a head coach.  </P> <P> "We were thinking it wasn't going to happen this year," Marshall said,  jokingly. "I thought it might take a couple of years to do that."  </P> <P> Marshall took the job at Christ College after serving five years as an  assistant at Westmont. He also was an assistant coach at Idaho State and Cal  Poly San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> The Eagles play Redlands in the first round of the Redlands Tournament at 8  tonight.  </P> <P> College Division Notes  </P> <P> Chris Briones, a catcher at Brea-Olinda High School, has signed a letter of  intent to play for Chapman. Briones, who batted .370 with 10 doubles last  season, was a first-team all-Orange League selection and helped the Wildcats to  the league title. . . . The City of Orange is sponsoring a youth baseball camp,  featuring Chapman Coach Mike Weathers, Dec. 26-29 at Hart Park. The four-day  camp costs $99 and will include instruction from Weathers and other college  coaches and players. For information, call Weathers at 997-6663.  </P></p>

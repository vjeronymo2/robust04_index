			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Arts: Spoils of reconquista and jihad - An exhibition of Islamic Art in Granada FIVE hundred years ago Al Abdallah, last Muslim ruler in Spain, meekly handed the kingdom of Granada over to the Christians and slunk off to exile in North Africa with his mother's reproach ringing in his ears: 'Weep like a woman; you have not defended your kingdom like a man'. Generations of travellers, ravished by the beauty of the Alhambra, have understood why Al Abdallah would have wept. The Nasridi rulers' palace is the most intact and satisfying monument of Islamic secular architecture to have survived in Andalusia. Now, for the first time, the palace has become the setting for an exhibition: Al-Andalus. The Islamic Arts of Spain. For this exceptional event, artefacts have been brought from museums and cathedral treasuries throughout Spain and abroad - from libraries in Cairo and Istanbul, from collections in the US, St Petersburg and Copenhagen, and from mosques in Fez and Rabat. Made over a period of seven and a half centuries, between the establishment of the Ummayad caliphate at Cordoba and the final triumph of los reyos catolicos, these luxury objects include some of the most notable masterpieces of Islamic medieval art. There is one big problem about this glamorous show, a joint venture between the Alhambra and the Metropolitan Museum of New York. In theory, these objects should be more at home here than at any time in the past five centuries. They are disposed around rooms of legendary beauty, covered with classic makkarnas or stalactite plasterwork, with ceilings of inlaid wood and the Nasridi's carved reminders that 'There is no conqueror but Allah'. In practice, the exhibition fights with its setting. Display-cases and panels have been shoe-horned into the sultan's apartments, half-obscuring tiled walls and filigree stuccowork, blocking niches. In the first important room the visitor enters, the Mexuar or council-chamber, the walls are hidden behind huge photographs of the interior of the Great Mosque of Cordoba. Such an intrusion seems unnecessary, even in the interests of evoking a century which has left us so little in the way of museum-pieces. No one with the slightest interest in Spain's Islamic heritage is going to miss seeing Cordoba for themselves. Conversely, anyone who makes their first visit to the Alhambra during the next two months will surely resent finding the palace's legendary rooms chopped about by designers. Of all buildings in the world, none is more dependent on a prospect, namely the dazzlingly lovely panorama of Granada and the Sierra Nevada, which the Nasridi's architects knew to exploit so skilfully. But in order to turn the Salon de los Embajadores, the sultan's audience room, into a darkened gallery, all the window arches have been blocked. In case the Alhambra's administration has a mind to repeat this experiment, the point should to be made forcefully. Al-Andalus might just pass, in the hullaballoo of Spain's triple-centenary year - the fall of Granada, the expulsion of the Jews, and Columbus. But it represents the victory of museological chic over aesthetic good manners. And yet, even in the Salon de los Embajadores, it is hard to lament over-long in the presence of stunning masterpieces of the 10th and 11th Centuries, created in the workshops of the caliphs and later of the Taifa, or successor, kings. The ivory boxes, the lustred bowls, silk textiles and metalwork, look sumptuous and that makes just the right point about the heyday of Arab rule in Spain. Theirs was a brilliant civilization, a fact historians have always recognized and which was abundantly obvious to Spain's medieval neighbours. In the time of Caliph Abd al-Rahman III, who gave his daughter the delightful ivory gaming-box we see, the princelings and knights of the Christian north and southern France, wanted nothing so much as to lay hands on the inlaid saddles, gilded candelabra, silks, wickedly sharp swords, and Arab stallions of the Saracens. The massive silver-gilt casket of Caliph Hisham II from the treasury of Gerona cathedral, was probably given by the counts of Urgel or Barcelona, recruited shortly after the millenium by the caliph's governor in return for all the booty they could capture. The Pamplona casket of carved ivory, with its wonderful scenes of court life, hunting, and date-picking, was commissioned at the same date to celebrate the Muslim conquest of Leon. From further afield, too, the spoils of reconquista and jihad have been reunited. Around 1100, the citizens of Pisa saw a winged monster put on top of their cathedral, where it remained until 1828. Tradition has it that the Pisa Griffon, a stolid beast the size of a foal, was looted at the conquest of the Balearics. As with the Lion of Venice, scholars dispute where the monster originated - Islamic it certainly is, and perhaps a fountain decoration, but was it made in Egypt, Iran, North Africa, or Andalusia? When Muslims had the upper hand, they would carry off church bells and convert them into mosque lamps: two beautiful examples, temporarily stripped of their electric light-bulbs, have been borrowed from the Qarawiyyan Mosque in Fez. Certain exhibits will be seen only in New York, such as the minbar (pulpit) of the Kutubiyya Mosque in Marrakesh. In Granada, the textiles are also considerably reduced. Never mind, what we do see is simply marvellous, such as the red silk used to line the reliquary casket of a Visigothic saint, St Millan. From the last days of Nasrid rule survives exquisite armour and, as part of a cardinal's pickings, a great curtain such as might have draped the sultan's chamber. The exhibition catalogue gives an engrossing account of the splendour of court-culture at Cordoba, Medina al-Zara, and Granada. My recommendation for Spain's quincentenary would be to visit Granada and then, armed with the catalogue and Michael Jacobs's excellent Guide to Andalusia (Penguin), to set out on a dogged search for the not-quite vanished splendours of Islamic Spain. Sponsored by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. In Granada, to 7 June. At the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, New York, 30 July to 27 September.</p>

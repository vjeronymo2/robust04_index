			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Slovak Television Perceived as Unobjective"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--The Press and Information Department  (TIO) of the Slovak Government Office regards the coverage of  the parliamentary debate on the Slovak Government Policy  Statement in the first issue of STV's [Slovak Television]  "Aktuality" program on 12 April as incompatible with the STV's  legal status as a public corporation. This is stated in a  statement by the TIO of the Slovak Government Office that was  made available to TA SR yesterday. The statement draws  attention to the fact that the TIO of the Slovak Government  Office considers the failure to make public a single idea from  Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik's speech, while at the same  time including a statement by Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  [HZDS] Deputy Olga Keltosova, a violation of the objectivity of  information. The STV is legally obliged to maintain  objectivity, the statement says.</p>

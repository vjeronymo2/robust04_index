In an interview with AL-AHRAM's Saturday edition, he said an  invitation will also be sent to the National Dialogue Committee  to meet in Aden after the 'Id al-Fitr holiday to continue the  dialogue, which stopped after a number of its participants  withdrew because of escalating squabbles, the mass media's  stand, and military clashes between the armed forces of the  General People's Congress in Sanaa and the Socialist Party's  forces in the border governorates in Abyan, Abb, (Ta'izz), and  Lahij.    He expressed hopes that the crisis will be resolved and  noted  the need for all the parties to cooperate to achieve this end.    Al-'Attas emphasized that terrorism has serious effects on  Yemen and on the Arab countries to which this terrorism is  exported. He said he does not approve of any terrorist act  directed from his country at fraternal Egypt or other Arab  countries.</p>

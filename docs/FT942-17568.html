			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow fights back after heavy morning deficit Wall Street US blue-chip stocks ended with modest gains on Thursday after another buffeting from an unstable bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 9.22 better at 3,635.97, after fighting back from a 67-point deficit at mid-morning. The final push into positive territory came only about an hour before the close, as a burst of program-guided buying, coinciding with the end of trading in the first quarter, lifted the bellwether index by about 30 points. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also reversed course during the session. It climbed back from a six point decline to end 0.21 better at 445.76; but declining issues outnumbered advances by 1,532 to 738. For a second consecutive day, activity was hectic, as portfolio managers sought to square positions before their books closed for the quarter. NYSE volume reached 398m shares, topping the previous day's level of 390m. The American SE composite ended 2.43 lower at 443.11, and the Nasdaq composite down 1.45 at 743.46. It was an appropriate end to a week of turmoil. After a net loss of 147 points since Monday's opening, confidence was in short supply when investors began the last session before the Easter three-day holiday. Share prices were already slipping by mid-morning, when the Chicago Association of Purchasing Management released its March index of business activity. The data were received badly. Not only did the index indicate a overall surge of activity in the region, but more importantly for the inflation-sensitive bond market, the report's prices-paid component showed a big rise. In response Treasury prices, especially on the long end of the yield curve, dropped precipitously, triggering frenzied selling in stocks. Within an hour, however, share prices stabilised amid a cross-current of program-driven trades. As the day progressed, buyers finally trickled back into the Treasury market, tempted by low prices. In equities, bargain hunters snapped up some of Dow components battered earlier in the week. Caterpillar recovered Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 112 and Allied Signal Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 36 5/8 . JP Morgan gained Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 , McDonald's Dollars 1 to Dollars 56 7/8 and IBM Dollars 1 to Dollars 54. The Dow transportation index, hammered over the past week, slipped a further 3.31 to 1,635.19. Airline stocks held up well, but trucking issues were weak, with the expiration of a pivotal labour contract only hours away and talks between union representatives and management stalled. On the Nasdaq, Microsoft improved Dollars 1 1/8 and Intel gained Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 67 1/2 . But Pyramid Technology sank Dollars 3 7/8 to 7 7/8 after a profits warning. Canada Toronto stocks pulled out of another steep slide in late trading and ended mixed to positive bias after falling for six consecutive sessions. The TSE- 300 composite index finished a busy session 15.71 points higher at 4,329.62. Volume was 80.44m shares valued at CDollars 1.0bn. Strong bank stocks, golds, a rebound in debt markets and bargain-hunting combined to offer a late lift. The gold and silver index climbed by 233.46, or 2.2 per cent to 10,778.81 after a solid rally in gold prices. Comex gold closed up a sharp USDollars 5.70 at Dollars 394.30 per ounce, after bouncing off a two-and-a-half-month high of Dollars 396.50.</p>

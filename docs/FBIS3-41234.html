			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mauricio Schvartzman entitled "Computer </F> Problems"]    [Text] It is said that a former president of a small and  poor country travelled to the United States last December.  Arriving in Miami, an immigration department agent--after  looking through the passenger's passport and consulting the  computer--asked him to wait, ordered a [member of] customs  personnel to bring his suitcases and invited him to a nearby  office. The visitor, somewhat alarmed, asked: "What is wrong?"  The customs official explained: "Your name coincides with that  of another person who appears on the screen. Moreover, he is  your age--the customs official complicated matters even more  so--and he is registered as a drug trafficker." The foreign  visitor indignant, surprised, and desperate protested: "That  cannot be." He complained: "I was president of the republic and  fought drug trafficking with the U.S. Government's cooperation.  Let me phone the U.S. ambassador in my country."    The former president managed to get through: "Ambassador, I  am being delayed here in Miami because the computer registers a  drug trafficker with my name." He explained his problem  sounding rather terrified. The ambassador confirms: "Yes, they  have informed me that your name appears in the computer. It is  a computer problem." The ambassador promises to do his best,  saying: "We will resolve the problem."    It is said that finally after 40 minutes, or after some 90  minutes according to more exaggerated witness reports, the  former president was able to comply with the immigration red  tape and visit the United States under the uneasy impression  that the incident, caused by who knows what, was a warning.    This anecdote is an example of the political language of  "demonstrations," like military maneuvers, street  demonstrations, cabinet changes, retirements, etc., whose  goals--which exceed their disclosed purposes--are uncovered,  sometimes correctly and others erroneously, through analysis or  speculation.    The case of the former president delayed by an immigration  agent reminds us of the unfulfilled promises General Andres  Rodriguez--who perfectly fits the anti-hero in the  anecdote--made to the U.S. Government about handing over the  protectors of drug trafficking and dismantling their  infrastructure.    If for the political process the transition meant building  the legal framework of democracy to assure the free action of  the political institutions and elect--based on these  conditions--the first civilian president, for the U.S.  Government it also meant eliminating the protection system for  drug traffickers.    The United States was especially concerned about this  because  the transition process was begun by a totally corrupt Armed  Forces whose rebellious commander presided over the executive  branch. The proposal to "dignify" the Armed Forces by the  rebels was not restricted merely, under the terms of the U.S.  aid for the new government, to prohibiting military men from  engaging in partisan activities, eradicating illegal activities  in general, and controlling the misuse and draining of state  resources, but specifically to the handing over of those who  protect traffickers.    The concern was and is very logical. U.S. experts wonder if  military men are capable of dignifying the Armed Forces. Who  will cast the first stone? Who is clean enough of any charges,  of any links, or of protecting anyone to cast the first stone?  More than four years of transition government have elapsed and  the strategists received the expected answer: The process to  dignify the Armed Forces failed--we have the disastrous example  of Colonel Gonzalez Rojas, or the replacement of General Bernal  who at the time was defense minister, or the dismantling of the  Antinarcotics Secretariat's leadership which greatly upset the  United States; Rodriguez was supposed to have cast the first  stone, but did not, he never did; and, finally, most of the  members of the high command were and are trapped by links  related to commitments and protection.    The responsibility for throwing the great quantity of stones  that should have been cast was transferred to [President Juan  Carlos] Wasmosy. Yes, to a civilian government, but under the  vertical domain regarding military issues of a very ambitious  general. The situation remains unchanged: The process to  dignify the Armed Forces continues in the hands of the Armed  Forces, but the difference is that it now has the ludicrous  facade of a civilian government.    So, in view of the careful protection granted from high  spheres to traffickers--detected and monitored by U.S.  intelligence--it was decided to materialize a plan under which  U.S. Southern Command servicemen based in Panama would build  schools, water wells, health posts, and repair roads in San  Pedro Department as "training for the shipment of construction  material for future actions similar to the Persian Gulf War," as  Ambassador Glassman explained on one occasion. Who says this  project has concealed objectives? The message is clear and  direct: One typical "demonstration" that the U.S. troops  sometime use, when justified, is to carry out a "Persian  Gulf-type" intervention in Paraguayan territory.    Everyone understood the message of the "demonstration" of  the  military social actions. The less discreet commented that  "there are concealed purposes," without understanding the  opportuneness of the maneuver.    "There are no concealed purposes and it will benefit the  country," commented others with a sense of opportuneness, thus  supporting the opportunity to pressure the protectors and  allowing the Armed Forces to become dignified and overcome the  dispute the opposition maintains with the ambitious general.  For the first time most opposition legislators applauded the  arrival of U.S. troops and were willing to grant them all the  privileges and immunity requested, because they have interpreted  the "demonstration."    Undoubtedly some ambitious general assumed the role of  protector, took it personally, and overcame Wasmosy's first  impression that the South Command's offer was beneficial. So,  on Wednesday, 2 February, a letter of conditions was sent to  Ambassador Glassman, which he was made to sign. According to  the letter, the Paraguayan Army was to participate in the joint  actions, that the cost of the project had to be clearly  established--Congress having approved the project it should be  noted that this plan affects the nation's sovereign rights--the  operation zones must be restricted, the importation of weapons  restricted, detailed information of the U.S. personnel to enter  the country should be disclosed, and that it should be clearly  established whom will be granted privileges and immunity.  Wasmosy and his subordinates have again picked up the old  yankee anti-imperialist wave.    This never crossed Southern Command's mind. Glassman, taken  aback by the offense, commented that "similar offers to other  Latin American countries were never rejected." General Oviedo,  as a champion of the national liberation, on Thursday, 3  February, asked journalists: "Do you think we would reject  something that benefits the Armed Forces?" Military strategists  read between lines: "The interests of the protectors?" The  almost dramatic answer was: "We have withdrawn the draft bill,  but beware the consequences." Watch out.    That same evening a cable television channel showed a  documentary on U.S. military operations in Panama when Noriega  was arrested. Was that mere coincidence or another  "demonstration?"    One can expect anything if this relationship between the  United States and the military leadership continues to be simply  horrible. What other names and prospects will appear on the  computer screens in the future?</p>

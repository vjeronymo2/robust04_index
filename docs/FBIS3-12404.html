At the forefront of these topics is the issue of sending  envoys to Washington to examine a number of matters,  particularly the need to guarantee international protection for  the Palestinian people, as well as the need to take effective  measures to disarm the settlers, to remove a number of  settlements which have been hotbeds of tension, and criminal  activities against the Palestinian people. These are necessary  prerequisites before the resumption of the peace process, which  came into being in order to provide security for the Palestinian  people and the rest of the region's peoples. However, such  security has been violated by armed gangs of settlers.    Moreover, the measures which were taken yesterday by the  Israeli Government do not constitute a practical step but merely  an exercise to cover up the crime. For this reason, curbing the  activities of settlers and the building of settlements in  general, and the provision of international protection are  fundamental requirements for the negotiations to take their  natural course.    Conversely, we have also been trying to table these issues  before the UN Security Council; we are hoping that a resolution,  which would guarantee international protection and the  disarmament of settlers, will be adopted in an effort by the  international community to help us to continue the peace process  to its final conclusion.</p>

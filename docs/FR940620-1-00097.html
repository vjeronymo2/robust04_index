Neither this clause, nor any action taken by the Government under this clause, creates or implies privity of contract between the Government and the Contractor's subcontractors or suppliers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Requests for information. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) The contracting officer may request the Contractor to provide sufficient information to enable the contracting officer to evaluate the Contractor's asserted restrictions. Such information shall be based upon the records required by this clause or other information reasonably available to the Contractor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Based upon the information provided, if the_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Contractor agrees that an asserted restriction is not valid, the contracting officer may_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at the Contractor's expense; or, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Return the computer software to the Contractor for correction at the Contractor's expense. If the Contractor fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected software to the contracting officer within sixty (60) days following receipt of the software the contracting officer may correct or strike the markings at that Contractor's expense. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Contracting officer concludes that the asserted restriction is appropriate for this contract, he or she shall so notify the Contractor in writing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The Contractor's failure to provide a timely response to a contracting officer's request for information or failure to provide sufficient information to enable the contracting officer to evaluate an asserted restriction shall constitute reasonable grounds for questioning the validity of an asserted restriction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Government right to challenge and validate asserted restrictions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) The Government, when there are reasonable grounds to do so, has the right to review and challenge the validity of any restrictions asserted by the Contractor on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software delivered, to be delivered under this contract, or otherwise provided to the Government in the performance of this contract. Except for software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made available without restrictions, the Government may exercise this right only within three years after the date(s) the software is delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government, or three years following final payment under this contract, whichever is later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The absence of a challenge to an asserted restriction shall not constitute validation under this clause. Only a contracting officer's final decision or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Challenge procedures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) A challenge must be in writing and shall_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Require the Contractor to respond within sixty (60) days; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

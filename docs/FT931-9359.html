			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Lithuanians likely to pick ex-communist as president A FORMER communist party boss and an emigre ambassador were the choices facing Lithuanian voters in yesterday's presidential elections. The contenders epitomise the confusion over how the small Baltic state can embark on the transition from communism to capitalism. Mr Algirdas Brazauskas, respected for splitting the Lithuanian communist party from Moscow three years ago, is tipped to win. He is riding high on a wave of popular discontent with every aspect of Lithuanian life from the lack of hot water to chaotic agricultural reforms. But Lithuania's ambassador to the US, Mr Stasys Lozoraitis, an emigre who has spent his adult life in the west, is expected to pick up a substantial number of votes with his warning that Mr Brazauskas is too rooted in the past to take the country into the future. Some supporters, citing the dubious nature of opinion polls, even hope for an upset win this morning. 'Lozoraitis can see things better than us from the outside,' said Mr Berute Vienazinviene, who is in her early 60s, as are both the candidates. 'I respect Brazauskas but you can't teach an old dog new tricks.' That opinion is shared by the Catholic Church, young people, and many educated and better-off Lithuanians who want to rejoin the capitalist west from which Lithuania was plucked by Soviet annexation in 1941. But peasants, disgruntled by hasty land reform in this agricultural nation, and others nostalgic for the safe Soviet past have been reassured by the promises of Mr Brazauskas who says that the 'burden of reform must be borne by the state not by ordinary people'. His renamed Democratic Labour party trounced Mr Zytautas Landsbergis, the nationalist leader, and his radical Sajudis movement in parliamentary elections last November. Even though this is unlikely, Mr Brazauskas also expects this week's negotiations with Russia will produce better terms for the supply of energy as the change to world prices has cut off hot water to Lithuanian homes. The tall former athlete has, in effect, halted privatisation pending a review. He has also pledged to soften financial policies agreed with the International Monetary Fund, which is soon expected to release the second tranche of a standby facility. The affable Mr Lozor-aitis meanwhile, looking every bit 'the American' he is perceived to be with his horn-rimmed spectacles and natty suits, has made no promises except to say: 'We must do something' to relieve the plight of the peasants and 'make something' of the obsolete industries inherited from Soviet rule. The truth is that neither candidate has a clear idea of what to do once in power, underlining the dilemma facing reformers in the former Soviet Union. While both have vowed to correct the mistakes made by Mr Landsbergis in his first year of independence, neither has a magic solution for coping with the country's limited resources, and for attracting badly needed foreign investment.</p>

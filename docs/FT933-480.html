			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Directors warn tax rise could harm recovery THE ARGUMENTS against tax rises in the November 30 Budget strengthened yesterday when the Institute of Directors and the Confederation of British Industry said higher taxes could harm the recovery. The comments add up to the sternest warnings yet that the upturn could be jeopardised by any extra taxes in the next financial year on top of the Pounds 6.7bn already announced. The institute and the CBI are trying to persuade Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to emphasise cuts in public spending in his effort to reduce the growing gap between state expenditure and revenues. The warnings underline anxiety that, despite promising growth in the first half of the year, the economy could sag over the next few months because of weak export demand and sluggish consumer spending. Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the institute, said recovery was 'uncertain'. Launching a package of policy ideas for the Budget, Mr Morgan said: 'We may need the consumer to come to the rescue (of the upturn). We certainly don't need any tax rises.' Mr Sudhir Junankar, CBI deputy head of economics, told a London conference: 'There is a risk that further tax rises may hit consumers and business confidence and hamper the pace of the recovery we expect over the year ahead.' He added that many people had yet to adjust to the tax increases pencilled in for next April. 'The government must avoid complacency and not take for granted the recovery that is now under way.' The institute is meeting Mr Clarke next month to press its suggestions for the Budget. Rather than tax increases - being considered by the Treasury as a way to reduce public borrowing, which is forecast to reach Pounds 50bn this financial year - the institute wants the chancellor to reduce public spending by Pounds 9bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 20bn the year after. Mr Morgan said the spending cut for next year, from the planned level of Pounds 296bn, could be achieved by relatively modest measures. These include more contracting out of government services and tight controls on pay and welfare spending. Although the chancellor has indicated that he will keep next year's spending at planned levels, Mr Morgan said he hoped to persuade the chancellor to 'revisit' the arguments. The institute also wants to see tax cuts of Pounds 1.3bn from next April in areas such as help for companies on business rates, tax relief for individuals sending their children to private schools, and reductions in inheritance tax. The Engineering Employers' Federation yesterday urged Mr Clarke to announce in the Budget an increase in tax allowances on investment from 25 per cent to 100 per cent. It said this would lay the foundations for a 'lasting recovery' by increasing industry's growth potential.</p>

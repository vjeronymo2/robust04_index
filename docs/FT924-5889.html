			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big spenders 'likely' to win Russian gas contract A GROUP of Russian companies is reported to be 'likely' to have won a huge contract to exploit a 3 trillion (million million) cubic metre (105 trillion cubic feet) gas deposit in the Barents Sea in competition with a consortium of leading Western companies - because the former could offer more jobs and spend more money in Russia. The contract has been said by Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, to be the harbinger of a 'new government policy in the area of the development of national industry'. It seems as though pressures from the powerful industrial lobby have forced the government to reassign the contract for the exploitation of the Shtockman gas field 600 km (370 miles) off Murmansk to the Rosshelf consortium of 19 leading Russian military manufacturers. The leading current affairs programme 'Itogi' (Results) said that promises on price, orders and employment were crucial - with the Rosshelf group claiming that the cost of their tender was 4 per cent lower than that of the Western consortium, promising to buy equipment worth Dollars 2.5bn and employ 250,000 people. It claimed the Western group would spend only Dollars 400m and employ 30,000 people. Itogi reported on Sunday night that Rosshelf would 'most probably' get the contract - one of the biggest such fields in the world. A final decision on this and other large projects is expected today or tomorrow. If the contract does go to Rosshelf, it will dash the long-cherished hopes of a consortium of Western companies, which includes Norsk Hydro, Conoco and three Finnish companies united under the title of the Barents Group. The group had an agreement to exploit the Shtockman Field since 1989: and although the contract was with the old Soviet Ministry of Oil and Gas, its successor, the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry, had accepted its validity. Mr Sven Brevik, Norsk Hydro's vice president in charge of exploration, said yesterday that 'we have as yet heard nothing from the government. There is a possibility, whatever the outcome, that we may co-operate with Rosshelf on the project, though we do not yet know how'. There is much frustration among the Western companies at the length of time it has taken to decide on the contract, and at apparent changes of mind on the part of the Russian authorities. They doubt the ability of Rosshelf to finance the project, or to establish expertise in offshore gas drilling. The government has for some time sought to establish 'rules of the game' favouring Russian companies, or at least foreign companies that pledged to use Russian products and labour.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ghazi al-'Ayyash] </F>   [Text] The Iraqi Cabinet follows up all that the press  publishes about issues dealing with citizens. The Interior  Ministry is one of the active ministries with regard to finding  solutions to many of the issues dealing with citizens that are  published in the press. Many people follow up on TV the interior  minister's, Watban Ibrahim al-Hasan, weekly meeting with  citizens, because this meeting is proof that the official is  seeking the truth and exposes it--in its entirety--extremely  frankly to citizens. In addition, the Interior minister's  willingness to listen to citizens encourages them to tell him  the whole truth without reluctance or fear. We would like to  thank the Cabinet for commenting on the article about the  absence of competition, which was published on 20 February 1994.  The Cabinet requested the Interior Ministry's views and comments  about the article. Following is the response that the Cabinet  received from the Interior Ministry and a copy that the ministry  sent us, while requesting our comments about its second  paragraph. The response states that the prices of sweet  potatoes, rose because of the increased demand for them during  the month of Ramadan and the decline of production during the  fall season. Sweet potato prices rose both before and after  Ramadan. This season's production is more than that of the last  season; prices for the last season did not reach more than half  those for this season. In spite of the fact that growers tried  to keep sweet potatoes in the ground as long as possible, there  is plenty of supply in markets this season. This fact reinforces  our statement. We also affirm that there are hundreds of trucks  loaded with sweet potatoes waiting at al-'Alawi so that sellers  could speculate on prices. The reason the high price reached 40  dinars per kilogram is that, although sweet potatoes have been  available in markets, so far, the Ministry of Agriculture has  not yet fixed their price.    To the Cabinet Secretariat:    Please accept the ministry's best regards...    Referring to your correspondence M/2136 of 22 February 1994,  we would like to make the following remarks:    1. The ministry's responsible department continues to  monitor  and follow up all factors that may impact on the easy flow of  exposed goods. As a result of this monitoring, a large number of  violators are apprehended daily in the different distribution  centers and subjected to the required legal procedures. For  example, during the two months of January and February 1994,  4,079 violators were apprehended.    2. The article referred to sweet potato prices in the  domestic markets. It should be indicated that prices for sweet  potatoes have not yet been fixed, therefore, the prices rose  because of both the greater demand for sweet potatoes during the  month of Ramadan and the decrease in the production of the fall  season. The statement in the article referring to the hundreds  of loaded trucks at al-'Alawi awaiting the highest prices  possible is not a precise one, because prices of sweet potatoes  in the domestic market are subject to the mechanism of supply  and demand.    3. There are a few major reasons for the fact that grocery  stores do not adhere to the prices fixed for goods such as sweet  potatoes and cauliflower. One of the reasons is that grocery  stores are distributed over large geographical areas. Baghdad is  a case in point where grocery stores are to be found on all  streets--big and small. Another reason is that Baghdad's  distribution centers work around the clock. A third reason is  that citizens do not cooperate, and many of them are not aware  of the prices of goods, which are not made public by the media.    We would also like to indicate that the Economics Department  held some meetings with representatives of sales offices and  grocery store owners to enlighten them and indicated to them the  necessity of adhering to fixed prices as this matter concerns  citizens' daily food. We are also monitoring those producers who  are not selling their products at al-'Alawi; legal procedures  such as impounding, confiscating goods, imposing fines, and  closing sales offices have been taken against violators. This is  for your information, with our appreciation.    Watban Ibrahim al-Hasan    Interior Minister</p>

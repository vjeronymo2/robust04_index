			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "pol"] </F>   [Text] Plzen--The Skoda Jaderne Strojirenstvi [Nuclear  Engineering] Plzen company will supply compact grids for the  spent fuel pool of the Rivne nuclear power station in Ukraine.  Twenty percent of the order has already been paid for. Another  60 percent of the payment is due to arrive in the next few days.  If it does, Jaderne Strojirenstvi will supply the corresponding  part of the ordered equipment by the end of June.    According to Vaclav Lobovsky, director of Skoda Jaderne  Strojirenstvi, this contract should, first and foremost, explore  the ability of Ukrainian nuclear power stations to pay. Jaderne  Strojirenstvi had signed a letter of intent with Derzhkomatom  [State Committee for Nuclear Energy], their umbrella  organization.    Skoda hopes to obtain $150 million (4.5 billion korunas)  worth of orders on the basis of this contract, to be realized  gradually until the end of the year 2000. This is the sum at  which the letter of intent estimates the needs of the four  Ukrainian nuclear power stations equipped with VVER  [water-moderated water-cooled] reactors--Rivne, South Ukrainian,  Zaporizhzhya, and Khmelnytskyy.    According to Karel Wagner from Skoda Jaderne Strojirenstvi,  who participated in a seminar on Czech regulatory drives in the  South Ukrainian nuclear power station, Skoda's program has been  received well. By its design, the equipment offered by Skoda  also enhances the nuclear power stations' safety.    In addition to reactor grids and drives for regulatory  systems, Skoda Jaderne Strojirenstvi wants to assert itself on  the Ukrainian market with hermetic cable bushings [kabelove  hermeticke pruchodky], spare parts, and operational inspections  of the pressure vessels.</p>

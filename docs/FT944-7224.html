			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kiln Capital raises Pounds 25m in placing Kiln Capital, a planned new listed company investing in Lloyd's of London, has raised Pounds 25m via a share placing. Kiln plans to invest exclusively in insurance syndicates managed by the RJ Kiln managing agency, unlike many other Lloyd's investment companies which have spread funds across a range of syndicates. Dealings are expected to start on December 1. The company has also made an offer to some Names to subscribe for up to 2m ordinary shares at 100p each. Plans for corporate investment in Lloyd's have been affected this year by the lacklustre performance of existing corporate vehicles. Mr Colin Murray, chairman of RJ Kiln, said he was 'delighted' with the response to date.</p>

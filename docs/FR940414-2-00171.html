In developing its recommendations, the Advisory Committee shall consider a wide range of policy alternatives, including policies affecting: (i) Demand for personal vehicle travel; (ii) vehicle and fuel technology changes (including increases in vehicle and fuel system operating efficiency); and (iii) shifts in consumer choice among vehicle and fuel technology options. Policies to be considered will focus on those that can be implemented by the federal government, but such policies will be considered in the context of what can and should be accomplished at the state, local and regional levels, and by private parties, both consumers and producers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Remarks by President Fidel Castro to unidentified members </F> of Colombian solidarity groups at Cartagena de Indias on 16 June  -- recorded]    [Text] [Crowd applauds, chants: "Fidel, Fidel, Fidel!"  Unidentified speaker shouts: "Long live the Cuban Revolution!"  Crowd shouts: "Viva!"]    [Castro] We have just held a meeting with an important group  of businessmen and industrialists from Cartagena, Barranquilla,  Colombia. Then suddenly I came over to meet with the solidarity  groups. Well, those persons I talked with are magnificent  people. Really. I was positively impressed. Many are already  working; many have economic operations with Cuba. They export  products, but they not only export products, they purchase  products, especially numerous products from the pharmaceutical  and biotechnology industry. In other words, trade between our  two countries is being quickly developed.    Since it was such an abrupt change, I said: What is this?  First I was told I would say something, then others would follow  and say something. I said: Well, I have realized it is better  for me say something, and then you can ask some questions.  Things will be easy this way and I will not get confused here  and start talking about plywood, lumber, airlines, tourism,  merchandise, and all those things. [laughs] Well, we will help  one another, a dialogue rather than a speech, and to answer  questions, things you are interested in about the summit or  whatever, meaning things about our country. I can tell you about  things you are interested in.    First of all, I want to state our profound gratitude for  your  hospitality, for everyone's hospitality, in Cartagena, Colombia,  particularly for your hospitality. I have seen you everywhere.  Wherever I went, I saw people who looked like you. [laughter,  applause] The faces, enthusiasm, warmth, hospitality everywhere  we went within our busy schedule. Our schedule was very busy.  Really. You know how the summits are. If you do not know, I will  tell you. [laughter] I have tirelessly said this.    Based on my experience with the nonaligned-countries  meetings  -- Cuba hosted the sixth summit in 1979 and almost 100 heads of  state and government attended it -- I say that heads of state  and government are the most undisciplined people in the world.  [laughter] Obviously, I cannot say the same about the  illustrious colleagues with whom I met recently. Perhaps they  can become disorganized in a nonaligned meeting, but here they  were very organized.    In the nonaligned-countries summits, when it was time to  hold  meetings, apparently many people like what I like, meaning that  the meetings... [pauses] I am not talking about meetings like  this, which are so pleasant. I am talking about the work  meetings we have in the government and the party. I have always  said that what I like most about meetings are the recesses.  [laughter] However, [chuckles] what many of these heads of state  like most is to attend these meetings once in awhile. The rest  of the time they come from all over the world and hold bilateral  meetings; greet friends; and, when it is time for a morning  session, the place is empty, there is no one. The ones from  Africa are gathered here; those from other places are gathered  elsewhere; and so on and so forth.    That is why they give the impression of being undisciplined.  Some of them arrive and others follow; and, when a speaker is  scheduled to take the floor early in the morning, war breaks out  [laughter] because they do not want to address an empty hall. At  least the halls were full here; people attended the meetings;  and they behaved in a disciplined way. It was a positive  impression. The schedule was busy, like I said, and bilateral  meetings were held in the morning or in the evening. Actually,  there was no time in the morning or in the evening. A meeting  was scheduled for 0700.    I slept three hours the first day. I went to sleep at 0400  and I was back on my feet at 0700 -- no, I was back on my feet  at 0600. We had to bathe and all that. It was actually three  hours -- from 0300 to 0600. The second day, I broke the record  and slept five hours. That was a phenomenon. I do not know how I  managed that, between 0200 and 0700. The third day, meaning last  night, I slept two and a half hours. Things ended very late. I  had to leave a table [laughter] because the heads of state were  leaving and only a few people remained there. I had breakfast at  2300; I literally had breakfast at 2300. I had drunk some coffee  and some juice -- nothing else, not even some milk. At 2300, I  managed to sit at a long table they had there. Well, I began to  eat calmly -- not much. When you are in a hurry the best thing  is to eat a little. I said I had to leave because... [pauses] I  saw Gabriel Garcia Marquez sitting there with other people, and  I wanted to go sit over there. I was tired of so much protocol  but, like I said, I had eaten very little. I had a little bit of  desert. I was served two small slices of coconut pie. I said:  Well, I will eat a little bit of fiber. [chuckles] When I was  halfway through the first slice of coconut pie, I was told: Let  us go. [laughter] I had to get up. [chuckles] I asked: Why? Has  something happened here? I was interrupted halfway through the  small slice of coconut pie. [laughter]    Aside from that, I think I will have to visit the doctor to  check my ears because... [pauses] To tell you the truth, it was  a splendid concert with artists from many countries, including a  Cuban artist, Carlos Vives, who was presented at the end, but  someone's equipment must have broken down and they could not  lower the volume. I think more cannon volleys were fired there  than during the Battle of Berlin [laughter] because it was very  noisy. There were moments when my ears hurt. I was not the only  one whose ears hurt. I had to cover one of my ears. I feigned it  like this [laughter] and I leaned back. [laughs] I was actually  covering my ear because the noise was unbearable.    Anyway, we ended the meeting very late. I do not know why I  had to get up. Perhaps people had to leave. I was told to get up  and I asked why we had to get up. I could not even finish my  slice of pie. What else could I do? I bid everyone farewell and  moved over to Garcia Marquez' table. I felt liberated there. I  had finally shaken off the burden of so much ceremony and the  pressure of so many political leaders. I found a group of  friends there -- I did not know some of them, but they were  magnificent people -- and I stayed there for about two hours.  That was why I slept so little last night. It is my fault, but I  felt free there. I said: I come seeking asylum here. I come  seeking asylum here. [laughter, applause]    The funny thing is Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin  passed by after we had been talking for some time. I told her: I  have sought asylum here. She answered: Very well, we welcome  you. [laughter, applause] I said: Come here, Noemi. What kind of  asylum are you thinking about? [laughter] I sought asylum at  this table, you know, but I am firmly determined to return to  Cuba. I want to have at least a small plot of land where I can  rest, since so much is being said about eternal rest. Just  imagine that, I said. [laughs] A small plot of land. [laughter,  applause]    Those are anecdotes about the summit but the summit's  schedule was certainly busy; and delays occurred because they  tried to schedule too many things for such a small amount of  time, and there was simply not enough time. Two days were not  enough for such a busy schedule despite the hospitality,  organization, and great security measures. The security measures  organized by the Navy and Public Force members was excellent.  Obviously, we were much more calm. Well, we are used to being  calm everywhere.    You know that when we travel, there is immediately a flurry  of activity since the hunting license has been established.  [laughter] Even though hunting restrictions exist in the world;  even though animals are protected; even though you cannot hunt  whales, and rightfully so; and you cannot hunt lions and  rhinoceros -- particularly the rhinoceros, because it is  reported the rhinoceros' horn has I do not know what kind of  aphrodisiac properties. [laughter] People go around killing  rhinos, and they will exterminate the rhinoceros. Nevertheless,  [chuckles] I am the only species for which there is no closed  season in the year. [laughter, applause]    Ever since the CIA planned the first attempts to eliminate  me, I have not been lucky enough to be left alone. They are  always trying to see how they can get me wherever I move. I must  be like an eel... [laughter] for I am very difficult to catch  and I get away. [laughter] There are always people from Miami at  ceremonies like this, not just reporters from  counterrevolutionary stations, but many disguised as reporters.  I will never forget that during a visit to Chile many years ago,  there were several cameras in front of me and one of them had a  gun inside it. The cameraman was posing as a Venezuelan  journalist, with a gun. I was right in front of him.  Fortunately, they are not suicidal, they are not fanatics. Those  are the dangerous ones, the crazy ones. These are crazy, but  they are crazy for money. [chuckles] They want to enjoy that  money in this life. [laughter]    This has occurred many times, meaning the organized hunts.  They mobilize people if we go to this or that place; if we go to  Spain. They want to see what opportunity they have, what chance  they have. I do not tell you this to pose as a courageous  person, only to give you an idea of how difficult it is to  travel. They are around; they are the last ones to leave because  they are paid to cause problems, make things difficult, create  scandals if possible. They watch the hotel entrance and  sometimes it is difficult to leave. That is how it has been. It  is not an easy task, but that is how it has been. It has been  rich in experiences, very interesting.    There is something we have not lacked at any time: the  warmth  and hospitality of the people in Cartagena, and that encourages  us a great deal. I have had to sign some autographs even though  I am not an artist [laughter] and I have had to pose for some  pictures. I may eventually become blind, given the number of  flashes I have had to see in my life. Well, that is the price of  fame. Whom do I have to thank for that fame? The Yankees.  [laughter, applause]    While in South Africa, while in South Africa, [repeats  himself] we attended a luncheon and many people, a lot of  people, came over to greet us. I got up with pleasure and  greeted all of them. That day I was really hungry; it was not so  late, but there is seldom time to eat during these trips, but it  was useless. I was not able to taste anything while I was there.  I had to sign autographs and pose for pictures with many of the  political leaders who went there.    The Americans were not far away. They do not like that.  This administration is resigned to it, however. They take it in  stride. The Bush and Reagan administrations would get furious  when I went somewhere and was treated well. They got the image  they worked at. It bothers them beyond measure that there are  people in every corner of the world who are kind and hospitable.  A reporter came by and asked me why kings, princes -- I do not  recall how many other things he added -- come to greet me. I  answered: Let me tell you; it is thanks to the Americans. I did  not say Yankees because there are times when one has to be  courteous [laughter]. He laughed and went straight to the  Americans to tell the vice president right away. Some people saw  him.    The Americans who went to the presidential inauguration in  South Africa behaved mostly courteously; several of them came by  to greet us. The climate is different. Undoubtedly, there was  great affection from the ANC and the South African people. They  reminded us, since it was not our place to remind them, of the  significance of the Cuito Cuanavale battle, the significance of  our cooperation with the Angolan people. A country as small as  Cuba deployed up to 50,000 soldiers. We helped them battle the  South African aggression. The results of those combats were  decisive in accelerating the process of the end of apartheid.  [applause] The South Africans were all saying it. They were  coming by and stating it with much love and affection.    That is how it happened. Even the U.S. media acknowledged  it.  I was not seeking that. They might make an official resign for  taking his picture with me. Several did however, and some of  them are high up. They approached and greeted me. I said to one:  I congratulate you; you are courageous. He asked me why. I  replied: Because you had the courage to come and greet me. Do  you know what he did? About five minutes later he came back with  more photographers and said: Let us have our picture taken  again, to make sure. It was a very courageous gesture. [laughter]    There are bitter moments, hard work, threats, all those  things, but there is also the tremendous inspiration of knowing  there are so many noble people in the world, so many generous  people, so many people who do not let others fool them, so many  people who do allow others to manipulate their brains as is done  with a child, and people who recognize the effort -- not my  personal efforts -- none of us is anything without the people,  none of us is anything without the effort and sacrifice of the  millions of people who struggled and made the Revolution  possible, who have supported it, and who are defending it. I am  aware that it is our people and their efforts and sacrifices to  whom the many noble people in the world wish to express  recognition, affection, and support. I have seen it here among  you in particular. I have seen in this hospitable, warm land,  where we have felt great encouragement because the fight -- and  we have been fighting and waging a very difficult battle for  many years -- requires encouragement. This encouragement  sustains us, we live on this encouragement. This is why we  appreciate, with much fervor and affection, the deep solidarity  and support you have provided during these difficult times.  These are among the most difficult times we have experienced, in  a struggle against the blockade, a struggle against a  restrengthened blockade, a struggle against the efforts of our  mighty neighbors to the north to make us surrender by hunger, to  force us to give up, and to force us to our knees. Yet, we will  cut off our legs rather than bow our heads. [applause]    [Unidentified speaker] Using Marti's words: In the world,  there are more flowers than snakes. You can be assured that here  you will always find a garden to support the dignity of the  Cuban people. [applause]    [Unidentified speaker] Commander Fidel, accept my salute of  sincere friendship and boundless and disinterested solidarity  from this group, as well as all the solidarity groups working  jointly today throughout Colombia. We want you to know that we  are increasing our efforts and thoughts that you may remain,  with the same physical and spiritual integrity, at the helm of  your people for the good of the Third World community. Thank  you. [applause]    [Unidentified speaker] I am also carrying a gift, a sign of  affection for our beloved commander. [applause, laughter]    [Unidentified speaker] From the city of Barranquilla -- 100  km from Cartagena -- a delegation has come to express to you the  love of the Colombian people and the deep admiration we all feel  for the great political and social work that you have carried  out, not only on behalf of the Cuban people, but also on behalf  of all the peoples of the world, who see in you and in Marti's  people, the best example of dignity in history. [applause]    [Unidentified speaker] Commander Fidel Castro, comrades  from Cuba and Colombia: The Cartagena University Professionals  Club is honored and proud to have in its midst a man of the  historic stature of Fidel Castro. It had always been our dream  to meet, greet, and listen to the dialectic and depth of his  oratory, and his characteristic wit. We feel truly happy to have  with us this hero who we so highly revere and whose good works  we have seen.    My dear friends, I dare guarantee that we are privileged to  have here, in front of our eyes, such a great man, who is, I  believe, after Simon Bolivar, the greatest in history. [applause]    I want to point out this historic moment, not only for  Cartagena, but also for the Professionals Club. I am going to  ask our illustrious commander to do us the favor of writing his  name on this wall because from today on, this hall will be  named: Fidel Castro's. [applause, crowd chants: Fidel! Fidel!  Fidel! Viva Commander Fidel Castro! Viva! Down with the Yankee  blockade! Down!]    [Unidentified speaker] On behalf of the youth present here  who represent a Solidarity with Cuba committee, we wish to  present this humble banner to you, Commander. The banner reads:  Thanks, Commander, for making so much dignity possible.  [applause]    [Unidentified speaker] On behalf of the friends of Cuba in  Cali, who are very numerous, I have the deep honor of relaying  the deepest message of solidarity to the commander in chief, and  to tell him that Cali, in the most humble and simple manner,  support the entire epic of the Cuban people because we know that  the Cuban epic is our epic, the epic of mankind that struggles  with hope and struggles to live in a better world.    I would also like to respectfully ask your opinion on the  path the Colombian solidarity campaigns, and possibly Latin  American campaigns, ought to take. We would like to hear what is  the most appropriate form that the expressions of solidarity  ought to take at this time. Thank you. [applause]    [Castro] We are truly waging a war for our survival in light  of our northern neighbor's attempt to force our surrender by  starving, choking, drowning, and crushing us. Our neighbor also  tries to isolate us. What you are doing is waging a battle  against isolation. What are you doing is waging a battle against  the blockade. You have spontaneously understood and seen that  for us, this is main path of the struggle right now to resist  the efforts of the most powerful nation in the world, which  today rules unchallenged. This fulfills what Bolivar and Marti  prophesied could happen in this hemisphere. This is what is  taking place practically worldwide. We could say that we are  involved in that Biblical struggle, the struggle of David and  Goliath. We need support because this battle has to be won  morally and politically. Above all, by winning the moral battle,  one wins everything.    I already told you about what happened in South Africa. I  believe that impressed the U.S. observers at the summit. I have  really not mentioned this much because I do not want them to  conduct a witch hunt against those people who came to greet me.  I see that this relates to the same thing. If they see that in  spite of the deluge of campaigns, calumnies, and lies against  Cuba... [pauses] What has fallen upon our small country, upon  our people, and upon our struggle is a true deluge, greater even  than the Biblical deluge. Yet, this deluge has not been able to  fool everyone. It has not been able to prevent the fact that in  so many parts of the world, through instinct and out of an  elementary sense of direction that each human being has, only  some of the people can be fooled. There are many who cannot be  fooled, however. Thus, we have people who react the way you do.    This encourages us and truly gives us hope. As I said, that  is what we need, that is our strength, that is our lifeline. We  are overwhelmed with emotion by what you have done and by what  you do today. We could not imagine anything more affectionate,  hospitable, and noble. You cannot imagine the power that this  has. That enormous wall must be destroyed with this.    I too studied the Bible because I studied in Jesuit schools.  I spent about 12 years studying at La Salle school. I had to  study the Bible every year. I cannot forget the story of the  walls of Jericho. The story goes that at the end, with trumpets  -- I believe it was Joshua -- some of you may be more up to date  on this. It was Joshua, right? The story is that with trumpets  they destroyed the walls. I say that men and women like you  around the world will destroy the modern walls of this gigantic  Jericho, which today attempts to defeat and crush Cuba, the  Cuban Revolution, and Cuba's independence, and tries to destroy  the brotherhood and unity among all our peoples. [applause]    [Unidentified speaker] Fidel, our children know you. They  love you and they love Cuba, and we love our Cuban children.  [applause]    [Unidentified speaker] Fidel, all of us in this room, or the  majority of us here have lived the Cuban Revolution. We have  seen the new man that comes from Cuba. We have witnessed the  commander who did put aside war to talk about fraternity and  awareness, that you come to a meeting or summit and say that you  can perceive the will of noble people, and the men who truly  want the new being of Cuba to become the new man of Latin  America.    I believe it is important that this disparagement be  overcome. I believe North America has a reality, a terrible and  inhumane reality, where Latin people are starving, where some  live way above others, where an underworld exists, and that  underworld of savage capitalism must disappear. I believe we  must demonstrate that truth. Just as the Cubans in Miami  demonstrate superfluous glory, it is important to demonstrate  how this superfluous glory destroys many lives and kills many  people through starvation. [applause]    [Unidentified speaker] I have seen the newscasts on  television, and they keep saying that you have changed your  attire for a guayabera. If you have always dressed in your  uniform, why change now? [laughter]    [Castro] My dear, I am going to tell you what happened. I  was  told that they had requested all visitors to wear guayaberas or  regular shirts. All they had to say was that it was so hot, and  we would have brought t-shirts or no shirts at all.    As you can see, I had a problem because I have my old  habits.  I said to myself: What should I do about my hosts? Before,  everyone would attend the summits in business suits. I attended  those summits in my usual outfit. As a matter of fact, one  reporter once asked me about my outfit and I told him those were  the outfits I wore when I was in the mountains. I like them,  these are my outfits; they are very comfortable. I do not have  to keep up with the fads, changing the cut or the design. It is  very inexpensive.    I also have a dress suit. I call it that not because it has  too many ornaments or anything else, but because it is a  suitcoat, a tie, and slacks. It is a suitcoat unlike the one I  wear everyday to work, and sometimes I attend ceremonies in that  if I do not have time to put the other suit on.    I know that some criticized me. Some began to make up  stories. Not everybody, but some would say that I was the only  one who attended the summits in a uniform. It seems that they  wanted to associate the idea of my uniform with a who-knows-what  idea or experience that they may have had in their countries, or  perhaps wanted to portray me as a militarist or something to  that effect.    I have received no increase in rank, however. I have the  same  rank I had when I disembarked from the Granma. [applause] I was  commander because there were lieutenants, captains, and  commanders. There were three captains, one commander, and  several lieutenants. That is all there was. I remained  commander. I was the only one who was not promoted. But I was  commander in chief... [pauses] I retained that title and rank.  We fought the war and we won. We fought in the Bay of Pigs; we  fought in many places to carry out important internationalist  missions. Many people have received rank. There came a point  when our forces were so big that just with the three ranks, it  was impossible to keep up.    But I always felt love for the rank I held, which was my  first rank, and I always dressed in the uniform.    There are exceptions. I can assure you that I do not sleep  in  my uniform. [laughter] Every once in a while I will wear pajamas  or something similar. If I go to the beach, something I like  very much, I do not go swimming or scuba diving in my uniform.  [laughter] Instead I wear shorts and practice my sports  activities.    But there was a history and tradition. The request was for a  shirt or guayabera. It would not have been appropriate for me to  be in uniform while the others were in shirts. I thought to  myself: Which one of the two will I wear? The one I call the  formal suit would not be appropriate. I thought: Should I wear  my daily uniform? They would have begun talking about the  uniform. I believe I had not worn a guayabera since I was a  student. That was not too long ago [laughter], but it was some  time ago. Then I decided to demonstrate that I was not afraid of  wearing a guayabera.    There are some who have said that I wear a bullet-proof  vest. The only bullet-proof vest I wear are my morals.  [applause] When you can keep your head high and your conscience  clean, then you... [pauses] When you challenge the enemy, it is  just like lions do. You have seen the lion trainers in the  circus with the whip. Later, he turns his back on the lion and  the lion remains calm. Sometimes I must turn my back on the lion  and I am at ease.    The enemy is always making plans. I more or less hinted at  that before. I am talking about assassination plots everywhere I  go. There are many groups that know they have impunity to do  this, to organize all types of plans.    Some were concerned. The comrades in charge of security were  worried about the carriage ride. They were worried about this  because it was 40 minutes among buildings, and with a horse that  would walk slowly. Our horse actually had a bad temper.  [laughter] We almost had an accident. It crashed into the  carriage ahead of us. I believe I was in the third carriage and  our horse ran into the carriage in front of us.    They almost convinced me because one should not argue with  the people in charge of security. One must listen to them and  negotiate with them. They had arrived at the conclusion that I  should not participate in the carriage ride. They had me almost  convinced. I was looking at the paintings at the Naval museum,  but I felt uneasy. I finally told the comrades, I am going for  the carriage ride. I told them that it was very difficult for me  to play the role of a coward. I do not want anyone to say that I  came here to Barranquilla and did not take a carriage ride.    [Crowd interrupting] Cartagena!    [Castro] That is right. I came to Cartagena representing  Barranquilla and all of Colombia [applause] that I came to  Cartagena and did not ride in the carriage. Then it occurred to  me: Who will I invite? [laughter] It occurred to me that I would  invite Gabo [Gabriel Garcia Marquez]. I said to him: Gabo, I  invite you to come with me. [laughter] I am a bad friend.  [laughter] Climb aboard with me. [chuckles] I told Mercedes  Garcia Marquez: Mercedes, do not worry, if you are going to be  widowed, it is better that you become widowed while you are  still young. [laughter] So, there is no problem. [chuckles] I  took Gabo with me and we went for the ride and it was fantastic.    That is how it is. So that is why I wore the guayabera. The  nice thing about the guayabera is that everyone praised it.  [applause] I did not even know how this guayabera would turn out  because I did not know how this beard would look with a white  guayabera. Well, I finally made the decision to wear the  guayabera and I must say I liked it. [laughter]    I still have not decided if I am going to take the plane in  the guayabera and change while I am in the airplane, or if I  will arrive in Havana in guayabera. [applause]    These are the reasons, but no, I will return to my uniform.    [Unidentified speaker] This poetry book reads: To Fidel,  father. [applause]    [Castro] The first thing I wanted to say is that I  congratulate Cartagena, I congratulate all of Colombia for  hosting the Fourth Latin American Summit. It would be hard to  find a more hospitable and beautiful city for this task. I would  like to say that not all that is desired is attained in these  summits. These summits have the singificance of being the first  time, almost, in Latin American history that we have met on our  own without having others summon us. It is the fourth time.  [applause]    If we speak of integration and unity, we must begin by  meeting. Not every head of state has exactly the same views and  the number of political ideas are very heterogeneous. The mere  fact of meeting to discuss issues of mutual interest always  means getting closer; leaders get to know one another. It is a  first step, an important first step. It is so important that our  northern neighbors felt envious; they were worried, and invented  a summit there, of all places, in Miami. [Crowd: Down with the  Miami summit!]    If they invite me, I will calmly go. [laughter] But they  have already said not to think or even dream about it. They have  truly committed an act of cowardice. They did not want me there.  They are afraid of ideas, of words. [applause] They are afraid  of the truth, and chose Miami on the basis of domestic politics  -- that is the truth. It is an important state because there is  a group, not a majority, but they are the ones that make more  noise. They have more resources. They have lobbies. They have  representatives in Congress and make great efforts so the  blockade against Cuba is strengthened, for greater hostility and  threats against Cuba.    They exert enormous pressure and the U.S. Government takes  this pressure into consideration, thinking about the next  election, when in fact many members of that community are  economic emigres, just like there are millions of Colombian,  Dominican, Puerto Rican, and Mexican economic emigres. That is  why they are building a wall that is higher than the Berlin  Wall, to prevent the Mexicans from crossing over. All the  technical means possible are used to stop them. Well, many of  these people are economic emigres and they oppose the blockade  and aggression.    You have no idea how they treated the representatives of the  Cuban communities in the Miami area and throughout the United  States when they went to a meeting in Cuba. They were treated  with fascist methods, truly fascist methods. Those people are  full of hate and the desire for revenge. [Words indistinct] what  part of the country each one gets. That is how they think about  our country; those are the people who want to own the country.  That is why we were not invited to the summit -- quite the  contrary.    I said: It does not matter if we do not go. The important  thing is what will be done and what will be demanded at the  summit because there are many things to demand there,  face-to-face. They have the opportunity to tell it like it is. I  hope that at least a few of them decide to tell it like it is  and make demands and defend the interests of Latin America and  the Caribbean. That summit, however, is a result of this one,  and this one must be defended. Once there was talk of holding  these summits every two years. No, every year. This is  important, very important. It represents a big step forward and  I think that the fact that it was held in this city and with  great success truly represents a source of pride. Efforts were  exerted so the summit would be a brilliant event. If the program  is too long, however, sometimes... [pauses] They wanted to do so  much for their visitors that there was practically no time for  everything, but the cordial, warm attitude of the people, the  city's authorities, and everyone was evident. I want to use this  opportunity to congratulate you. I hope this summit becomes part  of our history.    I am also deeply touched to hear, like I heard here, that  people have come from faraway places. They had to travel  hundreds of km. People have come here even from Cali. I think a  bus or two buses brought them. Others came from Santa Fe de  Bogota and other places. They had to make great sacrifices to do  so. In my opinion, this increases the importance of this  meeting, of this event. In my eyes, this increases the noble,  generous, supportive, human character of the Colombians. In my  eyes, it heightens the pride of being part of this Latin  American family.    We will be united one day. We will not have the right to  mention Simon Bolivar's name and Jose Marti's name with honor  until we are a truly united Latin America like they dreamed; so  we are a force to be reckoned with; so we have a place in the  world; so we are respected by others; so we do not become a  balkanized continent, an easy victim of those who have always  wanted to seize control, an easy victim of those who want to  plunder us. We have the same language, a privilege Europe does  not have -- yet Europe is uniting to survive. What kind of  future do we have, divided in a thousand pieces, if there are  great economic and political powers? We have the same culture,  which is something the Europeans do not have; we have the same  language, which is something they do not have; we have the same  origins, which is something they do not have.    What a vision Bolivar had back then! He thought about this  when there were no roads, trains, airplanes, communications,  telephones like this one. What are they called? [people answer:  "Cellular telephones."] Cellular telephones and all these things  that allow you to contact Patagonia in a minute. Bolivar rode a  horse, he travelled by horse, yet he dreamed about uniting this  hemisphere. We must be capable of uniting in modern times, with  all the means of communication we have. One feels pride that our  brothers are people like you and people like the Bolivians,  Peruvians, Brazilians, and the Central Americans, because the  people are everywhere, like an immense mine. The conquerors  looked for gold all over the place -- tens of millions of  Indians died when they were forced to look for gold -- yet they  did not know that the heart of only one of the hundreds of  millions of Latin Americans contains more gold than all the gold  that existed in the heart of this hemisphere! [applause] I  perceive this wealth in our people; I perceive their  intelligence; I perceive their ability, and I know we have the  right to a future and we will conquer that future.    Together we wage a battle today -- you and I, you and our  people -- so our homeland may survive, so the revolution may  survive. That trench must never fall into the hands of the  powerful empire [applause] because it would become another  weapon to seize control. The day before he died, Marti said  everything he had done so far for Cuba's independence was to  prevent the United States from extending its dominance over  American lands. We are fulfilling the most sacred precepts of  our predecessors and those who started this long process. Time  will not defeat us ever, and someday we will be the strong,  indestructible nation they dreamed about. You are the best proof  of this. Thank you, a thousand times thank you! [applause] If  they tell you our plane could not take off, it would be for one  reason -- the enormous cargo of emotions and gratitude we take  with us after meeting with you! [applause]</p>

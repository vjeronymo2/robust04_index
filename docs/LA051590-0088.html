			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET NEWSLETTER;  </P> <P> 'FORTRESS EUROPE': THE FEAR FADES;  </P> <P> LOOKING AHEAD TO 1992, EUROPEANS HAVE SPUN OUT REAMS OF RULES TO DEFINE THE  UNIFIED MARKET. AND DESPITE SOME NAGGING CONCERNS, THE U.S. IS LESS NERVOUS  ABOUT ACCESS AND PROTECTIONISM.  </P> <P> Visions of a Fortress Europe -- the fear that the European drive to create an  integrated market by 1992 would lead to increased protectionism -- have abated,  but some nagging problems remain.  </P> <P> Despite a few skirmishes at the start, U.S. policy-makers and businessmen agree  that the Europeans by and large have kept their promises to make the new  "single market" open to Europeans and foreigners alike.  </P> <P> While there are "some serious concerns and problems with specific EC (European  Community) policies, . . . they are overshadowed by the growth opportunities  presented by the EC market," a new report issued by the National Assn. of  Manufacturers concludes.  </P> <P> Michael Calingaert, a Brussels-based EC-watcher for the Pharmaceutical  Manufacturers Assn., said: "I always thought that 'Fortress Europe' was a  rather silly dialogue on both sides. I think the whole discourse has moved into  the background."  </P> <P> That buoyant assessment has been borne out in practice by the burst of  directives and regulations that the EC has issued to lay the groundwork for  1992. About 145 of them have been formally adopted so far -- out of 282  originally expected -- and more are coming each day. Stanley Crossick, a  partner in Belmont, a Brussels-based consulting firm that keeps tabs on the  1992 effort for U.S. corporations, says the consensus is that both on these and  on larger issues, the EC "has been sensitive" to U.S. concerns.  </P> <P> A banking directive was drastically overhauled after Washington complained it  might discriminate against U.S. financial institutions. And Eurocrats are  giving U.S. firms an early look at new regulations so that they can voice any  complaints before the rules are adopted.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, American firms are riding a wave of trade with Europe.  </P> <P> The $22.6-billion trade deficit the United States ran with EC countries in 1986  has turned into a $1.5-billion surplus. "The growth in EC demand for U.S.  exports should continue," the NAM report says.  </P> <P> American investment in Europe is also accelerating.  </P> <P> To be sure, even the most optimistic Eurowatchers concede that the road to 1992  will not be entirely bump-free. The Europeans are playing much tougher with  Japan, forcing Tokyo to set stiff export limits on cars and insisting that  Japan buy parts and labor in the 12 EC nations.  </P> <P> And U.S. officials point out that while the policy-making European Commission  may seem open-minded in setting broad policies on 1992, there still is a danger  that it will succumb to demands for protection from individual industries  before a new, integrated market is in place. "What we're concerned about is not  Fortress Europe," an American-based EC-watcher for a major U.S. corporation  declared. "What we're concerned about is the (European) Commission giving  relief to specific industries."  </P> <P> U.S. firms are also nervously eyeing a spate of second-level issues, from  buy-European provisions in government procurement guidelines to regulations  governing local content and place of origin.  </P> <P> "The concern of people now is to see how the nitty-gritty things work out,"  said Eamonn J. Bates, a partner in Bernard Krief Europe, another Brussels-based  EC-watching firm that represents American corporations and other foreign-based  companies.  </P> <P> Among the items on current U.S. watch lists:  </P> <P> Standards, testing and certification. The Europeans, by promising to show  Americans proposed new standards earlier and permitting U.S. testing labs to  act as surrogates in certifying products, have gone a long way toward meeting  earlier U.S. fears that the certification process would act to bar U.S.  products.  </P> <P> But the issue remains far from fully resolved. While Europe has consolidated  its testing into two or three laboratories that serve the entire continent, the  U.S. system involves separate, industry-run labs for each sector. American  industry is divided over whether the United States should make its system more  compatible with Europe's.  </P> <P> Rules of origin, local content and sectoral issues. Although the EC has no  broad-scale policies mandating that goods be produced either partly or largely  in Europe, it has moved toward minimum requirements for TV program production,  electronics and autos.  </P> <P> U.S. strategists fret that the number could grow before the 1992 process is  fully in effect. The European Commission ruled last February that microchip  makers will have to fabricate their wafers in Europe to qualify for new EC  trade preferences.  </P> <P> Subsidies. Despite all the rhetoric, the commission appears still wedded to  continuing the widespread subsidies that European governments traditionally  have provided to businesses on the Continent for research and development,  investment and exports.  </P> <P> To U.S. business, these grants and aid -- much more than the United States  provides for its businesses here -- are unfair. Washington is trying to  persuade Europe to reduce them as part of the current round of global  trade-liberalization talks, but success seems unlikely.  </P> <P> Trading Across the Atlantic  </P> <P> Leading U.S. Exports to the EEC  </P> <P> In U.S. dollars (1989)  </P> <P> Aircraft and related equipment: 9,213,476,407  </P> <P> Automatic data processing equipment: 5,542,476,605  </P> <P> Parts of office machines: 4,473,826,260  </P> <P> Engines and motors for gas turbines, etc.: 3,720,353,656  </P> <P> Technical measuring equipment: 2,691,946,750  </P> <P> Leading U.S. Imports to the EEC  </P> <P> In U.S. dollars (1989)  </P> <P> Petroleum products, refined: 2,376,265,592  </P> <P> Alcoholic beverages: 2,386,322,600  </P> <P> Military and other special transactions: 2,742,625,327  </P> <P> Aircraft and related equipment: 3,396,178,846  </P> <P> Passenger vehicles: 7,036,661,434  </P> <P> SOURCE: Data Resources Inc./McGraw Hill  </P></p>

The joint venture, named as the Philippine Satellite  Consortium, was created in compliance with a contract signed by  Beijing Highden Enterprise Ltd., subsidiary of China Everbright  Group Companies, and a Philippine consortium led by the CLMC  Group.    Lu Changsheng, director and president of the Beijing  Highden,  said the Philippine Satellite Consortium will buy and launch a  communications satellite for the country in two to three years  upon the approval by the government of the joint venture project.    The project, dubbed as "Philippines Satellite 2000," will  require at least 200 million U.S. dollars, Lu said.    It is one of the joint ventures agreed by the Filipino and  Chinese investors during President Fidel Ramos' state visit to  China last April.    China has committed the Philippine Government that the  satellite will be totally owned, controlled and operated by  Filipinos.    Roberto de Vevenia, president of the CLMC Group, said during  a press conference held here today that the Philippines is fully  confident of the Chinese technologies in the manufacturing and  launching of satellites.    Therefore, he said the China Great Wall Industry Corporation  (CGWIC), the only government-authorized company responsible for  and providing launching services of commercial rockets and  manufacture of communications satellites, is one of the  strongest competitors for the project.    The CGWIC has already launched three communications  satellites and two scientific experiment satellites for users  from Hong Kong, Australia, Pakistan and Sweden since it began  providing launching service for foreign users in 1990.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 18 SAPA -- Renewed rightwing terrorism  would hit South Africa unless the government agreed to amnesty  for rightist political prisoners, Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging  [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche  said on Saturday [18 June]. "The pre-election bombing blitz on  the Reef proved that there were people who know how to plant  bombs. No force in the world will be able to stop rightwing  terrorism if the government does not accede to our demands", he  told SAPA in Pretoria.    He was speaking after a protest march in the city centre by  about 120 rightwingers demanding the cut-off date for political  crimes be set at April 27, 1994.    In a memorandum handed to an official of the Justice  Department, the rightwingers also said Justice Minister Dullah  Omar was biased against the rightwing in his definition of  political prisoners.    "Mr Nelson Mandela's conciliatory statements must be  translated into conciliatory actions," the memorandum stated.    The march was held under the banner of the political rights  organisation, established last year to campaign for the release  of "conservative political prisoners".    Well-known rightiwngers such as Mr Barend Strydom, Mrs Gaye  Derby-Lewis and Mr Piet Rudolph took part in the protest.    Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg could not attend  because of "over-commitments", local Afrikaner Volksfront  [Afrikaner National Front] leader Jan du Toit said.    The group, led by an AWB band, marched from the Pretoria  city  hall to the corner of Paul Kruger and Pretorius Streets, where  the memorandum was handed to justice official Dr Flip Jacobs.    Mr Terre'blanche told a small crowd the government had to  release rightwing leaders if it was really interested in peace.    "Today we came in peace to put our request. The next time we  may not be so peaceful as our leaders in prison cells will start  calling for revenge," he warned.    Referring to the small number of rightwingers who turned up,  Mr du Toit said numbers were not important. "We don't force or  pay our people to take part in protest marches."</p>

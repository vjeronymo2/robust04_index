			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Clashes mark strike over death of left-wing leader in Nepal SPORADIC clashes marked a strike called by Nepal's left-wing opposition yesterday to press for the resignation of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, Reuter reports from Kathmandu. Police said protesters had thrown stones at buses in the capital, Kathmandu. Police fired in the air to disperse rioters at the border town of Jitpur, about 90 miles south of Kathmandu, officials said. There were no immediate reports of casualties in either town. Sunday is a working day in Nepal, but there was little traffic on the streets and offices, and shops were closed in response to the strike called by the Unified Marxist-Leninist party (UML). The UML organised the strike to back calls for the reopening of an investigation into the death, in a road accident in May, of Mr Madan Bhandari, the party leader. A judicial inquiry last month into the death found no foul play, but the UML says he was murdered. A nationwide UML strike on June 25 led to days of violence in the land-locked Himalayan kingdom. At least 11 people were killed. The UML says that the agitation will continue until the prime minister has been dismissed.</p>

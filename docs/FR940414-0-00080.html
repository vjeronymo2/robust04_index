Because the relationship between production and vessel length departs dramatically from the exponential curve for all vessels in the whiting fishery, highline production data were determined to be the best way to illustrate the relationship of potential harvest capacity to vessel length for vessels in the whiting fishery. Although production data are used to illustrate relationships between vessels of different lengths, the potential harvest capacity of vessels larger than 150 ft (45.7 m) is presumed to be greater than the historical highline production for those vessels. The formula promulgated by this rule takes the difference between a vessel's highline production data and potential harvest capacity into account. Highline production is the average production for the top 25 percent of the vessels in each vessel class. For analytical purposes, highline production values are used to demonstrate trends and relationships between vessels of different lengths for vessels that participate substantially in the whiting fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the increase in historical production per increment in vessel length for factory trawlers is less than the increase in production per increment demonstrated by smaller vessels in the groundfish (non-whiting) fishery, comparison of the highline catch amounts associated with number of permits needed for a factory trawler is affected by the size of vessel chosen for comparison. As an example, compare the number of 60-foot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (18.3 m) and 90-foot (27.4 m) permits that would be required for a permit for a 300-foot (91.4 m) vessel. If a 300-foot (91.4 m) factory trawler were to obtain all of its permits from 60-foot (18.3 m) boats, under the NMFS preferred approach it would need about sixteen permits. Since the 1991 highline production data for 60-foot (18.3 m) vessels was estimated to be about 470 mt per week, these permits represent 7,500 (16 x 470) mt/week of catching capacity in the offshore whiting fishery. During the same year, the highline production data for factory trawlers around 300 ft (91.4 m) in length was in the 1,000&hyph;1,100 mt/week range. In 1992, highline factory trawler production went up, but was still generally less than 2,000 mt/week. Thus, the demonstrated capacity of the sixteen 60-foot (18.3 m) vessels is still greater than the 1992 factory trawler catch by a factor of at least three.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If, on the other hand, the factory trawler were to acquire all of its permits from 90-foot (27.4 m) trawlers, it would need a total of 6. A 90-foot (27.4 m) vessel's highline production data was 610 mt/week, which is only 30 percent higher than for a 60-foot (18.3 m) vessel. Thus, the demonstrated production of these six vessels combined amounts to slightly more than 3,500 mt/week. While this value is less than the amount a 300-foot (91.4 m) vessel might harvest occasionally in the pollock fishery, it is higher than any weekly catch observed by a factory trawler over recent years in the whiting fishery. This example illustrates that a reasonable safety factor still exists, even if 90-foot (27.4 m) vessels are used for comparison with factory trawlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sixty-foot (18.3 m) vessels were selected for comparison with the factory trawlers in the whiting fishery for several reasons. First, that size of vessel was common among all three gear types (trawl, longline, and pot) and thus allows a comparison of harvest capacity and vessel length for all three gear types. Second, 60-foot (18.3 m) catcher vessels were assumed to be producing closer to their actual harvest capacity than 80- or 90-foot (24.4_27.4 m) catcher vessels. Therefore, 60-foot (18.3 m) vessel permits were used as a yardstick to compare the relationships between harvest capacity and vessel length for vessels using all three gear types and participating in the non-whiting sector of the fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the appropriateness of choosing comparison values is not determined by the make-up of the current whiting fleet, but by the length composition of the permits that are actually assembled in order to license a factory trawler. Since permits may be acquired from across the groundfish/whiting complex for this purpose, it seems likely that any factory trawlers will acquire permits from a variety of vessel lengths. Regardless of the lengths of the size endorsements on the permits being combined, or whether the smaller vessels have fished primarily for other groundfish or shrimp, the appropriate measure of the catching capacity, relative to a factory trawler, is what these vessels could produce in the offshore whiting fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters noted that the actual harvest capacity of larger (80&hyph;90-foot) (24.4_27.4 m) at-sea delivery vessels in the whiting fishery was greater than the 500 mt per week for catcher vessels used in the NMFS analysis for comparison with factory trawler production values. They noted that the larger at-sea delivery vessels often were constrained by production limits from motherships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NMFS agrees, and the NMFS analysis assumes that actual harvesting capacity is greater than the production values for all classes of vessels substantially involved in the whiting fishery. For example, if all 90-foot (27.4 m) vessels delivered 1,000&hyph;1,100 mt of whiting per week (equivalent to the largest single week of deliveries by any catcher vessel in the data examined) instead of the 610 mt observed production for the top 25 percent of delivery vessels, then if under the NMFS preferred approach, six 90-foot (27.4 m) vessel permits are combined, the harvest capacity retired would actually amount to 6,000 mt per week or more, almost triple any observed production from factory trawlers in the whiting fishery. At this point, neither the information regarding potential factory trawler performance submitted by commenters (addressed in the response to comment 4), nor any other information of which NMFS is aware, supports the assumption that the actual production of factory trawlers in the whiting fishery can be increased by a factor of 2.5 to 3.0 through the introduction of efficient offloading procedures at sea. Still, this is an emerging technology, and it is not impossible that factory trawler catch could be increased substantially if a factory trawler serves, in whole or in part, as a delivery vessel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 4: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters have suggested that factory trawler catches have been restricted by the processing aspects of their operations and that supplemental at-sea transfers between factory trawlers, which are both harvesting and processing, could significantly increase factory trawler catch rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NMFS agrees that production methods may be one factor limiting current harvest levels for factory trawlers. During 1991, for example, whiting factory trawlers had weekly levels of fish retention that were roughly half the amounts for comparably sized motherships, despite having roughly the same under-deck space available for production lines, freezing, and storage facilities. This indicates that processing limitations probably are not the sole factor constraining harvests. NMFS agrees that some potential exists for factory trawlers to increase their production. Thus, the harvest capacity for vessels over 200 ft (61.0 m) in length, calculated by this rule, is greater than any historical level of factory trawler catch in the whiting fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / International Company News: Pinault-Printemps sells kitchen chain to cut debt PINAULT-Printemps, the French retailing group, has sold Mobis Expansion, a chain of kitchen furniture shops, to the Guy Elmarak furniture company as part of its ongoing programme of raising capital to reduce its debts. Mobis, a chain of 41 shops across France, belonged to Conforama, the group of furniture stores bought for FFr4.4bn (Dollars 800m) by Pinault in 1991. The Conforama deal was one of the first stages of the transformation of Pinault, originally an obscure timber group based in Brittany, from an industrial concern into a broadly-based retailing group. However Pinault has been burdened by heavy debts since late 1991 when it made a FFr5.3bn partial bid for the Au Printemps stores and mail order group. As a result it has for the past year been selling peripheral businesses to try to bring down its borrowings. Initially Pinault concentrated on selling its original manufacturing and timber interests. More recently it has been looking for other ways of reducing its debt and in the autumn secured an injection of FFr1bn from Credit Lyonnais, the French bank which is one of its main lenders. Mr Francois Pinault, chairman, is now reported to be negotiating to buy part of Credit Lyonnais' junk bond portfolio. Mobis fits into Pinault's new strategy while Pinault said the disposal would enable Conforama to concentrate on its core chain of furniture stores.</p>

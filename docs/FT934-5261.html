			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (26): A vote for change CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS: AN ESSAY ON BRITISH POLITICS by Tony Wright Routledge Pounds 9.99 157 pages We British live in a model democracy, as those who rule us never cease to say. From our schooldays, we are taught that Westminster is the mother of parliaments, with a democratic tradition which is the envy of the world. That may be in parts of the globe where elections are infrequent and freedom constrained. But among the advanced capitalist democracies, the UK system of government looks anomalous. One symptom is its pervasive centralism. Local government has no constitutional status: it exists as a concession graciously granted by the centre, and the concession has been substantially reclaimed in recent years. Another is the absence of checks and balances on the power of the executive. The strengthening of the party system in the elected Commons is unmatched by a credible second chamber or a written constitution which might impede the creation of what Lord Hailsham described as an 'elective dictatorship'. The growth of judicial review has been a small ray of sunshine in a dismal landscape. A third is the quality of the political process in the UK. Parties with a minority of the vote command parliamentary majorities, allowing ill-conceived policies to pass and small swings of the electoral pendulum to produce far-reaching changes of government. A year ago, there were encouraging signs of a cross-party movement for reform. For decades, only the Liberal Democrats had shown any interest in constitutional change. They were vulnerable to the accusation that their interest in the subject - particularly in electoral reform - was largely self-interested. But the Labour party had begun to think about the UK's political structures. For as long as Labour managed to win an occasional turn in the driving seat, there had been little inclination to suggest reconstructing the Westminster juggernaut. The loss of successive elections, plus restiveness over centralism in Labour's northern and celtic heartlands, encouraged a new interest in constitutional reform. Some Conservatives also seemed open to ideas of constitutional reform. Former Conservative advisers such as Ferdinand Mount and Graham Mather called for modernisation, and pointed to the quality of political decision-making as a factor in the UK's post-war decline. A year on, the prospect looks much less exciting. Weakened by the collapse of its European strategy, the government is unable to win unconditional backbench support even for measures promised in its election manifesto. As for Labour, John Smith's cautious presbyterianism has reasserted the 'one more heave' approach. In this gloomy period for those who wish to see the British state modernised, this essay from Tony Wright comes as a refreshing read. A political scientist who has already written several incisive and accessible tracts, Wright was elected a Labour MP last year. He is one of the party's awkward squad, a constant prodder against the 'no change' mood which still dominates the opposition's thinking after 14 years out of power. Wright eloquently restates the case for moving away from Britain's centralised, top-down politics towards a more representative and participatory democracy. In a society where business has become decentralised, where companies seek to empower managers and staff, there is a need for a new sort of politics which can be closer to the citizen and provide better government. The most interesting part of Wright's argument, however, comes when he reflects on what such social changes mean for politicians such as himself. UK parties have offered a monolithic outlook, a take-it-or-leave-it political manifesto which must be swallowed whole or not at all. In a society which is becoming more pluralistic, a new model of party politics is needed. In this context, electoral reform, with its implicit bias towards coalition government, should not be seen as a political fix for parties which find it hard to win first-past-the-post elections. It is a new way of doing politics which seeks to construct government out of a plurality of interests, and within which policies will be agreed by negotiation rather than fiat. Such sentiments would not be unusual coming from a German or a Dutch politician. From a practising British politician in the official - if emasculated - opposition, it is a remarkable admission.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / The British Association: Benefit cash claimants 'understated' The number of people claiming welfare benefits is underestimated by at least a third, according to a survey whose first results were released at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Loughborough yesterday. The survey, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, shows that people are moving in and out of jobs, family relationships and welfare programmes much more quickly than in the past - and more quickly than social scientists had previously realised. Far more people depend on benefits to top up their incomes in the course of a year than claim at any given time. The underestimate of the coverage of welfare benefits is most acute for couples and single people of working age; for example the number of families with children receiving income support is 64 per cent more than the figure implied by the official counts of monthly claimants. Single parents and pensioners, on the other hand, have less tendency to move on and off benefits. 'What strikes me is how important the welfare state remains,' Professor David Rose of Essex University's Centre on Social Change, a survey organiser, said. More and more middle class people were realising that they were 'just one monthly pay packet away from income support'. The survey is based on a random selection of 5,000 households containing 14,000 people, who are interviewed every autumn about their social and economic circumstances. It started in 1991 and will continue to track the same group for many years. The purpose is to discover the dynamics of changing lives - information that is impossible to extract accurately from government statistics and from large one-off 'snapshot' surveys. Many people in the survey experience large fluctuations in income. Fifteen per cent of individuals experienced a growth in family income of more than a third between 1991 and 1992 and 13 per cent suffered a fall of more than a third in the same period. So more than a quarter saw a substantial change in living standards within one year. Changes in family composition - children being born or leaving home, couples forming or splitting up - were the most important reason for large changes in income. But changes in employment also played an important role, particularly for women. The proportion of women moving backwards and forwards between full-time, part-time, short-term and no employment at all within the course of a year doubled from 10 per cent in the 1960s to 20 per cent at present. 'People are coping with a great deal of turbulence in their everyday lives,' said Professor Jonathan Gershuny, director of the British Household Panel Survey at the University of Essex.</p>

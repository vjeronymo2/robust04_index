			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Austrian building group rises 6% Wienerberger Baustoffindustrie, the Austrian building materials group, reported a 5.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in the third quarter to Sch386m (Dollars 36.4m). This was mainly due to the strong performance of its core bricks and pipes businesses. For the nine months, pre-tax profits were ahead 30.7 per cent to Sch1.02bn and the directors have raised their profit forecast for the full year to Sch1.15bn, 22.6 per cent above the 1993 result. Sales in the nine months fell 20.6 per cent to Sch7.4bn, mainly because of the sale of the sanitary fitting subsidiary to Wolseley of the UK earlier this year. Excluding this distortion, sales were ahead about 10 per cent, the group said. The loss at the troubled Treibacher ferro-alloy subsidiary was slashed in the third quarter to Sch7.8m from Sch68.1m, in the same period of last year, mainly as a result of cost reductions. There was a small improvement in market conditions. Pre-tax profits of the wall, ceiling and roof division advanced 5.4 per cent to Sch282.5m in the third quarter, while those of the pipe systems and sewage technology division jumped 56 per cent to Sch62.6m. Lenzing, the world's largest producer of viscose fibres, said sales were flat in the first nine months of the year at Sch6.04bn, excluding the 1993 sales figures of Glanzstoff, sold earlier this year. The group, which suffered a loss of Sch203m in 1993, said it expected a positive result for the full year 1994.</p>

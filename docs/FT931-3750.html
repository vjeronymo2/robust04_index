			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Few mourn the death of Taurus - Richard Waters surveys the ruin 'THE MONSTER is dead. Private investors should just breathe a big sigh of relief.' That was the reaction of David Jones, chief executive of discount broker Sharelink, to this week's decision to pull the plug on the Taurus computer. As the London Stock Exchange's plans for a paperless settlement system were declared dead, it was a sentiment echoed in many quarters. Taurus was never popular with the brokers who deal with individual investors  -or with the investors themselves. The plan to do away with share certificates and stock transfer forms, replacing them with a computerised system for share ownership and transfer, aroused deep antipathy among many investors. It was difficult to see what benefits the changes would bring, and brokers hinted darkly that it would lead to higher costs. The demise of the system (it proved too complex to build) does not mean that nothing will change. The Bank of England has now picked up the baton and is bent on forcing through quick changes to the settlement arrangements. In fact, things could now move much faster than they would have if Taurus had been kept alive. No decisions have yet been taken, but a number of things are clear. First, the interest of private investors will be given much higher priority than they were last time around. Bank of England officials said this week that some interest groups could suffer in the search for a swift solution to London's settlement traumas - but it was a high priority to ensure that private investors were not disadvantaged. That is an important political priority after the Taurus fiasco. Second, whatever developments replace Taurus, private investors are likely to be treated differently from institutions, since their demands differ. Institutions want to move quickly to a simplified version of Taurus, involving a computerised system. Private investors are likely to be left alone while this objective is pursued. Third, most brokers have moved on since development of the Taurus system began seriously in the mid-1980s. Most have given more management attention to their back offices and automated more of their activities. Stephen Cooke, of stockbroker Gerrard Vivian Gray, says: 'A firm like ours has halved its settlement costs since 1987.' That has made settlement more efficient and brought down the cost. One aspect of this development has been the effort made by many brokers to put private client's shares into their nominee companies. Some broking services, such as Barclayshare and the Share Centre, operate exclusively on a nominee basis. Also, most personal equity plans are managed through nominees. Nominee accounts are more efficient to manage than individual shareholdings: brokers control the share certificates, and make transfers on behalf of their clients. The arrangement effectively replicates many of the functions of Taurus. Of course, many investors do not want to use nominees. Most brokers charge a fee for them. Also, being in a nominee account makes it impossible to claim rights as a shareholder, for instance to receive a company's annual report and attend its annual general meeting. If nominees are the way of the future after Taurus, then the Bank of England should give careful attention to how they can be made to operate more effectively for private shareholders.</p>

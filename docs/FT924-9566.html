			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: HK Land/Trafalgar Hongkong Land can hardly have expected to raise its stake in Trafalgar House so soon after its tender offer flopped. It must have stumbled across a pretty smart operator willing to set up its options package. Presumably that operator reckons on finding enough institutional holders willing to commit themselves to selling a portion of their stake at around 85p in February in exchange for protection against the market value of their remaining holding finishing below that level in May. With a floor under the price and no other obvious buyers in the market, Trafalgar's share price looks becalmed. That may shake out a little more paper, which would help the counterparty meet its initial commitment of 36m shares. Land's stake in Trafalgar House will thus move over 20 per cent, allowing it to equity-account the holding. It might like the outside world to believe that the deal was worth this simple convenience. The fact remains, though, that it has also turned up the heat under Trafalgar. The story is not over yet.</p>

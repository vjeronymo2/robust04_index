			<p>BFN     [Text] In his Friday prayers sermons in Tehran today,  Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, the acting Friday prayers leader of  Tehran, stressed: The Saudis act in harmony with America, and  their inability to stage and manage the magnificent hajj rites  has now become abundantly clear.    The acting Friday prayers leader of Tehran referred to King  Fahd's remarks on 'Id al-Qurban [Feast of the Immolation--20 May  1994], saying: By exploiting the resolvable differences between  Iran and the United Arab Emirates concerning the Abu Musa  Island, the Saudis seek to blackmail us. Although they  constantly state that hajj is not a stage for political issues,  nonetheless Fahd, in his speech on 'Id al-Qurban, tried to  achieve the political objectives of the Saudi Government.    Ayatollah Jannati then referred to the Enjoining Good,  Prohibiting Vice Week, which is to start on 11 June and called  for the media to pay serious attention to this principle so as  to clarify and explain it to the public. He emphasized the need  for everyone to be sensitive toward this principle, and said: In  the fight against vice, one must not stop at peripheral issues;  instead, efforts must be made to resolutely confront the  fundamental vices that constitute the root of corruption. In  this way, major sources of corruption must be pursued and dealt  with.    In another part of his remarks, the acting Friday prayers  leader of Tehran alluded to the government's recent call to  retailers to place price tags on their goods. He said: We hope  that this step may constitute a good method for confronting  those responsible for high prices.    He also referred to the occasion of Muharram [first month in  lunar calendar] and said that extensive mourning ceremonies  should be staged in the best possible way during this period.  He added: Just as the eminent leader of the revolution has  said, during this month, one must refrain from superstitious  acts.</p>

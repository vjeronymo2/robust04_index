			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Selling raid on Costain A WEEK of widespread gloom in the housebuilding and general contracting area of the market culminated in another bear raid on shares of Costain, the international construction and mining group. A big slide in Costain stock was triggered by one US investment bank attempting to unload a large block of shares into the market. At one point Costain shares had fallen to 29p, the lowest since 1976 after a host of bearish stories - all subsequently denied by the company - circulated in the market. Costain's Hong Kong interests and its Channel Tunnel operations were all rumoured to have been encountering problems. Costain shares reached a peak 366p in the autumn of 1987. By the close of trading yesterday, the shares had rallied to end the day a net 8 down at 30 1/2 p, a fall of almost 21 per cent. Since the start of the year Costain shares have more than halved. Mr Tom Slee, Costain's Finance Director, later denied that the group had any problems with its bankers. The group was also reported as saying the proposed flotation of its Australian interests was going smoothly. Fisons setback End-of-account speculation forced Fisons down to its lowest level for nearly seven years. Despite the disbelief of many and the insistence of the company that the speculation was unfounded, the shares slumped 18 to 189p on heavy turnover of 6.4m. Dealers were saying that one Sunday newspaper would carry a hard-hitting story on the pharmaceuticals group. Fisons said yesterday that it had spoken to the journalist involved and been told that a story had been written on the new management but the article was positive rather than negative. There was no assurance that the story would appear this Sunday. Fisons has languished since a profits warning in mid-June which sent the shares down 100 points in a day. Analysts said yesterday they saw no recovery in the price until Opticrom, the company's eye treatment receives approval for use by the Food and Drug Administration. Opticrom was withdrawn from the US in 1989 and is now unlikely to be relicensed in time for the US rag-weed season which starts in August, observers say. A series of downgrades in the big building stocks continued with Mowlem said to have been downrated and BZW said to have lowered profit expecations for Taylor Woodrow. Dealers said BZW had erased their previous Pounds 25m profits expectation for the group and now looked for the company to do no better than break even this year. For next year the broker chopped its previous forecast from Pounds 42m to Pounds 35. Taylor Woodrow shares eased to 78p. Racal Electronics was the heaviest traded stock in generally active electronics/telecoms sector after visits by analysts at least two leading brokers firms. The shares rose 2 1/2 to 67p on turnover of 12m. Cable &amp; Wireless (C &amp; W) gave a ready response to a story carried in the Financial Times Telecoms Markets newsletter suggesting that Mercury, C &amp; W's telecoms subsidiary is to take a stake in TeleWest, thre UK's largest cable operator, owned by TeleCommunications of the US and US West. The stock initially rose to 529p but later dipped to close 3 off at 522p. Vodafone lost 8 more to 302p but dealers expect the shares to respond to a series of presentations to institutions expected shortly. Amstrad dropped 1 1/2 to 31 1/2 p with analysts said to be concerned at the company's refusal to return calls about current trading. A switch recommendation, out of Barclays and into NatWest, issued by Mr Derek Chambers, banks specialist at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, saw the former slip 2 to 320p on 3.7m and the latter move up 7 to 335p on 3.3m. The Carr analyst reduced his interim profits forecast for Barclays from Pounds 378m to Pounds 150m and for the full year from Pounds 600m to Pounds 450m. He expects NatWest to achieve profits of Pounds 300m for the interim period and Pounds 750m for the year. A host of buy recommendations, notably from Goldman Sachs, Carr Kitcat and BZW, produced another strong showing from Prudential whose shares ran up a further 5 to 247p, after 249p, with turnover increasing sharply to 11m. A growing conviction in the market that not only Japanese investors but also US institutions are taking a much cooler view of the forthcoming Wellcome share flotation hit the shares. Wellcome fell 20 to 875p. Glaxo extended recent gains as SG Warburg Securities repeated its buy recommendation. The house is looking for profits of Pounds 1,425m for the year just ended. The shares jumped 22 before settling for a gain of 3 at 710p Speculation that US investment bank Goldman Sachs had attempted to offload a 10m share stake in ICI gave an opportunity for a bounce of 14 to 1163p. ICI has been depressed by worries over the possible overhang of stock after Goldman Sachs acquired 20m shares from Hanson on May 8, reportedly for 1400p a share. However turnover yesterday was only 2m shares. Aegis, the holding company for the world's largest group of media buying and planning specialists, dropped a further 17 to 39p after a sell note from agency broker James Capel hit clients desks. The shares have fallen from around 90p in the past week since Capel first slashed its profits forecasts, initially by Pounds 20m but then adjusting in the note to a cut of Pounds 17m to Pounds 32m for 1992. Dealers said big institutions were unwilling to touch the stock and that even small selling was sending the share price down sharply. However, Capel believes that at 40p the risk-reward equation is balanced and that the shares are beginning to look attractive. More gloom descended on an oil sector still affected by the recent slide in crude oil prices, a weak dollar and a host of profit downgrades as Shell hosted a presentation to analysts. The Shell presentation was described as 'bearish' by one analyst who said the company had spoken of inexorably rising costs in the North Sea operations which were putting pressure on profits. Shell shares reacted predictably to the gloomy news from the presentation, delivered in London, and fell 9 1/2 to 482 1/2 p on keen turnover of 4.2m. There was no let up in the selling pressure on BP. Overnight selling in the US, resulting from the series of UK broker downgrades on Thursday, and a constant flow of selling orders from UK institutions left the stock a further 6 weaker at 203 1/2 p with turnover a hefty 16m shares. Enterprise Oil, also upset by recent broker downgrades, fell 7 to 378p. Food retailer Argyll gained on a reported recommendation from Hoare Govett ahead of the group's annual meeting next Wednesday. Dealers said Hoare argued that Argyll's current trading was going well and expected the company's agm statement to be upbeat. The shares gained 8 to 357p on turnover of 1.7m. Shares in engineering group Vickers recovered from earlier weakness that followed a Smith New Court deal in which the broker bought a block of around 3.8m shares at 129p and sold it at 131p. Having shed 1 1/2 p to 132 1/2 p, the shares recovered to end at 134p, unchanged on turnover of 8.5m shares. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (27).

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Ukraine 'makes N-arms progress' UKRAINE has made progress in efforts to obtain security assurances from the west in exchange for becoming non-nuclear, authorities in Kiev said yesterday. Mr Borys Tarasiuk, deputy minister of foreign affairs, said a draft agreement in which leading nuclear powers, including Russia, would pledge not to attack Ukraine had been prepared and was being discussed with the western nuclear states. 'There are no doubts in anyone's mind that this question will be resolved,' he said on his return from Washington, where he met President George Bush. Ukraine, which has 176 inter-continental ballistic missiles on its territory, is the key to the Start 2 disarmament agreement between Russia and the US. Until Ukraine ratifies the earlier Start 1 treaty to remove all nuclear weapons from the country, Start 2 cannot go ahead. The Ukrainian parliament is hesitating over Start 1 in an attempt to win security guarantees and financial assistance from the west. Ukraine is trying to establish a shield against Russia, which would remain a nuclear power even if Start 2 were implemented. But to avoid singling out its powerful northern neighbour Mr Tarasiuk said Ukraine was seeking simultaneous security assurances from the US, France, the UK and Russia. British diplomats in Kiev confirmed that the UK was involved in negotiations.</p>

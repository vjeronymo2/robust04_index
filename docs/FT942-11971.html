			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chesterton Intl flotation shows valuation of Pounds 50m Chesterton International, one of the UK's leading property consultancies, is to be floated on the stock market in early summer with a value of more than Pounds 50m. It is expected to become the UK's largest listed property agency. The company will issue a small number of new shares, but the majority of the expected Pounds 25m placing will come from outside shareholders - primarily former employees - who own 33 per cent of the company; assuming they are prepared to sell. Chesterton made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.9m in the year to June 1993, but brokers suggest that profits will comfortably exceed Pounds 5m in the current year. Mr William Wells, chairman, said the flotation was a logical move for a company which has encouraged employee ownership of its shares, and which had also funded the bulk of its acquisitions through scrip. Chesterton has acquired 23 property consultancies in the UK since 1985 and around 50 per cent of its UK earnings came from outside London last year. The company was founded in 1805, but its current shape stems primarily from 1986, when it sold its substantial residential estate agency business to the Prudential for 'a very nice price'. Mr Wells said the company had 'taken the view that you either had to be a small niche business, or a large international player'. It opted for the latter. Last year, around 70 per cent of its turnover came from a broad range of professional advisory fees. The remainder came from brokerage fees, an area which should pick up sharply with the increasing activity in the commercial property market. Mr Wells said Chesterton had invested Pounds 7m in building up its international network in the past few years, and this should also be a source of growth. The company has a broad client list ranging from Marks and Spencer to the Crown and Church. The latter has diminished in importance since the Pounds 800m decline in the Church's income producing assets to Pounds 2.16bn, mainly because of speculative property losses. Chesterton has been cleared of responsibility. The timing of the flotation should be good. The only other large listed property consultancy, Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, trades on a p/e ratio of 25, reflecting anticipated earnings growth as the property market recovers. However, with only Pounds 6m of shareholders' funds, Chesterton's assets, as the cliche has it, are its employees. The company needs to show that these assets will not sell their shares and leave. The flotation is sponsored by Robert Fleming, and Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities are brokers.</p>

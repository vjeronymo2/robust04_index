			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Restructure costs cut Logica 22% to Pounds 3.2m Logica, the computing services company, reported pre-tax profits 22 per cent lower at Pounds 3.21m for the first half of 1993 after restructuring charges of Pounds 2.1m. Turnover was flat at Pounds 106.5m (Pounds 104.2m). Earnings per share were 3.3p (3.7p) and the interim dividend is raised by 12 per cent to 1.4p (1.25p). The shares gained 4p to 310p. The results suggest that Logica is coming to terms with the geographic and managerial difficulties which have depressed profitability although growth remains difficult and there are some problem areas. There was no net growth in the UK and sales in continental Europe slipped 3 per cent. Sales in North America rose 10 per cent; the company made a loss of Pounds 700,000 there in the first half compared with Pounds 1.4m last time. The problem lies with expenditures needed to support and develop a funds transfer software package. Speedwing Logica, a joint venture with British Airways, is performing below expectations. Mr Martin Read, chief executive, said that operating profits of Pounds 5.3m illustrated the underlying strength of the business. He believes that the restructuring expenses would be recovered in the second half and expected to see an improvement in performance. There have been some 100 redundancies, chiefly in administration, but the company this year took on 170 graduates. Net cash stands at Pounds 12.7m and Mr Read said it was likely Logica would be making strategic acquisitions this year.</p>

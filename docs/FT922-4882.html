			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Foreign investors take stock of China - But caution is required as the markets are opened up to the west, writes Simon Davies It has not been a perfect introduction to capitalism; and it is taking place in communist China, where two people have been killed over places in the queue as they battle to buy shares in a stock market which is showing scant regard for both fundamentals and the laws of gravity. Since the beginning of March, the Shenzhen index, which tracks the stock movements of one of China's two official stock exchanges, has jumped 171 per cent, in spite of the number of stocks on the market almost doubling in the same period. It makes the performance of the market in neighbouring Hong Kong appear pedestrian. People in Shenzhen start lining up in the broking houses' transaction queues in the evening, so that they can have a chance of buying stocks the next morning. Gangs have started selling positions in the queue and fights break out daily, with two deaths and more than 450 arrests so far this year. Shanghai, the other show-piece exchange, has taken a less frenzied approach, as befits its greater proximity to Beijing. But it has still been chaotic. The index rose more than 100 per cent in one day when price restrictions were lifted two weeks ago, but in two trading days during the following week it fell 19 per cent when the authorities outlawed investment syndicates. The fact that new issues are offered through a lottery system has not inspired international confidence. It has not been all one-way trade; a local investor recently committed suicide over losses on an investment in Shanghai Yangzhong Industrial, a stock which is currently the subject of a market manipulation investigation. But official reminders of the risks are going unheeded. At the start of the year, foreigners were allowed to join the fight for shares. The Shenzhen exchange permitted its Shanghai counterpart to issue the first tranche of China shares to foreign investors, but the southerners have expanded more aggressively. The Shenzhen market boasted six listed companies in January and these were all A shares, only available to local investors. During the year a further nine have been added, with six of these issuing B shares, which can be purchased by foreigners. Analysts expect there to be at least six more Shenzhen B share issues by the end of the year. Shanghai has 14 listed companies, of which only Shanghai Vacuum has issued B shares. However, at least seven more companies will issue B shares this year. The foreign issues have been well received. The average premium to issue price of the six Shenzhen B share issues was more than 380 per cent on Friday. The most recent issue, Shenzhen Petrochemical, jumped 386 per cent in its first eight trading days. This performance is being reflected in the number of China funds being launched. So far more than 10 funds focusing primarily on B shares have been launched or are in the pipeline. These have attracted a lot more than the Dollars 150m so far raised from the issue of China shares to foreigners. Fundamentals are being ignored. On Friday's closing prices, the average 1992 price-earnings ratio for B shares was 52, compared with under 10 for similar manufacturing companies in Hong Kong. Cynics expect to see a repeat of the experience in Indonesia, once a favoured emerging market. The market was eventually swamped with new paper, while some earnings forecasts were found to have been plucked from the air; share prices have slumped for the past two years. There is also concern over the level of regulation in China. At present there is no companies law, there is little appreciation of international accounting standards and a very limited scale of investor protection. The Chinese authorities are not renowned for their subtlety in dealing with perceived problems. Further measures are possible, but barring significant intervention, the down-side is seen as limited until China can issue sufficient new paper to absorb massive foreign demand.</p>

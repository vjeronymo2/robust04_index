			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>   [Text] An informed Palestinian source in Amman has stated  that security issues have hindered reaching a  Palestinian-Israeli agreement in Cairo. The source added that  the extent of security measures at the bridges and inspection  points and Israel's powers in this regard took 36 hours of  fruitless discussions.    The source told AL-DUSTUR that the Israelis insist on  putting  an observer at the crossings who will have the right to talk to  and interrogate those who arrive at and those who leave the  crossings prepared for the residents of Gaza and Jericho. This  constituted a departure from their previous stands by which they  demanded a special crossing which will be subjected to remote  electronic surveillance, he said.    The source said: A new condition has been presented over the  past two days by the negotiating delegation dispatched by Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. The Israeli condition is that the  Israelis should have the right to interrogate directly and  independently every suspect and to search him thoroughly without  interference from the Palestinian authorities.    The source added: The Israeli delegation was very  uncompromising concerning basic issues on the agenda in an  attempt to transfer controversial issues to the ['Arafat-Peres]  Davos meeting in Switzerland.    Answering a question, the source said: The 12 points of  difference have been reduced to four after difficult sessions of  negotiations. However, the remaining issues are more important  and complicated and we do not know if the Davos meeting will  succeed in tackling them.    The source said: Differences over the Jericho area are still  continuing but the Israelis have agreed on a compromise giving  the Palestinian side special "passageways" to the Dead Sea,  al-Nabi Musa, al-Maghtis, and the River Jordan without Israeli  interference in order to prevent any connection between Jericho  and Jordan. [sentence as published]    AL-DUSTUR has learned that the Israeli side proposed "joint  investments" in the area located between Jericho and the Dead  Sea but the Palestinian position on this proposal has not yet  been revealed.    The source said: The Israelis went back on their agreement  to have a symbolic Palestinian presence on the entry posts to  the West Bank--a policeman or a flag--and presented to us a new  stand pertaining to a symbolic Palestinian presence immediately  after, and not at, the entrance of the bridge.    Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa carried positive signals  from his Israeli counterpart after a brief visit to Tel Aviv  four days ago dealing with basic issues in general and  recommending compromise solutions, but these signals disappeared  at the negotiating table and the Israeli side appeared to be  most uncompromising.</p>

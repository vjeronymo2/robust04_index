			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: MON KEE -- RECLAIMING OLD GLORY  </P> <P> There was a time in the late '70s and early '80s, when clams with black bean  sauce were considered exotic, when only so-called "adventurous" eaters would  order pan-fried squid, and when Mon Kee was the only good Chinese seafood  restaurant in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Since then, the San Gabriel Valley has become the place to go for Chinese  seafood, and Chinatown's Mon Kee might be only the 25th most interesting place  to get live crab or shrimp with spicy salt.  </P> <P> In the mid-'80s, Mon Kee tried opening a second restaurant in Beverly Hills  called Mon Kee West. Where the original was a bare-bones dive, the new place  was expensively ornate. The food got fancied up, too. Regulars of the old place  complained -- the twice-cooked scallops weren't as delicious, the whole catfish  wasn't as fresh-tasting -- and eventually Mon Kee West closed. (Other Mon  Kee-owned Chinese seafood restaurants, called Mandarin Cove, have less serious  intentions.)  </P> <P> Now Mon Kee is testing the waters in Encino, testing them with steamed  flounder, sizzling oysters, lobster with ginger and green onions. Mon Kee may  not be the best Chinese seafood restaurant in Los Angeles anymore, but it's  working hard to become the best Chinese seafood restaurant in the San Fernando  Valley.  </P> <P> Mon Kee, 17337 Ventura Blvd., Encino, (818) 788-7272.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 29, RIA -- "Russia's new policy is  based on the premise that finding new friends does not mean  losing old chums," Ivan Rybkin, who chairs the State Duma, told  North Korean Ambassador Son Sung-pil on April 29. The meeting  was held at the request of the latter.    The ambassador spoke in favour of more dynamically  developing  bilateral ties to note that "certain differences in our  countries' respective ideologies are no reason for deteriorating  mutual relations." On the so-called nuclear issue, the  ambassador of North Korea said that his country is ready and  willing to deal with all controversial issues of normalisation  in the Korean Peninsula by way of negotiation.    The two sides discussed prospects for bilateral cooperation,  in particular in the economy, science and technology.</p>

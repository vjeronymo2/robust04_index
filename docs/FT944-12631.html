			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Prices index hints at inflation rise Further hints of rising price expectations and a slow-down in the rate of manufacturing growth were revealed in a business survey yesterday. The prices component of the Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 70.2 per cent in October from 70.1 per cent in September, as the overall index fell to 58.3 per cent from a seasonally adjusted 60.5 per cent last month. Any figure above 50 per cent indicates growth from the previous month. The prices index was above 70 per cent for the fourth consecutive month, and was particularly affected by upward pressures on general commodity prices. The most significant price rises were seen by purchasers of plastics, chemicals and various types of paper and steel. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, which commissions the survey, said the drop in the overall index was largely attributable to a fall in the rate of growth in the output index, which eased to 59.3 per cent from 64.3 per cent in September. Although the rise in the prices index in October was marginal, analysts said it suggested incipient inflationary pressures. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'The index is much higher than the readings earlier this year or last year.' Almost every other component in the overall index, which is compiled from data on stocks, output, orders, delivery times and prices, registered only slight changes from the previous month.</p>

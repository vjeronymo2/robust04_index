			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Bookies predict nine-minute ovation The prime minister is likely to get a nine minute standing ovation when he addresses the conference today, according to odds issued by William Hill, the bookmakers. The company offered relatively short odds of 3-1 against a nine minute ovation, compared to 4-1 for seven minutes or less, 7-2 for eight minutes, 4-1 for 10 minutes, 8-1 for 11 minutes and 7-2 for 12 minutes or more. Bets will be settled on the time for the ovation calculated by the Press Association news agency. Mr Major received conference ovations lasting 9 1/2 minutes in 1991, about seven minutes in 1992, when applause merged into singing, and 11 minutes in 1993. His predecessor Lady Thatcher often received ovations lasting eight to 10 minutes. Her longest was more than 11 minutes in 1987.</p>

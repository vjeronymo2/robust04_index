			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses 2.4% despite buying by investment trusts THE NIKKEI average set a 5 1/2 -year low for the second consecutive day as a drop in the futures market prompted further arbitrage-linked selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 400.24, or 2.4 per cent, to 16,045.56. The index fell to the day's low of 16,030.91 in the morning session on arbitrage selling and liquidation of holdings by corporations and financial institutions. Heavy buying in the afternoon by investment trusts helped recoup the losses, and the Nikkei rose to 16,403.65. However, the improvement was eroded by selling by a leading US broker towards the end of the session. Volume rose from 288m shares to 330m. Foreign investors, who until recently have been buyers of the Tokyo market, were seen selling real estate, securities and bank shares. Traders said foreign interest towards Japanese stocks was waning, although liquidation of holdings is not expected in the near term. Declines outnumbered advances by 905 to 118, with 85 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks dropped 30.97, or 2.4 per cent, to 1,245.64, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 4.46 to 976.04. Comments by Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, ruling out scope for a cut in the official discount rate also discouraged investors. In spite of the denial, however, the sharp falls in share prices raised hopes of monetary easing among bond market participants. The yield on the 129 10-year benchmark fell to 5.395 per cent from 5.42 per cent on hopes of lower short-term rates. However, stock market participants ignored movements in the bond market. Traders said buyers would be absent while the selling by arbitrageurs and institutions continued. A total of 212 shares fell to the year's low, as was the case with Nippon Steel, Y5 cheaper at Y260. Rumours that leading Japanese brokers had revised down their earnings forecasts for the leading steel companies prompted selling. Institutional investors sold holdings of leading blue chips. Daikyo, the condominium maker, weakened Y19 to Y781. The issue fell by its daily limit on Wednesday as rumours that the company faces financial trouble circulated in the market. Although company officials denied such rumours, traders said investors remained pessimistic about Daikyo's business prospects. Real estate companies were also weak, with Mitsui Fudosan finishing Y55 down at Y830 and Mitsubishi Estate retreating Y21 to Y779. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 358.77 to 19,143.36 in volume of 22.3m shares. Roundup WEAKNESS IN New York and Tokyo unsettled Pacific Rim markets. NEW ZEALAND closed lower as investors, already scarce ahead of the July 2 government budget announcement, were further discouraged by weakness on international markets. The NZSE-40 index closed 14.85 down at 1,515.95 in turnover of NZDollars 24.9m (NZDollars 29.6m). An exception was Brierley Investments, a cent up at 97 cents on the day's heaviest volume of 6.7m shares. AUSTRALIA held up fairly well in the face of the sharp declines in New York and Tokyo, the All Ordinaries index ending 6.2 off at 1,624.9 after an early low of 1,616.1. Turnover was steady at ADollars 271m. CRA fell 12 cents to ADollars 14.24 after reporting that a strike had closed iron-ore production at its Hamersley unit in Western Australia. MANILA continued its downward correction as the composite index shed 36.04 to 1,499.78 in turnover of 184m pesos, after 264m. The decline was triggered by a Dollars 2.125 loss to Dollars 39.625 for PLDT in overnight trading on the American Stock Exchange. It fell 45 pesos to 1,045 pesos in Manila. HONG KONG also extended its retreat, the Hang Seng index tumbling 49.96 to 5,796.10 in steady turnover of HKDollars 2.77bn. Utilities were sharply lower: Hongkong Electric lost 40 cents to HKDollars 18.60. KUALA LUMPUR was broadly lower in light trading, the composite index slipping 6.69 to 596.50 in turnover of MDollars 103m (MDollars 186m). Telekom Malaysia declined 30 cents to MDollars 13.70 and Tenaga Nasional 25 cents to MDollars 8.50. SINGAPORE fell on profit-taking. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 11.41 down at 1,506.03 in turnover of SDollars 112.4m (SDollars 140.3m). Shipping stocks were among the most actively traded, joining shipyard issues on the list of losers. Hotel shares were also sold after a local report that occupancy rates have slipped in the second quarter. TAIWAN firmed in light dealings as late bargain hunting overwhelmed midsession declines. The weighted index gained a net 24.88 at 4,628.78 as turnover shrank to TDollars 28bn from TDollars 36.8bn. SEOUL dropped in cautious trading. The composite index fell 12.87 to 563.85 in turnover of Won211.5bn, after Won326.5bn.</p>

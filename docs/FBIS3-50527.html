			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Martha Garcia Ferrufino, head of the </F> Secretariat of Provincial and Rural Development, at her office;  date not given -- first five paragraphs are PRESENCIA  introduction]    [Text] Last 6 August, during the ceremony of taking office,  the first Aymara vice president of the republic, Victor Hugo  Cardenas, said that "after 500 years of colonial silence and 168  years of exclusion, we are speaking up to tell our truth."    This seems to be the tone that has been adopted in the new  National Secretariat for Provincial and Rural Development, the  mission of which is to "raise the standard of living for rural  inhabitants at a significantly greater rate than that of the  rest of the Bolivian population, and expand the relationship  between rural inhabitants and the authorities at all levels."    The head of this office, Martha Garcia Ferrufino--the only  woman at that level of the Executive Branch--has worked for the  last 10 years with peasants in Mizque, Carrasco, Puna, and  Tiraque provinces, through the nongovernmental organization  [NGO] Center for Agricultural and Livestock Development  (Cedeagro), of which she was the director.    The interview that follows was carried out in her office at  the National Service for Community Development. One's attention  is called to the fact that on the walls there are no traditional  portraits of leaders of past administrations, but rather maps,  papers, and blackboards full of innumerable notes.    Her enthusiasm in explaining her plans was only tempered  when  she remembered her activities in the Cochabamba valley where,  she is certain, she will return after fulfilling her new mission.    [PRESENCIA] In general terms, what are the objectives of the  National Secretariat for Provincial and Rural Development?    [Martha Garcia] They involve turning government strategies  and policies around toward an environment that is normally  forgotten: the rural areas. The provinces are slowly  languishing, they have no economic, social, or cultural  prospects in the face of the indifference of the city people and  the State.    I believe that a small space has opened up in this  government--that of the Secretariat of Provincial and Rural  Development, and of Ethnic, Racial, and Generational Affairs--to  be able to resolve, or at least to facilitate, a process of  development that brings confidence and energy to the rural  population, to be a tool for their future.    [PRESENCIA] The distinction between province and community  is  important. In general, the villages have always had conflicts  with the communities, how do you view that?    [Martha Garcia] When the President said that we all belong  to  an ethnic group, he stated a truth. We all belong to an ethnic  group--Quechua, Aymara, Guarani, Chiquitana, Mojena, etc.--but  also, after 168 years of the Republic, we have another  reference, of legal, geographic scope, which is the province.    What is in the province? The indigenous-peasant community  and  the residents of its capital cities and its sections and  cantons. But now most of the indigenous groups and peasants have  moved to these capitals, because their former employers have  been abandoning their family estates.    Thus, an almost unified, uniform, and homogenous movement  has  now developed in the rural area, which does not deny that there  must be a level of cooperation between the villages, which are  disappearing, and the communities, which look to these small  capitals for their economic reference of commercial transactions.    [PRESENCIA] How are you carrying out the work?    [Martha Garcia] By focusing on what the province is, based  on  diagnostics made by its own inhabitants, for them to be the  first to make a reading of the reality of their corresponding  provincial jurisdiction.    This means that the inhabitants, at each administrative  level, are carrying out a census of their natural resources, to  determine how many people are they, who they are, to what  culture they belong, where they are located, and what type of  production and prospects they have. That is the first thing they  should do, to give them the information to also permit them to  objectively define what their needs are and develop strategies  to respond.    I insist that the Secretariat of Rural Development aim to  promote activities permitting very flexible proposals to be  defined for provincial, global, and also local development in  the provinces, beginning with their own inhabitants, and to  expand these into the microregions where there are calls for  unified efforts to resolve the problems.    [PRESENCIA] How will the peasant community become involved  in  this process, given its diversity and the existence of internal  and conflicting authorities within the provinces themselves?    [Martha Garcia] One must start with the fact that there is a  basic organization in the rural area that must be respected and  with which one must cooperate. I am speaking of the ayllu, which  is a natural organization; and the peasant syndicate, which is  structured and has a hierarchical order.    Then, we want to enter in a fashion that is objective and  honest, for once, to help resolve the problems of the  communities while respecting their structural organizations:  ayllus, communal syndicates, subcentrals; in the case of the  Guaranis, their assemblies. It is necessary to respond within  these contexts, because they have their own ideas of what the  local transformation must be and the definition of the services  they require.    [PRESENCIA] What are the objectives of the Secretariat you  are heading, for the next four years?    [Martha Garcia] A very dynamic action program will be  carried  out in the provinces to establish local organizations that will  initially be called Provincial Development Councils.    The Councils shall be charged with getting political society  to work with civil society in each of the provinces. In fact,  there already are political authorities (sub-prefectures and  mayoralties) and civil authorities, peasant organizations  (ayllus or assemblies; unions, and their expression in centrals  and sub-centrals), and civic committees.    This should permit the design of the provincial development  strategy, and the authorities must monitor the process of  transforming the education, health, and productive sectors, and  provide working guidelines for all the entities doing  development work in the provinces.    I am referring to the NGO's, Churches, FF.AA [Armed Forces],  etc., which must all act according to the same guidelines.  Currently, some projects are in a state of chaos; anyone may  enter a given geographical environment and establish direct  contact, without anyone monitoring them or ensuring  compatibility with a global proposal.    In summary, the trend is that each province communicate with  the authorities to coordinate systems, strategies and control,  and even to monitor the different tasks as they are completed,  in such a way as to respect the strategy the province itself has  laid out, avoiding isolated activities by either public or  private entities.    [PRESENCIA] In the Executive Branch's new structure, rural  areas are divided among three ministries: Human Development,  Finance, and Sustainable Development. The latter also has  authority over the Institute for Colonization and the National  Council for Agrarian Reform. How will your work be compatible?    [Martha Garcia] Coordination among the three ministries must  be of a complementary nature, of common effort with respect to  the strategies that will be designed.    Some of them are regulatory in nature, while others support  and strengthen the activities that are carried out throughout  the entire rural environment, and I repeat that the objective is  to serve the provinces, even though there may be differences of  focus on what the territory should be, or which actions  correspond to cultural expressions, etc. The goal is to respond  in an integrated fashion to the needs of the rural inhabitants.    I do not believe there will be conflicts, but rather that we  will complement each other.    [PRESENCIA] But, for example, if the Ministry of Sustainable  Development declares a tax reserve in a zone where you have  decided to bring new land into production, doesn't that create a  conflict between the two?    [Martha Garcia] What we are doing is making the proposals  compatible and defining what the activities of the three  Ministries will be within those zones, which may in fact create  conflict.    Let us look at the other side. For example, the case of  natural resources. The Ministry of Sustainable Development will  regulate their use throughout the country, but it is the rural  inhabitants who will apply those regulations. But this not only  involves conservation, but reproduction of the natural resources  in a sustainable fashion.    [PRESENCIA] Another potential conflict is between  business-agricultural-livestock interests and peasants organized  in unions or communities in the same area. How will you address  that reality?    [Martha Garcia] This is dealt with in the legal area; that  is, how the large farmers and ranchers will be treated, as well  as the small farmers living in the same zone.    For the rest, reality shows significant conflicts in our  country: one can see signs of wealth and misery side by side.    How to carry out activities in those areas? With respect to  our areas of responsibility, this involves small farmers  beginning to have a healthier and better consolidated economy,  to permit them to live in a more comfortable and modern fashion.    The objective--as the minister of Sustainable Development  has  said--will first be to save the small farmer, to try to resolve  the basic problems. Then, serve the large ranchers and farmers.  In any case, there will be certain restrictions on  everyone--both small and large farmers--particularly with  respect to the preservation of natural resources, the forests.  Neither large nor small farmers may diminish our national  endowment.    [PRESENCIA] How do the different secretariats in the  Ministry  of Human Development coordinate with each other, particularly  when several carry out direct activities in the rural area?    [Martha Garcia] The secretariats, jointly and in agreement  with each other, will design the activities and proposals.  Moreover, these will also be agreed upon as an axis with the  local participants, particularly in the health, education, and  productive sectors.    For example, if in the provinces where, together with the  local population, we are carrying out work we deem necessary,  involving the creation of five school districts, that means the  Secretariat of Education should be involved there. What is  important is that the definition and geographical coordination  of activities be developed locally rather than by the  Secretariats.    [PRESENCIA] In the area of education, are the proposals of  the Educational Reform Support Team and your Secretariat  compatible?    [Martha Garcia] I believe that the problems are being  resolved. The educational reform proposal is being evaluated by  all the Secretariats of the Ministry, which are reviewing its  defects and weaknesses, but also its successes, based on the  recognition that, given the state of the educational system  today, we have an obligation to reform it.    [PRESENCIA] Many analysts indicate that without large  economic investment, the rural standard of living will not  improve. How will resources be generated and directed and how  will the scale of production of the small farmers be increased  if the market is still small?    [Martha Garcia] The first market is the rural one,  consumption. Our basic objective is to cover the needs of the  rural population, and our purpose is to increase production.    [PRESENCIA] How will the channeling of resources to the  rural  areas be organized?    [Martha Garcia] I believe that the level of local  organization is basic, basic, that is, direct communal  participation from diagnosis to problem resolution.    That means becoming involved in the peasant economy through  productive infrastructure. That leads us to prioritizing the  expansion of irrigated land. I am speaking of small projects  ranging from rehabilitating irrigation ditches watering between  10 and 60 hectares, to medium projects covering up to 200  hectares. We will follow up implementation of agricultural and  livestock programs with technical support, to permit substantial  improvement in living conditions and ensure at least increased  cash for those communities.    The good thing about irrigation systems is that they  coordinate different ecological levels. Normally, seed  production is carried out at high ecological levels, while  irrigation systems are built in the valleys. This means that  improved seeds will be produced simultaneously in the high zones  and planted in the valley zones, and thus production levels will  be improved.    [PRESENCIA] Will the money be given as credit or donation?    [Martha Garcia] Most of the resources have to come to this  country in the form of donation. But they will serve to create a  provincial rotating fund that will permit lending for production  purposes. It will be a credit that will be managed locally, and  we will seek for it to be gradually rotated into a seed bank,  which will also be locally managed and administered, which will  set an example for saving in the community.    [PRESENCIA] Will access to this type of supply be through  the  community, cooperatives, or families?    [Martha Garcia] Community. But within the community  individuals, that is, the family, will be respected. Experience  shows that both institutions must co-exist: the community, as a  level of social control, administration and investment  monitoring, and the family, which must ensure efficiency in  managing the crops and their relationship with the community.    We are speaking of social capitalization, because if the  community administers the resources, it should also monitor a  level of guaranteed returns, returns that must lead to the  generation of surpluses (even if minimum), which can be  converted into social capital for the community.    In summary, the rotating fund is a credit that normally  would  be handled in cash. For example, agricultural and livestock  warehouses that will initially be co-administered with the  community, but which the latter must prepare, and in the future  they can administer those resources on their own, while  simultaneously acquiring the ability to resolve problems and  provide services for production.    [PRESENCIA] Does this mean repeating the experience of the  Peasant Agricultural Corporation (Coraca)?    [Martha Garcia] No. Coraca was administered from the city,  not by the community, and it failed because there was no  resolution on the part of the community, particularly in the  management of its resources.    What is now being proposed is to establish cooperation in  managing the provincial economy, to make it possible for  investment to be defined by the community; that is, for the  community to make the request, which will be satisfied through a  very well-structured organization within the community, which  must exercise social control and have a good level of  administration and technology, because it must monitor the  management and permanence of those resources. If there is no  regular return on investment within the community, then one can  only with great difficulty speak of a structural resolution to  communal problems.    [PRESENCIA] The Secretariat of Provincial and Rural  Development is also responsible for relations with peasant  organizations. Is it carrying out that activity?    [Martha Garcia] I can say that relations with the peasants  and Indians will be much more efficient. Until now, there have  been only political relations, which have ignored the peasant  and Indian bases.    Our proposal is to develop relations with the structured  bases in the sector with respect to the subcentrals and  centrals. The activities will be more direct in the areas where  they are located: there will be a more concrete relationship  that will resolve all claims that previously were normally  handled by hierarchical petitions through the peasant structures.  <H5>  Areas of Extreme Poverty </H5>   [PRESENCIA] The plan submitted by your Secretariat proposes  to serve 60 provinces....    [Martha Garcia] In principle that would be the number, but  now we intend to cover 80, because the President requested that  we serve all rural provinces, except for the department capitals  and the 12 that are under the attention of the Secretariat of  Agriculture and Livestock--which reports to the Ministry of  Finance--which intends to convert them to intermediate cities.  Thus, we will serve 80 of the 108 provinces throughout the  country, and approximately 300 sections.    [PRESENCIA] What time frames have been defined?    [Martha Garcia] Based on different studies, we have  determined that approximately 35 provinces already have  development proposals. Of the 35, 14 already have organized  activities and their proposals for provincial development are  already advanced. First, we will attend to those 14, and in  1994, to 24.    These provinces are in every department except Pando, which  has none at that level of organization.    [PRESENCIA] Where are the most depressed areas of the  country?    [Martha Garcia] Several studies of the poverty levels in the  provinces show that most provinces are at a level of poverty or  extreme poverty.    [PRESENCIA] There is the impression that the standards of  living are higher in the east.    [Martha Garcia] Yes, but there are exceptions. For example,  on a scale of 1 to 100, the Ichilo region rates 77; Sandoval,  60; but Abuna is at 1 and is one of the poorest in the country.  Elsewhere, Tapacari has 3; Chayanta 8, and so on.  <H5>  Inefficiency of Contacts Only at Government Headquarters </H5>   Among its mandates, the Secretariat for Provincial and Rural  Development has that of "expanding the relationship between  rural inhabitants and the authorities at all levels." That  means, among other activities, communicating with the peasant  union leaders and agreeing with them on different proposals to  carry out.    Martha Garcia recognizes that "up to now we have discussed  only the formation of the Secretariat with the leaders of the  General Trade Union Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia  (CSUTCB), which initially accepted it, but we have not laid out  definitions. Once the proposal is finished, it will be necessary  to discuss it with them, as well as the Secretariat's strategy."    She says, however, that the dialogue was developed with the  organization that until this week was headed by Paulino  Guarachi. But, she comments, "not only in the CSUTCB, but also  in the Nationalist Confederation, different political parties  are represented, the UCS [Solidarity Civic Union], MNR  [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement], etc., and dealing with so  many interlocutors here, at government headquarters, is not the  most efficient and effective way. So, it is rather at the level  of the union centrals, which are the intermediate entities, and  the departmental federations, with whom we are trying to arrive  at an agreement and jointly define what the strategies will be,  because activities now are joint efforts, and are not just on  the part of the Secretariat."  <H5>  The Potato, Symbol of the Crisis in the Countryside </H5>   One product exemplifying the crisis Bolivian peasants are  experiencing is the potato. This product, originally from these  zones and constituting the main dietary product, is now in a  process of genetic degeneration.    Martha Garcia explains that low potato production goes back  to 1983-84, when there was a severe drought with "rather serious  results, forcing the peasants to harvest so intensely that  subsequently "there was overproduction of potato, because for  other products, the harvest was truly disastrous. But now one  cannot even overproduce potatoes. That is, the genetic material  in the seeds has deteriorated to such an extent that it has  disappeared from almost 60 percent of the community."    This means, says Martha Garcia, that "there is no guarantee  in the producing communities of their basic foods, which are  potato and corn."    Thus, she adds, "our greatest concern is to gradually  recover  this product and try to ensure that the communities can  basically produce for their own sustenance. The average current  potato yield nationally is 4.5 tons per hectare, compared to a  potential average of 20 tons, and the production from a  1/4-hectare parcel can easily be calculated. Thus, one of our  objectives is to increase potato production from 4.5 to 5.6 tons  per hectare."  <H5>  Exports and Small Farms </H5>   The current hegemonic trend is to insert ourselves into the  international market in a competitive fashion, which among other  things, means increasing export levels.    This has two direct effects in rural areas: one, the  increasing importance of agro-industrial enterprises that  produce for export, and two, those who work for these companies  are converted into agricultural workers.    But most of the peasant population simultaneously maintains  its traditions and forms of production, limited by the expansion  of small holdings.    Given that reality, Martha Garcia says that the Secretariat  for Rural and Provincial Development "will try to consolidate  and resolve the problems of the small landowner. Issues of  salaried agricultural workers will pass over to the Ministry of  Labor, because they involve labor relationships."    And with respect to small farmers, Garcia explains that this  is a structural problem, which "may be resolved only with great  difficulty. Surely this problem will be included in the  Agriculture Law, in which tenancy and land ownership issues will  be defined. What we will do will be to work with those small  farmers to ensure them a level of productivity and food  subsistence."</p>

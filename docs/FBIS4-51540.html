			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- China has formulated a  comprehensive automobile industry development policy with  emphasis on fostering domestic auto parts makers, Japanese  Government sources said Wednesday [27 April].    The sources in the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] said the 13-chapter policy drafted by China's  State Planning Commission bars foreign automakers from producing  vehicles with components shipped from their plants outside China.    The sources said the draft aims to develop economical  passenger car models designed for use by the public, signaling a  departure from its past policy of emphasizing the development of  vehicles for office use.    In order to promote the development of the domestic  automobile industry, emphasis will be laid on fostering parts  manufacturers, they said.    Along this policy line, the sources said, the draft policy  calls for foreign automakers operating in the country to  maintain the local content ratio or the ratio of locally  procured parts used in the vehicle at 40-50 percent in the  initial stage.    The complete knockdown formula (CKD) to assemble vehicles  with most components and parts brought in from outside the  country will be banned, the sources said.    They said the policy paves the way for Japanese automakers  to  produce vehicles in China through joint ventures with Chinese  partners holding a controlling equity of over 50 percent.    In view of the local content regulation, the Chinese auto  market will be open only to foreign automakers engaging in auto  parts production in advance, the sources said.    China is regarded as a potentially huge market for auto  makers, with domestic demand exceeding 15 million units in the  year 2000.    Under the existing principle, Japanese automakers now  produce  only minivehicles and small-sized cars in China while U.S. and  European rivals engage in producing larger vehicles.    Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's top automaker, which is  interested in producing cars in China will be required to launch  a joint part manufacturing venture before making full entry into  the Chinese market, the sources said.</p>

A separate grant program is in effect for the faculty development component of this provision. In addition, section 748 now authorizes grants or contracts to support predoctoral training in general internal medicine and general pediatrics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory General Funding Preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be given to any qualified applicant that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of applications that have been recommended for approval by the peer review group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increase in the Rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' and revisions to the established funding preference were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 58 FR 51838 on October 5, 1993 for public comment.

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Bonn wants Gorbachev at Brandt service BONN would like Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader, to attend the memorial service in Berlin for Mr Willy Brandt, the former German chancellor, in spite of a Russian ban on his leaving the country. A government spokesman in Bonn confirmed the official attitude yesterday, but insisted that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had taken no initiative to persuade the Russian government to allow Mr Gorbachev to leave the country for the occasion. Unofficial reports said the German chancellor was 'greatly concerned' about the travel ban on the former Soviet leader, and had instructed his officials to do what they could to have it changed. Bild am Sonntag, the mass-circulation Sunday newspaper, said Mr Kohl had told his staff: 'We must do something. If he is not allowed to come, it would be a scandal.' The German Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the report yesterday, but a government spokesman said the government would welcome Mr Gorbachev's attendance at the memorial service for Mr Brandt, scheduled for next Saturday in Berlin. He was unable to confirm whether Mr Gorbachev had already been officially invited. The travel ban was imposed on Mr Gorbachev after he refused to give evidence before the Russian constitutional court into the activities of the Soviet Communist party.</p>

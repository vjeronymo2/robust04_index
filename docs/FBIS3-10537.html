			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 8 Mar (DPA) --  Today, the police violently evicted Indian peasants from four  tracts of land they had occupied several days earlier in the  northern area of San Cristobal de las Casas, in the convulsed  southern state of Chiapas. Witnesses reported that the police  arrested some 20 Indians and stole some of the squatters'  belongings, like television sets, radio recorders, and kitchen  ware.    The Indian peasants' eviction from land plots is one of the  demands included in an extensive petition presented yesterday by  the Citizens' Front for the Defense of San Cristobal, composed  of this Chiapas city's influential and wealthy people.  Nevertheless, today, the group, headed by San Cristobal Mayor  Jorge Mario Lescieur Talavera, told Chiapas Governor Javier  Lopez Moreno of their decision to waive their demands, which  included the expulsion of Bishop Samuel Ruiz, mediator between  the government and the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN].    Among other things, the Citizens' Front demanded that San  Cristobal de las Casas stop hosting the peace talks between the  government and the EZLN and that all the catechists and priests  who promoted the theology of liberation, whom the Citizens'  Front had accused of "masterminding" the guerrilla movement,  leave town. They also demanded the Catholic churches be  temporarily closed. They regard the churches as centers for  "aiding and abetting crime." In addition, the Citizens' Front  demanded the expulsion of nongovernment organizations and the  boycott of independent newspapers in the capital and San  Cristobal, which they had accused of being EZLN mouthpieces.    The demands were presented in response to the mobilization  of  peasant and Indian groups demanding land and public services;  demands that culminated in the occupation of several mayor's  offices in Chiapas as a consequence of the Zapatist rebellion  which broke out on 1 January.    In praising the decision of the Citizens' Front to waive its  demands, Governor Moreno warned, however, that legal orders will  be enforced against those who have invaded land tracts and  municipal buildings.</p>

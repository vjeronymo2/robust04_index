			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NBA / SAM MCMANIS;  </P> <P> PITINO FINDS SLUMPING KNICKS ARE A TEAM IN TURMOIL AS PLAYERS BICKER  </P> <P> The New York tabloids have resurrected a catchy phrase to describe the suddenly  slumping New York Knicks, a nickname previously reserved primarily for the New  York Yankees: "Team Turmoil."  </P> <P> It is a nickname that seems to fit.  </P> <P> After the Knicks' 10-point loss to the New Jersey Nets Friday night, Coach Rick  Pitino strongly criticized his players and promised changes.  </P> <P> The Knicks, who still lead the Atlantic Division by 6 1/2 games over the  second-place Philadelphia 76ers, lost eight of 13 games and were entangled in a  net of inner-conflicts. A summation of the squabbles:  </P> <P>  -- Gerald Wilkins had a shouting match with Mark Jackson.  </P> <P>  -- Kiki Vandeweghe was said to be shut out of the offense by teammates.  </P> <P>  -- Forward Charles Oakley was upset that Vandeweghe has cut into his playing  time.  </P> <P>  -- Ditto for Johnny Newman.  </P> <P>  -- Rookie Rod Strickland continued to be upset about his bit part as Jackson's  backup.  </P> <P> After the loss to the Nets, Pitino had had enough. He threatened to bench  Jackson, Oakley and Newman. And he questioned the attitude and talent of his  team.  </P> <P> "We will do away with reputations," Pitino told Newsday Friday night. "We will  rock this boat. I've been conscious of egos, because we have a lot of fragile  egos. This is not panic time, but we have to get ready for the playoffs.  </P> <P> "I think our heads don't match our play. We have an over-inflated opinion of  ourselves. We're going to have to face the music."  </P> <P> The Knicks held a team meeting Saturday that lasted so long they missed their  flight to Washington. Players aired their grievances. Pitino reiterated his  gripes. And, apparently, an understanding was reached.  </P> <P> Pitino's threats turned out to be merely a scare tactic. But they worked. The  Knicks recovered Sunday to edge the Washington Bullets, who lately have been  tough to beat.  </P> <P> So, all is right with the Knicks, who are close to clinching their first  division title since 1970-71.  </P> <P> Selfishness, Part I: Since switching to point guard for the Chicago Bulls,  Michael Jordan has become statistic conscious. He has started checking with  statisticians to see how close he is to a triple-double. He had a string of  seven consecutive triple-doubles broken Friday night.  </P> <P> "The guys at the scorer's desk let me know what I need," Jordan said.  </P> <P> So, too, do the Bulls' assistant coaches.  </P> <P> "They keep reminding me when I get back to the huddle," Jordan said. "They say,  'You need three more of this. You need four more of that.' "  </P> <P> Jordan is trying to win over voters for the league's most valuable player  award.  </P> <P> "If the way I'm playing now doesn't convince them I'm a complete player, then I  guess nothing will," Jordan said.  </P> <P> Selfishness, Part II: The underachieving Atlanta Hawks have apparently found  their culprit -- guard Reggie Theus.  </P> <P> Theus has a reputation as a selfish player and things haven't changed at  Atlanta.  </P> <P> At least, that opinion was expressed by several unnamed Hawk players, and a  former assistant coach, in a recent story in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  </P> <P> "Reggie is the worst thing that has happened to us all year," one player said.  </P> <P> Said another: "For a while, I'd just thought he'd lost his game. But now, I can  see it's just Reggie."  </P> <P> And former assistant Brendan Suhr, now in a similar job with the Detroit  Pistons, said the Hawks made a mistake in acquiring Theus from Sacramento.  </P> <P> "It's been a disaster," Suhr said. "Reggie told us he'd submerge himself in our  system because he only wanted to win at this stage in his career to prove he  was not a loser. Obviously, he didn't mean it. Or, he's just kidding himself."  </P> <P> In defense, Theus said: "It's a very difficult adjustment, to find a rhythm  when you only see the ball two or three times in a sequence. . . . If you ask  negative questions, you can often get negative responses."  </P> <P> The Seattle SuperSonics ended a seven-game losing streak with a victory over  the Dallas Mavericks Saturday night, which might temporarily soothe the temper  of Coach Bernie Bickerstaff.  </P> <P> After losing to the Lakers Tuesday at Seattle, Bickerstaff yelled so loudly at  his team that he could be heard down a long corridor. Two nights later, after  losing to Phoenix, the SuperSonics had lost seven of their last 15 home games  after winning 17 in a row at one point. Bickerstaff did more than just bark. He  benched power forward Michael Cage and replaced him with Xavier McDaniel.  </P> <P> According to the Seattle Times, Bickerstaff could be heard screaming at Cage  after he allowed A.C. Green to score a career-high 33 points: "You say you've  got guys covered, and you don't have them covered at all. What do you know  about defense?"  </P> <P> Said Cage about his benching: "I've got to make sure I don't distance or  alienate myself from the team, which could happen."  </P> <P> Cage is not the SuperSonics' only problem, however.  </P> <P> "So many things are wrong, I can't put my finger on it," Bickerstaff said.  "Maybe I need my toes, too."  </P> <P> The craziest game of the week had to be Friday night's battle royal at Chicago  Stadium between the Bulls and the Detroit Pistons.  </P> <P> The Pistons won, 114-112, in overtime of a game that had a fight between Isiah  Thomas and the Bulls' Bill Cartwright, five players fouling out, including  Jordan and Joe Dumars. Chicago Coach Doug Collins was close to tears after  almost attacking the referees.  </P> <P> The Pistons may have won the game, but the loss of Thomas even for a short time  obviously will hurt. Thomas said he did not know how he fractured his left hand  in the brawl, although he landed several punches and fell to the floor.  </P> <P> Why would Thomas, at 6-foot-1, take on Cartwright, who is 7-1?  </P> <P> "We've played the Bulls six times this year and Cartwright has hit me five  times," said Thomas, who was fined $5,000 and suspended for two games for  initiating the fight. Cartwright was fined $2,500 and received a one-game  suspension. "I stole the basketball from him, and he hit me. I pushed him and  was about to turn away when he rushed me."  </P> <P> There is a history to the Thomas-Cartwright confrontation. On Jan. 31, Thomas  needed six stitches to close a cut over his right eye after Cartwright elbowed  him.  </P></p>

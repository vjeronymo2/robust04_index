			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Labour attacks cuts in criminal injury awards The government was forced on to the defensive yesterday by Labour attacks on plans to speed up the criminal injuries compensation scheme. Mr John Major defended the government's plans to replace individual assesments with a tariff scheme during irritable question time exchanges. The prime minister said the changes, which will take effect in April, would make the system more efficient and speed up payments to claimants. But it later emerged that the changes would reduce the annual bill for compensation payments from about Pounds 500m a year to Pounds 250m by the end of the decade. The government expects 46 per cent of claimants to be worse off under the new system, which will replace individual assessment with fixed payments. The proposals have been criticised in both houses of parliament, and there is growing unrest among Conservative backbenchers about the impact on the victims of crime. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, sought to exploit Tory unease by claiming that compensation for police officers seriously injured in criminal attacks would fall from Pounds 121,000 to Pounds 7,500. He said that a young woman with two children who saw her husband murdered at her own front door had received Pounds 137,000 under the existing scheme, but would have received only Pounds 17,000 after April. 'Why should she lose Pounds 120,000 under a government cost-cutting exercise?' he asked. 'Is it not bad enough that crime has doubled under this government without making the victims pay for it?'</p>

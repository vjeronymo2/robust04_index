However, capital construction  across the country remains large in scale. Departments and  units in some places have exceeded the boundary of their  authority in approval matters and have flouted the relevant  state decrees. Some have gone their own way, launching projects  in a blind fashion, with the result that the "property fad" is  rearing its head again, creating a very negative impact on  national economic development and efforts to curb inflation.  This we must view with great seriousness. Preventing blind  development in property and real estate will be the focus of a  reduction in the scale of fixed-assets investment and an  improvement of the investment mix this year. We expect to see  greater and better efforts in this regard, which will produce  results early this year.    Property and real estate is a new industry in our country.  It has to develop healthily. The healthy development of the  property and real estate industry is marked by a reasonable  proportion of investment in other industries and should be  commensurate with the supply capacity and market demand for  capital and building materials. Based on our national  situation, fixed-assets investment must focus on infrastructural  facilities and industries such as agriculture, transport,  communications, and energy in order to break the constraints of  "bottlenecks" created by the relative backwardness of these  industries on national economic development. At the same time,  we must support the development of key capital and  technology-intensive industries, promote upgrading the  production structure, and enhance the competitiveness of  products in international markets. If large amounts of social  capital flow into the property and real estate industry and it  is allowed to develop blindly, the development of infrastructure  and industries and the revitalization of key manufacturing  industries will be seriously affected, and eventually the  progress of our country's modernization will be hampered.    To maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of  the national economy, we must prevent blind expansion in the  property and real estate industry. First of all, measures must  be adopted to put a tight lid on the building of luxury hotels,  office buildings, luxury villas, holiday resorts, and high-class  amusement facilities. These building projects require  large-scale investment, and, moreover, demand for them has grown  soft. Vying and competing with each other, blind development  and building is bound to result in serious wastage. Second,  strengthen investment management. Property and real estate  investment must be incorporated in fixed- assets investment and  credit plans and must not go beyond these plans. Planning and  management departments should reject property projects which are  not incorporated and banks should refuse them loans. Third,  strengthen the management of development and construction.  Regardless of size, property and real estate developments must  meet the requirements of urban planning and must be handled  according to capital construction procedures. Land must be used  with extreme care and reason, and scrutiny and approval must be  done according to the relevant land use rules and regulations.  Fourth, conscientiously enforce regulations on levying  value-added tax on property and real estate and regulating the  property market.    To facilitate the healthy development of the property and  real estate industry, it is necessary to correctly adjust the  investment mix in the property and real estate industry.  Solving housing problem for urban residents, especially  families with special difficulties, and renovating dilapidated  houses should be the key tasks in property and real estate  development. These should be pursued in a down-to-earth manner  and in accordance with the relevant state decrees, and thus we  will render some practical services for the masses. We should  go as far as our ability permits but pursue the job to the  utmost of our ability; and we should pursue reform of the urban  residential housing system under the state's centralized  planning to achieve a home ownership scheme.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Turbulent week ahead for the dollar - Currencies The week ahead promises to be a volatile one for the dollar with a critical meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, and a bevy of important financial data, providing markets with much food for thought. These developments take place amid a market still trying to understand the implications of last week's shift in power towards the Republicans at the mid-term congressional elections. The dollar rally, prompted by Fed intervention to support the currency at the beginning of the month, was given further momentum by the election results. This has led a number of observers to call a turn in the dollar, after nine months of decline. Decisive action from the Fed tomorrow could bolster the dollar's rally. On the other hand, should the Fed disappoint the market, the dollar will be very vulnerable to renewed selling pressure, especially following its recovery over the past 10 days. There will be no shortage of possible triggers for market concern. Prominent among these will be the retail sales and capacity utilisation figures, out tomorrow; the consumer price index for October, out on Wednesday; and the September merchandise trade report, released on Friday. The key issue, however, will clearly be the FOMC meeting. Most analysts are predicting a 50 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate. Indeed, a Reuters poll of 30 analysts last week found them to be unanimous on this point. Whether this will satisfy the market probably depends on the message which accompanies it. The Fed is widely seen to have undermined the effectiveness of its last move, three months ago, by saying that it did not expect to have to tighten rates again for some time. This time round, the market view is that 50 basis points will only be seen to be sufficient if the Fed indicates the possibility of a similar rise at the December FOMC meeting. Those analysts predicting a moderate response from the Fed say the US economy is not far outside the desired 'box' of 2 1/2 per cent (growth) by 2 1/2 per cent (inflation). In Europe the main focus will be on the Nordic currencies, in the aftermath of yesterday's Swedish vote in favour of joining the European Union. Analysts had speculated that a 'yes' vote could help the Swedish krona reach SKr4.65 against the D-Mark, from around SKr4.75 on Friday. Other Nordic currencies will probably rise on the back of the krona, although the Norwegian krone will be constrained by uncertainties over a similar EU poll there, on November 28.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: in Brief POLL TAX: The High Court yesterday refused to close the loophole holding up poll tax prosecutions, ruling that liability orders based on computer print-outs were illegal. Declaring computer evidence 'hearsay', the court upheld an earlier ruling by Coventry magistrates. The ruling could affect thousands of pending debt-collection cases. The bill introducing the council tax, currently before the Lords, will make such evidence admissible for the future, but councils are unlikely to proceed with liability orders affected by the ruling until the bill becomes law early next month. Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, said the bill had been amended 'precisely to make clear that in future computer evidence will not be regarded as hearsay'. ***** ENVIRONMENT: The government has dismissed as 'unrealistic' European Commission plans to start an energy tax to combat global warming early next year. Officials giving evidence to the House of Lords' European Communities committee yesterday said it could take five years to agree details and introduce an EC 'carbon tax' on fossil fuels. They also said they doubted that detailed proposals on the tax would be ready for presentation to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June. ***** TRANSPORT: The Transport and Works Bill failed to complete its report stage in the Commons last night when the government chose not to extend the sitting until consideration of the measure had been concluded. The bill would empower the government to authorise rail, tramway and inland waterway work schemes, replacing the need to go through the lengthy and often costly private-bill procedure currently required.</p>

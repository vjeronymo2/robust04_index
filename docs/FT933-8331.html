			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Italy's offer of beds boosts Bosnian airlift ITALY yesterday became the latest country to join the international scramble to evacuate the wounded war victims of Sarajevo when it offered to provide 454 hospital beds for the seriously injured patients  - the largest offer to date. But as the diplomatic wrangling continued over the airlifts, which some UN officials have criticised as a publicity stunt, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) indicated that it now had more offers of beds than it had patients awaiting evacuation. More than 700 beds have now been offered by more than a dozen governments in recent days, including Britain, Ireland, France, Jordan, Turkey, Finland, Kuwait and the US, following the emotional press coverage of the case of Irma Hadzimuratovic, a five-year-old mortar victim from Sarajevo. Ms Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman for the UNHCR, yesterday welcomed the flood of offers, which she said marked a turnabout in attitudes, after 16 months of indifference from western countries. She said thousands of offers from individuals and private clinics were also pouring in, which the International Office for Migration (IOM), an inter-governmental agency, would follow up due to lack of staff at the UNHCR. However, Mr Manuel de Almeida, UNHCR spokesman in Zagreb, stressed that more aid was needed across the former Yugoslavia. Until last week, the UNHCR staff had only been identifying some 25 patients a week for evacuation in Sarajevo, he said. However, there were others lying injured at home in the city, which the UNHCR staff - who are already badly overstretched - have not yet had the resources to identify. He said 15 countries had now offered hospital places, including Italy, Finland, the Czech republic, Jordan, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, the US, Canada and Turkey. Amid charges that the media - and humanitarian campaign - had focused too narrowly on Sarajevo, the UNHCR yesterday said that it hoped to extend the operation across Bosnia, although renewed fighting in central Bosnia was still making conditions dangerous. Meanwhile, the British government yesterday came under fresh fire over its evacuation of 21 injured from Sarajevo on Sunday after the Swedish foreign minister claimed that the British government's questioning of the choice of victims had delayed Sunday's airlift. British foreign office officials yesterday denied the allegation, and insisted that, in spite of media allegations that some soldiers had bribed their way onto the airlift, the British government 'had met all the objectives' of the operation. In an effort to deflect the critical publicity over the affair, the British government noted that it had been the largest single donor to the former Yugoslavia, having given Pounds 131m in aid in the past 14 months. However, it said it had no plans to conduct further airlifts at the moment.</p>

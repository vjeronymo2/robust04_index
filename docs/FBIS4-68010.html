			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kay Nehm, the new federal public prosecutor, </F> by Alfred Merta, Friedemann Weckbach-Mara, and Barbara Schmid;  place and date not given: "More Police on Our Streets!"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] BILD AM SONNTAG:  Following events in Bad Kleinen, do you fear fresh terror  attacks by the RAF [Red Army Faction]?    Nehm: At the moment there are intense discussions  going on within the RAF on whether they should change their  objectives and renounce violence. If the "hardliners" get their  way over the next few weeks, attacks cannot be ruled out.    BILD AM SONNTAG: Do you have any hot leads in the  arson attack on the Luebeck synagogue?    Nehm: We are currently investigating some 250  leads. If we persevere, I expect that we will be able to  clarify the matter and bring those guilty of the Luebeck attack  to trial.

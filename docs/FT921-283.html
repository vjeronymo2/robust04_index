			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Arab efforts to defuse Libya crisis near failure THE latest Arab League attempt to defuse the crisis over Libya's refusal to yield two men accused of bombing a US airliner appears near collapse after further Libyan statements at the weekend. Mr Ibrahim Mohammed Beshari, the Libyan foreign minister, vowed yesterday that his country would not 'surrender' to demands that it hand over its nationals for trial in the west. A despondent Egyptian foreign minister, Mr Amr Moussa, said after a meeting with President Hosni Mubarak and Mr Beshari: 'I see that things are difficult and are not progressing towards a breakthrough the way one would like.' The United Nations Security Council is due early this week to approve a resolution that would impose sanctions, including an arms and air embargo, against Libya over its refusal to hand over Libyans allegedly involved in the 1988 and 1989 bombings of US and French airliners in which a total of 441 people died. The Arab League yesterday sent a letter to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, outlining its understanding of the Libyan position. League officials would not be drawn on its contents, but they expressed little optimism of an early resolution of the crisis. Moderate Arab states, notably Egypt, have been trying for months to head off a looming confrontation with the west, fearing domestic troubles if Libya is subjected to UN-imposed penalties. Last week, a compromise appeared to be in the making when Libya indicated it might be prepared to hand over the two suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, to the Arab League which would have passed them to the UN secretary general. But Tripoli balked, prompting speculation about serious differences in the Libyan regime between Colonel Muammer Gadaffi and his number two, Major Abdel-Salam Jalloud. Col Gadaffi is being portrayed as a voice of reason in the Egyptian press, while Maj Jalloud is depicted as the main obstacle to compromise. Egyptians were furious last week after an Arab League committee led by its secretary general, Dr Esmat Abdel Meguid, was insulted when it went to Tripoli to discuss the crisis. Egypt was particularly incensed by a despatch carried by Jana, the Libyan news-agency, which alleged that the Arab League committee was acting under pressure from the 'Crusader West'. This week's expected Security Council resolution follows one agreed in January, demanding that Libya hand over nationals involved in bringing down the two aircraft.</p>

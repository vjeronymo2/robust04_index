			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Ricoh sues Honeywell over sensor patent RICOH, the Japanese office equipment and camera maker, said yesterday it had filed a patent infringement suit against Honeywell, the US technology company that has aggressively sought to enforce its own patents in Japan for autofocus cameras. The suit is the latest in a series of trans-Pacific disputes over intellectual property rights in which, more often than not, Japanese companies have been accused of infringing on US patents. Increasingly, however, Japanese companies are striking back. On the same day that Ricoh said it had filed suit in New Jersey alleging that Honeywell had infringed a patent on semiconductor sensors, it said it had settled out of court with Honeywell in the dispute over autofocus cameras. Ricoh denied infringing on Honeywell's patents, but it said a reasonable settlement was preferable to protracted and costly litigation. Although it did not disclose the terms of the settlement, it said it would have no material affect on the company's financial condition or operations. Ricoh claims Honeywell sensors infringe a Ricoh patent for a semiconductor device that enables high-precision and high-speed measurement of airflows.</p>

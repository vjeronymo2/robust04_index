			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Abbey National debt rating downgraded THE weak state of the UK economy and the depressed housing market has led Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, to downgrade one of the country's two biggest home loan institutions and consider cutting the credit rating of the other. Moody's said changes in the market for housing finance in the UK meant the lenders were facing a long-term deterioration in their credit quality. Moody's long-term debt rating of Abbey National, which turned itself from a building society into a bank two years ago, was cut from AA1 to AA2 yesterday. The AA1 rating of Halifax, the biggest UK building society, has been put under review for possible downgrade. The downgrading of Abbey National brings Moody's rating into line with those of Ibca, the London-based agency, and Standard &amp; Poor's, both of which rate it AA. Commenting on the Halifax review, which affects Dollars 4.5bn of long-term debt, Moody's said it will focus on 'the impact of the weak UK economy and housing market and Halifax's asset quality, as well as on the way in which changing market dynamics may affect the building society's future financial flexibility.' Moody's said both institutions would be affected by long-term changes in the housing market. 'The inflationary cushion which has always helped to keep risks in this kind of lending down is changing,' said Ms Angela Jameson, a senior analyst at Moody's in New York. She said losses on mortgage indemnity insurance would lead insurers to provide less comprehensive cover in future, leaving lenders more exposed to losses. Moody's decision affects Dollars 7.5bn of debt issued by Abbey National.</p>

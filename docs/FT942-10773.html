			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Fourth year of decline sets record  -Japanese season The Japanese corporate results season starts this week with 1,390 companies, listed on the first and second sections of the Tokyo stock exchange, announcing annual figures for the year to March. The trend is expected to be for companies to report profit declines for the fourth consecutive year, the longest period on record. Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of Nomura Securities, projects combined pre-tax profits for the last business year to fall 23.2 per cent. Sales of the manufacturing sector are forecast to fall 4.9 per cent. Although earnings prospects in the electronics and electronic parts sectors improved, lower earnings of basic materials companies, such as steel, cement, and paper and pulp makers, will have pulled profits lower. Capital investment, excluding financial companies, is expected to have declined by 11.4 per cent. Improvement in profit margins, lower labour costs, and a decline in depreciation and other effects of rationalisation are expected to help earnings for the current year, with NRI expecting pre-tax profits to rise 0.2 per cent. However, the institute, which based its forecast on an average yen rate of Y109.5 to the dollar, warns the outlook will deteriorate if the annual average for the currency rises sharply.</p>

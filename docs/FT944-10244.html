			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Royal to shed staff despite tripled profits Royal Insurance, the composite insurer, yesterday forecast a 10 per cent reduction in its UK workforce over the next three years, in spite of a near tripling of pre-tax profits in the first nine months to Pounds 311m. Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive, said competitive pressures and the scope offered by technology for cutting costs were forcing a reappraisal of manpower levels across the group's operations. Jobs would be lost through natural wastage. Though the group's results underlined the strength of Royal's recovery from heavy losses in the early 1990s, Mr Gamble acknowledged that the group had benefited from exceptionally good trading conditions, particularly on claims. Reflecting its increase in pre-tax profits, up from Pounds 113m last time, Royal also announced a switch in its investment strategy away from fixed-interest securities. It invested an extra Pounds 250m in equities in the nine-month period with the objective of boosting long-term capital growth, rather than income. Royal's results followed similarly buoyant figures earlier this week from Commercial Union but neither have assuaged fears that the insurance industry is entering a phase of intense pressure on margins over the next few years. Highlighting the pressure on premium prices, Royal estimated private motor rates had fallen by 5 per cent over the past year. Household policy rates have also fallen in the past 12 months, while Royal estimates growth in rates for commercial lines has slowed considerably. Lex, Page 18 Details, Page 21</p>

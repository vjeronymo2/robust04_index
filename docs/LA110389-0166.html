			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> 3RD YEAR OF ELEPHANT PREGNANCY  </P> <P> An elephant entering her third year of pregnancy apparently has set a world's  record for a pachyderm gestation, but doubts are growing about the health of  the 200-pound fetus, anxious zookeepers said today.  </P> <P> Jean, a 19-year-old Asian elephant at the San Diego Wild Animal Park, was due  to give birth to her first calf in August, after what would have been a normal  22-month pregnancy, said park spokesman Tom Hanscom.  </P> <P> Nearly 60 days later, the 2 1/2-ton pachyderm is showing no signs of labor and  park officials have little hope of a healthy birth, Hanscom said. "At this  point, we doubt there is a live fetus."  </P></p>

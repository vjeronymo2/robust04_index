[passage omitted]    The minister also talked about Sudanese-British relations,  pointing out that these relations are historic and all the  problems between the two countries could be solved through  dialogue.    The minister referred to the wrong behavior by the British  ambassador to Khartoum and asked Britain to send a new  ambassador who would work toward strengthening relations between  the two countries.    The minister also talked about the archbishop of  Canterbury's  visit to the rebel areas. He said the visit was seen as support  for mutiny, a violation of national sovereignty, and a call to  war. He also said that the visit contributed to the  deterioration of Sudanese-British relations. He described the  archbishop's action as a political one on whose basis the thesis  of mutiny would be built. [passage omitted]</p>

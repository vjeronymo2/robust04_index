			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Calpers blocks directors seeking re-election at Sears THE California Public Employees' Retirement System, better known as Calpers and the largest public pension fund investor in the US, said yesterday it had voted against all the directors standing for re-election at Sears, Roebuck, the retail and financial services group. Sears, which has been the subject of shareholder agitation for several years, is holding its annual general meeting on May 14. Three directors on its reduced nine-man board are up for re-election. Mr Dale Hanson, chief executive, said the fund's proxy guidelines normally require a supportive vote. 'In this case, Sears' continual poor performance, and the board's obvious reluctance to insist that Mr Brennan (Sears chairman and chief executive) make the changes necessary to save this company, compelled us to express our displeasure in some tangible way.' Calpers threw its weight behind four motions put forward by dissident shareholders at Sears including one which requires a study of the possibilities of splitting the group's different interests into separate companies. Much of the dissatisfaction with Sears centres on its large retail operations. Some of its financial services interests, which include the Dean Witter brokerage and the Allstate insurance company, are seen as more attractive propositions. The other three proposals backed by Calpers include a suggestion that the jobs of chairman and chief executive be split between different people; a strengthening of confidentiality of the proxy vote; and the elimination of the staggered terms for board directors. Directors currently hold office for three years, and each year approximately one third of the directors' terms expire. Calpers owns 2m Sears shares, worth about Dollars 85m at yesterday's price of Dollars 42 7/8 , up Dollars  1/4 . This represents about 0.6 per cent of Sears' stock. However, as one of the biggest institutional investors in the US with assets of Dollars 68bn, it has taken a leading role in matters of corporate policy. Sears has battled against shareholders' criticism with attempts to revamp its stores, overhaul the organisational structure on the merchandising side, and several tranches of job cuts. Last year, it pushed up net profits from a depressed Dollars 902m to Dollars 1.28bn, but said that more needed to be done.</p>

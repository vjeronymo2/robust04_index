			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (13): Loss of aid status is a blow  -The Forest of Dean remains industrially vulnerable The Forest of Dean, although part of Gloucestershire, is significantly detached from the rest of the county by its geography, history and economic traditions, and it has to come to terms with very different problems in the 1990s. Unlike other parts of the county, which have an agricultural tradition, the forest has played a largely industrial role in an attractive rural setting of former royal hunting forests. Its recent history highlights the long-standing vulnerability of the local economy, which has been heavily committed at various times to industrial sectors that have performed badly or disappeared altogether. Iron has been mined and smelted since pre-Roman times and the coalfield was heavily exploited in the last century. In 1944, 55 per cent of the workforce was in mining and 26 per cent in steel and engineering, but both industries went into decline and the last deep pit closed at the end of 1965. Attempts at diversification included the move by British Acoustic Films into an old brewery site at Mitcheldean. The company was taken over by Bell &amp; Howell, the US film camera manufacturers, which in turn was acquired by the Rank Organisation. This turned out to be a stroke of good fortune for the local economy. Rank Xerox, formed in 1956, by Rank and the Xerox Corporation of the US, started copier production at Mitcheldean in 1959. By the mid-1970s, it was employing nearly 5,000, mostly at Mitcheldean but also at Cinderford and Lydney. In the early 1980s, came the double blow of recession and the expiry of the Rank Xerox patents. Competition from Japan was intense, and Rank Xerox was forced to cut production. Employment was down to 1,200 by the mid-1980s. With vacant space at its 67-acre manufacturing site, Rank Xerox then created a business park and enterprise workshops, to attract a wider variety of employment. Among the organisations now on the Mitcheldean site are an electronics company and a software manufacturer. Rank Xerox remains the largest employer with a current workforce of around 1,800. Its commitment to the forest was underlined in 1990, when the company's electronics manufacturing was relocated from Welwyn. Mitcheldean is now the company's European manufacturing centre for electronics, wiring assemblies and fused rolls. Rising unemployment in the early 1980s, which reached 16.8 per cent in the Cinderford and Ross-on-Wye travel-to-work areas, led to the forest receiving assisted-area status in 1984. The benefits, including regional selective assistance and access to European regional development funds, restored some confidence, and unemployment fell below 5 per cent. But there remains a narrow industrial base, heavily dependent on the manufacturing sector and on a small number of medium-sized employers. These include Smith Kline Beecham, Engelhard Industries, Lydmet (formerly British Piston Ring), and SCA (formerly Reed Packaging). Unemployment has recently crept back above 10 per cent. A big blow was struck to the fragile recovery last summer, when assisted-area status was not renewed. A particular worry has been the growth in the number of people having to go outside the forest area for work, particularly to defence- and aerospace-related jobs elsewhere in the county. It is feared that these will inevitably be reduced as defence spending is cut. Another fear is that, with the loss of assisted-area status, the area will again suffer from undue 'competition' provided by assistance still available across the Welsh border in Gwent. The best hope for support now is an extention of rural-development area status northwards, to link up with a similar application from Hereford and Worcester and Shropshire for the Marches. Mr Dick Whittington, assistant director of administrative services at Forest of Dean district council, says: 'We are confident we will retain our rural development status, and hope we can extend the area, but there is no way this can compensate for the loss of assisted-area status.' He sees few signs of recovery from the recession. The structure plan for the forest, which goes to public inquiry next spring, argues that 4,500 new jobs are required by the year 2001, mainly concentrating on the three centres of Cinderford, Lydney and Coleford. But a recent study by the University of Warwick suggests that medium-term employment prospects 'are at best limited, with only modest employment growth projected under the most optimistic scenario.' One area of potential growth is tourism, based on the attractive landscape, the development of many woodland tracks and bridle paths by the Forestry Commission, and the area's rich industrial heritage.</p>

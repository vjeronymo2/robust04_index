			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND SO, ON TO BAGHDAD?;  </P> <P> KEEPING GULF POLICY IN PROPER PERSPECTIVE  </P> <P> In the days and weeks and probably months ahead, the resource America is going  to need in greatest abundance is not more military hardware, ground forces or  burden-sharing by allies, but wisdom. We are going to need a lot of that. But  will we have enough when the crunch comes? One has to wonder.  </P> <P> Washington policy-makers are said to be deeply divided over the proper aim of  U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf. Some circles in the Bush Administration tilt  toward a policy whose rationale absolutely requires the toppling of Saddam  Hussein by whatever means necessary. They would not accept even the complete  withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait as an end-point in the military crisis. Direct  military action against Iraq, not to mention Kuwait, is required.  </P> <P> But that course goes disturbingly beyond the original purpose of the U.S.  military commitment and would represent a substantial escalation of U.S. aims.  The United States is in Saudi Arabia to deter aggression, to protect U.S. oil  supplies and to defend Saudi Arabia, an important ally, the site of a great  deal of the world's oil and a country in the same geopolitical ballpark as  Israel, another ally this nation cares deeply about.  </P> <P> Yes, absolutely: Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait, as demanded by United Nation  resolution, and it is the purpose of the punishing and nearly all-embracing  economic embargo to effect that goal.  </P> <P> Iraq must also be prevented from realizing any design on Saudi Arabia. And that  is precisely the purpose of the American military commitment, which, it must be  said, has so far achieved its goal of deterring Iraq from Saudi Arabia with  seeming surety. In that sense, it might be argued, U.S. policy is already a  triumph.  </P> <P> But the question of the political and even biological future of Saddam Hussein  is not an appropriate issue for U.S. military forces -- it is a problem for the  Iraqis themselves. If the United States were to deal with that issue directly,  it would put at risk the most startling and commendable achievement of the Bush  Administration's crisis management in the gulf: the broad anti-Hussein  international political consensus.  </P> <P> If American forces are attacked in any way, our retaliation should be swift and  merciless. But we must not risk a wider conflict by losing sight of the clarity  that instructed our initial involvement two weeks ago. We especially owe it to  the tens of thousands of American military personnel who are putting their  lives on the line in the Persian Gulf to maintain a policy that is cool-headed,  wise and just.  </P> <P> It is a policy that must not be buffeted off course by the winds of domestic  politics, or by the overreaching of military and policy theorists for whom war  is a kind of academic exercise -- in theory an extension of diplomacy by other  means. While threats of war may be an extension of diplomacy, war itself is the  proof of diplomacy's failure.  </P> <P> Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee puts the  issue clearly, leanly and correctly: "Our military mission is to defend Saudi  Arabia." Let's keep that in mind.  </P></p>

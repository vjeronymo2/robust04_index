			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Growth now but pain later: Lamont delays big tax increases until next year MR NORMAN LAMONT took a calculated gamble with Britain's finances yesterday by leaving the economy to grow out of recession in 1993-94, postponing the pain of big tax increases until April 1994 and beyond. But the chancellor unnerved the City by forecasting a Pounds 50.1bn public sector borrowing requirement for 1993-94, some Pounds 5bn higher than expectations. This led to a sharp 1 point fall in prices for government gilt-edged securities. Presenting his third Budget, and the last of the traditional spring revenue-raising Budgets, the chancellor announced: A series of measures to help industry and small businesses. A Pounds 230m package to provide opportunities for the long-term unemployed. A modest extension in the range of value added tax to domestic fuel and power, to take effect from April 1994. Moves to increase the importance of the 20 per cent income tax band introduced last year. A boost to the housing market by cutting stamp duty. A relaxation of the 'full funding' rule so that bank and building society purchases of gilts will count towards financing the PSBR. Increased National Insurance contributions from 1994-95. The Budget envisages a net increase in taxation of only Pounds 490m in the coming financial year - well below the Pounds 2.25bn tax rise expected in financial markets. Although his long and complex speech failed to excite Tory backbenchers seeking a revival in the government's battered fortunes and drew withering scorn from the opposition, the chancellor spoke as a man who intended to stay in his job for some years to come. Following the recent example of US president Bill Clinton, Mr Lamont announced substantial tax rises for later years. He declared his intention to enact as many as possible into law by August when discussion of the finance bill must be completed. The measures announced yesterday will raise Pounds 6.73bn in extra taxes in 1994-95 and Pounds 10.3bn in 1995-96. Mr Lamont said that Britain would grow faster than its European Community partners this year. He forecast that the economy would expand by 1.25 per cent in 1993 and at an annual rate of 3 per cent in the first half of 1994. He made clear that the government believes bank base rates, at 6 per cent, are appropriate to current economic conditions. Although Mr Lamont did not mention it, yesterday's Budget marked a significant dilution of the government's earlier policy of balancing the Budget over the economic cycle. The Treasury 'Red Book', issued after the chancellor sat down, showed that it was the government's objective to reduce the PSBR to Pounds 39bn by 1995-96 and Pounds 30bn by 1997-98. In five years, Britain will have a deficit of 3 3/4 per cent of gross domestic product - more than the level specified as appropriate in the Maastricht treaty - compared with 8 per cent in the coming financial year. Mr Lamont said his Budget was one for 'sustained recovery' and for jobs 'not just for this year and for next year, but right through the decade'. The Budget bore the hallmarks of having paid close attention to the pleas of big industry and small businesses alike, by announcing a two-stage reduction in advance corporation tax rates and more flexibility in the handling of penalties for late value added tax returns and misdeclarations. Many of the tax increases announced yesterday were designed with more than one objective in mind. They also sought to interfere as little as possible with the supply side of the economy. Where he 'gave away' taxes in the coming financial year, the chancellor made sure that there would be even bigger income flows for the government in future years. The chancellor, for example, used environmental arguments to justify higher taxes on domestic fuel and petrol. He announced plans to levy VAT on domestic fuel and power from April 1994 - initially at 8 per cent and after a year at the full standard rate of 17.5 per cent - and to raise duties on petrol and other road fuels by at least 3 per cent in real terms in future budgets after a rise of 10 per cent in 1993-94. These measures would help the UK to meet two-thirds of its target for reducing carbon dioxide emissions under the United Nations Convention on Climatic Change, he said. As expected, Mr Lamont froze income tax allowances and thresholds for 1993-94, raising some Pounds 660m in the process, and left income tax rates unchanged at 20 per cent, 25 per cent and 40 per cent. He took modest steps to strengthen the role of the 20 per cent tax rate in the income tax system. The 20 per cent band will be extended by more than indexation to Pounds 2,500 in 1993-94 and by a further Pounds 500 in 1994-95 as a step towards turning it into the basic rate of income tax. The chancellor also reduced the tax credit on dividends from 25 per cent to 20 per cent in 1993-94 and plans to restrict the tax relief on married couples to 20 per cent from April next year. In moves designed to give a short-term boost to the housing market, he doubled the stamp duty threshold for transactions on houses, land and property to Pounds 60,000 immediately - at a cost of Pounds 220m in 1993-94 and Pounds 270m the following year. But from April 1994, tax relief on mortgage interest payments will be restricted to 20 per cent of the Pounds 30,000 limit compared with 25 per cent at present. This will yield an estimated Pounds 820m in 1994-95, rising to Pounds 870m the following financial year and cost households Pounds 10 a month. Smokers, drinkers and car drivers will feel the impact of the Budget immediately. Alcohol duties, other than spirits, rose by 5 per cent last night, putting 1 1/2 pence on a pint of beer and 5 1/2 pence on a bottle of wine. Tobacco duties increased by 6.5 per cent, adding 10 pence to the price of a packet of cigarettes. National Insurance contributions for employees and the self-employed will rise from 1994-95 onwards, increasing government income in that year by Pounds 1.79bn and by Pounds 2.22bn in 1995-96. Among measures to deal with some of Britain's 3m jobless, Mr Lamont announced plans for four pilot schemes that would subsidise employers to create jobs for the long-term unemployed. He also announced a number of projects to boost investment in infrastructure with private finance. These include the Heathrow Express rail link to Paddington Station, which will go ahead as a joint venture between British Rail and BAA, and the Channel tunnel rail link, which is to proceed as a joint venture between the public and private sectors by the end of the decade. The Budget set aside more funds to help exporters to fast-growing markets. The need for such a measure was emphasised by the Treasury forecast that the current account balance of payments deficit would rise this year to Pounds 17.5bn from Pounds 12bn in 1992.

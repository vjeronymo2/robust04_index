			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast] </F>   [Text] A serious impasse between the government and the  rearmed groups of the 3-80 Northern Front was overcome yesterday.    The demobilized members of the 3-80 Northern Front,  following  orders from its Council of Commanders headed by Jose Angel  Talavera Alaniz, alias El Chacal, had decided to suspend their  disarmament because the government was unable to fulfill its  promises made during the disarmament negotiations. It  definitely created a serious concern among the political,  economic, and social circles that see in the 3-80 Northern Front  the most serious threat to the Nicaraguan peace process.    Salvador Talavera Alaniz, alias Esteban, brother of Jose  Angel Talavera, El Chacal, who was the political leader of the  armed group for a long time, said they were able to reach a  compromise with the Government Ministry to fulfill the  agreements reached in Quilali last week when the first meetings  between the 3-80 Northern Front Council of Commanders and the  Government Ministry began.    Now that the impasse has been overcome, the former armed  groups will be able to purchase the lands they need. The former  armed groups need more than 1,300 manzanas of lands to return to  civilian life.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Illarionov, director of the Analysis and </F> Planning Group of the Chairman of the Russian Federation Council  of Ministers: "The Closer to the Market -- the Less the  Suffering"]    [Text] According to the most recent data -- on 1  October -- the volume of total indebtedness for products shipped  is 16.5 trillion rubles [R]. There is no sense in talking about  the entire amount of indebtedness, though, since it also  includes the part of it which is related to the passage of  payments. The problem worrying everyone is the outstanding debt  in industry -- the main object of the non-payments. On 1 October  it was R6.9 trillion.  <H5>  Indebtedness in the Mirror of Statistics </H5>   If we recall the "peak" of the non-payment crisis -- last  summer -- it turns out that in absolute figures, the amount of  the outstanding debt doubled: on 1 July 1992 it was R3.2  trillion. During this 18-month period, however, prices rose over  10-fold. Consequently, the outstanding debt, on a relative  scale, not only did not increase, but even dropped. The  indicators characterizing the relative proportion of  non-payments in the national economy also indicate this trend.    The relative proportion of outstanding debt in the entire  amount of indebtedness during last-year's non-payment crisis was  61-62 percent, but after the introduction of pre-payments and  carrying out reciprocal setoffs, it dropped to 49-46 percent,  and in January 1993 it was 42 percent. It remained at this level  until October of this year.    The next indicator makes understandable the way in which  outstanding indebtedness relates to the entire industrial  output. In August of last year the indebtedness exceeded the  amount of goods produced by a factor of 2.6. In December of last  year this indicator was 135-140 percent. It held at this level  for the last 10-11 months: the figure for 1 October is 137.5  percent.    A characteristic indicator is the relative proportion of  outstanding debt to the gross domestic product. At the "peak" of  non-payments it was 1.7 percent of the VVP [GDP]. In the autumn,  after carrying out the reciprocal setoff, it was 86 percent of  the GDP, in December -- 70 percent, in February 1993 -- 48  percent and in March -- 32 percent. It stayed at this level for  the entire remainder of the year: on 1 October the relative  proportion of outstanding debt was 34 percent of the gross  domestic product.    A year ago, the outstanding indebtedness exceeded the  monetary funds in the enterprises' accounts by a factor of 2.6.  In June of this year, the relative proportion of outstanding  debt exceeded the enterprises' funds by a factor of 1.3. In  October it rose slightly -- to a factor of 1.6.    In the meantime, when examining the dynamics of the growth  of  outstanding indebtedness, allowance should be made for the fact  that the data on 1 October of this year is not totally  comparable with the entire preceding series. Up until 1 October,  the outstanding indebtedness was calculated in production cost  prices. Beginning on 1 October, a new type of accountability was  introduced, and non-payments were calculated in sale prices.  Even a non-specialist knows that the sale price is higher than  the production cost price, and specialists refine this to a  difference of 20-30 percent. The latter indicators, therefore,  overstated the relatively comparable series by at least 20  percent.    We can therefore say precisely that no rise took place in  the  relative proportion of outstanding indebtedness in the national  economy. Moreover, it was reduced in the relative indicators.  This is demonstrated visually by the graphs: after the summer  "peak" of 1992, the volumes of outstanding indebtedness emerged  on an even plateau somewhere toward October and were at a stable  level for a year, and for certain sectors even fell.    Let us sum up everything that has been said. There are  non-payments in the economy. The problem, however, remained at  approximately the same level of urgency throughout the year.  There is therefore no objective basis for talking about the  exacerbation of the problem of non-payments, and there is no  payment crisis right now.  <H5>  The Reasons for Non-Payments </H5>   Since the beginning of the reform, in January of last year,  the enterprises have been relieved of the obligatory ties,  "designated" by the government, with each other, and with buyers  and suppliers. On the one hand, this relieved them of  "obligations" and disadvantageous partners, and made it possible  for them to seek more advantageous ties. It is obvious, however,  that such things cannot be done overnight, and the enterprises  continued "from force of habit" to supply their output for the  traditional buyers, without waiting for payment. The recipients  of the goods either had no money in their accounts, or had  money, but had lost interest in the goods supplied them. As a  result, the gross heap of non-payments increased quite quickly.    The compulsory pre-payment for goods supplied, introduced by  government resolution, should theoretically eliminate the  payment problem as a phenomenon. In practice, however,  pre-payment has only partially eased the urgency of the  situation. What is happening now? The idea is that the  enterprises should wait until the money arrives before they ship  their products. In reality, however, they are, as before, not  waiting for the pre-payment. Why? The certainty, to quite an  extent encouraged by last year's reciprocal setoff, continues to  exist among enterprise directors that sooner or later the  government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, whoever  you like, will pay them. This illusory hope is also fed by the  fear of facing the truth: if they do not pay, this means that  the shipment must be stopped, and consequently, production cut  back or completely curtailed. In principle, in a normal economy,  the normal producer will do just that. If he is not paid for the  goods, why produce them? Our shipping of goods in exchange for  "air" stems from the residues of the former mentality.  <H5>  What Reciprocal Setoffs Are Leading To </H5>   If we look at the experience of other countries with a  transitional economy -- Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic --  we observe a considerable amount of non-payment in them. It has  been fluctuating at a level of 20-30 percent of the gross  domestic product for many years. This problem is being gradually  solved by privatization and by enterprises adopting true market  behavior. The owner or boss is appearing who is beginning to  follow a more efficient policy. This is, of course, possible  only after a wave of bankruptcies, unemployment and changes in  production structure.    In the last few years we have emerged at a non-payment level  at which we will stay for several years. In no case should this  phenomenon be combated by methods of reciprocal setoff, although  this possibility is constantly discussed, and the Central Bank  of the Russian Federation is coming forth as a zealous advocate  of following it.    Just what did carrying out reciprocal setoff lead to last  year. Immediately upon the payment of a credit balance, the  Central Bank issued a relatively small number of loans, a fact  of which it loves to remind us. Apart from the R150 billion of  credit emission, however, a little over R1 trillion was issued  to the accounts of the commercial banks, which was then  transferred to the accounts of the enterprises. In the course of  time, the loans were converted into a cash monetary mass, which  rained down on our market in a month or two, and gave a colossal  splash of inflation.    After all, after the January 1992 price shock, the  correcting  inflation was quite quickly reduced to 10 percent a month. The  growth rates of foodstuffs in August of last year were the  lowest in the entire history of the reform -- 6 percent a month.  The restrictive monetary credit policy followed by the  government gave every chance of reducing inflation to 2-3  percent a month by the end of last year. In August the  non-payment knot was untied, but at the price of 25-30-percent  inflation last autumn.    There were, of course, other reasons -- the technical loans  to the neighboring countries, the cash ruble banknotes, which  were transferred in innumerable amounts to the states of the  ruble zone. Carrying out reciprocal setoff, however, was one of  the most powerful creditogenic and emissionogenic factors. We  carried out one reciprocal setoff. Ukraine carried out four of  them. Did they solve any non-payment problem? No. It is as  urgent as it was, remains and, apparently, will remain. The  enterprise directors, considering the last four reciprocal  setoffs, naturally hope that they will not be dropped in the  abyss for a fifth time. Reciprocal setoffs are not the least of  the reasons that the growth rates of inflation in Ukraine  exceeded 40 percent a month in 1993. In September they had  65-percent inflation, and early October estimates fluctuate  within a range of 70-80 percent. That is, Ukraine has entered a  stage of hyperinflation, in which it is not the solution of the  non-payment problem which is regarded as of paramount  importance, but the survival of the nation.    If we follow this path, we will repeat Ukraine's experience.  After all, we now have a real possibility of achieving a  reduction in the inflation growth rates. We began the year with  30-percent inflation, in which in some weeks the price growth  rate reached 12 percent. The technical mark of hyperinflation  was close at hand. From this dangerous level, thanks to the  government's consistent and basically restrictive monetary  policy (which did not please the overwhelming majority of the  people who were getting money), we emerged, in the second week  of November, at a level of 2.3 percent. (The results would have  been even more impressive if it had not been for the monetary  reform, which caused an inflation splash.)    If the reciprocal setoff between enterprises is carried out  all the same, then all the government's efforts to "beat down"  inflation and all the sacrifices that society has made in the  last two years will again come to naught.    In addition, engaging in reciprocal setoffs for non-payment  between enterprises is destroying the producers' adaptation to  the changing market structure, and is depriving them of  objective criteria. Credit emission is changing their  guidelines, and is inclining them toward the paternalistic  support of the state.  <H5>  The Problem of Payments with the Neighboring Countries </H5>   The nature of non-payment among producers who are now  foreigners to each other is analogous to that of the domestic,  the Russian. Why do the enterprises of the CIS countries  continue to supply goods to Russia without waiting for payment  from their partners? Because they hope that sooner or later  their expenses will be paid. Why do Russian enterprises not  introduce pre-payment for their goods and in general do not  count on it? Apparently, because they do not need these goods.  It is also obvious that the enterprises themselves should solve  the problems between them. The states, having established the  general rules, do not have the right to interfere in their  affairs. The main thing is that the payments pass through the  RKTs [accounting-clearing center] on time. Here, the Central  Bank must be given its due -- it has made great efforts to  accelerate the passage of the payments.    Making settlements among the enterprises of the neighboring  countries is intensifying, but the Central Bank has not solved  another problem -- the lack of a mechanism to determine the  exchange rates of national currencies in relation to the Russian  ruble.    The Central Bank quotes the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian  national currencies through the dollar. The exchange rate of the  Ukrainian karbovanets is established at stock exchange marts.  For a number of currencies of the neighboring states, however,  the quotations are either not introduced at all (they include  the Georgian kupon, the Azerbaijan manat), or are introduced at  an artificially fixed level -- these are the Belorussian, Uzbek  and Kazakh currencies.    "Floating" quotations, and market determination of the  exchange rate of the currencies of our neighboring countries are  vitally necessary. Otherwise, we will continue to subsidize  these states due to an overstated currency rate of exchange.  <H5>  Non-Payments and Structural Reorganization </H5>   If an enterprise director is absolutely certain that no  reciprocal setoff for non-payments is in the offing, and that he  will receive no help or indulgence from either the government or  from the Central Bank, he will stop supplying his goods "for  air." Then he will be obliged to change the enterprise's policy:  to cut back or completely curtail the output of goods for which  he is not paid, and begin to produce things which will be sure  to be paid for with real money. The producer will adapt to the  market normally, and this will above all be manifested in  structural changes in the economy. It is in this that the real  sense of all reforms lies.    Let us face the truth: structural reorganization is, of  course, accompanied by a rise in unemployment. You must pay for  everything. Including with unemployment, for this sort of  employment structure -- a copy of the production structure --  does not answer the market needs. Even if we have a 20-percent  unemployment level in our country, we must remember that this is  only one-fifth of the population. When, however, we support  industry which does not meet the demands of the market through  credit emission, reciprocal setoffs and subsidies, we have  inflation, and 100 percent of the population suffers from it.    Paradoxically, it is also reassuring that, under the  conditions of an economic recession, the production of a number  of goods, mainly durable goods -- irons, microwave ovens,  freezers and television sets -- is increasing, and for some  items -- by 20-30 percent. This is a colossal increase by any  measuring standards. At the same time, the production of  combines and tractors is being cut back. This means that  structural changes are taking place in a sector such as machine  building, which has been sluggish all these years.    Do you know which sector is feeling the burden of  non-payments least of all? The food sector. This is  understandable: food products are paid for immediately. The  growth rates of this sector in the course of this year have been  2-3 percent. This is the first sector to emerge from the  recession.    A whole sector and sub-sector (production of household  electrical appliances, which is "seated" in machine building)  emerged from the crisis, after carrying out structural  reorganization. Why them, precisely? Because they stand nearest  of all to the consumer market and detect all the demand  fluctuations more quickly. Other sectors, however, representing  the demand for raw material and completing items, will also  gradually emerge from the crisis.    Structural reorganization of the economy is a process which  will last for more than just a year and even for more than just  a decade. It is a real art to sense the demands of the market  and attune to it. Products that have not been paid for are among  the visible signs of production non-competitiveness. Carrying  out reciprocal setoff for non-payments will therefore only  distort the pulse of the market and deprive the producer of a  market guideline, which is not all that easy to find.   <FIG ID=FBIS-USR-002C-34A>           Graph of Outstanding Indebtedness </FIG>   <FIG ID=FBIS-USR-002C-35A>           Graph of Outstanding Indebtedness </FIG>   <FIG ID=FBIS-USR-002C-35B>           Graph of Relative Proportion of Outstanding Indebtedness </FIG>   <FIG ID=FBIS-USR-002C-36A>           Graph of Relative Proportion of Outstanding Indebtedness </FIG>   <FIG ID=FBIS-USR-002C-36B>           Graph of Relative Proportion of Outstanding Indebtedness </FIG>   <FIG ID=FBIS-USR-002C-37A>           Graph of Outstanding Indebtedness </FIG>  &lt;/graphic&gt;   &lt;/graphic&gt;   &lt;/graphic&gt;   &lt;/graphic&gt;   &lt;/graphic&gt;   &lt;/graphic&gt;</p>

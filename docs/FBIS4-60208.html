			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of  the Armed Forces, yesterday, Saturday, chaired a joint meeting  of the Presidential Council, the Speakership Council of the  House of Representatives, and the Council of Ministers. The  conferees discussed the latest developments in the secessionist  plot engineered and executed by the rebellious separatists in  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership against unity,  democracy, and Constitutional legitimacy in the country. The  conferees also discussed the blatant and escalating treasonous  stand of the so- called 'Ali Salim al-Bid -- the war criminal  and enemy of unity, democracy, and Constitutional institutions  -- who has finally revealed his real nature and the reality of  his destructive intentions and illegitimate ambitions. These  were revealed in his secessionist declaration, which is based  solely on his grudge against the people and his plot against  their unity.    Only two hours after the people rejoiced over the  declaration  of the three-day peace made yesterday by the joint meeting of  the Presidential Council, the Speakership Council of the House  of Representatives, and the Council of Ministers on the occasion  of the blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth anniversary of the  Republic of Yemen, in response to the call of the YSP unionists  and a number of Arab leaders, and to give the misled and  helpless people an opportunity to declare their clear principled  stand against the secessionists and in support of unity and  Constitutional legitimacy; following a review of the treacherous  stands adopted by secessionist elements that were accompanied by  premeditated violations of the call for peace and continued  attacks by the secessionist gang on the units of our Armed  Forces, the forces of unity protecting Constitutional  legitimacy; and in light of the steps and events that would  result, the conferees adopted a group of sovereign and  Constitutional decisions aimed at protecting unity and democracy  and pooling all efforts in the holy national war.    The joint meeting of the Presidential Council, the  Speakership Council of the House of Representatives, and the  Council of Ministers issued the following statement:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. In  light of these very delicate and important circumstances through  which our Yemeni homeland is passing; in the course of  confrontation against the challenges facing the national  constants on which society is based and to which the Republic of  Yemen adheres, particularly the Constitutional principles and  the dear national achievements of the people -- the dearest of  which are unity and democracy -- the joint meeting firmly  reiterates that the Yemeni people, particularly the Armed  Forces, the Security Forces, and all Constitutional  institutions, will confront all serious plots aimed at  encroaching on their unity or tampering with their national  choice.    Our Yemeni people, who offered great sacrifices to achieve  unity, are always ready to offer more sacrifices to safeguard  this great historic achievement. Our lofty Yemeni people, who  foiled the attempts to create a new secessionist reality in the  homeland, under the slogan of the fabricated crisis raised by  traitor 'Ali Salim al- Bid, can also bury his miserable  secessionist declaration, which was born dead and which came as  the rebellious secessionists were dying. They will face their  destiny, thanks to the steadfastness of our Yemeni people and  their rallying around their legitimate leadership and their  brave Armed Forces.    This declaration is considered by every Constitutional,  legal, and political criteria as high treason. It will not go  unpunished. It is considered a violation of the Constitution of  the Republic of Yemen and a departure from the collective will  of the people who declared their unionist word on 22 May 1990  when they said yes to the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen,  to unity, and to democracy, in the public referendum of 15 May  1991.    While we underline these facts, we urge all sons of our  struggling people to rally behind the ranks of eternal unity and  stand in the trenches to defend and preserve that unity. We  urge them to sacrifice everything they hold dear and to pool all  available resources and energies to ensure that popular efforts  are coordinated with military operations to ensure results as  soon as possible and at the least possible cost.    We are confident that our people and all their political,  social, and cultural forces -- including the ulema, thinkers,  shayks, intellectuals, merchants, workers, students, youth, men,  and women -- will set the most splendid examples in this eternal  national confrontation of a serious threat to their single  existence, their independent political entity, and their shining  civilized fate.    In this regard, and because we appreciate and value all the  previous positions of the fraternal and friendly states with our  people, and their unity and democratic march, we are certain  that they will not continue to deal with the gang of rebellion  and secession, especially after its secessionist trend was  confirmed in practice. Consequently, any kind of dealing by any  party with the traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his declaration of  secession is considered an act against the Yemeni people and  flagrant and rejected intervention in the Republic of Yemen's  internal affairs. All Constitutional authorities in our country  have the right to deal with such an act in the appropriate  manner.    In a spirit of sincere brotherhood and with the feelings of  noble tolerance that live in the hearts of all Yemenis; and with  a substantive, deep view of the requirements of logic and a deep  faith in the one country and in the loyalty and tolerance of all  of its children, we urge all unionists in the Socialist Party,  all those deceived by the rebellious secessionists, and all  those living under the tyranny of these criminal, secessionist  gangs to take swift, clear, and decisive positions on the side  of the people, their unity and Constitutional legitimacy, and  its institutions, which are based on the will of the people and  which were established according to the people's free and  democratic choice.    Out of concern for them and out of respect for the principle  of participation, we urge them to shoulder the national  responsibilities and reject any further killings, and to help  break the circle of destruction of the people's resources and  energies, for which the adventurous secessionists show no  concern. Al-Bid's statement confirms their destructive and  bloody intention. Here, we stress with all confidence and  growing ability that our Yemeni people, and all their united  forces and segments, particularly in the Armed Forces and the  security agencies, are able to (?raise higher) the word of the  people, which stems from the words of God, and to champion the  people's free will to protect unity, preserve Constitutional  legitimacy, and protect security and stability under the lofty  banners of the Republic of Yemen.</p>

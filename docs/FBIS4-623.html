			<p>BFN     [Text] A joint administrator of the Ciskei, the Reverend  Bongani Finca, says the interim council is investigating claims  that hit squads and heavily armed auxiliary forces are operating  in the territory. Mr. Finca said, at a special session of the  council at Bisho, that his administration had put an immediate  hold on all sales of state land in Ciskei. It was also  investigating massive land deals over the past few months. The  investigation would not exclude land sold to the former head of  state Oupa Gqozo. Mr. Finca said the administration did not  intend conducting a witch hunt, but all allegations of  corruption would be thoroughly investigated.</p>

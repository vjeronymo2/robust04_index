			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW'S NORMAN PICKS NOTRE DAME  </P> <P> Todd Norman, an all-Sunset League linebacker the past 2 seasons at Ocean View  High School, has made a oral commitment to attend Notre Dame in the fall,  Norman said Thursday.  </P> <P> Norman, 6 feet 6 inches and 245 pounds, led Ocean View in tackles with 95 last  season and was a second-team Times' all-county selection. He also played  offensive guard but was being recruiting as a linebacker. Norman also had  considered USC and UCLA.  </P> <P> Norman also is a standout on the basketball team. He is averaging 21.4 points  and 11 rebounds for the Oilers (13-6 overall, 3-2 in league play).  </P> <P> Norman had taken trips to national champion Notre Dame and to USC the last 2  weekends. He was planning to go to visit UCLA this weekend, but canceled the  trip after picking Notre Dame.  </P> <P> "My visit was what did it," Norman said. "It's a beautiful campus and area, and  they have the football tradition going again. I'm ready to try something new.  I'm leaving a nice area to go to a nice area." STEVE KRESAL  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["ub" report: "Critical Questions About Germany's Role in </F> the European Union"]    [Text] Bonn -- In Paris the struggle over the expansion of  the European Union [EU] toward the north is accompanied by  critical questions about Germany's future role in Europe. When  Bonn speaks of an end to the "imbalance toward the south" and  understands itself as a "hinge" in the center, this needs some  urgent explanation, circles of French diplomacy have said. At  the movement there is no real dialogue between Bonn and Paris.  If this does not change, the specters of the past that one is  encountering again everywhere cannot be banished. The  reemergence of distrust is, however, not so much a problem  between Paris and Bonn as between the Germans and the smaller  states in Europe, it was noted.    French diplomats in Bonn accuse the Germans of having forced  the EU expansion in Brussels by brute force. In particular,  there are complaints that Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  occasionally uses the wrong kind of language. Kinkel threatened  the Spanish in Brussels that he would "break their backs" if  they did not agree to a compromise with Norway. No German would  have talked like that before reunification. This rude language  led to a temporary hardening of the Spanish attitude in  Brussels, it was said.    In the Foreign Ministry it was stressed that none of the  German diplomats heard Kinkel say anything like that at the  conference table. If he did say it in a different context, a  misunderstanding is conceivable. When the minister speaks in  his Swabian dialect in the heat of discussion, this might sound  different in translation than what was meant. France may be  expressing concern that Germany wants to give up its previous  restraint.    The new role in which Germany sees itself is irritating,  above all, the smaller states in the EU and not so much Paris,  the French side said. Minor differences because of Chancellor  Helmut Kohl's nonattendance at the memorial celebrations on the  50th anniversary of the Allied invasion in Normandy on 6 June  and because of the festivities for the withdrawal of the troops  of the Western Allies from Berlin on 8 September must be seen  against the background of this general distrust in Europe.    For the first time French diplomatic circles stated that one  is wondering what the shifting of the capital from Bonn to  Berlin will mean. German politics must explain this to France  above all. It still holds true that Europe cannot be shaped  without renewed cooperation between France and Germany. Bonn and  Paris together must form the "hinge" between the north and the  south. France must know whether the Germans want to maintain  the old ties with the West from before reunification or whether  one has to prepare for a Germany that is oriented differently.  German-French friendship is not self-evident, it was stressed.  Friendship is not a natural condition between the two  countries. It must be consolidated again and again. It is high  time for Bonn and Paris to talk to each other honestly and to  frankly broach the many problems that exist between them.    A change in government in Bonn will not irritate Paris, it  was said. In personal talks Social Democratic Party Chairman  Rudolf Scharping promised complete continuity in foreign and  security policy. He stated that what he said in his speech at  the Munich security conference will apply to his chancellorship,  it was noted.</p>

Employees  of the PFA have still not been permitted to enter the building.  The order was given by Mr. Allahyarov, the Chief of Baku's  Sabail District department of police.    Yesterday, the police searched the building for the entire  day. According to the Deputy Chairman of the PFA, Arif Aliyev,  all doors and most furniture were damaged by the police.  Moreover, all telephones and computers were stolen.    Nakhichevan's sources told TURAN that yesterday the police  suggested that the employees of the Nakhichevani branch of the  PFA should leave the building. The same sources report that a  special regiment of police was sent to the Ordubadskiy Region in  Nakhichevan. As is known, presently the leader of the PFA,  Abulfaz Elchibey, lives near there. All those facts cause  further tension in Nakhichevan.    Meanwhile, the opposition is still subjected to persecution  in Baku. This morning, the policemen removed the employees of  Nasimi District branch of the PFA from their building. At the  same time, official mass media waged a smear campaign against  the opposition. "The enemies of the Azerbaijani nation must be  punished", reports Azeri television.</p>

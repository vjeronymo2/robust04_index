			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Questions asked about Ritblat share purchase - Institutions concerned about a conflict of interest INSTITUTIONAL investors in British Land were yesterday asking questions about the deal secured by Mr John Ritblat, chairman, to buy shares at 298p while the market price jumped 46p yesterday to 344p. More fundamentally, they were concerned that the partnership deal with Mr George Soros's Quantum group could cause a conflict for British Land's management, trying to serve both its own shareholders and the partnership. The subject is fraught since in 1989 institutional investors stopped British Land from spinning off most of its properties into a new company. The deal included management incentive targets which shareholders considered too easy. As part of yesterday's deal setting up the partnership which will invest Pounds 500m in property, Quantum is to buy 11.3m new shares at 298p each, the closing share price on Tuesday. However, Quantum is buying the shares ex the final 4.72p dividend and ex the 4-for-17 rights issue at 245p which British Land also announced yesterday. Mr Ritblat is buying 2m shares personally, of which 538,383 will come from taking up the rights on his existing holding. At least another 1m shares and up to all the remainder of the 2m will be bought from Quantum at the 298p price. This will take his total holding to 4.29m shares. It was also revealed yesterday that Mr Ritblat's salary rose by 7.9 per cent last year to Pounds 336,300. On the face of it, the share deal gives Mr Ritblat a rapid profit. However, advisers to British Land said that under the terms of the agreement with Mr Soros, Mr Ritblat had to retain 4m shares for a year, so he could not realise yesterday's profit. Further, he is required to hold 2m shares until the end of the partnerships 'acquisition period' at the end of 1997. An incentive for British Land management in the form of options over another 4m of the Quantum shares, again at 298p, cannot be exercised until 2003, and only then if certain performance criteria are met. British Land said Mr Soros had insisted that Mr Ritblat put his own money into British Land shares. Rather than viewing the agreement as a way for Mr Ritblat to buy shares cheaply, they were seen as the 'stick' part of a 'carrot and stick' arrangement. Since the shares to satisfy the management options would come from Quantum rather than from the company the incentive scheme was not dilutive for shareholders. As for potential conflicts, British Land said that what was good for the partnership would be good for its own shareholders. Unlike the 1989 deal, which was defeated at a shareholder vote, yesterday's proposal is not subject to shareholder approval.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mark Aleksandrov: "In the Vicious Circle </F> Which Could Lead to a Nuclear Arms Race"]    [Excerpts] Against the background of the vociferous  campaign in the Western mass media over the DPRK's secession  from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], reports of  the reluctance of India and Pakistan to accede to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty have been overshadowed. Indeed, the  press in general devotes little attention to the problem of the  possible possession of nuclear weapons by these states. And yet  it has a very serious character. [passage omitted]    Fears are now increasing all the time in the world that  nuclear weapons could be launched in this region, since  relations between India and Pakistan are extremely tense, and  several times have deteriorated to the point of open military  operations. But both these states are ostentatiously  disregarding the opinion of other countries. Pakistan will not  renounce its "nuclear option" until all vexed questions with  India are settled, including the problem of Kashmir, Pakistani  Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali stated in a speech to  parliament. He ruled out the possibility of a compromise with  the United States on the nuclear question; the latter is  offering to supply Islamabad with 38 F-16 fighter bombers in  exchange for winding down its nuclear program. The minister  also stated that his country will not sign the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty until Delhi agrees to accede to this  international document.    As for India, it is giving extremely contradictory signals.  First Delhi claims that nuclear weapons arsenals must be  destroyed worldwide, then it says that it reserves the right to  choose whether to develop its own nuclear bomb or not. At the  same time, it refuses to talk about signing up to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, declaring it "discriminatory."    Thus a kind of vicious circle is arising. Both Pakistan and  India are continuing their research programs, with all the  latent danger of a nuclear arms race and the danger of the use  of those weapons. And no arguments have any effect on either  country.    There are many factors here. The principal ones, of course,  are the failure to resolve the numerous and long-standing  problems in Indo-Pakistani relations. But perhaps not the least  role here is played by the double standards practiced by so  influential a state as the United States with regard to  countries which refuse to submit to the international nuclear  nonproliferation regime. Whereas, for instance, the DPRK is  being subjected to real ostracism, only reproaches or  expressions of regret are leveled at Pakistan.    Next year an international conference is due to be held with  a view to extending the term of the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty. It is expected that the treaty will become indefinite  and universal, that is to say, if not all the states in the  world, then the overwhelming majority will be participants in  the treaty. And it goes without saying that the requirements on  all countries, whether the DPRK or Iraq, Israel or Japan, India  or Pakistan, should be the same. All mankind is vitally  interested in such a solution to the nonproliferation problem.</p>

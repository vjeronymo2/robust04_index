			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ILL JUROR PROMPTS DELAY IN MCMARTIN  PRE-SCHOOL TRIAL  </P> <P> The long McMartin Pre-School molestation trial hit another snag Tuesday when a  juror's eye problem postponed the prosecution's final day of closing arguments  until today.  </P> <P> Barring further delays and after lengthy instructions from Los Angeles Superior  Court Judge William Pounders, the case is expected to go to the jury on  Thursday, after 2 1/2 years.  </P> <P> Ray Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are charged with 65  counts of molestation and conspiracy involving 11 youngsters who attended their  family-run nursery school in Manhattan Beach. Both are free on bail.  </P> <P> Each side was allotted 6 1/2 days for final arguments, in an effort to speed up  the proceedings and avoid a mistrial. The case has lasted six years and cost  county taxpayers more than $15 million. The jury, which once had six  alternates, is down to its final 12 members, due to health and job problems.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin, who has said she will finish her remarks today,  a half day before her deadline, has the last word because the burden of proof  is on the prosecution.  </P></p>

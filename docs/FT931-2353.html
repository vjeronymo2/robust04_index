			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Man in the News: A spoonful of financial pain - The chancellor's current buoyancy has not been affected by an unpopular Budget / Norman Lamont There was a self-consciously poignant moment this week as Mr Norman Lamont set about persuading the British people that they would one day applaud him for putting up their taxes. Sharing for an instant the burden of his office with a few million television viewers, Mr Lamont recalled the judgment of a colleague. Good chancellors, this wise soul had explained, were invariably unpopular. Mr Lamont allowed himself a chuckle. By that standard, he sometimes thought he was the best guardian of the nation's finances there had ever been. This weekend as he contemplates the public mood after his third and perhaps (just perhaps) his last Budget, Mr Lamont can hardly be blamed for seeking solace. Before Tuesday's package he was unpopular with the voters. After it, he was more deeply so. The reaction was not all bad. The broadsheet newspapers by and large judged that in the circumstances (and that is an important caveat) he had done something like the right thing. Faced with a Pounds 1bn-a-week Budget deficit, there was no option but to raise taxes. Cutting tax allowances such as mortgage interest relief and extending valued-added tax was probably the best way to do it. The 'green' edges provided by a higher tax on heating and fuel went down well with the chattering classes. The Conservative party at Westminster offered a broadly similar assessment, though their unease at the extension of VAT to domestic fuel forced another of those by now ubiquitous government U-turns. A significant chunk of the extra revenue will have to be spent on offsetting help for the poorest. But the tabloid press, more attuned than the politicians and journalists who inhabit the Westminster village to the mood in the pubs, was far less generous. It reminded the chancellor of all those broken promises - offered only a year ago when he was cutting taxes to help the Conservatives win the general election. It seized on the VAT move as an assault on pensioners. It had no doubt that the 1 per cent rise in National Insurance contributions was a disguised increase in the basic rate of income tax. The tabloids reminded the chancellor more effectively than the Labour party that he could not claim to be clearing up after some other government's mess. Mr Rubert Murdoch's Sun, which has been harrying Mr Lamont for months over his personal affairs, declared that it was no longer enough for him simply to resign. He should commit himself to a certain kind of hospital. Mr Lamont was unapologetic. He demonstrated last autumn after sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism that it would take more than a few nasty newspaper editorials to shift him from a job he has always wanted. He has not been singing in his bath this week (apparently he now prefers reading the newspapers during his evening soak). But he is personally buoyant. Sensibly, he has decided to mend some of the bridges he burnt with the media after the ERM debacle and during the controversy over the Treasury's contribution to a personal legal bill. He has relearned how to smile rather than snarl when criticised. He will stay at No 11 Downing Street for as long as Mr John Major will have him. The chancellor is convinced that the Budget struck the right balance between nurturing economic recovery in the short-term and bringing down the Budget deficit over the medium term. He decided on this growth-now-pain-later-strategy in January at the Treasury's pre-Budget gathering in Chevening. There was subsequently some debate about how the extra money would be raised. Mr Lamont considered extension of the VAT base to beyond domestic fuel. His novel plan to encourage the long-term unemployed back to work by paying benefits to employers ready to hire them was added late in the day. Mr Lamont spotted the idea in an article in the FT (reading it, of course, in his bath). But the outline of the macro-economic strategy did not change between Chevening and last Tuesday's speech. Mr Lamont made it clear to the prime minister that he regarded the pledge to raise an extra Pounds 6.5bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 10.5bn in 1995-96 as the minimum necessary. He also insisted from the outset that the government would have to legislate for the increases this year if the strategy was to have a shred of credibility in financial markets. Those who have talked to him since Tuesday have taken away the suspicion that, left to his own devices, he would have preferred to have been a shade tougher. But there is no evidence of any great row with the prime minister during the Budget's preparation. On the day itself, Mr Major volunteered to his Downing Street aides that the chancellor had come up with the right Budget at the right time. Mr Lamont wants the tax increases to be seen alongside the squeeze on public spending set last November in the autumn statements and the 1 to 4 per cent inflation target which has replaced the ERM as the lodestar for monetary policy. Taken together, he believes all three represent a coherent macro-economic policy which should last the lifetime of the present parliament. He intends to supplement it with an approach to micro-economics which combines the free-market zeal of the Thatcher years with a recognition that government can single out manufacturing industry for help. His judgment on the politics of the Budget was similarly sanguine. No matter that he raised taxes just a year after promising to cut them. Circumstances, a favourite friend of politicians when pledges are dropped, had changed. Economic recovery would dim tabloid memories (by yesterday The Sun had been driven to welcome on its front page the fall in unemployment and a pick-up in the housing market). The electorate would thank him for restoring a grip on the economy, for refusing to duck difficult decisions. Had not Lord Howe got it right by being similarly tough in 1981? Therein lies the gamble. Mr Lamont was probably correct in judging that to have done nothing would have been a more damaging admission of failure. But he may well have been too hopeful. A ministerial colleague - in admittedly mischievous mood after a good dinner  -summed up the chancellor's predicament with a cruelly amusing metaphor. Mr Lamont was like the bank robber who wounded an innocent by-stander while plying his trade. By stopping to ensure an ambulance was called before making his getaway, the robber left the bank convinced that he would be judged a popular hero rather than a villain. Well, not quite. Mr Lamont cannot take for granted the nation's willingness to forget and forgive. He has staked all on the economic recovery taking hold before the government's finances get any worse. If it does not, then he or his successor will find themselves repeating the tax-raising exercise in November. He is assuming that improved housing and labour markets will persuade the public to take the deferred tax increases in their stride; that by the time of the next election in 1996 or 1997, reductions equivalent to 2p or 3p off the basic rate of income tax will restore the Conservatives' tax-cutting credentials. Maybe. In the meantime, what of Mr Lamont's future? He is 50 and has no inclination to move out of the world of politics he has inhabited for most of his adult life. He would be happy to stay at the Treasury indefinitely. If the prime minister decided he must move, then the only other job that would interest him would be the foreign office. The chancellor has a case for staying on. His first Budget in 1991 dug the government out of Lady Thatcher's poll tax hole. His second helped win the general election. The ERM debacle cannot be pinned on him without implicating the prime minister. He has already jotted down his own account of the fateful sequence of events which led to Black Wednesday. The most common assessment at Westminster this week was that the Budget had probably enhanced his chances of remaining. Those long-awaited green shoots are showing signs of taking root. He has pre-empted many of the decisions which a successor might want to take in the first unified Budget in December. The truth is that Mr Major has not made up his mind about cabinet reshuffles. He will do so only when he manages to set himself free from the political quagmire of the Maastricht treaty. Until then Mr Lamont, like the rest of us, will have to wait and see whether this week's Budget improves with age.</p>

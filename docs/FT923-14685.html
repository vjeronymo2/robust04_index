			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / People: Non-executive directors Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers and former head of defence export services at the MoD, at TI GROUP. This appointment brings non-executive directors into a majority of one on the TI board. ***** Sir Patrick Wright, recently retired head of the diplomatic service, at BAA. ***** Waverley Cameron has resigned from WAVERLEY CAMERON. ***** Donald McFarlane, chairman of Senior Engineering, at JAMES DICKIE. ***** Colin Popham has retired from BENTALLS. ***** Sir David Trippier at DUNLOP HEYWOOD. ***** Sir Colin Campbell, Lord Rees and Sir John Swire have retired from JAMES FINLAY. ***** Wallace Clapperton, recently retired from Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities and responsible for Scantronic's original flotation, at SCANTRONIC. ***** Sir Ian Morrow has retired from The LAIRD GROUP. ***** Sir Christopher Laidlaw has retired from DALGETY. ***** Bradley Hanson as Warburg's representative at STERLING PUBLISHING GROUP. ***** Edwin Davies who, in 1989 sold his company Fernox Manufacturing to Cookson, at CAMBRIDGE TECHNOLOGY &amp; SCIENCE. ***** Francis Maude (above left), the ambitious Tory party politician, may have had the misfortune to lose his seat at the general election but he has lost little time in building up an alternative business career. Already installed as head of the privatisation unit at Sal-omon Brothers, he has now become a non-executive director of Asda, the Leeds-based grocery chain. Maude, who was previously Financial Secretary of the Treasury, has a lot in common with Archie Norman, Asda's chief executive. Both studied at Cambridge University, rose rapidly in their respective careers and have made a big splash in their chosen fields before reaching the age of 40. Norman says Maude has a 'sharp intelligence and a sardonic sense of humour - which will come in useful at Asda'. The company, which is struggling to turn itself round after a painful few years, has also appointed David O'Brien (above right) as a non-exec-utive director. O'Brien, a former managing director of Rank Xerox (UK), is currently chief executive of the Bradford-based National and Provincial Building Society, which will go down well in Asda's Yorkshire homelands. Frank Knight, a former deputy chief executive of United Biscuits, who joined the Asda board as a non-executive director last September has been elevated to the post of deputy chairman. Patrick Gillam, Asda's chairman, said it had always been his intention to strengthen the non-executive representation on the board. He said all the new appointments would contribute to the company's development. 'Nobody comes on the board because they are a mate of mine,' he said somewhat defensively at yesterday's press conference.</p>

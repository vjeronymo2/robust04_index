			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: All eyes on Bundesbank as markets weaken EUROPEAN bond markets seemed poised yesterday for a strong finish to the week if the Bundesbank decides not to raise Germany's key Lombard rate at its council meeting today. The UK government bond market could be the biggest gainer, according to a broad range of economists and traders. Yesterday, though, the hatches stayed firmly battened down as traders awaited this morning's Bundesbank council meeting, with gilts suffering another bad case of jitters. Other European bond markets remained in the doldrums, waiting for fears of a hike in the Lombard rate - or some other drastic tightening in monetary policy - to be dispelled. Most observers by yesterday had largely ruled out the prospect of an immediate increase in the Lombard rate, the emergency funding rate for banks which is seen internationally as the key determinant of German monetary conditions. However, views remained mixed on the authorities' likely stance on two other options: a rise in the 8 per cent discount rate, which sets the floor for money market rates, and a cut in the DM70bn quota for banks to sell bills at the discount rate. German money market rates crept up yesterday at the latest weekly repurchase tender, though this was put down to technical factors and strong bidding for funds rather than to any policy signal by the authorities. On Liffe, the bund futures contract edged down to 87.72 from 87.74 in a moderately busy day, as cash bunds also remained paralysed in a narrow range. THE UK government bond market, which had recovered some of its composure on Tuesday, slid again yesterday as traders positioned themselves for the worst from Germany. The short gilt contract on Liffe lost around  1/4 of a point to trade by the close at 89.77, a signal that the market expects the UK base rate to creep back above its current 10 per cent level. Longer-dated gilts also reflected the nerves, with the benchmark 9 per cent bonds due 2008 losing  1/4 of a point to finish at 101 9/32 , a yield of 8.85 per cent. FRENCH government bond prices also slipped as traders returned from the long Bastille Day holiday, shrugging off encouraging news that inflation had slowed to 0.1 per cent in June. Prices fell to match losses in bunds this week. The sale tomorrow of FFr11bn-FFr13bn of two and five-year notes (BTANs) also left the market feeling bearish. The benchmark 8.5 per cent OAT due 2002 slipped 0.15 of a point to a yield of 8.81 per cent, a spread over bunds of around 80 basis points. US Treasury prices rose sharply yesterday in the wake of the first monthly decline in industrial production since February. In late trading,the benchmark 30-year government bond, which has recently lagged behind the short end, was  23/32 higher at 104 9/32 , yielding 7.626 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  1/8 at 101 7/16 , yielding 4.209 per cent. Although the 0.3 per cent decline in industrial production and the 0.4 percentage point drop in capacity utilisation in June matched market forecasts, the figures provided additional support for market sentiment because they confirmed what June's employment report suggested - that the economic recovery has been extremely weak. Economists were quick to warn that production levels would remain sluggish in the coming months due to poor growth in factory orders and relatively high inventory levels. In the credit markets, the Federal Reserve added reserves to the system through Dollars 1.5bn in customer repurchase agreements in an attempt to counter the slight firmness of Fed funds, which were trading at 3 3/8 per cent, slightly higher than the Fed's target of 3 1/4 per cent. PROFIT-taking wiped out some of the recent gains in Japanese government bonds, despite an improvement in early trading in Tokyo. Data on industrial output (down 1.9 per cent in May) and bankruptcies (up 30 per cent in June) gave further evidence of economic weakening. But the official line on the lack of need for a discount rate cut remained unchanged. The yield on the benchmark bond No 129, which opened at 5.19 per cent, fell to 5.15 per cent before climbing to 5.22 in late trade.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Differing views of financial statements - In A Nutshell Nearly half of the directors of small companies appear to be unaware they are responsible for preparing their company's annual financial statements. Forty three per cent think it is the responsibility of their auditors, while 3 per cent believe it is the job of the shareholders, a survey* of 200 directors by accountants Baker Tilly showed. From September, auditors' reports will be required to include a statement explicitly recognising directors' responsibility for the accounts. The survey, of companies with turnover up to Pounds 2.8m, was prompted by the government's proposal to remove the audit requirement for companies with sales of less than Pounds 37,600. Most of the directors questioned favoured abolishing the audit requirement for companies of a similar size to their own, but wanted it replaced with a simpler 'compilation report'. The most popular turnover threshold for an audit - chosen by 34 per cent of respondents - was Pounds 350,000. the present limit for the cash accounting for VAT. *Directors' Views of the Small Company Audit. 2 Bloomsbury Street, London WC1B 3ST.

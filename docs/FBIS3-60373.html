Regarding the other issues discussed on Friday by the  Council, the Presidency noted the following results:    1. Dumping of waste. The Council has reported on the  advancement of work relating to this issue which has progressed  to such an extent under the Belgian Presidency that it could be  closed, under Greek Presidency, during the first half of 1994.  It also noted a first overview of results of the cost/profit  analysis of this directive as far as certain Member States are  concerned. The full Commission report is expected early 1994.    2. Elimination of PCB [polychlorinated biphenyls]/PCT  [polychlorinated triphenyls]. "Good progress" was noted in the  evolution of technical work on this directive. The Twelve  reportedly came close to consensus on the coefficients and  technical norms as well as on the calendar for controlled  harmonisation. The Commission felt that technical work should  focus on elimination on the run up to 2010 and on the limit of  concentration.    3. Green Paper on civil liability for environmental damage.  At a public session, the Council held a full round table  discussion on this document which has already been discussed by  public and professional circles. In his introductory speech to  the debate, Commissioner Paleokrassas pointed out that only two  Member States so far have formally submitted their comments on  the Green Paper and that the European Parliament has been  associated in a "very fruitful" public hearing. He felt that it  was too early, at this stage, to imagine that the state of the  environment did not justify measures in this area. Ministers  replied by indicating major directions for reflection. They  raised questions on several major themes such as: prevention,  framework measures that could be justified at Community level,  insurance. By way of conclusion, the Commissioner stressed that  the subject is a tricky one and requires very serious  examination before any decision is taken. He said he felt that  the White Paper and/or formal proposals could be presented  before next year. Between now and then, a certain number of  points should be specified:    (a) the scope, that is, the categories of damage to be  considered;    (b) the sharing of responsibilities between the Union,  Member  States and other levels of responsibility; in this connection,  Mr Paleokrassas felt that "even if we depend upon national  legislations, we must ensure that we are within a coherent  Community framework that does not cause competition distortion  between Member States;"    (c) the main aim of the legislation should be prevention.    4. Implementation of Community legislation. In comments on  the report recently presented by the Commission, Mr Paleokrassas  stressed the "unsatisfactory state" of the situation: many  directives have not been transposed into national legislation by  Member States or have been transposed incorrectly (directive  relating to the assessment of environmental impact). In  addition, "the practical application of Community environmental  legislation to individual cases often seems inadequate, if one  measures the growing number of violations and complaints (about  one thousand each year)," he pointed out. The Council has held  an in-depth discussion on the means to be implemented to reverse  this trend. On this subject, Mr Paleokrassas welcomed the  initiative aimed at establishing, within the framework of the  Vth Programme, a network of Community authorities to ensure that  environmental legislation is applied. In his view, this  represents a "major contribution to the development of common  approaches from the technical and procedural aspects of  implementation and execution." The setting up of the Environment  Agency should, for its part, allow the EC to have the means  necessary to improve the situation.    5. Follow-up of results of Unced [United Nations Conference  on Environment and Development] in Rio. The Commissioner  announced the preparation of the Community report to be  submitted to the second session of the UN Committee on  Sustainable Development in May 1994 and regretted that the  Community was not formally participating and that the specific  terms of the fund for LDCs [less developed countries] had not  yet been implemented. Several Ministers were concerned about the  lack of visibility of Community action and the risk that the  commitments made in Rio had not been executed. Finally, the  Council appealed to national and European decisionmakers so that  part of the loan foreseen for the large European networks  suggested by Mr Delors be allocated to environmental initiatives  such as the clean-up of polluted soil, the restoration of  natural parks, prevention of damage caused by bad weather.</p>

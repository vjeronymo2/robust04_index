			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vidin, March 6 (BTA correspondent) -- The Bulgarian  ship Khan Koubrat towing six barges loaded with 6,000 tonnes of  oil left Bulgarian territorial waters at 3 a.m. on Sunday, BTA  learned from the State Shipping Inspectorate. It was followed  by two patrol boats of the Western European Union (WEU) and a  patrol boat of the Bulgarian border troops upstream to kilometre  845 at the Timok River. The ship disobeyed orders to stop.    Official sources who declined to be named said that today at  noon the ship called at the Serb port of Prahovo where the  unloading of the fuel began. This is the first armed hijacking  of a ship in the history of Bulgarian river shipping, according  to reliable sources, provided it is not a sham.    As the ship passed Vidin yesterday, two persons could be  seen  on deck pointing a gun and a pistol at seven crew members who  held their hands up.    All papers of the ship were left behind at the port of  Somovit and the regional prosecutor's office in Nikopol, which  was expected to rule on a document crime consisting in the entry  of a new discharge port in the shipping documents.    The fate of the crew is unknown. If kidnapped at gun point,  they should be let free to return to Bulgaria.    This morning Vidin customs representatives met WEU monitors  in Calafat (Romania) to discuss the incident. Customs Chief  Nedyalko Yolov declined to give official information.    The Council of Ministers today said the Khan Koubrat had  crossed Bulgaria's western border with its cargo, entering the  Serb section of the Danube. After intensive talks it was  decided not to use force to free the hostages and stop the ship  so as to avoid the risk of bloodshed and pollution of the Danube  by a possible explosion, the government's press office also  said. Vesselin Blagoev, chief secretary of the Council of  Ministers, said the competent authorities are working on the  case.    The Khan Koubrat and six barges carrying 6,000 tonnes of oil  were detained by WEU monitors near Calafat on January 31 on  suspicion of sanctions-busting. Pending a ruling by the Nikopol  regional prosecutor's office, the ship was held under customs  control at the port of Somovit. On the night of March 3, it  sailed undocumented westward to Romanian and Yugoslav  territorial waters, apparently hijacked according to eyewitness  accounts of representatives of the Vidin customs and the State  Shipping Inspectorate and of BTA's local correspondent. The  possibility of a sham hijacking cannot be ruled out.    Later on the Foreign Ministry's press office said the  ministry had been assigned to inform the UN Sanctions Committee  of the incident, to take the necessary steps to repatriate the  crew, ship and cargo, and to have the hijackers handed over by  the country where they will seek refuge. According to the  border troops and WEU mission leaders, armed persons aboard the  ship had forced the crew to steer to Bulgaria's western border,  the Foreign Ministry's press release says. The information by  the WEU mission leaders that there might be foreign nationals  among the hijackers has not been confirmed so far by the  investigation launched by the competent Bulgarian authorities,  according to the Foreign Ministry.    The Bulgarian authorities took steps to stop the ship as  soon  as the violation of the customs ban was established. They were  assisted by the Romanian authorities, monitors of the WEU  mission and the Sanctions Assistance Mission, the Foreign  Ministry said. All attempts to stop the train of vessels were  unsuccessful.</p>

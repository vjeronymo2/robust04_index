			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Arts: Some like it Wilder THAT'S THE trouble with re-doing Some Like It Hot. Almost everyone who goes to the Prince Edward Theatre will have seen Billy Wilder's movie comedy - and presumably enjoyed it as much as everybody else, if they are going again. Even with a better show, and with generous good will, the interval was always going to be a-twitter with odious comparisons. Yet for what it is, the show is not at all bad (though in the first half the frantic determination of the cast suggested that they might have their doubts); quite a lot of people may enjoy it. Tommy Steele directs and takes the Tony Curtis role in a musical version first tried in New York in the early 1970s: score and lyrics by the reliable Jule Styne and Bob Merrill, book 'based on the screenplay'. The sea-change has been been considerable, whether on the Atlantic crossing or during the original musicalising - probably both. Certainly the film was richer and stranger; making time for all the singing and dancing here incurs much trimming and simplifying, and some of the new repartee is of numbing crudity. Though film can manage things that the stage cannot, the designers of the show (Terry Parsons and Nick Richings) strike back vigorously with a bright, brisk series of period-tacky sets, and then a terrific car-and-cycle chase which cheekily uses film. The chorus of Hoods, Broads and Musicians look satisfyingly peculiar, and downright etiolated in their Florida swimsuits - not a bit like a well-scrubbed, sedulously tanned Broadway chorus. Norman Maen first assigns them a leggy nightclub-dance, preening and funny, and then gives the men an antic number for 'Penniless Bums', one of Styne's neatest contributions. Later the choreography grows more ordinary, though the dancers do their best to give it a specious fizz. Better than end-of-pier, but an aeon behind A Chorus Line: and wasn't that 20 years ago already? A basic proposition of the movie was that the Curtis and Jack Lemmon characters were doleful, harried and - with good cause, in view of the pursuing gangsters - perpetually nervous. When Steele bounces on with his phosphorescent grin, a sort of Bermondsey Cat's smile which at each entrance seems to precede him by a good two feet, the premises are instantly altered. He brims with winning confidence, agelessly sparky and trim. (Just once in a while, the effect was slightly macabre.) Since he has to have a big tap number, the title song is enlisted for the purpose and everybody else joins in. Coming late in the action, that puts the story on hold when it needs to be hurtling along. Furthermore, it leaves Steele and his sidekick Billy Boyle - large and discouraged but comically graceful, even subtle - doing full-dress professional drag acts, without a shred of excuse in the story nor their hapless characters. British pantomime takes over. Mandy Perryment strives gamely to recapture the dizzy Marilyn Monroe persona. On opening night she began like a Speak Your Weight machine on fast-forward, but later she relaxed enough to emit some bemused human signals. Her lusty, fuddled old Croesus is Royce Mills, who sports an arthritically horny edge and can sing, and there are ripe supporting cartoons from Veronica Clifford and Edward Phillips.</p>

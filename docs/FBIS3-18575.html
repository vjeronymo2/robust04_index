We must take advantage of the present opportunities."  Foreign Minister Willy Claes reiterated this position in Paris  yesterday, after meeting with President Francois Mitterrand and  his colleague Alain Juppe.    Claes was in Paris on a working visit. He reported to his  colleague Juppe on the talks on European Union [EU] enlargement.  Both ministers also discussed the financing of the common  foreign policy. Some members of the Union argue it should be  financed by special contributions from the member states.  "However, we can hardly develop a common policy, if, with every  action, we must discuss who will pay what," Claes stated.    France has now suggested eastablishment of a fund which  would  be financed partly by Community funds and partly by member state  contributions. "This seems to be a good working hypothesis,"  Claes said.    With Mitterrand, the Belgian minister talked mainly about  the  situation in Rwanda and Burundi, where he was on a visit last  week, and about Zaire.    With his counterparts, Claes also made preparations for the  Paris Conference. Last December's European Summit in Brussels  adopted French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's idea of a  Security Pact in Europe.    Belgium fears that this conference might be pointless,  unless  one succeeds in getting countries such as Slovakia and Romania,  which are showing little interest, around the table. The  purpose of the conference, scheduled to start in Paris next  April, is precisely to convice the countries of Central and East  Europe, including Russia, to reach agreements concerning their  borders and respect of minorities on their territories.</p>

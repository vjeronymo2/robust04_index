			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters suggested various changes to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of tuition charges that must be refunded for withdrawals which occur during certain portions of the academic period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary believes the refund percentages provided in appendix A are reasonable and appropriate. The commenters have not given evidence or justification as to why these refund levels should be altered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that institutions should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed to deduct a students unpaid charges from a refund due under appendix A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The June 8, 1993 final regulations require that, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all refund calculations other than a statutory  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation, a students unpaid charges be subtracted from the amount an institution could otherwise retain. The Secretary finds no justification for exempting refund calculations under appendix A from this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter believed board charges are adequately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated under part VI of appendix A, and should not be discussed separately in part VII.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary believes housing charges are separate and distinct costs from board charges, even though some institutions voluntarily choose to link these two costs together. A housing contract prescribes charges for a dormitory or housing space that presumably cannot be refilled past a certain point; therefore, such charges are expended at the point the space  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be refilled. Part VI provides for the refund and retention of such charges accordingly. Board charges, however, are incrementally expended over the length of the period for which the student has been charged; the cost of food the student has not yet consumed cannot fairly be retained by the institution. The contract concept applied to housing charges, therefore, is inappropriate when determining the fair refund of board costs. Part VII, therefore, provides separate and distinct guidance for the refund of board charges. For the purposes of calculating a refund under appendix A, institutions must treat these two charges separately, in accordance with the appropriate guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested adding specific language to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section VIII A to clarify that an administrative fee (of the lesser of $100 or 5 percent of tuition) cannot be retained in the case of a student whose aid package consisted only of FFEL programs funds, because FFEL programs funds must be returned in full to the lender if the student withdraws before attending one class.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The commenter is correct regarding the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that FFEL programs funds be returned in full in the circumstance noted. However, the Secretary does not believe this or other such requirements should be reiterated in appendix A. The first paragraph of appendix A clearly states that these requirements do not affect an institution's obligation to comply with other Department of Education regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Five commenters requested the Secretary clarify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment of unofficial withdrawals under appendix A. Specifically, two of these commenters believed the language of Section X clearly implies that a students failure to give withdrawal notice in writing would be just cause to deny the student's refund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary considers an institution to have met  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fair and equitable refund requirement if it uses a policy that meets the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> minimum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  requirements of appendix A. Although appendix A does not recognize unofficial withdrawals and recommends against the institution's acceptance of oral withdrawal notification, an institution is not prohibited from adapting a more liberal interpretation of this subject into its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of appendix A requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.23&blank;Audits, Records, and Examinations   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters suggested including the nationally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized accrediting agencies among the list of agencies with which institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs must cooperate in the conduct of audits, investigations, and program reviews authorized by law. A few commenters also suggested including the nationally recognized accrediting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies among the list of agencies with which a third-party servicer must cooperate in the conduct of audits, investigations, and program reviews authorized by law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees with the commenters. Accrediting agencies assist the Secretary in determining institutional participation in the Title IV, HEA programs and should therefore be included in the list of entities that an institution must cooperate with. A third-party servicer, acting as an agent of the institution, should be required to cooperate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with any accrediting agency that accredits an institution with which the servicer contracts to administer any aspect of the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section is revised to include nationally recognized accrediting agencies in the list of entities that an institution and a third-party servicer must cooperate with in the conduct of audits, investigations, or program reviews authorized by law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter was concerned that the requirement for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer to cooperate with a guaranty agency and other entities in the conduct of audits, investigations, and program reviews, would give the guaranty agency access to proprietary information of that servicer. The commenter noted that guaranty agencies directly compete for the services provided by other third-party servicers. The commenter suggested limiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperation to only include information that a holder of loans would be required to make available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary disagrees with the commenter. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations only require access to a third-party servicer's records to the extent necessary to monitor compliance with applicable statutes, regulations, special arrangements, agreements, and limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Another commenter felt that a third-party servicer should not be required to cooperate with these entities to the extent that that cooperation includes the copying of computer programs that are the sole property of the servicer. The commenter felt that any copying would violate copyright laws included in the licensing agreement to the software; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter recommended deleting this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These regulations require access to a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer's records to the extent necessary to monitor compliance with applicable statutes, regulations, special arrangements, agreements, and limitations. These regulations do not require, nor does the Secretary expect, a third-party servicer to violate any copyright laws governing computer programs. Nevertheless, a third-party servicer, like an institution, is expected to make available for examination and copying all relevant information, including the computer program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

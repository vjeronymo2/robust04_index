			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F> Udo van Kampen in Brussels on 7 January -- recorded]    [Text] [Van Kampen] Mr. Woerner, the former Warsaw Pact  states are impetuously urging to join NATO. What can they  expect from the forthcoming summit?    [Woerner] Two things that lead in this direction: First, a  declaration of principle that we are willing to accept new  members in an evolutionary process, without giving a specific  deadline or criteria for that; second, a very specific offer --  Partnership for Peace, which is close political and military  cooperation agreed on between the respective state and NATO.    [Van Kampen] In particular the Poles say: This is not  enough for us. We want a specific date so as to have our  security interests safeguarded.    [Woerner] I do not think that such a decision will be made  at the summit. For that we still need some time. However, one  can see this offer of Partnership for Peace as a first step for  some of these states on the path toward membership.    [Van Kampen] But is there still time for that after the  election success of right-wing extremist Zhirinovskiy in Russia?    [Woerner] I think there is still time. There is no question  that, of course, Russia's behavior will influence the decisions  of this alliance in the future and, to a certain extent, also  the speed with which this process will take place.    [Van Kampen] Is there not too much consideration for  Russia's interests? Does this not practically mean that Russia  has a veto right?    [Woerner] Quite the contrary. We do not give anyone a veto  right -- not the Russians, either. However, it is clear that we  do not make this decision in the abstract sense but in a very  specific security situation and in view of two big historical  changes -- first, building a new security architecture for all  of Europe, together with the Russians and not against the  Russians. This is an important international goal, which is  also in the interest of the East Europeans. Second, anchoring  the East Europeans -- at least those that belong to the West --  firmly in the structures of the West.    [Van Kampen] Are you afraid that a speedy expansion of NATO  toward the east might weaken the alliance?    [Woerner] If this were done precipitately, and if one were  to take in too many new members all at once, this would indeed  be a consequence. However, no one wants this. This will be a  gradual process so that the Alliance's ability to make decisions  is not endangered.    [Van Kampen] Well, there are voices that the enemy image  from the East has vanished -- let us be honest and, perhaps,  dissolve NATO entirely.    [Woerner] I can only say that NATO is now more popular than  ever. We have a number of states that want to join NATO,  because NATO is the one decisive factor of stability that  currently exists in the world. In a time of increasing  instability one does not dissolve the only stable element. On  the contrary, NATO is gaining additional weight.    [Van Kampen] What will NATO look like in the year 2000?  Which role will it play?    [Woerner] I think that it will then, hopefully, be the  anchor of stability of a comprehensive Euro-Atlantic security  system. I think that it will deal even more intensively than  hitherto with crisis settlement. Of course, it will continue to  fulfill one task: ensuring the safety of its member states and  this means safeguarding peace.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Ilva sees reduction in deficit ILVA, the Italian state-owned steelmaker, expects to cut losses to about L2,000bn (Dollars 1.3bn) this year from L2,309bn in 1992. Consolidated debts at the company, due to be split and partly privatised, amounted to about L7,500bn at the end of June, against L7,583bn at the end of 1992, according to Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's treasury minister. Addressing a parliamentary committee, Mr Paolo Savona, the industry minister, said plans for the partial privatisation of Ilva, which is Europe's fourth-biggest steelmaker, could be ready by mid-September. The group, controlled by the IRI state holding company, has until recently been locked in a row with the European Commission, which had blocked a previous restructuring plan. Last month, the Italian government and the commission reached a compromise. The commission extended its deadline for a new re-organisation plan in return for Italian commitments on swift privatisation and not writing off outstanding debts. Meanwhile, discussions have taken place with a number of leading private sector steelmakers on investing in the big Taranato and Novi Ligure works, which form the heart of the flat products company.</p>

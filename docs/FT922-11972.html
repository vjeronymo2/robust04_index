			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: CBOT wins approval for pollution futures THE Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has received approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its novel pollution futures, or 'Clean Air Futures' as the CBOT calls them. These are contracts based on the sulphur dioxide emission allowances that will be issued by the US Environmental Protection Agency under the 1990 Clean Air Act. These permits to pollute will be tradeable among the companies, primarily electric utilities, that will receive them. Those companies that have installed cleaner technologies will be in a position to sell their permits to those who still cannot meet the more restrictive air standards. Mr William O'Connor, the exchange's chairman, called the new contracts 'the most exciting development in our industry since the introduction of interest rate futures 15 years ago.' The CBOT is still waiting for a decision by the EPA on its application to administer the annual auction of the emission allowances. The first auction is scheduled for March 1993 and the futures are expected to start trading before then.</p>

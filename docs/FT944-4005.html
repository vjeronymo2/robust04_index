			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Unison says cuts will secure its future Unison, Britain's biggest trade union, said yesterday that its financial future was secure after a voluntary redundancy programme which cut staff numbers by nearly a quarter. It also said it had signed up 92 per cent of its 1.3m members to pay their subscriptions by check-off. Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary, denied reports that the union faced a financial crisis, although he said it would have a small deficit this year and might have to borrow up to Pounds 5m to help cover the Pounds 13m costs of the redundancy programme - the biggest by a UK trade union. Unison was formed 18 months ago from the merger of three public service unions - Nupe, Nalgo and Cohse. By the end of this year it will have shed 340 full-time jobs and 40 contract workers, bringing its staff down to just less than 1,200. Those accepting redundancy received payments of up to Pounds 70,000, with an average of Pounds 31,000. The redundancy exercise will reduce annual staffing costs by Pounds 11m. Mr Jinkinson said the terms had been best received by staff with easily marketable skills, such as secretaries and word processor operators. The enlarged union was still 'a bit top-heavy' with full-time officials. Mr Jinkinson said the 92 per cent check-off sign-up level had been achieved by mid-November and was still increasing. He conceded, however, that the figure of about 100,000 members still to be signed up represented 'a significant loss of potential income.'</p>

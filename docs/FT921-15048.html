			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Appointments: Property developments Drusilla Vesty is taking charge of British Gas's developments after several years planning one of the largest derelict sites in Europe. As director of property development, Vesty is unlikely to see quick results from her new job, though she is likely to make faster progress than in her previous task of directing policy at the London Docklands Development Corporation, which has been particularly badly hit by recession. Vestey, who was responsible for the development strategy and installation of the Pounds 240m advance infrastructure in the Royal Docks since 1985, oversaw a project which is unlikely to come to fruition for many years. British Gas's largest potential project is a predominantly residential development covering 296 acres in east Greenwich. ***** Nuclear Electric, the state-owned company which operates the nuclear stations of England and Wales, has also recruited a development specialist to deal with its surplus buildings and sites. David Hall, a chartered surveyor, is to take up the newly-created post of head of property development. He is a director of Chesterfield Properties and until recently was managing director of MEPC Development. The largest building that Hall will deal with is Sudbury House, by St Paul's Cathedral, which will be sold once planning permission has been gained for redevelopment. He will also have to deal with a clutch of other buildings no longer needed by the nuclear industry.</p>

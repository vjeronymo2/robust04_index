			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Observer: Came the dawn A couple of hundred alternatives later, the proud name GMTV was yesterday revealed to the world. No, it's not the internal communication station for General Motors or even a rival to Granada in Greater Manchester. Having won the commercial breakfast franchise from TV-am, Sunrise Television has decided to change its name 'to avoid confusion with BSkyB's breakfast programme'. To avoid a writ, more like. Sky News calls its breakfast segment Sunrise and isn't likely to beam on any namesake. The arduous task to find a name viewers won't choke on naturally involved an opinion poll and the chewing over of focus groups; three dozen were seriously considered and a short list of six exhaustively researched. After that little hiccup, what about the programme? 'Good Morning' to you all.</p>

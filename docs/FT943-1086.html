			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / UK Company News: News Corp rejects panel as way to settle dispute News Corporation, the publishing group owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch, has rejected an attempt by investors to use the City Disputes Panel to resolve a long-running dispute over its exchangeable preference shares and convertible bonds. Instead, it is taking legal action against merchant bank J Henry Schroder Wagg, one of the investors who incurred losses in the confusion surrounding the preference share and convertible bond issues the media group launched in 1989, which were convertible into shares owned by News Corp in Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times. When Pearson demerged its Royal Doulton china subsidiary last year, investors thought that anyone converting the News Corp bonds and shares would receive Doulton shares, in addition to Pearson shares. A notice published in the FT in December on behalf of a News Corp subsidiary advised holders that they were entitled to the Doulton shares as part of the exchange. However, in January, News Corp published another notice saying it was seeking legal advice and in February said that investors would not receive the Doulton shares. Without the Royal Doulton shares, the value of the conversion package was worth less than the redemption value of the bonds. In the confusion surrounding the terms of the exchange, several investors, including Schroder, incurred significant losses. Representing aggrieved investors, including Schroder, City lawyers Slaughter &amp; May wrote to News Corp recommending the matter be brought before the disputes panel. News Corp, however, rejected arbitration 'because it didn't think it was the most appropriate procedure,' Mr Robert Hunter, a litigation partner at Allen &amp; Overy, News Corp's lawyers, said yesterday. Instead, the group has started legal action against Schroder, asking the High Court to rule that the bank has no grounds for compensation. Schroder disagrees. 'We felt this was an appropriate dispute for the panel to hear, and believe it is the right body to consider the dispute,' Mr David Caruth, Schroder's legal adviser said yesterday. 'We don't think the courts are the appropriate forum for this dispute,' he added. News Corp was unavailable for comment, but is expected to make a statement today.</p>

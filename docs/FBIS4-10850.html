			<p>BFN     [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, 16 Apr (AFP-NA) -- It was  announced in Marrakech that Morocco and Argentina today decided  to apply "various mechanisms in order to develop their economic,  trade, scientific, technical, and cultural relations."    The strengthening of bilateral relations and several  international topics were evaluated by Moroccan Foreign Minister  Abdellatif Filali and his Argentine colleague, Guido Di Tella,  who -- after representing his country at the recent Uruguay  Round Conference in Marrakech -- remained in the country on an  official visit.    According to a joint communique, the two parties determined  "the agreement of their viewpoints on the main topics that were  discussed and the similarity of the evaluations that have been  made by the two governments regarding the rapid evolution of  international relations."    After lamenting that their economic exchange has not yet  come  up to the level of their good political relations, the two  countries expressed their desire to "consolidate their  cooperation in every sphere."    At the end of a meeting in which several other Moroccan  ministers participated, Di Tella announced that President Carlos  Menem will make an official visit to Morocco "before the end of  the year." The exact date has not yet been made known.    The economic exchange between Argentina and Morocco, which  was very scarce in the 1980's, has been increasing constantly  for the past three years.</p>

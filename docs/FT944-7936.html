			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Aids drug lifts BioChem shares Shares of BioChem Pharma, the Montreal-based pharmaceuticals group, rose strongly yesterday following reports that a drug discovered by the company has contributed to promising results in combating Aids, writes Bernard Simon. BioChem is 17 per cent owned by Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals group which has the licence to develop and market the drug, known as 3TC. Clinical trial results, which were released at a conference in Glasgow, Scotland, last weekend, indicated that 3TC, in combination with rival UK pharmaceuticals group Wellcome's AZT drug, sharply reduces the level of the HIV virus, which causes Aids. BioChem's shares closed at CDollars 17 1/4 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday, up 9 per cent. The company said yesterday it had renewed its development and marketing agreement with Glaxo. Under the agreement, BioChem will receive royalties based on sales.</p>

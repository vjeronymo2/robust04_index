			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Beijing has put pressure on a group of liberal  intellectuals to stop publishing an avant-garde journal. The  authorities have also tried to boost the sales and influence of  the People's Daily [RENMIN RIBAO] by launching several regional  editions.    Chinese sources said yesterday the editors of the magazine  JINGPIN (ELITE) could not find an official book registration  number to publish its third edition. The two previous editions  had been published earlier this year under a temporary  registration number, which had expired.    The editors and contributors of JINGPIN are influential  intellectuals and ex-officials associated with the former party  chiefs Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. They include former PEOPLE'S  DAILY editor Qin Chuan, former culture minister Wang Meng, and  liberal economist Yu Guangyuan. While this group did not openly  support the 1989 democracy movement, it is understood that the  authorities fear the liberal intellectuals might give "spiritual  support" to the underground dissident movement.    "All the articles for the third edition are ready," a source  close to the magazine said. "Our failure to get a registration  number is a sign the authorities are getting tough with dissent."    Meanwhile, the Propaganda Department of the party is anxious  to reverse the decline in the sales of a large number of  official mouthpieces, including the PEOPLE'S DAILY, whose  circulation last year reportedly dropped by almost 20 percent.  Media analysts in Beijing said the party had given the green  light for the paper to launch several regional editions, the  first of which will appear in the East China area.    Cadres on the People's Daily said they hoped the new  editions, which will have more local content, would help to stem  the decline in circulation. It will be the first launch of  regional editions by a national paper.    Sources in the paper said the editorial policy remained  "rigid and doctrinaire" despite the appointment in the past year  of two moderates, Fan Jingyi and Zhou Ruijin, as chief editor  and vice- chief editor. Mr Zhou, considered a protege of  President Jiang Zemin, sat at the same table as Mr Jiang when  the latter hosted a Lunar New Year banquet for the leaders of  the Beijing media.    While the authorities are clamping down on liberal journals,  they have not stopped efforts by the Maoist ideologues to  discredit the reform policy. Chinese sources said commissars  led by Deng Liqun, a former head of propaganda, had started  writing a series of articles on how patriarch Deng Xiaoping's  open-door policy could encourage the growth of capitalism and a  "new class of exploiters". These articles are to be published  after the death of Mr Deng.    The sources said Mr Deng and his family were aware of the  "anti-reform articles," but they had decided not to take action.  Moreover, the remnant Maoists still have a stranglehold over  many departments within the Central Committee. The sources  added that to ensure his predominant position in the post-Deng  era, Mr Jiang had formed alliances with the ideologues.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting helps Valmet turnround Valmet, the Finnish paper machinery and engineering group, said yesterday productivity and cost-cutting gains had helped it return to profit in 1993. Profits after financial items were FM100m (Dollars 18.07m) compared with a loss of FM298m in 1992. Unspecified extraordinary charges of FM154m, mainly write-offs associated with rationalisation moves, resulted in a pre-tax loss of FM54m, but this was a sharp improvement over the pre-tax loss of FM219m in the previous year. Valmet said it would show a net profit of FM85m when its annual report was published later this month, compared with a net loss in 1992 of FM120m, although details were not given. Group sales were up 11 per cent to FM10.7bn compared with FM9.6bn in 1992, thanks in part to the fall in value of the Finnish markka last year. More than 80 per cent of Valmet's sales were outside Finland, mainly in western Europe and North America. Operating profit improved sharply to FM479m from FM171m. Valmet said its internal rationalisation programmes, coupled with the prospect of more stable markets in the forestry industry, should produce a further improvement in 1994.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michel Castex] </F>   [Text] Beirut, March 1 (AFP)--The killing of nine  worshippers in a church bombing has heightened fears among  Christians for their future in Lebanon, where they feel  politically marginalised, analysts and politicians said on  Tuesday.    Just hours after the victims were buried several Christian  political leaders turned on the government, demanding that it  fulfil its responsibilities by identifying and punishing the  bombers.    Many agreed the government was wrong to focus its attention  on ambitious projects to rebuild Lebanon's war-shattered  infrastructure when it should first strengthen security and  address social issues.    The head of the Maronite Church, Monsignor Nasrallah Sfayr,  set the tone at a funeral service Monday in Our Lady of  Deliverance Church, where 55 worshippers were also wounded  during Lent Mass on Sunday.    "All the Lebanese have the right to a life of freedom  without  fear, frustration and inequality," Sfayr said, urging the  government to rectify its mistakes.    "Saying that such things happen in other countries is not  enough for us. Elsewhere the culprits are found and punished,  but here they are not identified because of negligence or  incompetence," he added.    Karim Paqraduni, Secretary General of the right-wing  Christian Phalange Party, echoed Sfayr, speaking to AFP on  Tuesday.    "There is no political will to arrest those responsible for  this revolting crime," he said.    Paqraduni escaped a December bomb attack on his party's  headquarters during a weekly leadership meeting because he was  abroad at the time. Three people were killed and 100 wounded,  and the bomber is still at large.    The church bomb "played into the hands of extremists on all  sides," Paqraduni said.    "The bomb clearly underlined a political desire to  destabilise the situation in Lebanon, terrorise Christians and  push them to react, in a bid to create a civil war situation in  Lebanon," Paqraduni said.    "The government's political inefficiency allowed this to  happen," he added.    For 'Isa Ghurayb, chief editor of the French-language  L'ORIENT-LE JOUR, the "horror" which plagued Lebanon during its  1975-1990 civil war had returned to haunt the Lebanese.    Ghurayb, whose newspaper is owned by Culture Minister Michel  Iddih, said the church bombing was the latest in a series of  unpunished attacks against Christian targets in Lebanon.    "These repeated acts of aggression worry the Christians,  mainly the Maronites, because they coincide with an  unprecedented political imbalance in Lebanon ... (where) a  growing number of Christian feel they have become alienated.    "Nothing is being done to remedy this disastrous feeling.  There are just hollow calls to close ranks around the  government," he said.    Samir Ja'ja', head of the former Christian Lebanese Forces  militia, accused the government of failing the Lebanese people,  who "have realised that the security the authorities promised to  restore is still a mirage."    The sense of frustration arose after the 1989 al-Ta'if  inter-parliamentary accord, which effectively ended the war in  Lebanon, with the Christians agreeing to give Muslims a greater  share in running the country.    It was exacerbated as the government failed to keep a pledge  to introduce sweeping social and economic reforms, which led  most Christians to boycott the 1992 legislative elections,  protesting that they were imposed by Syria.    No demographic survey has been carried out in Lebanon since  1932, but the Christians maintain they represent 50 percent of  the three-million-strong population, even though hundreds of  thousands fled the country during the war.    The Muslims say they outnumber the Christians by two to one,  but the Maronites are the largest single Christian community.</p>

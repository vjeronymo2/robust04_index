			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOMELESS DRIVE FELL SHORT, YET SUCCEEDED;  </P> <P> * COMBINED EFFORT LAID GROUNDWORK FOR COLLABORATIONS SURE TO BE NEEDED IN  FUTURE  </P> <P> Since the summer's emergency food and shelter campaign fell far short of its  goals, it would be tempting to say the effort was a failure. But there were  many successes, the first of which was the collaboration of many agencies to  aid the poor and hungry at a time of crisis.  </P> <P> Some background is needed: While there is always a great need for food and  shelter, the summer of 1990 was especially harsh for two reasons. First, all  agencies serving the poor have seen a huge increase in demand since the  beginning of the year. And, second, one of Orange County's biggest charities,  Share Our Selves of Costa Mesa, had closed down its food, clothing and  emergency financial operations while its new home was being refurbished. SOS  had hoped to be open as early as August, but city permit and other delays have  pushed that date to at least October.  </P> <P> Alarmed by the situation, the United Way and the Orange County Homeless Issues  Task Force in June started the unusual summer effort aimed at gathering $1  million, 500,000 pounds of food and 1,000 new volunteers. The results:  $213,500, 7,425 pounds of food and 291 volunteers. But the effort had an  immediate impact: As soon as goods and money were received, they were dispersed  to agencies to give to those in need.  </P> <P> Among the major contributors were United Way, 502 Fair Share, Parker Hannifin  and many private donors. Food drives were held by the American Red Cross, the  Girl Scouts, Crystal Cathedral Preschool, the Church of Religious Science,  Orange's municipal Social Services Agency and several private businesses.  McDonnell Douglas donated $10,500 to the Food Distribution Center. Some food  drives are continuing.  </P> <P> All of the agencies were responding to the crisis that, it was hoped, was only  temporary. But, things being what they are today, their efforts may be needed  again.  </P> <P> Indeed, a giveaway of school supplies and clothes conducted Sept. 29 by the  Orange County Rescue Mission was an indication of how much poverty there really  is in Orange County. Hundreds of impoverished children and parents stood in  line for hours to obtain new and used clothes, boxes of pencils, stacks of  notebooks and bags of books and crayons. The turnout far exceeded expectations  and supply.  </P> <P> As for the summer's collaboration of agencies, the combined effort laid the  groundwork for future collaborations. Perhaps that will help avoid similar  emergencies in the future.  </P></p>

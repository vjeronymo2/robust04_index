			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> Sculptors are invited to submit slides of their work for possible placement in  the city of Brea's consignment art program, which installs pieces for one-year  periods on publicly owned property. One location awaiting art is a newly  landscaped area at the intersection of Lambert Road and the Orange Freeway.  </P> <P> Work will be selected by the city's Cultural Arts Commission, which makes  recommendations to the City Council. The city will pay for transportation and  installation costs, as well as insurance. The rationale for the project is that  developers required to purchase works of art in accordance with the city's Art  in Public Places program would be exposed on a regular basis to a range of  potential selections. For more information, call Scott Riordan, program  coordinator in the Brea Community Services Department: (714) 990-7723.  </P></p>

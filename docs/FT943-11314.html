			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Accountant asks Pounds 200 to sign letter Ten years ago, my accountant arranged two policies for me, one an endowment, the other whole of life. Now the endowment has matured, he proposes to charge me 0.5 per cent on the proceeds for signing the maturity form. His normal charge would be 1.1 per cent but, in view of the amount involved, he expressed himself willing to take the lower charge. This would give him Pounds 200 simply for signing the maturity form and a letter written by me to the insurers. But I knew nothing of this charge until 10 years after taking out the policies. Is this normal practice? I have a further endowment policy written in trust which matures in four years. This involves one (different) trustee to whom I wrote some time ago but have received no reply. If he cannot be traced, how do I replace him? Whether your accountant is entitled to charge a percentage on the policies' proceeds depends on the agreement between you and him when the policies were taken out. If you are unhappy, the professional conduct department at the Institute of Chartered Accountants might be able to assist you. The address is: Gloucester House, 399 Silbury Boulevard, Milton Keynes, Bucks MK9 2HL. You can replace trustees on the present policies by writing to the companies concerned in order to verify who has the power to appoint trustees. It might be possible that, as settlor, you have this power; if so, the companies concerned could supply you with forms in order to make the necessary change.

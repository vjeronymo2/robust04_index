			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG-DISTANCE PHONE RATES TO DIP AGAIN;  </P> <P> BUT CONSUMERS WILL PAY 30 CENTS MORE PER MONTH ON LOCAL BILLS  </P> <P> Long-distance rates for calls between states will drop again April 1, but  telephone customers will pay correspondingly more -- 30 cents a month -- on  their local phone bills.  </P> <P> The lower interstate tolls and offsetting increase in local bills stem from a  Federal Communications Commission program that, over several years now, has  been shifting to customers a large part of the costs that long-distance  carriers pay local phone companies for completing calls.  </P> <P> According to an FCC finding released in Washington, American Telephone &amp;  Telegraph will save even more than the company had estimated -- $705 million,  compared to $533 million.  </P> <P> The FCC study also found that the local phone companies underestimated by even  more last December when they proposed reducing their long-distance connection  charges by $489 million to offset the 30 cents they will gain from local  customers in the form of an increase to the "subscriber line charge."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Must Pass Along Savings  </P> <P> The subscriber line charge has been rising periodically in increments until, on  April 1, it will peak at $3.50 month. Theoretically, that sum represents each  phone user's contribution to the fixed costs of maintaining a nationwide  telephone network, regardless of how much a customer may call long distance.  </P> <P> With residential and business users paying more, AT&amp;T has to pay less under  the FCC's shared-cost system. And AT&amp;T also must pass along its savings in  connection charges to its customers in lower prices.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T will have to recalculate its interstate tolls now in light of the FCC  finding, Los Angeles spokeswoman Daylanne Johnson said, but added: "This is  more good news for our customers, since their rates will be even lower than we  had anticipated."  </P> <P> Most likely, the new reduction will follow the pattern that AT&amp;T proposed  on Feb. 15, based on a $533-million reduction. That called for a rate cut  averaging 1.6% overall. The April 1 reduction will drop prices nearly 40% lower  than before the Bell breakup five years ago.  </P> <P> But the price changes -- under the February proposal, at least -- would vary  according to a customer's calling habits. For example, rates on about a third  of AT&amp;T's interstate traffic -- those calls running less than 292 miles --  would have increased 4.7%, which AT&amp;T described as "less than a penny a  minute." On the other hand, rates during normal business hours (8 a.m. to 5  p.m., Monday through Friday) would have dropped 3.8%.  </P> <P> The business-day reduction normally benefits commercial accounts more than  residential customers, who do most of their long-distance calling late at night  and on weekends, when rates are discounted 35%. The proposal would have trimmed  that discount to 33%.  </P> <P> A $705-million rate cut would likely exaggerate each of those changes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rivals Usually Follow Suit  </P> <P> While AT&amp;T's competitors, principally MCI and US Sprint, are not regulated  by the FCC -- and thus are not obligated to reduce their rates to reflect their  lower costs -- in the past they have mimicked AT&amp;T's reductions to maintain  a pricing advantage in the nation's $50-billion long-distance  telecommunications market.  </P> <P> The shared cost of the interlocking local and long-distance networks became  necessary after the breakup of the Bell System owned by AT&amp;T, which  operated a seamless network through its 22 subsidiary companies.  </P> <P> In January, 1984, when AT&amp;T was divested of all local operations to settle  a longstanding government antitrust lawsuit, those local subsidiaries were  regrouped under seven regional holding companies, including San Francisco-based  Pacific Telesis, parent of Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell.  </P> <P> Nancy Lubamersky, Pacific Bell's director of access services, said the company  is "very happy with the (FCC) order" because the reduced connection costs will  make its services more attractive.  </P></p>

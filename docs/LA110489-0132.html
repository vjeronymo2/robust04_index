			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY PACIFIC TO INCREASE ARIZONA LOAN-LOSS RESERVES  </P> <P> Security Pacific Corp., stung by Arizona's continuing real estate woes, said  Friday that it will substantially increase loan-loss reserves for its bank  there and put the unit's problem loans into a separate holding company.  </P> <P> The loan-loss reserves -- money set aside to cover future losses -- will be  boosted by an unspecified amount in the fourth quarter, but earnings in the  period are still expected to be higher than a year earlier, Security Pacific  said. That is because the move will be offset by gains from sales of assets,  including an office in Singapore, said John F. Kooken, Security Pacific's chief  financial officer.  </P> <P> Separately, the Los Angeles-based banking company said its Security Pacific  Bancorp Northwest subsidiary has reached agreement to buy Mountain West Savings  Bank in Idaho for $31.5 million. The bank would be Security Pacific's first in  that state, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> Security Pacific, parent of Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles, is  one of a number of banks hurt by Arizona's soft real estate market. Last month,  for example, First Interstate Bancorp, the Los Angeles-based parent of First  Interstate Bank, reported a loss of $15.5 million stemming from problem loans  at its Arizona bank.  </P> <P> Kooken said in an interview that Security Pacific's Arizona bank has lost $50  million after taxes through the first nine months of the year.  </P> <P> Kooken said Security Pacific has $465 million in non-performing loans in  Arizona, about 40% of its portfolio there. Putting those assets into a separate  company will allow Security Pacific to deal more easily with its problems in  the state, he said.  </P></p>

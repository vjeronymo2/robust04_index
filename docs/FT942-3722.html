			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Exports limp behind while the rest of Peru strides out: After almost four years of sweeping economic reform, one vital sector stubbornly stands out in its failure to respond The export sector continues to be the Cinderella of Peru's buoyant economy. In the almost four years since the administration of President Alberto Fujimori embarked on its sweeping programme of deregulation and structural adjustment, exports have stubbornly failed to respond. Exports were, in fact, stagnant throughout the 1980s, never coming close to matching the record Dollars 3.9bn in 1980. What has changed is their make-up: 'non-traditional' exports (mainly finished and agro-industrial products) have gradually gained in importance while traditional exports (minerals, oil, sugar, cotton and fishmeal) have fallen to 67 per cent of last year's estimated total value of Dollars 3.4bn. The sluggish performance reflects in part Peru's vulnerability to international raw materials prices. And while the economy enjoyed the protection of high tariffs - until early 1991 - the balance of trade remained favourable. But three years of fast-growing, mainly consumer-driven imports have sunk Peru's trade account into deficit and the gap this year will be wider than ever. Even Mr German Suarez, president of Peru's central bank, has admitted the deficit will almost certainly be well above the Dollars 569m enshrined in the 1994 'letter of intent' currently pending approval by the International Monetary Fund. This year's economic programme, to an even greater extent than hitherto, stresses control of inflation - it should not exceed 20 per cent this year, down from 39.5 per cent in 1993. The exchange rate, meanwhile, will continue to float but money supply targets will remain tight. The central bank will not sacrifice these targets in order to intervene on the foreign exchange markets. All of which is bad news for Peru's already hard-pressed exporters. In the past 12 months, the Peruvian sol has appreciated by almost 14 per cent against the dollar - half of that in the first five months of this year. Mr Francisco Raffo's modern Textil San Cristobal factory in Chincha is just the sort of operation that Peru should be encouraging. Built at a cost of Dollars 10m four years ago, it produces top-quality cotton knits for some of the world's most demanding customers, including Adidas, Nike and Reebok. Sales last year - about 90 per cent exported - topped Dollars 24m. San Cristobal trades on Peru's natural advantages - world class raw materials in its Pima and Tanguis cotton and an inexpensive but skilled labour force. Machinery is the most modern available and efficiency is high. 'But even having cut costs to the bone, we barely turn a profit,' says Mr Raffo. Although exporters publicly demand government intervention to 'improve' the exchange rate, most of them privately admit this is unlikely under the free market economic policies to which the Fujimori government is committed. Action, however, could be taken on a number of other fronts to reduce excess charges and 'anti-technical' taxes, they say. First, they want a full tax 'drawback' scheme on the grounds that 'taxes should not be exported'. Currently, exporters can reclaim locally-applied value added tax, though the system is unwieldy and refunds slow to come through. Exporters, however, enjoy no 'drawback' on the high internal tax levied on fuel products. The economy and finance ministry claims the scheme is too complex to administer. Mr Raffo reckons his energy costs, at Dollars 100,000 a month, are three times those of Latin American competitors. Peruvian businesses are also hammered by a series of supposedly 'emergency' tax measures, in force until fiscal reforms and a broadening of the taxpayer base is achieved. One is a minimum 2 per cent tax on assets, paid monthly and offset as an income tax credit if the business turns in a profit. Lossmakers forfeit the tax entirely. Businesses must now also bear the entire brunt of the housing fund contribution Fonavi, in effect a 9 per cent payroll tax. And, despite the decline in terrorist attacks, security costs remain a heavy burden on Peruvian businesses. The government argues that exporters have benefited substantially from a series of structural reforms, including the slashing of import duties, port handling and transport costs. While admitting that customs efficiency has improved, exporters complain that procedures remain cumbersomely bureaucratic. 'We're now competing in a global marketplace with countries like Taiwan and Korea, and we simply can't afford these delays,' says Mr Raffo. The yawning trade deficit this year may, however, force more decisive moves to deepen the partly completed foreign trade reforms. 'If the gap between imports and exports approaches Dollars 1bn this year, which is perfectly likely, then the government will have to take steps to improve conditions for exporters,' predicts Mr Raffo.</p>

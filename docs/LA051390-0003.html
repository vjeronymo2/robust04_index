			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA'S LOST GENERATION  </P> <P> Nine months after the Tian An Men Square massacre, while some people have  almost forgotten what happened there last June, we Chinese students in the  States are still struggling with the painful reminiscences of the blood bath  and with the dilemma of longing to contribute to our motherland but at the same  time facing possible political persecution if we go back. We are so grateful to  you for letting our experience be known to the public.  </P> <P> After reading "China's Lost Generation" (March 25), many of our American  friends told us that they were moved by our stories vividly portrayed by Jim  Mann. Many of them asked whether they could do anything for us.  </P> <P> At the turning point of this century, democracy is triumphing in almost every  corner of this planet. Why should China be left out of this worldwide  megatrend? We believe a democratic and economically strong China is of great  importance to a peaceful world, especially to a peaceful Asia. We also believe  that the seeds of the democratic ideal have already been brought to China. A  noble course needs to be urgently pursued to spread these seeds on the vast  land of China and to let them sturdily grow there. It is for these beliefs that  we Chinese students in the United States are still forcefully fighting.  </P> <P> HAIKONG SHEN, CHUN SHEN, YINTE WANG -- UCLA  </P></p>

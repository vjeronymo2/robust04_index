			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging Markets Politics continued to dominate the Brazilian market last week as the latest opinion polls suggested that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso could win in the first round of the general election on October 3. At the same time, steady inflows of foreign cash continued to bolster the local currency, which has appreciated against the US dollar by 11 per cent since the reais was introduced on July 1. Mr Anthony Parker at Baring Securities commented that experience showed that successful investors traditionally sold when the market looked expensive and bought when it looked cheap, but the country could now be at a watershed and have a reforming president for the next four years, or even longer. 'This could mean that investors will continue to buy,' he said. 'We think the market could comfortably go up by another 15 per cent before investors become worried about the multiple. Much higher than that, and you would be in a rarified atmosphere.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Dollar terms                   No. of      Aug 26       % Change         % Change Market            stocks        1994       over week       on Dec '93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America      (209)      748.61         -0.0             +15.1 Argentina           (25)      949.94         +3.0              -4.5 Brazil              (57)      405.04         +2.3             +74.0 Chile               (25)      720.17         +3.9             +30.5 Colombia1           (11)      828.61         -7.5             +28.5 Mexico              (68)      989.82         +2.1              -1.6 Peru2               (11)      146.92         +4.0             +21.5 Venezuela3          (12)      536.97         -2.5              -9.3 Asia               (557)      272.47         -1.6              -6.4 China4              (18)      102.22         -0.2             -31.5 South Korea5       (156)      131.95         +1.0             +11.7 Philippines         (18)      317.66         +0.2              -6.7 Taiwan, China6      (90)      155.85         +2.5             +15.3 India7              (76)      139.11         -1.1             +19.4 Indonesia8          (37)      109.23         +3.0             -12.4 Malaysia           (105)      303.48         -2.7             -10.5 Pakistan9           (15)      397.27         -0.6              +2.4 Sri Lanka10          (5)      184.77         -0.1              +4.2 Thailand            (55)      416.20         -2.8             -12.9 Euro/Mid East      (125)      124.34         -3.4             -26.6 Greece              (25)      219.25         -4.3              -3.7 Hungary11            (5)      197.18         +0.6             +18.3 Jordan              (13)      161.60         -0.9              -2.4 Poland12            (12)      726.74         -6.1             -11.1 Portugal            (25)      124.51         -0.7              +9.4 Turkey13            (40)      126.74         -4.2             -40.4 Zimbabwe14           (5)      260.47         +4.3             +28.9 Composite          (891)      361.87         -0.0              +1.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Local currency terms                       Aug 26           % Change          % Change Market                  1994           over week         on Dec '93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina             582,909.57         +3.0              -4.5 Brazil                1,345,857,576      +1.6              +1,224.4 Chile                 1,207.02           +3.9              +26.6 Colombia1             1,198.38           -7.4              +29.3 Mexico                1,444.10           +2.3              +7.0 Peru2                 199.45             +4.9              +25.4 Venezuela3            2,098.52           -2.5              +47.6 Asia China4                110.71             -0.4              -32.5 South Korea5          139.12             +0.8              +10.8 Philippines           399.76             +1.9              -10.0 Taiwan, China6        154.40             +2.1              +15.4 India7                153.84             -1.2              +19.4 Indonesia8            128.19             +3.0              -10.0 Malaysia              285.37             -2.7              -15.3 Pakistan9             550.80             +0.2               +4.3 Sri Lanka10           197.42             +0.0               +3.4 Thailand              412.97             -2.9              -14.5 Euro/Mid East Greece                355.11             -1.9               -7.6 Hungary11             256.27             +0.6              +26.9 Jordan                231.02             -1.1               -3.5 Poland12              1,048.87           -5.9               -5.0 Portugal              137.54             +1.0               -0.4 Turkey13              1,949.16           +0.3              +34.0 Zimbabwe14            310.58             +4.4              +45.4 Composite  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

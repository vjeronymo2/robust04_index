			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: BT BT's third-quarter results yesterday revealed that an increasing number of Britons nattered to each other on the phone for the second successive quarter. This is good news for the UK economy; it is also encouraging for BT's shareholders. But investors are not yet going to be swept away with excitement given the two bigger forces tugging away at BT. The first is the government's sale of another slab of up to 22 per cent of BT's shares which may now come in early summer. The government's brokers will try to tickle up BT's shares in advance. They have a plausible line to push. BT's prospective dividend yield has now converged with base rates. The company will generate considerable cash next year creating further scope for rapid dividend growth. BT's redundancy programme will ensure that operating costs remain static while revenues pick up strongly in recovery. But investors may resist such enticements until the uncertainty concerning BT's much-rumoured talks with the US-based Electronic Data Systems has been resolved. If BT were to buy a stake, it would make sense to do so soon. The tumbling pound is increasing the costs of overseas investments. Such a controversial move may queer the government's pitch. But why should government funding needs get in the way of strategic decisions by a privatised company?</p>

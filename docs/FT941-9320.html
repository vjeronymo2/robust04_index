			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips brush aside talks failure Wall Street Blue-chip stocks finished moderately higher yesterday although concern over US-Japanese trade relations restrained the broader market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 9.28 ahead at 3,904.06, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 0.05 at 470.23. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 2.32 down at 474.91, but the Nasdaq composite gained 4.06 to 785.45. Activity on the NYSE was brisk, with 263m shares traded. Advancing issues led declines, 1,103 to 1,026. Stocks faltered at the opening as investors sought to put into perspective a 2.7 per cent slide in Tokyo share prices overnight. However, investors quickly decided that the collapse of Friday's bilateral trade talks in Washington would have only a minor impact on US corporate earnings. Likewise, the day's only economic news - December business inventories  - was virtually ignored. The data showed no change, just as analysts had expected. Indeed, the market was looking ahead to a week which was nearly free of potential obstacles, with the exception of January's consumer price index, due out on Thursday. In such a vacuum, cyclical issues were free to resume their march forward. But later a stumbling block emerged in the US Treasury market. At first, the heightened trade tensions failed to unhinge bonds. But as the dollar plunged against the yen during the afternoon, prices on the longer dated government securities began to show moderate losses. In late trading the benchmark 30-year issue was  15/32 down at 97 15/32 . The weakness in bonds dampened enthusiasm in stocks, but blue chips managed to post some gains. Among individual stocks, 3m advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 105 3/4 and Philip Morris added Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 58 3/4 . United Technologies climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 67 3/8 after Morgan Stanley upgraded the issue. But Merck dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 33 7/8 and Allied Signal shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 78. Car makers were back in favour after three losing sessions: General Motors gained Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 61 5/8 , Chrysler Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 59 1/2 and Ford Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 65 3/4 . With Paramount shareholders set to choose between rival takeover offers, principals in the long-running takeover saga were active. QVC jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 48 1/2 amid expectations that its bid would fail, while Viacom B shares fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 29 7/8 on the likelihood that its offer would prevail. The target company's stock eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 76 1/8 . In healthcare, investors continued to respond favourably to last week's merger of Columbia Healthcare and Hospital Corporation of America. Columbia HCA added Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 39 3/4 . Canada Toronto stock prices closed modestly lower. According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 index fell 10.40 points, or 0.24 per cent, to close at 4,395.20. Volume was 64.847m shares, down from Friday's 67.084m shares, but trading value rose to CDollars 930.3m from CDollars 761.8m. Nine of 14 sub-indexes closed lower, led by the conglomerates group, down 2.9 per cent as Canadian Pacific tumbled 1 to 22 3/4 on volume of about 2.1m shares. Maclean Hunter fell  3/8 to 17 on the day's heaviest volume of about 4.2m shares.</p>

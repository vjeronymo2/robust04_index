			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Spivs in the sights of Russian spy-catchers RUSSIA'S new security ministry, heir to the sinister KGB, is turning its attention from spies to spivs in an attempt to stem a flood of illegal exports of precious natural resources. At a press conference at the infamous Lubyanka building, one-time prison and KGB headquarters, security officers said they had unearthed systematic theft from key state enterprises in central Russia and the Urals on an 'astounding' scale. 'Our data prove there is a well-structured network of criminal groups specialising specifically in taking strategic resources out of the Russian Federation,' said Mr Andrei Chernenko, the ministry spokesman. A recent operation, codenamed 'Trawl', had prevented the smuggling of 9m tonnes of metals, 604,000 tonnes of petrol and oil products, 2,000 cubic metres of lumber, and chemicals worth Dollars 20m (Pounds 10m). Officers described how some gangs operated convoys of trucks protected by armed guards to ship smuggled goods. One bogus trading company had even dug up 52km of railway lines to smuggle out of the country. The ministry said there was evidence that many of the smuggled goods were being channelled through the Baltic states with the collusion of government officials. Russia has so far failed to create proper borders with other former Soviet republics. The rouble tumbled on Russia's fledgling currency exchange yesterday to Rbs205 to the dollar from Rbs168, close to its lowest level this year, Leyla Boulton writes. The government blamed inflation, but the slide was also prompted by expectations that the government and central bank will loosen monetary policy. It was also announced yesterday that Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the new first deputy prime minister, will be responsible for the country's industrial policy.</p>

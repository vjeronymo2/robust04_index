			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: BM inches ahead to Pounds 34.6m but lifts pay-out by 47% ANNUAL profits inched ahead at BM Group, the construction equipment and engineering concern which saw its share price fall by three quarters this summer after the departure of its chairman. BM made Pounds 34.6m (Pounds 34m) pre-tax in the year to June 30 on turnover of Pounds 519m (Pounds 396m). Although fully diluted earnings per share fell by 14 per cent to 23.4p (27.2p), the total dividend has been increased 47 per cent to 5p (3.4p) after a final of 2.9p (1.8p). The share price shed 15p to close at 91p. The company also announced yesterday, Mr Moger Woolley was taking over as chairman. He spent most of his career at DRG, the packaging group. The figures included a full-year, as opposed to an eight-month, contribution from Blackwood Hodge, construction equipment distributor. Thomas Robinson, the engineering group that proved to be Mr Roger Shute's last big deal before he resigned on health grounds, was included for four months, chipping in Pounds 2.6m profit and Pounds 52m sales. Distribution, including Blackwood Hodge, increased sales by Pounds 79m to Pounds 337m. But profit, after interest, slipped to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 17.7m). Mr Howard Sutton, chief executive, said margins had been eroded in the UK. The US was patchy, while demand from Australian mines remained resilient. In construction equipment manufacture, UK activities had struggled. Mustang in the US had a successful year and Austoft, maker of sugar cane harvesting equipment, had fallen back in Australia. The division made Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 4.2m) profit. Other manufacturing businesses made Pounds 7.69m (Pounds 5.01m) on Pounds 86.1m (Pounds 40.8m) sales. Group operating profit rose to Pounds 43m (Pounds 42.4m) before property gains of Pounds 919,000 (Pounds 325,000) and exceptional gains of Pounds 316,000 (Pounds 1.41m). Interest costs were Pounds 9.74m (Pounds 10.4m) and net debt Pounds 61.1m (Pounds 90.3m). Gearing was 36 per cent, helped by the Pounds 60m rights issue linked to the Robinson buy. COMMENT Mr Shute used to say BM was a tortoise, not a hare. Yet it tried to be the latter as a deal-oriented growth company. Since the departure of the hard-driving Shute, the largely unchanged management would gladly settle at last for a tortoise. Whatever the animal, some analysts are unhappy. BM's aim of 'above average earnings per share growth' looks incongruous now the company accepts it cannot buck recession in its markets. The sceptics also point to acquisition provisions which still amount to about Pounds 11m. Dividend cover would quickly fall below three times if earnings weakened. A pre-tax profit forecast of Pounds 30m, including an extra Pounds 4m from Robinson, gives a prospective p/e of five. This looks cheap, but the restoration of credibility could take years. Meanwhile the 7 per cent-plus yield gives some support and dividend growth prospects do look reasonable. See People</p>

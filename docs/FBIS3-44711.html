Mr Chen Guangyi was appointed  director with Mr Jiang Zhuping, Mr Yan Zhixiang, Mr Li Zhao, Mr  Shen Yuankang and Mr Bao Peide appointed deputy directors.    Mr Chen Guangyi said that his appointment as director by the  central authorities had been made only ten days before his  taking up his duties and he therefore needed time to study the  situation.

Close attention would be paid to air safety  and to the maintenance of healthy and rapid development of CAAC.</p>

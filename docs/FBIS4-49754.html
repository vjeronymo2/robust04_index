			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`Excerpts' of report by Yunnan Chief Procurator He Zhanjun </F> at Second Session of Eighth Yunnan People's Congress on 4 March:  "Yunnan Provincial People's Procuratorial Work Report"]    [Text] In 1993, the procuratorial organs in Yunnan  Province seriously implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC  National Congress and of the First Session of the Eighth  National People's Congress [NPC], and the decision made by the  first session of the Eighth Yunnan Provincial People's Congress  on the provincial procuratorial work report; upheld the guiding  thought of serving socialist economic construction, reform, and  opening up, as well as the principle of "grasping the reform and  opening up with one hand and the crackdown on criminal  activities with the other"; resolutely implemented the CPC  Central Committee's important decision on thoroughly launching  the struggle against corruption and the NPC's laws and  regulations on punishing economic crimes such as corruption and  bribery; earnestly discharged the procuratorial organ duty of  legal supervision; strictly enforced the law and handled cases  vigorously; resolutely punished economic crimes such as  corruption and bribery; severely cracked down on criminal  activities of various kinds; scored better results in  procuratorial undertakings on the basis of the previous year;  and made active contributions to safeguarding social stability,  border tranquility, and to protecting and promoting a smooth  process of the reform, opening up, and economic construction.    The main situation in our province's procuratorial work in  1993 was as follows:  <H5>  I. Resolutely Implementing the CPC Central Committee's </H5> Decision on the Struggle Against Corruption; Concentrating  Efforts and Using Legal Weapons To Crack Down on Economic Crimes  Such as Corruption and Bribery    In 1993, the procuratorial organs at various levels in our  province continued to view cracking down on economic crimes such  as corruption and bribery as a key task. Particularly after the  second plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline  Inspection, procuratorial organs immediately took action to  resolutely implement the CPC Central Committee's arrangements  and Comrade Jiang Zemin's instructions on "concentrating  strength to crack down on a number of big and serious cases" and  "striving for marked results in phases in the near future."  Under the unified leadership of the provincial party committee  and the party committees at various levels, procuratorial organs  acted vigorously and speedily, organized efforts carefully,  increased the weight of the struggle against corruption and  bribery, and concentrated their strength to severely crack down  on cases, especially big and serious cases. Last year, they  received reports on 2,804 cases of economic crimes and opened  files to investigate 1,384 of these. Of the cases for which  files were opened for investigation, 584 were corruption cases,  43.32 percent of the total; 127 were bribery cases, 9.42  percent; 306 cases involved embezzlement of public funds, 22.7  percent; 111 cases involved counterfeit trademarks, 8.23  percent; and 181 cases involved tax evasion, refusal to pay tax,  and tax fraud, 13.43 percent of the total. There were 749 big  and serious cases involving more than 10,000 yuan or cadres at  or above county and department levels, accounting for 55.6  percent of the cases for which files were opened. The  proportion of big and serious cases increased by 23.3 percentage  points over 1992. At present, the organs have: Finished  handling 1,285 cases involving 1,524 persons; brought 551 cases  to court involving 657 persons; and waived prosecutions in 496  cases involving 581 persons. They retrieved economic losses of  39.07 million yuan for the state and collectives, a 41.8 percent  increase over 1992.    1. Seriously learning from a series of instructions  given by the central leadership and the provincial party  committee and continuously deepening understanding of the  important and profound meaning of the struggle against  corruption. After the central leadership issued the  instruction on strengthening the struggle against corruption,  the provincial procuratorate held a telephone conference and a  meeting of heads of subprocuratorates, prefecture  procuratorates, and city procuratorates, to relay the  instruction and make arrangements. The procuratorate also  organized procuratorial police, especially leading cadres, in  carefully and seriously learning from the important speech by  Comrade Jiang Zemin and the spirit of the second plenary session  of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, as well as  the relevant instruction by the provincial party committee, to  thoroughly understand the important and profound meaning of the  struggle against corruption and the guiding thought in the  anticorruption drive. Efforts were made to sum up assessments  of the work in combating corruption and bribery during the past  several years and to sort out and tackle some ambiguous  understandings and the passivity, complaints, and fears about  the difficulties which once existed among a small number of  cadres and policemen. The broad masses of procuratorial  policemen in the whole province joined the struggle against  corruption with a strong will, staunch determination, great  enthusiasm, and a vigorous fighting spirit. The work in  combating corruption and bribery continuously developed in depth  and in the correct direction.    2. Upholding the mass line, strengthening the work in  receiving reports and complaints, and relying on and mobilizing  the masses in thoroughly launching the struggle against  corruption and bribery. The work of receiving reports and  complaints is a good style through which procuratorial organs  can follow the mass line and, on the other hand, it is a main  channel through which procuratorial organs open files to handle  cases. In August, the provincial procuratorate convened a  meeting on the work of receiving reports and complaints by  procuratorial organs throughout the province and adopted six  measures, including: Extensively publicizing the work of  receiving reports and complaints; once again publicizing the  phone numbers and addresses to which reports can be made;  increasing the days and times for procurators to meet the  masses; promptly informing the people the state and results of  investigations into their complaints; and strengthening the work  of investigating, supervising, and keeping confidential the  clues provided by reports. These measures aroused the enthusiasm  of the masses to make reports and a good trend emerged wherein  the reports made by the masses rapidly increased month by and  quarter after quarter.    According to statistics, in the whole  of 1993, 3,248 tip-offs regarding economic crimes such as  corruption and bribery were received from the masses making  reports. Of these tip-offs, 2,294 were received during the  period August to December, an increase of 240 percent over the  previous seven months during which 954 were received. The  quality of the tip-offs, and the rate of the tip-offs being  established as cases, also improved dramatically. Of the cases  of economic crimes such as corruption and bribery for which  files were opened for investigation by the procuratorial organs,  53 percent were based on tip-offs reported by the masses and  many of them were big and serious cases. In order to encourage,  support, and protect the enthusiasm of the masses for reporting  lawbreaking and criminal activities, the procuratorial organs  resolutely honored the policy of awarding the persons who had  merit in making the reports and resolutely handled and  investigated cases of reprisal against persons maing the reports  to ensure a healthy and smooth development of reporting work.    3. Concentrating strength in handling big and serious  cases and pinpointing key areas. Following the central  leadership's instruction that the struggle against corruption  should pinpoint leading party and government departments,  judicial departments, administrative and law enforcement  departments, and economic management departments, and that  strength must be concentrated to investigate into a number of  big and serious cases, all procuratorial organs made careful  arrangements, vigorously launching the work of investigating  cases and adopting the following measures: First, they sorted  out big and serious cases for investigation. In the second half  of last year, efforts were made on two occasions to sort out and  investigate tip-offs to cases throughout the whole province.  After the big and serious cases had been identified, they were  studied one by one and forces were organized to crack the cases  batch by batch and phase by phase. Second, when investigating  big and serious cases, the responsibility system for handling  cases, namely the "four fix's and one guarantee," was practiced  as follows: "Fix the leadership, fix the personnel, fix the  plan, and fix the period, as well as guarantee the funds for  handling the cases." Third, chief procurators personally took  command and directly participated in investigations into the big  and serious cases which had great impact, caused great harm, and  involved interference and a great degree of difficulty. Fourth,  establishing a system for supervising the handling of cases, a  system for urging the swift handling of cases, and a system for  reporting cases to the senior levels for the records, therefore  the senior departments could always monitor the situation and  the progress of handling big and serious cases. Fifth,  strengthening cooperation and coordination between public  security departments, law courts, discipline inspection  commissions, and supervisory organs. Sixth, in light of the  situation whereby in recent years there has been an increasing  number of economic criminals committing crimes inside and  outside the province and then fleeing with the money, the  provincial procuratorate strengthened unified command and  coordination work toward big and serious cases. By adopting  these measures, they effectively increased the strength of the  work of handling and investigating big and serious cases and  improved their efficiency when handling such cases. Last year,  the procuratorial organs opened investigation files on 737 big  cases of economic crimes such as corruption and bribery each of  which involved over 10,000 yuan. Of this total, 75 cases  involved between 100,000 and 500,000 yuan, 11 cases involved  between 500,000 and 1 million yuan, and 13 cases involved over 1  million yuan. In the second half of last year, procuratorial  organs opened investigation files for 825 cases, an increase of  57.7 percent over the 523 cases in the first half of last year.  Of these cases: Some 410 involved personnel in leading party  and government departments, judicial organs, administrative and  law enforcement organs, and economic management departments,  accounting for 30.41 percent of the total number of files  opened; Shu Kaitai, a former deputy head of the provincial  personnel department, received bribes of more than 200,000 yuan;  He Zizhong, a former chairman of the Dehong Dai-Jingpo  Autonomous Prefecture Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] Committee, took opportunities arising from  his office when he served as vice prefecture governor, to  embezzle more than 2 million yuan; Cao Wei, a former deputy  chief of a certain section in the Yunnan Bureau of State  Administration of Exchange Control, took bribes of more than 4  million yuan, collaborating with another three persons; Ren  Shujun, head of the labor management office of the provincial  labor department, and Kou Wei, a cadre in the office, abused  power and breached rules in performing formalities for the  transfer of personnel, in return for bribes of more than 100,000  yuan; and Wu Hancheng, deputy commander of the traffic brigade  of Wanding City Public Security Bureau, took bribes of more than  90,000 yuan when he ran a car business in the name of the  traffic brigade, and so on.    When they made efforts to investigate into cases of  corruption and bribery, the procuratorial organs at various  levels also investigated a number of serious and extraordinarily  large cases of counterfeit trademarks, tax evasion, refusal to  pay tax, and tax fraud. Last year, the procuratorial organs  opened investigation files on a total of 83 serious cases of  counterfeit tobacco which claimed to be Yunnan's famous and  quality tobacco, as well as counterfeit and poor-quality wines,  foodstuffs, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, an 84.4  percent increase over the previous year. A total of 181 cases  of tax evasion, refusal to pay tax, and tax fraud were looked  into and handled, up 45.5 percent. For example, Kunming City  Wuhua District Procuratorate investigated a case in which He  Yuanbao, general manager of Yunnan office of Hainan  International Joint Investment Company Limited, collaborated  with his men in carrying out criminal activities involving  counterfeit "Red Pagoda Hill" tobacco. The case involved some 8  million yuan and He and his men reaped undue profits amounting  to 2 million yuan. The procuratorates in the counties and cities  such as Kaiyuan, Chenggong, Shuifu, and Ximeng also uncovered  four very serious cases in which tricks were used to cheat the  state into reimbursisg tax. Each of these cases involved over 10  million yuan. Through investigating and handling these cases,  the procuratorial organs dealt a severe blow to the criminal  elements who had committed serious crimes, safeguarded the  market economy order and tax collection work, and protected the  interests of the state and the people.    4. Strictly enforcing the law, correctly  implementing laws and policies, and earnestly ensuring the  quality of handling cases. Under the circumstances whereby  reform was being deepened, opening up was being expanded, and  the old system was changing into a new system, investigations  into and handling of economic crimes faced many new conditions  and new problems. Not only were the conditions of criminal  activities very complicated but there were also some problems  for which the laws did not have specific written prescriptions  or which the policies did not allow us to distinguish and grasp.  Therefore, the procuratorial organs at various levels attached  greater importance to the principle that: "First, act  resolutely, and second, act prudently, exhausting every effort  to be accurate," a principle which they voluntarily upheld.  When handling specific cases, they paid attention to thorough  investigation and research, clarified facts and circumstances,  strictly fixed the boundary between what was a crime and what  was not according to the relevant law, and correctly determined  the nature of the crime and defined it. To ensure the quality  of handling cases, procuratorial organs upheld the policy of  division of labor and dividing levels when handling big and  serious cases; separated investigation, arrest, and prosecution,  and strengthened internal restraint; and let the procuratorial  commission discuss and decide collectively every big and serious  case. When a case could not be determined immediately, it was  not handled hastily; effective systems and measures, such as  requesting for instructions and making reports, were  strengthened so that the best efforts were made to handle every  case properly and solidly and to avoid mistakes, overlooking,  miscarriages of justice, and letting criminals go. Attention  was also paid to grasping the strategy of struggle and embodying  the policy of lenience and strictness. At the same time, in  work, the principle of the "three conducive's" was seriously  implemented. Attention was paid to the political and economic  effects of handling cases but even more was paid to the social  effects of handling cases, so that procuratorial work could  better serve economic construction. Although the work in  handling cases last year was arduous, the time was pressing, and  the degree of difficulty was great, in general, the quality of  handling cases was good and no big errors or mistakes were  discovered. Regarding the cases for which erroneous verdicts  were given during the previous several years, once they were  discovered, a serious and solemn attitude was adopted and the  principle of "correcting every error" was upheld, to correct  them according to law and in the manner of seeking truth from  facts.    Judged overall, an absolute majority of the personnel in our  party and state organs are honest, law-abiding, diligent, and  serve the people. However, a small handful of seriously corrupt  elements do indeed exist and we cannot underestimate their  potential for harm. We must soberly realize that the struggle  against corruption and degeneration is a long-term and arduous  duty, which penetrates the whole process of the building of  socialism with Chinese characteristics. We think that we must  not overestimate the recent achievements in the struggle against  corruption and bribery, that we must not be complacent with the  initial results we have scored, and that we must resolutely,  tenaciously, thoroughly, and persistently carry out the struggle  against corruption and bribery.  <H5>  II. Severely Crack Down on Serious Criminal Activities, </H5> Safeguard Social Stability and State Security    Last year, provincial procuratorial organs received requests  from public security organs and state security organs for the  arrest of 30,297 persons and, after examination, they granted  approvals to arrest 26,758 people. They also handled 30,874  persons who were transferred to the procuratorial organs for  proceedings to be initiated, as well as 608 people requesting  proceedings waivers. After examination, they initiated  proceedings against 25,518 persons and waived proceedings for  1,399 people.    Responding to the conditions and features of criminal  activities in our province, we mainly grasped the following  tasks:    1. Emphasizing key areas and according to law, we  severely, swiftly, and harshly cracked down on the criminal  activities which caused serious harm. The spearhead of the  struggle was always aimed at murderers, robbers, rapists,  offenders employing explosives, armed criminals, gangs, and  crimes by triad societies. Last year, approval was granted to  arrest 14,304 of the abovementioned criminals and proceedings  were initiated against 13,649 of them, accounting for 53.46  percent of the criminals for whom arrest approvals were granted  and 51.01 percent of the total number of persons against whom  proceedings were initiated. Concerning the extraordinarily big  cases, the measures such as intervening ahead of schedule,  giving priority in handling, and making arrests and initiating  proceedings swiftly, were adopted to strengthen the weight of  handling cases, improve the efficiency in handling, and give  full play to the might of legal weapons, dealing a severe blow  to the arrogance of the serious criminals.    2. Resolutely and continuosly cracking down on  drug-related crimes. Drug-related crime has always been an  acute area for criminal activities in our province. Last year,  the procuratorial organs granted approval for the arrest of  3,209 drug-related criminals, initiating proceedings against  3,271 of them. At the same time, they organized forces to  actively participate two provincewide "26 June" and "26 October"  campaigns to severely punish drug-related crime, burn drugs, and  extensively publicize the relevant regulations, cracking down on  a large number of drug- related criminals.    3. Resolutely cracking down on criminal activities  by hostile elements which jeopardize the country's  security. The procuratorial organs received requests from  the state security organs to arrest counterrevolutionary  criminals such as special agents and spies, handling some of  those criminals who were handed over for the purpose of  initiating proceedings; after carefully examining the cases,  they granted approval to arrest and prosecute 22 persons,  promptly and in accordance with the law. They strengthened the  work of examining requests to arrest people and to prosecute  people involved in foreign-related criminal cases, effectively  safeguarding the country's security and stability along the  border.    4. Actively participating in various special  struggles, special rectifications, and working to combat  disorder in key districts. Under the unified leadership of  local party committees and governments, procuratorial organs at  various levels actively participated in the national,  provincial, and regional campaigns such as "one cracking down  and two banning's," (cracking down on abduction and the selling  of women and children, banning prostitution, and banning drugs),  the antitheft struggle, the struggle against smuggling, and the  encroachment of hooligans who rob passengers, thus forcefully  cracking down on criminal activities which seriously undermine  law and order. They actively participated in handling emergency  incidents and in combating disorder in the districts which had  chaotic law and order, thus safeguarding social stability.    Integrating the handling of cases with various other  procuratorial duties, procuratorial organs at various levels  seriously implemented the "Yunnan Province Regulations on  Comprehensive Management of Public Order." According to the  principles of combining cracking down and prevention, and of  tackling both the symptom and the cause, they actively took part  in the comprehensive management of public order and, through  lauching extensive and thorough mass education to publicize the  legal system, they actively launched "procuratorial suggestion"  activities. They visited those who had proceedings waived and  supervised and examined the situation of prisoners serving their  terms outside prison. They seriously and promptly handled the  "emergency" letters and visits by the masses, fostering the  sense of legal system and lawabiding concepts among the broad  masses, especially the young people. They also promptly and  correctly handled various kinds of contradictions among the  people, reduced the destabilizing factors which could affect  social stability, and prevented lawbreaking and criminal  activities.    Over the past year, by the common efforts of specific organs  and the broad masses of people, achievements were made in areas  such as punishing crimes and the comprehensive management of  public order and stable public order was maintained in our  province. However, there are still many problems which affect  our province's political and social stability and, in some  places, the law and order situation is not good, evil phenomena  in the society are still pronounced, and the penetration and  destruction by hostile forces outside our borders has never  stopped. Furthermore, along with the continuous deepening of  the reform and the adjustment of interest relations, new  contradictions and problems will emerge. Therefore, we must  maintain a sober mind and a high degree of alertness and  carefully strike at our enemies, punish crime, safeguard  stability, and protect the reform.  <H5>  III. Seriously Perform Procuratorial Duties, Earnestly </H5> Strengthen the Supervision of Law Enforcement    The building and perfection of socialist market economy  system require a sound legal system as a norm and protection.  Last year, the procuratorial organs seriously implemented the  Supreme People's Procuratorate's instruction on further  thoroughly discharging the duty of legal supervision and  strengthened the work in supervising law enforcement.    1 Strengthening supervision over investigation.  Strictly adhering to the principle of "using fact as the base  and law as the criterion," we earnestly examined arrest  approvals and prosecutions. Except for crimes which deserved  arrest approval and prosecution, and for which approval was  resolutely granted according to law and decisions were made to  initiate proceedings, last year, decisions were made to refuse  approval for the arrest of 2,079 people and to waive prosecution  for 203. At the same time, decisions were made to arrest 269  people who should have been arrested but were not arrested and  to initiate proceedings against 71 people who should have been  prosecuted but were not prosecuted. A total of 94 pieces of  opinion about correcting the unlawful behavior during  investigative activities was given. The procuratorates at  various levels, through measures such as intervening ahead of  schedule and monitoring and supervising cases, strengthened  their supervision of investigations into serious, extraordinary,  and big cases.    2. Strengthening supervision over hearing criminal  cases. Through going to law courts to support prosecutions  and examining the verdicts and judgments given by the courts,  procuratorial organs at various levels supervised the court  trials in accordance with the law. Last year, the procuratorial  organs raised objections to 125 verdicts and judgments on  criminal cases because they considered them definitely to be  erroneous. To date, the law courts have corrected the verdicts  in 37 cases. A total of 113 pieces of opinion on correction was  offered after unlawful behaviors were discovered during trial  activities. Regarding the execution of criminals sentenced to  death, procuratorial organs carried out on-the-spot supervision.    3. Strengthening discipline supervision.  Investigation into and the handling of five kinds of cases were  strengthened, namely: Fraudulent practices for personal gain,  use of torture to extract confessions, illegal detention,  dereliction of duty, and major accidents arising from  dereliction of duty. Particular efforts were made to  investigate malfeasance and "rights infringements" by judicial  personnel, as well as administrative and law enforcement  personnel. Last year, the procuratorial organs opened  investigation files for 366 discipline cases, of which 300 were  of the five kinds of cases, 81.97 percent of the total,  effectively safeguarding the dignity of the country's law and  the citizens' democratic and personal rights.    4. Strengthening supervision over trials of civil  cases and administrative cases. At present,, there are 13  subprocuratorates, prefecture procuratorates, and city  procuratorates and 29 county-level procuratorates which have  organs overseeing civil cases and administrative complaints and  carrying out the training of personnel who go to posts. Last  year, the province received 310 civil (economic) cases of  complaints about verdicts and judgments given by the courts, as  well as complaints about administration. To date, it has been  decided that 51 of the cases should be reviewed and work in  reviewing 31 cases has already been finished.    5. Strengthening supervision over implementation.  Supervision over the conditions for implementing verdicts and  sentences in criminal cases, and implementing policy and law in  prisons and reform facilities, has always been given top  priority. Last year, efforts were made to strengthen  supervision over implementation which was not carried out in  accordance with the law and that which was unlawful.  Procuratorial organs addressed cases of overdue detention  involving 710 people, discovered and corrected 599 incidents of  lawbreaking conditions during detention and reform activities.  At the same time, according to law, they cracked down on  reemerging crimes such as recidivists becoming "bosses and  bullies prison," to maintain order in the prison and reform  facilities. Attention was also paid to protecting, according to  law, the rights of those under detention. In addition, in  accordacne with the law, they handled 13 cases of corruption,  bribery, dereliction of duty, and fraudulent practices for  personal gain by 18 prison officers.  <H5>  IV. Strengthen Building a Contingent and Honesty in </H5> Procuratorial Organs    Over the past year, in order to adapt to the development of  the situation and to meet the needs of duty, the procuratorial  organs mainly grasped the following tasks in the area of  building a contingent:    1. Strengthening ideological and political work to  enable the broad masses of policemen to catch up with the  situation of developments in the areas of deepening the reform,  expanding opening up, and establishing the market economy system  and to continuously upgrade awareness and voluntariness for  implementing the party's basic line and serving economic  construction under the new situation. The broad masses of  policemen, during various procuratorial work but especially when  investigating big and serious cases, invigorated their spirits,  overcame difficulties, enforced the law impartially, fought  continuously, and made meaningful contributions to accomplishing  the difficult and glorious duties entrusted to procuratorial  organs by the party and the state. A large number of advanced  figures and collectives emerged. Last year, 34 advanced  collectives and 244 advanced personnel were commended by the  Supreme People's Procuratorate and the provincial procuratorate.  Comrade Yue Congkun, chief of the law and discipline section of  Tonghai County Procuratorate, sacrificed himself gloriously when  discharging his public duty last August and was granted the  title of revolutionary martyr by the provincial people's  government.    2. Firmly grasping clean government building for the  procuratorial contingent itself. On the basis of  organizing policemen to seriously learn from the important  instructions on combating corruption issued by the central  leadership, the provincial party committee and the Supreme  People's Procuratorate, the leading cadres of the procuratorates  of various levels launched self-inspection and self-correction  strictly according to the five regulations on honesty and  self-discipline issued by the central leadership. As regards  the problems detected during self-inspection, these were handled  according to the relevant regulations. The lawbreaking and  discipline-violating personnel within the procuratorial  contingent were seriously and solemnly handled according to the  principle of "running the procuratorates strictly." At the same  time, efforts were made to sort out and rectify companies run by  the procuratorial organs. The problem of random charges and  fines was also seriously tackled. Concerning the unreasonable  charges and fines which amounted to 1,033,500 yuan, 944,400 yuan  have been refunded and the rest will be refunded.    3. Strengthening building of a leadership group and  training cadres. The work to elect procurators for the  provincial procuratorate and 11 subprocuratorates and prefecture  and city procuratorates, was accomplished smoothly as the terms  of office of the old procurators expired. After this round of  elections, the average age of those in the leadership group  decreased, their educational attainments improved, the structure  became more rational, and the newly elected procurators were  given on-the-job training by the Supreme People's Procuratorate  and the provincial procuratorate. At the same time, responding  to the needs of the situation and duty, various styles were  adopted to strengthen work in training cadres. As a result, the  professional quality and combat ability of the procuratorial  police was upgraded.    Over the past year, although our province's procuratorial  work scored good results and some areas made new breakthroughs  and headway, a small number of leading comrades in some units  did not have an adequate understanding of the great significance  of the anticorruption drive, their emphases were not great  enough, and their measures were not adequately effective.    Deputies:    The year 1994 is a very important and extremely crucial one  for deepening the reform and expediting economic development and  a series of reform measures has been and will be promulgated.  The new situation raises new and higher demands for  procuratorial work. The duties of the procuratorial work in our  province this year are: Resolutely using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as  guidance; thoroughly implementing the spirit of the 14th CPC  National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee; upholding the party's basic line and adhering  to the political orientation whereby procuratorial work serves  economic construction, reform, and opening up; adhering to the  ideological line of seeking truth from facts; upholding the  principle of "doing two kinds of work simultaneously and with  equal firmness"; strengthening procuratorial organs' legal  supervision duty; enforcing the law strictly and handling cases  diligently; thoroughly launching the struggle against corruption  and degeneration; severely cracking down on serious criminal  activities; actively taking part in the comprehensive management  of public order; enabling our province's procuratorial work to  have a new development; and making new contributions to  safeguarding social and political stability to ensure a smooth  process for the reform, opening up, and modernization  construction.    In order to do a good job in our province's procuratorial  work this year, efforts must be made to grasp three areas:    First, it is necessary to closely center on the central  task of economic construction and to obey and serve the overall  situation of grasping the opportunity, deepening the reform,  expanding the opening up, promoting development, and maintaining  stability; it is necessary to voluntarily place procuratorial  work under the guidance of party committees at various levels  and under the supervision of people's congresses at various  levels; and it is necessary to firmly grasp the procuratorial  work's political direction, to enable procuratorial work to  always proceed and develop in the correct direction.    Second, during work, attention must be paid to grasping  "two crackdown's, two constructions, and one strengthening.  The "two crackdown's" means we will continue to launch an  in-depth struggle against corruption and bribery, pinpoint key  departments, firmly grasp big and serious cases, implement the  leadership responsibility system at every level, improve  standards of investigation, and ensure quality handling of  cases. When there is a case which constitutes a crime, no  matter who is involved, our investigation will go to the roots  and we will never be weak-handed. The cases of framing charges  against others must also be handled according to law and the  innocent must be protected and not pursued irresponsibly. We  will continue to severely and swiftly crack down on serious  criminal activities according to law, persistently crack down on  drug-related crimes, actively take part in the special campaigns  tackling acute problems of law and order, and do a good job in  comprehensive management. By "two constructions" we mean,  first, with the leadership group as the key point and with  building of ideology and work style and building of clean  government as the main content, we will grasp self-construction  of the procuratorial contingent, strictly run procuratorates,  improve the overall quality of the procuratorial contingent,  diligently build a procuratorial contingent which is politically  strong, professionally capable, and has strict discipline and a  tough work style. With strengthening and improving the means of  handling cases as well as working conditions as the key point,  and under the support and care from governments of various  levels and the relevant quarters, we will grasp building of  foundations for the procuratorates at various levels, especially  the grass-roots procuratorates. By "one strengthening" we mean  that: We will earnestly strengthen investigation and research;  leaders should take the lead in going deeply into the reality  and launch work centered on the party's central task and the key  points, difficulties, and weak links of procuratorial work;  leaders should carry out investigation and research on the new  conditions and new problems arising from the law enforcement  activities, to explore new law and deliberate new  countermeasures; and that leaders should strictly distinguish  between what is a crime and what is not, continuously improving  the standard of law enforcement. At the same time, on the basis  of investigation and research, and responding to the need of  establishing the socialist market economy system, we will  actively explore and promote the reform of procuratorial work,  proceeding from discharging the duty of legal supervision,  strengthening supervisory means, perfecting the supervisory  system, enhancing supervisory effects, and further straightening  out the relations between the upper and lower levels, as well as  internal organizations and setups, so that procuratorial work  can better adapt to the new situation of deepening the reform  and expediting the development.    3. It is necessary to uphold and strengthen the work  principle of enforcing law strictly and handling cases  diligently.Enforcing the law strictly is the central link  in building the socialist legal system and a must for  procuratorial organs when they discharge their duty of legal  supervision. Handling cases diligently is the concrete  embodiment of enforcing the law strictly. Therefore, we must  use this principle to arrange overall procuratorial work. This  year, we must make new headway and breakthroughs in three areas,  namely, investigating and handling big and serious cases,  especially serious cases; strengthening supervision over law  enforcement and of solemnly investigating unlawful cases of not  enforcing the law strictly; and handling cases such as  smuggling, counterfeit trademarks, and tax evasion. To  conclude, we must safeguard the overall implementation of the  law, ensure quality handling of cases, and handle cases as iron  cases.    In the new year, the procuratorial organs have very  difficult  and arduous duties but we are confident and determined that,  under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the  provincial party committee, and the Supreme People's  Procuratorate; under the supervision of the provincial people's  congress; and with the support of the provincial government and  the people of various nationalities, we can further emancipate  the minds, invigorate the spirits, honestly discharge our  duties, work hard, thoroughly safeguard social and political  stability, and make new contributions to expediting the reform,  opening up, and economic construction in our province.</p>

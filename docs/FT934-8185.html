			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Caracas suspends sell-off plans VENEZUELA'S privatisation programme has been suspended this week until after a new president is elected on December 5. The move, ordered by President Ramon J. Velasquez, is a serious blow to the government's highly regarded privatisation team and means that bidding on state assets will be delayed, perhaps until after a new government takes office in February of next year. Mr Julian Villalba, head of the privatisation programme, said the suspension was a 'political decision' taken as a courtesy to the next chief executive. The leading candidate in Venezuela's current presidential campaign, Mr Rafael Caldera, has expressed reservations about the privatisation programme. As a result of the delay the Venezuelan treasury will not receive at least Dollars 700m from sales of assets planned over the next few months, he added. The cash-strapped government will also have to continue financing money-losing concerns due for privatisation. Several large state-owned assets were scheduled to be sold through international bidding in November and December. They include three electric power companies; Aerpostal, an airline with domestic and international routes; and the Caracas Raceway. Venezuelan and international companies had expressed interest in these and other assets.</p>

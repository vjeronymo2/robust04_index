			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Solicitors tackle race bias the governing body for solicitors in England and Wales - is proposing to amend its rule book to make sexual and racial discrimination by solicitors a disciplinary offence. The society said it had decided to make the move because 'discrimination continues on a worrying scale against black trainees and qualified solicitors'. The new rule will add to existing equal-opportunity principles in the profession's code of practice, by requiring law firms and legal departments to adopt and operate an anti-discrimination policy. The society said that would force solicitors to address the issue and examine practices on recruitment and dealings with ethnic minorities. Firms will be free to develop their own anti-discrimination policies or adopt a specimen society policy that includes targets for employing ethnic minorities. Small firms should have at least one ethnic-minority lawyer and large firms should have at least 10 per cent of trainees and 5 per cent of other lawyers of ethnic-minority origin. Large firms are expected to meet the 10 per cent trainee target by the end of 1995. According to society statistics for last year, there were 10,423 firms of solicitors in 14,997 offices in England and Wales and 487 local authorities and 1,507 organisations employing solicitors. There were only 800 solicitors from ethnic minorities. However, 14 per cent of new students in 1990-91 were from ethnic minorities and the figure has been rising steadily. The society emphasised that the targets were not quotas and could not be enforced. Adherence to the policy, though, will be taken into account during routine monitoring, which from 1994 will have to take place in firms authorised to take trainees. The society said discrimination on grounds of sex was almost entirely directed against women in mid career, principally after the birth of children. It said it had anecdotal evidence of women being asked unlawful questions at interview about whether they were planning to have children. The proposals are being put out to the profession for consultation. The society has made clear that it intends to have the new rules in place by early next year.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITISH GET MOST OF THE THEATER MONEY  </P> <P> Regarding Dan Sullivan's article ("A Birthday Wish for Music Center," Sept. 17)  calling for a classical theater company to be finally formed at the Music  Center, sure why not? But to then advocate a director with strong classical  credentials "which therefore may suggest a Brit," only undermines his exciting  proposal and shows a total misunderstanding of where the American theater is  today.  </P> <P> Sadly our biggest problem in the area of classical theater still seems to be an  incredible inferiority complex. Even our own theater producers and professional  practitioners (not to even mention critics) find it hard to believe what  training, exposure to foreign works and just sheer hard work has accomplished  in the last 25 years in this country. Instead, we just keep on handing the ball  over to the Brits every time we can, assuming no American directors have the  proper cultural "genes" to be first-rate with the classics.  </P> <P> In our own back yard alone, Jack O'Brian of the Old Globe, Des McAnuff of La  Jolla, Dan Sullivan (our critic's namesake in Seattle) and Adrian Hall have  gained world-class distinction as classical directors, and its time they were  recognized as such by our own L.A. critic.  </P> <P> Since time and time again American money has gone to support the Royal  Shakespeare Co. and the BBC Shakespeare series, no wonder we can't raise enough  interest and money to produce our own classical projects like the one Sullivan  proposes.  </P> <P> ROGER HENDRICKS SIMON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

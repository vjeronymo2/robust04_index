			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan investors begin to believe economists WITH the exception of Milan, which took its rally to a third day, bourses tended to ease yesterday on position-squaring ahead of the Easter holiday, reaction to company results and a degree of disappointment with the Bundesbank's slow approach to interest rate cuts, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN rose on a broad front as investors began to believe a number of economists who have been suggesting in recent days that the worst of the Italian recession was over, and that the economy was poised for an export-led recovery. Comments by the governor of the Bank of Italy and the president of Italy's Banking Association about the outlook for lower interest rates also helped the mood. The Comit index rose 13.21 or 2.7 per cent to 498.76. Fiat and Generali were among the strongest performers, boosted by short-covering linked to monthly options' contracts. Generali fixed L1,390 higher at L35,090 and added another L110 on the kerb. Fiat rose L258 or 4.5 per cent to fix at L5,928 before rising to L6,030 after hours as rumours about asset sales continued. Speculation this week about a possible disposal of its retail group took the Rinascente shares L190 or 2.2 per cent higher to to L8,775. FRANKFURT fell as the Bundesbank shaved just four basis points off its short term repo rates. The automotive sector fell in unison as the DAX index closed 15.09 lower at 1,650.31 in turnover down from DM5.9bn to DM5.6bn. Daimler fell DM16.70 to DM563.80 on reports that a major German bank had made the shares a trading sell, bringing its Mercedes unit down DM19 to DM545; and VW lost DM7.90 to DM308 on profit-taking after hitting a new 1993 high on Tuesday. Mr Patrick Bettscheider, deputy equity dealing head at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said that the two carmakers apart, the market was illiquid on both the buy and the sell side, waiting for a new direction. In his view, that will be up, and will accelerate when other major companies are seen to employ the same cost cutting and restructuring policies which have brought VW back to popularity. Meanwhile, AEG fell DM8.50 to DM160 after it predicted 1993 operating losses at least as high as the DM200m of 1992. PARIS seemed unimpressed by its results season as the CAC-40 index fell 11.37 to 1,983.96 in thin to moderate trade. The tyremaker, Michelin, lost FFr1.90 to FFr165.10 after warning of a first-half loss if business does not improve. Worries about Michelin spilled over into Peugeot, which fell FFr6 to FFr549; and Thomson-CSF closed FFr3 lower at FFr163.50 after it reported a 35 per cent drop in profits for 1992, and cut its dividend. Pechiney International fell another FFr3.50 francs to FFr217 after Tuesday's FFr10.50 decline, on further consideration of its results for 1992 and the company's lack of optimism about the beverage can market this year. Among the day's winners, the Ferruzzi food unit, Eridania-Beghin Say, jumped FFr37 to FFr737 following news late on Tuesday of a 69 per cent jump in 1992 net profits. AMSTERDAM was dominated by a fall in Heineken as the CBS Tendency index dipped 0.5 to to 107.5 in otherwise quiet trading. Heineken finished Fl 6.10 lower at Fl 190.90 after it said that the European beer market was coming under increasing pressure from recession and taxation, and warned against short-term optimism. The shares had risen by 29 per cent over the last 12 months. Unilever ended Fl 2.70 lower at at Fl 206.40, taking a lead from the re-rating of US consumer goods shares after Philip Morris's price cuts last Friday. DSM, the chemicals group, lost Fl 3.00 to Fl 84.20 as the company warned that profits might not grow this year. The shares of the newly-merged Bols Wessanen finished at Fl 42.60 on their first day of trading. ZURICH edged back after Tuesday's record close and the SMI index shed 11.1 to 2,184.9 in thin trading. Nestle, down SFr35 or 2.9 per cent at SFr1,160, was hit by fears of increased price competition after the Philip Morris price cuts.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- April 7                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1146.85     1145.89     1147.01     1146.46 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1208.88     1209.01     1209.37     1207.06  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1143.70     1142.84     1143.94     1144.36 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1202.71     1203.95     1205.89     1206.25  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Apr 6     Apr 5     Apr 2     Apr 1    Mar 31  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1147.43   1136.15   1140.36   1144.81   1149.13 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1210.05   1202.24   1215.52   1219.86   1220.16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1147.41; 200 - 1209.38 Low/day: 100 - 1142.16  200 - 1201.33.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

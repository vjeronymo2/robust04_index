			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  opposition Democratic Party on March 29 demanded a hearing of  the National Assembly to lay bare the injustice of the "Uruguay  Round negotiations" as part of the struggle against the  "parliamentary ratification" of the farm market opening,  according to a Radio report from Seoul.    The Democratic Party inaugurated the "Committee of the  Struggle To Check Ratification of Uruguay Round Accord" with  democratic members of the "National Assembly" and declared it  would convert the party system into an emergency system to check  the "parliamentary ratification" of the farm market opening.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (18): Critical stage completed - The defence forces integration In its own way, the announcement at the end of last month was almost as momentous as the installation of President Nelson Mandela. Mr Siphiwe Nyanda, former chief of staff of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the African National Congress's guerrilla army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). Mr Nyanda, 44, was one of nine MK officers given senior positions in the integrated SANDF in a statement issued by Mr Joe Modise - himself a former MK commander and now minister of defence. Confirmed in their positions were the present chiefs of the army, air force and navy: Lt Gen J H Pretorious, Lt Gen J Kriel, and Vice-Admiral R C Simpson. In a restrained comment that must have concealed many emotions, Gen Georg Meiring, commander of the SANDF, declared himself 'quite happy'. The announcement marked the end of a critical stage of one of the most remarkable revolutions of the twentieth century. The South African armed forces were not defeated and their MK adversaries never managed to launch an effective guerrilla war. But the soldiers of both sides had to find an accommodation that would underpin the civilian leaders' political settlement. The essentials of the accommodation provide for the SANDF to swell to about 120,000 over the next year, allowing for the entry of MK cadres, soldiers of former homeland armies, and a much smaller number of guerrillas from the Azanian People's Liberation Army, military wing of the Pan Africanist Congress. Over the next three years this force will continue a process of 'restructuring and integration', during which it will be trimmed back to the pre-integration strength of the armed forces - about 91,000. These bare facts do not do justice to the complex behind-the-scenes negotiations that have run parallel to the public political bargaining. But in a chapter from a book to be published later this year by Johannesburg's Centre for Policy Studies, Mr Mark Shaw, a researcher at the centre, provides a detailed account.* The essence of Mr Shaw's thesis is that the former South African Defence Force (SADF) made their own assessment of the political and military options open to them, and 'chose. . . not to prevent change.' 'Contrary to expectations of many observers, the SADF did not seek to derail or prevent the transition; rather it sought to secure its place within it', writes Mr Shaw. 'This willingness to live with majority government and military integration was made far easier by the knowledge that its power, and the technical competence of its senior officers, ensured that it would remain a force which the new civilian authorities would have to respect, whatever formal arrangements were signed', he continues. Equally illuminating comments are made about MK, whose operational strength numbered about 10,000 in the mid-1980s. It never had an overt political agenda of its own, aside from the basic objective of ending white rule, says Mr Shaw. This made it easier for it to revise its strategy after Nelson Mandela's release in 1990, he writes. From 1991 onwards, its training changed from guerrilla skills to conventional military skills, 'designed specifically to prepare individuals for incorporation into a new national defence force'. Some 8,000-10,000 MK soldiers are believed to have been trained for this purpose, bringing the estimated number of troops available for integration to about 14,000-16,000. 'If estimates of MK guerrilla strength are accurate, it trained more people for the national army than for its guerrilla war. While this still left it vastly outnumbered by the SADF, it made it less likely that military 'integration' would amount to the MK being absorbed by the SADF', Mr Shaw writes. According to Mr Shaw, the South African cabinet decided in 1990 to try and leave the SADF untouched: 'It alone would control the military until it was reasonably certain of the outcome of the transition,' and ANC efforts to the contrary were 'stonewalled' until early 1993. The compromise reached on the thorny issue of control was the agreement to form a National Peace Keeping Force (NPKF). Although it was to prove a failure, the exercise nevertheless served a valuable purpose. Originally intended as force of 10,000 men, it initially comprised some 4,500 drawn from the SADF, the police force, MK and homelands forces from Transkei, Ciskei and Venda. Poorly trained and badly led, it was discredited on its first operational deployment in the East Rand, where violence actually increased after the force was deployed. Two days later it was withdrawn and later it was disbanded. The experience increased the legitimacy of the SADF, welcomed back enthusiastically to the East Rand. But, says Mr Shaw, the NKPF prevented a negotiation deadlock on joint control of the armed forces and showed that more time was needed for integration, while the legitimacy it afforded the SADF was to be transferred to the new SANDF. The months and years ahead, warns Mr Shaw, will be marked by internal battles over senior appointments and affirmative action. The call by the former SADF for 'a technologically advanced military force' will also be a sensitive issue, for it has political implications. A high technical capacity, Mr Shaw suggests, could help extend white officers' hold on military power. He also warns that 'tensions will inevitably develop between the old military leaders and the new political ones, with the ex-homeland officers split between them.' But the analysis ends on a cautiously optimistic note: 'Restraint and political skill on both sides could however yet ensure a united military, constrained by civil authority, in a society in which this once hardly seemed likely'. * The Small Miracle, Ravan Press, c/o Centre for Policy Studies, PO Box 16488, Doornfontein 2028.

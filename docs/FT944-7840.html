			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / ScottishPower launches telecoms subsidiary ScottishPower yesterday launched a telecommunications subsidiary to compete with British Telecommunications and Mercury for the provision of business services in Scotland. ScottishTelecom will use an optical fibre network which is being installed at a cost of Pounds 35m alongside ScottishPower's overhead and underground cables in central Scotland. The company claims customers making a mixture of local and long-distance calls via an exchange will achieve savings on call charges compared with BT and Mercury of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent. ScottishTelecom will introduce a standard Scottish rate for calls, other than local calls, to anywhere in Scotland. It believes BT and Mercury, which charge a long-distance rate for calls between cities will find it hard to respond to its Scottish rate. ScottishTelecom is the latest development in ScottishPower's strategy of diversifying from its core electricity business. It already has a gas subsidiary, CaledonianGas, and has expanded in retailing by buying many of the Clydesdale Group's electrical goods stores from the receiver. Mr Rod Matthews, ScottishTelecom chief executive, said all the current telecommunications operators had tariffs 'biased towards the large metropolitan areas, with London enjoying a number of special advantages on top of that'. ScottishTelecom has a partnership agreement with Energis, the telecommunications network owned by the National Grid company, which began operating this year. ScottishTelecom will use Energis's network south of the border. It will use Colt's network in the City of London. ScottishTelecom has not established connections to Aberdeen, Dundee and other places in Scottish Hydro-Electric's electricity franchise area, but is discussing using Hydro-Electric's telecommunications system or installing its own. ScottishTelecom has already begun providing services to a small number of large users such as the BBC and will offer its full range of services from next March. Full scale marketing began yesterday.</p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Letter: The myth that only large airlines can survive Sir, In his gloom at the prospects for independent airlines George Williams (Personal View, October 20) comes dangerously close to swallowing the myth that only the largest airlines can survive - a triple fallacy. First, smaller airlines are more innovative, free of the large airline tradition of eradicating consumer choice. For example, Virgin Atlantic has pioneered an unrivalled range of popular developments, including seat-back videos for every passenger, limousines, masseuses, lounges on board and a new class of travel for full-fare Economy passengers. Second, smaller airlines deliver a better product. This is the service industry par excellence. In choosing airlines, passengers attach great importance to the care, courtesy, enthusiasm, friendliness, respect and efficiency with which the airline's people treat them, on board and on the ground. Large airlines' conspicuous lack of these qualities led me to set up Virgin Atlantic Airways in the first place. Now our high service standards enable us to compete successfully with six out of the world's 10 largest airlines. That success is absolutely dependent upon our staff understanding the importance of their jobs and recognising their own personal contribution. Personal commitment is important to passengers, but rarely found in large airlines. Third, smaller airlines are more efficient. For example, the largest airline has admitted costs at least 25 per cent above those of its smaller competitors, contributing to inflation by wasting several million pounds a day of passengers' money. So smaller airlines suffer no lack of advantages - but they do lack the chance to use them. A barricade of obstacles to airline competition is still tolerated by governments. Government-imposed exile to Gatwick helped kill off many independent British airlines. That obstacle at least has gone, but now there is another: historical precedence in the allocation of vital airport take-off and landing slots. There could not be a more anti-competitive measure, but it is still tolerated by governments and may even be reaffirmed in the EC under the British presidency. Get rid of these needless obstacles to competition; crack down hard on predation before it can damage smaller airlines; and ban state subsidies to airlines. Then leave smaller airlines to compete. They can and they will, to the great benefit of consumers. Richard Branson, chairman, Virgin Group of Companies, 120 Campden Hill Road, London W8 7AR</p>

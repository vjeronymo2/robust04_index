The Saturday [15 January] session resulted in considerable  weakening of the position of SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak, after  his party rivals headed by Slovak Deputy Premiers Marian Andel  and Jozef Prokes pushed through the dismissal of the present  party leadership. The chairman himself (Cernak) remains in the  post.    In its resolution the meeting expressed disquiet about SNS  disintegration "at the time when Hungarian irredentists  jeopardize our country's integrity in south Slovakia."    SNS First Deputy Chairman Igor Uhrik resigned from his post  at the meeting, while Cernak was expressed no confidence and  asked to resign, and Deputy Chairmen Anton Hrnko, Andrej Findo,  Jan Hurny, Anna Malikova, and Central Secretary Jozef Hrabina  were dismissed.    The Council rejected the split of the present SNS  parliamentary group of deputies by the establishment of the  National Democratic Group, and asked the six deputies of this  group headed by Cernak to rejoin the "only legitimate" SNS group  (now comprising 8 members) or to offer their resignation from  their deputies' posts so that they can be replaced by other SNS  members.    The Central Council charged Cernak, Andel, Prokes, and  Miloslav Kona, chairman of the SNS Group of Deputies, to held  talks with the SNS coalition partner, the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). So far it has been only Cernak who  has negotiated with the Premier Vladimir Meciar-led HZDS.    A press conference which took place in the night only  confirmed the controversies between the SNS two factions over  the further functioning of the HZDS-SNS government coalition,  and the future identity of the SNS.    Prokes criticized Cernak's leadership for behaving  alternately as coalition and opposition body, which impaired the  image of Slovakia's stability abroad. Cernak expressed his  reservations about the so far functioning of the government  coalition.</p>

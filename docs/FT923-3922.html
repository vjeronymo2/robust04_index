			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UN troops in Bosnia 'should return fire' MR MALCOLM RIFKIND, the British defence secretary, yesterday called for the nearly 2,000 UK troops due to leave for Bosnia-Hercegovina to be given the right to return fire, amid growing outrage at the killing of two French United Nations peacekeepers. As the situation on the ground grew increasingly difficult Mr Rifkind said it was a 'crucial requirement' for any soldier to be able to defend himself, condemning as 'repulsive' the machinegun and mortar attack on the UN relief convoy near the airport in the besieged Bosnian capital. Mr Rifkind's remarks reflect growing calls from the countries contributing to the 16,000-strong peacekeeping force for their lightly armed troops to use force if attacked. Meanwhile, Brigadier-General Hussein Ali Abdul Razek, commander of the UN peacekeepers in Sarajevo, blamed the mainly Moslem Bosnian forces for Tuesday's attack on a UN convoy which left two soldiers dead and five wounded. He said: 'Irresponsible elements failed to respond to the local Bosnian commander's orders and attacked the convoy at a range of less than 100 metres.' The French government yesterday implicitly accused the Bosnian Moslem forces in Sarajevo of being responsible for the death of the soldiers. This is the first time that a contributor country to the UN peacekeeping operations in Bosnia has blamed one of the warring factions in the conflict between the Serbian, Moslem and Croatian communities of Bosnia. Vigorously condemning the attack, Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, said that it underlined the urgent need to find an answer to the security problems arising out of the UN protection force's operations in Bosnia. Mr Dumas stressed that the UN Security Council's resolution 770 of August 13 specifically provided for effective military protection of international aid convoys. He said he had asked Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, 'to activate' these measures. The attack on the convoy dealt a further blow to the 380,000 battered people trapped in Sarajevo. There is little food and no aid following the closure last week of the airport and possible shooting down of an Italian relief flight over territory controlled by Moslems and Croats. After yesterday's meeting of the London Conference steering committee in Geneva, it appeared unlikely that aid flights would be resumed before next Tuesday. The overland convoy attacked on Tuesday was en route from Belgrade, the Serbian capital, to Sarajevo in an attempt to compensate for the suspension of humanitarian flights to the Bosnian capital. Sarajevo has been besieged for five months from the surrounding hills by Serb forces opposed to Bosnian independence.</p>

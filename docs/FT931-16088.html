			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / World Trade News: ABB in Czech engineering venture ASEA Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, has taken a controlling 67 per cent interest in a new company created from the power-engineering division of Prvni brnenska strojirna (PBS) of Brno in the Czech republic. Terms were not revealed but Mr Eberhard von Koerber, executive vice-president of ABB, said it was the largest of the 26 ventures so far established by the group in eastern Europe. The business being acquired has 4,000 employees and an annual turnover of Dollars 120m (Pounds 78.9m), as well as making a Dollars 13.2m net profit last year. It produces boilers and steam turbines, mainly for small industrial power plants with capacity up to 60MW. Mr Koerber said the level of engineering at PBS was fairly high and so the new company, ABB-Prvni brnenska strojirna BRNO, should quickly become 'a major pillar for low-cost manufacturing' within ABB's global network of power engineering plants. He saw it adding substantially to ABB's existing Dollars 600m-worth of annual business in the industrial plant sector, and expected it to grow quickly enough to avoid the need for redundancies either there or at other ABB plants. Mr Koerber said the purchase price to ABB, as in its other eastern European acquisitions, would consist of payments in cash and kind, and management and technology transfers. The remaining 33 per cent of ABB-PBS is being retained by PBS Holding, a recently-privatised group in which the Czech state still holds 51 per cent.</p>

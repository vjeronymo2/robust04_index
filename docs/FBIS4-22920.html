To this end,  the actual nutrition was examined in the Plavsk rayon of Tula  oblast in the framework of the 1990-1992 State Union-Republican  Program of Urgent Measures in the aftermath of the Chernobyl  nuclear power plant accident. A contingent of children was  divided into two groups of 1-3 and 4-6 year old kids enrolled in  a preschool institution. The preschool institution nutrition was  examined by analyzing 100 menus using an analytical method with  the help of tables. The characteristics of child nutrition  rations based on the food intake (M+/-m) for  proteins, fats, carbohydrates, caloric value, and protein:fat  (animal vs. vegetable) ratio and the characteristics of daily  rations of actual child nutrition for the content of principal  nutrients and energy are summarized. This comprehensive hygienic  assessment shows a lack of balance and a vitamin and mineral  (especially calcium and iodine) deficiency. Based on the  findings, balanced seven-day four-times-a-day rations for 1-3  and 4-6 year olds are specially developed for the areas affected  by the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident.

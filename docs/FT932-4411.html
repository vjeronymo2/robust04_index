			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Marston jumps to Pounds 20m DOUBLED marketing expenditure helped Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the regional brewer, lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 20.1m over the 12 months to March 27. However, trading conditions for the industry continued to be difficult and the outcome, produced on an FRS 3 basis, included bad debt provisions of Pounds 2.5m, of which Pounds 1m was taken as an exceptional charge. Advertising and promotional spending of Pounds 3.7m paid off with a 32 per cent increase in sales volumes of draught Pedigree, a substantial increase in canned Draughtflow Pedigree, and a 31 per cent rise in Low C sales. Mr Michael Hurdle, chairman, said: 'Our recent trading performance gives us confidence that our strategy of widening our distribution base, together with increased emphasis on building brands, will enable us to make further satisfactory progress,' he said. 'We have now ceased production of all products which have no genuine brand potential.' With some evidence of an upturn in consumer activity in the last few months of the year, operating profits rose from Pounds 15m to Pounds 21m on turnover ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 127.7m. Overall beer volumes rose 3 per cent against a market decline of about 2 per cent. 'Free trade has probably never been as competitive as it is now,' Mr Hurdle said - though the company's business had not been directly affected by the national brewers' price war. Managed pubs increased profits more than 30 per cent for the fifth consecutive year. Some Pounds 9.9m was invested in pub improvements and Pounds 2.2m was spent on acquisitions. Volumes in tenanted pubs declined 5 per cent overall, but tenants on new six-year agreements achieved a 1.5 per cent increase in sales while those on the old agreement saw volumes fall an average 8 per cent. Earnings per share before exceptionals rose to 17.66p (16.53p). A proposed final dividend of 3.95p makes a total of 5.4p (4.91p).</p>

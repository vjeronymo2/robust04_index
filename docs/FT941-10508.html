			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Into uncharted territory: The careful calculations that lay behind yesterday's cut in UK base rates For the Treasury and Bank of England, yesterday's decision to cut bank base rates by a quarter percentage point to 5.25 per cent was a judgment of Solomon. Inflation, whether measured by the 'headline' retail prices index or by the government's chosen 'underlying' inflation rate of RPI minus mortgage interest payments, is set to rise in the months ahead as the indirect taxes decided in last year's two Budgets are put into effect. On the other hand, as yesterday's Bank of England inflation report makes clear, the rise will come from a much lower base than assumed just three months ago so that, with luck, the official target ceiling of 4 per cent for underlying retail price inflation will not be breached either this year or next. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, focused yesterday on recent economic indicators in his explanation for the first quarter-point rate change since 1985. But the discussions between the Bank and Treasury that led up to the decision when Mr Clarke met Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, a week ago, were concerned just as much with the future. The UK economy is heading into uncharted territory, requiring judgments by policymakers for which recent experience is a poor guide. The biggest imponderable is the fiscal tightening that takes effect from April when the tax increases decided last year really begin to bite. The increased tax burden in 1994-95 - at Pounds 8.4bn or 1.3 per cent of gross domestic product - looks formidable. But nobody can tell how the public will react to the mix of frozen tax allowances, increased national insurance contributions, reduced mortgage interest relief and lower married couples' allowance, and value added tax on domestic fuel and power. Will the tightening choke off the recovery, as many have warned? Or will low inflation, falling interest rates and increased consumer confidence caused by falling unemployment prompt people to reduce their savings from the most recent recorded level of 10.6 per cent of disposable income and so keep up a healthy level of consumption? The strength of the economy since the November Budget favours the second scenario. But if the economy is so strong, will not people want higher wages to offset the increased tax burdens and set off a wage-price spiral similar to those that were so familiar in the past? The Bank and Treasury hope that they will not. They have taken comfort from the way in which the inflationary pressures unleashed by sterling's devaluation in September 1992 were absorbed by industry, wholesalers, retailers and employees, and they are hoping that wage pressures will stay subdued after the tax rises because there is still thought to be considerable slack in the economy. It is this slack, or output gap, that has enabled the UK to cut rates at a time when economic growth appears to have risen above its long-term trend rate. The US, where the economy is growing faster and recovery is further advanced than in Britain, last week decided to nudge its short-term interest rates higher by a quarter of a percentage point precisely because it feared the economy was absorbing its slack and might run into inflationary bottlenecks. Yesterday's move is further evidence of the freedom given to the monetary authorities by the pound's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. The UK's rate cut came as the Bundesbank was disappointing hopes of lower German interest rates by leaving its significant 'repo' rate unchanged at 6 per cent. The UK base-rate reduction exerted only moderate downward pressure on the pound and the exchange rate of sterling seems to have played no more than a minor role in the discussions leading up to the interest rate cut. Instead, by timing the cut for the same day as the Bank's inflation report, the authorities were keen to emphasise how interest rate decisions in Britain are now determined primarily by the medium-term inflation outlook. In choosing a day when Mr Clarke left London early on a trip to Paris and Mr George was conferring with fellow central bankers in Basle, they may also have sought to take the drama out of the move. All the signs are that the final decision was finely balanced. The Bank certainly would have opposed a cut of half a percentage point for fear that it might fuel inflation. The quarter-point base rate cut will have little perceptible impact on the UK economy. Indeed, the Halifax Building Society said yesterday that it would not change its borrowing or lending rates following the move. But the rate reduction will reverse a slight tightening of monetary conditions that had arisen because inflation has been more subdued than anticipated since November, so pushing real interest rates higher. In that case it will do no harm.</p>

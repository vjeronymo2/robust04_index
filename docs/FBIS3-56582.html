			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Rough ideas and themes to help formulate letters to the </F> editor, comments, etc. on the Kozyrev statements today"  concerning a continued Russian military presence in states of  the former Soviet Union; "These are not necessarily Estonian  Foreign Ministry positions": "Ideas for Response to Kozyrev" --  received via Internet]    [Text] Big bully terrorizing smaller, weaker neighbors    Russia's image has been seriously hurt by these statements.  The only way for Russia unambiguously to demonstrate its  respect for Estonia's sovereignty and independence is to meet  its international commitments, specifically by meeting the  provisions of the July 1992 CSCE final document in which Russia  pledged to complete the unconditional, rapid and orderly  withdrawal of its troops from Estonian territory.    It is clear from these and previous Russian statements that  Russia does not take continued Baltic independence very  seriously. Baltic independence is viewed as a temporary  annoyance.    [Russian Foreign Minister] Kozyrev has again expressed the  Russian policy of "eminent domain." Balts have long warned about  the practical implications of concepts such as "near abroad,"  "special interests," "sphere of Russian interests for  centuries." When Hitler announced his plans, the world powers  did not take him seriously at first. The West set out on a path  of appeasement which led to world war. Are we really doomed to  repeat history? A bite of Baltics will not fill the bear's  stomach -- it will merely whet his appetite.    Clinton has turned into Bush and Kozyrev turns out to be  Zhirinovskiy.    Kozyrev: "Certain elements in those regions (CIS and  Baltics) constitute a major threat to those (Russian)  interests." Is Kozyrev referring to the democratically elected  governments of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania? Will we now hear  demands for the resignation of some or all of the Baltic leaders  to be replaced by individuals more "friendly" to Russia????  When have we heard things like this before?!?    Russia has not lived up to its international commitments and  obligations, especially on the issue of withdrawing troops  (Helsinki Final Document, 1992). In a form of appeasement, the  West has not exerted enough pressure to bring this about. As a  result, Russia, instead of behaving as a responsible partner in  the world community, is now making expansionistic, destabilizing  threats.    Clinton's message was fuzzy and seemed to allow conditions  to  be attached to troop withdrawal, the Russians have now been  emboldened.    Russia has no real concern for the Russian-speaking  residents  in other nations. Those poor people are merely being used as a  political tool. The tragic aspect to all this is that  resentment may grow against these people since Russian threats  will cause them to be viewed as a potential fifth column  wherever they reside.    IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO MAKE RUSSIA STOP. A CLEAR, SHARP  REACTION FROM THE WEST TO THIS LATEST MOVE WILL MAKE RUSSIA PULL  BACK AND SAY, "NO, NO, YOU'VE MISUNDERSTOOD. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE  MEANT AT ALL."</p>

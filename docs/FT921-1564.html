			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Management (In A Nutshell): On a wing and a prayer Are private investors a more fruitful source of finance for small businesses than the formal venture capital industry? In the US, 'business angels' are thought to provide at least twice as much finance as the venture capital industry, though in the UK, angels are believed to be less active. But evidence that private investors do have an important role to play comes from figures from Venture Capital Report (VCR), a monthly newsletter providing details of opportunities. Of the 1,123 entrepreneurs featured between 1978 and 1990 who provided feedback, 15 per cent received an offer for all the money they sought from a subscriber to the newsletter with a further 10 per cent receiving an offer from another source.

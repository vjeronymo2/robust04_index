			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] London, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Britain and France said  Friday [21 January] that the option of pulling all United  Nations troops out of Bosnia-Herzegovina, possibly as early as  this spring, was being given serious consideration. [passage  omitted]    In other developments Friday, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic hailed an agreement signed Tuesday between Belgrade  and Zagreb to normalize their relations, saying it could be a  turning point in the peace process.    Speaking after returning from Geneva, he said that the  agreement "could serve as a solid base for re-establishing  peace."    "We are ready to take part in a peace process on a new basis  of mutual recognition of former Yugoslav republics which have  already been internationally recognized," he said.    In Bosnia itself the situation was calm on most fronts for a  second successive day, according to officials. UN Protection  Force spokesman Bill Aikman said Thursday had been the calmest  day for months.    However Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said that  Bosnian Moslems were preparing to attack Serb positions across  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    He made the comments in a letter to Greek officials who had  invited him to Athens Friday. He cancelled the trip at the last  minute because of what he called the "new difficulties."    "A vast Moslem attack on all our positions is being  prepared... I must work at the same time for peace and work to  defend my country," he said, excusing himself from the Athens  trip.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT SO MUCH A VICTORY AS THE START OF A LONG RUN;  </P> <P> ABORTION: WE'RE ENTERING A MARATHON OF LEGISLATIVE RACES THAT WILL DETERMINE  WHAT, AND WHO, IS 'MODERATE' ON THIS ISSUE.  </P> <P> After so many bitter losses, winning one tastes sweet. Winning two, even by an  inch, can fuel a real certified sugar rush.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, those who support legal abortion got a taste of that high. In the  first test of political power since the Webster decision came down from the  Supreme Court, pro-choice voters in two governor's races showed that they were  what they have claimed: the majority. They supplied a huge winning margin for  James J. Florio in New Jersey and the razor-slim edge that has L. Douglas  Wilder claiming victory in Virginia.  </P> <P> This was enough to make heads swim. After all, for most of the '80s, common  political wisdom held that abortion was a losing issue. A candidate, the pols  believed, was safer being pro-life than pro-choice. As of Tuesday, that's no  longer true.  </P> <P> The pro-choice forces had spent the decade fighting a rear-guard action in the  courtrooms of America while the pro-life forces were out organizing voters.  Now, in the post-Webster world, they finally began playing on the same field.  And the newcomers look strong.  </P> <P> But before anyone pops open the Champagne bottles, a word of caution: This is  just the beginning.  </P> <P> Abortion politics in America are as volatile as the stock market and as  dizzying as a roller coaster. The current ride began on a downhill run with the  Supreme Court. Next it soared to pro-choice victories in Congress and the  Florida Legislature. These were followed by another duo of downers: two Bush  vetoes in Washington, and the early success of a bill in Pennsylvania that  could severely limit abortion.  </P> <P> Now, out of New Jersey and Virginia comes another upper. But if the pattern  suggests anything, this isn't the last curve. In the end, winning can be as  tough and as close as in Virginia.  </P> <P> Today, says Ethel Klein, a political scientist and marathon poll-watcher, "the  politicians on the defensive are those who have taken the absolutist pro-life  position -- those who took that stand out of political opportunism. The tables  have turned on them and they're trying to unshackle themselves."  </P> <P> On election morning, even George Bush seemed to be loosening the shackles on  Republicans, saying that the party had room for diversity. "Is it (abortion)  the most important issue for me?" he asked aloud. "Absolutely not."  </P> <P> But Americans remain ambivalent about this most personal of public questions.  "It's important to remember that this country is pro-choice but not  pro-abortion," Klein warns. "While society wants to keep abortion safe and  legal, it also wants the number of abortions reduced. And it's willing to put  guidelines around access."  </P> <P> The ride is not just going to go through high-profile gubernatorial races with  their ads and accusations. It's going to pass through the state legislatures  where those guidelines are written. It's going through arguments over the fine  print of dozens of bills staking out a position on such issues as  fetal-viability testing, parental consent and spousal consent.  </P> <P> The most intense struggles will not be about the victims of rape and incest, or  about the rights of minors. They will be about the fate of the majority of  women who have abortions: adults making personal decisions. At what point in  pregnancy, for what reasons and under what conditions will these women have  access to abortion? As the pro-choice poster puts it, "Who decides?"  </P> <P> Tuesday's races, for all the last-minute waffling, were relatively clear  battles between pro-choice and pro-life candidates. The next races may be  murkier.  </P> <P> Politicians will increasingly try to define themselves as speaking for that  pro-choice anti-abortion majority. Among activists, says Frances Kissling, head  of Catholics for a Free Choice, "the race is on to stake out what is moderate.  Where is moderate on the spectrum and how does moderate fit with principles?"  </P> <P> The good news from Tuesday for abortion-rights supporters is that voters  defined the pro-choice view as moderate. In Virginia, the country's first black  elected governor apparently squeaked into office because of his white  opponent's "radical" stand against abortion. During the New Jersey race, five  state legislators saw the light glancing off the front-runner and gave back  their Right-to-Life endorsements.  </P> <P> But these are still early laps on a ride that will reach its peak in the 1990  legislative elections. So a restrained celebration is in order. When it's over,  pass up the sweets of victory and start carbo-loading for a long, long run.  </P></p>

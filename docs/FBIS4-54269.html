			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Banks' Raised Deposit Rates"] </F>   [Text] Even though earlier this week some state-owned  commercial banks such as the BNI [Bank Negara Indonesia --  Indonesian State Bank] and BTN [Bank Tabungan Negara -- State  Savings Bank] raised the interest rates on their deposits, they  promised that the lending rates will not be raised. This was  confirmed by Widigdo Sukarman, president director of BTN, and R.  Syahdeiny, director of BNI, in conjunction with the announcement  on the increase in the interest rates on deposits with maturity  of one to three months by 0.5 percen to 9.5 percent effective 3  May.    Briefing newsmen on Tuesday, the two state banks executives  reiterated that the rise in the deposit rates will not be  accompanied by a rise in the interest rates for credits. This  is because commercial banks have to adjust their deposit rates  to supply and demand conditions in the banking industry. Apart  from that, the national banking industry is burdened with the  task of achieving the credit expansion target to step up  economic development.    It is not easy to maintain the lending rate at the same  level  all the time while the deposit rates tend to increase. This is  because, according to the two bankers, these two types of bank  interests are mutually influencing each other.    However, it is very important for the government to maintain  the banks lending rates in effort to spur economic growth  through the bank credit expansion scheme. As we all know, under  the 1994/95 fiscal year the bank credit expansion is expected to  grow by 18 percent. But now we doubt if the target could be  achieved because of the recent increase in the interest rates on  the deposits.    Lately, several private commercial banks raised the interest  rates on deposits to comply with the development in the foreign  financial market. The rise is linked to the 0.25 percentage  point increase in the U.S. Federal Reserve rate from 3.50  percent to 3.75 percent at the end of March.    Based on the record of the upward trend in the interest  rates  on deposits, several commercial banks last week raised their  deposit rates for short-term maturity. As a matter of fact, the  ABN [Algemene Bank Nederland] had increased the interest rates  to about 0.5 percent point since the end of March on one to  three months deposits and this was followed by Panin Bank and  BDNI [Indonesian State Commercial Bank].    Meanwhile, Bank Aken and Synergy Bank made adjustments to  their deposit rates after banks in Singapore increased their  deposit rates by an average of 0.25 percent. The signs that the  state banks were going to increase the deposit rates were  apparent since the beginning of March.    Observers of development in the foreign monetary system have  anticipated that the bank interest rates will continue to rise  phase by phase. According to their calculation, ideally, the  interest rate on banks deposits should reach 14 percent, and the  interest rate on lending should be about 20 percent.    We feel that the interest rates on long term deposits have  been established, and they are expected to move upward to  reflect the latest development in the financial market.  However, it seems that the rise in the interest rates on banks  deposits in Indonesia is not influenced by the foreign interest  rates. It has been expected that the interest rates on banks  deposits will be increased again in the second quarter of this  year to keep pace with the high inflation rate. We also have  take into consideration the economic and noneconomic factors  that influence the domestic rates. The Bapindo [State National  Development Bank] loan scandal case and the aftermath of the  massive workers' demonstrations in Medan can also be considered  as other influencial factors to the rising country risk  [preceding two words in English].    It is important that the government cautiously supervise the  development of its macroeconomic policy, especially to ensure  that the rate of inflation and the rate of depreciation remain  stable. This is because the inflation rate has a strong  influence on the deposit rates in the banking industry.    The government should create the monetary condition in the  country such that it could be brought back to the position where  it was in the beginning of this year, which would allow for  credit expansion facilities. In this context, we feel that the  monetary authorities should adopt a transparent attitude toward  the current upward trend in the interest rates on banks deposits.</p>

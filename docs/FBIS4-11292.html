			<p>BFN     [Text] A source close to the Haitian Army denies the  accusations brought against Haitian Police Chief Lieutenant  Colonel Joseph Michel Francois. According to the charges, the  police chief has allegedly supported a lucrative drug trade  between Colombia and the United States, through Haiti. Gabriel  Taboana, a former Colombian drug trafficker, asserted before the  Drug Trafficking and Terrorism Subcommission that he met Michel  Francois during a meeting with Pablo Escoblar in (?Colombia).  Former Haitian President Prosper Avril also participated in that  meeting.    The source, who wishes to remain anonymous, pointed out that  Col. Francois' last trip took place in 1981 before... [pauses]  after he was commissioned. He went to the United States for  proficiency courses in security. Since then, he has never gone  abroad. How can Taboana assert that he met Col. Francois in  1984, our source wonders. Remember that upon Col. Francois'  return, he was appointed to the Heavy Vehicles Corps of the  presidential guard at the National Palace.</p>

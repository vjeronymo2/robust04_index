			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Germans back call for EC growth plan GERMANY yesterday supported France in pushing for a European economic growth initiative from the European Community summit in Edinburgh next week - while insisting that it must not come at the expense of monetary stability and strict budgetary control. The finance ministers of both countries also pledged their firm commitment to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, and praised their central banks for their joint efforts to resist currency speculation against the French franc. They said that the existing parity between the D-Mark and the franc was 'fully justified by the economic data of both countries', and clearly implied that they were determined to continue to resist any speculative pressure. The joint declaration by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, and Mr Michel Sapin, his French counterpart, was a key element to emerge from the 60th Franco-German summit in Bonn, which covered the whole gamut of negotiations for the Edinburgh summit. Germany has been less than enthusiastic about the plan for a European growth initiative, and was clearly keen to restrain any suggestion that it should be financed by a big increase in public-sector spending. On the other hand, France has compromised in its EC negotiating position by accepting that enlargement negotiations to bring new members into the community can begin on January 1, even though neither Britain nor Denmark will have ratified the Maastricht treaty by then. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressed after the summit the need for all member states to go to Edinburgh ready to make compromises, and repeated the absolute determination of both France and Germany to press ahead steadily in their joint ambition of building an integrated 'European union'. The finance ministers said that any growth initiative must be in conformity with the economic convergence criteria of the member states, which include strict limits on public debt and budget deficits, as well as inflation. The initiative should concentrate on stimulation of investment activity, including both infrastructure spending and house-building. The ministers said that the European Investment Bank and a European Investment Fund could play an important role, as well as the 'rapid realisation' of the proposed cohesion fund to promote economic development in the weaker EC economies. Mr Kohl expressed his confidence that another important Franco-German initiative, the creation of a Euro-corps for joint defence, was gaining acceptance by other Nato member states. Nato's supreme allied commander in Europe, General John Shalikashvili, and the chiefs of the defence staffs in France and Germany, will begin talks on Monday to decide the precise relationship between the proposed Euro-corps and Nato, according to Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister. They have to reconcile the need for German troops in the corps to be subject to Nato inspections in peacetime, while French troops, not assigned to Nato, will remain independent. Mr Kohl said: 'All the reservations and aversions to this project have been systematically dropped, and the whole thing is now getting much more positive marks from our partners. 'This is true not just for this side of the Atlantic, but also for the other side.' Both France and Germany say the future corps, with a headquarters in Strasbourg, is 'an element in the process of building European union which will include, eventually, a policy of common defence. The European corps also constitutes. . . a contribution to the reinforcement of the European pillar of the (Nato) alliance and its common defence.'</p>

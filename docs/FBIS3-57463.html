			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Aleksandr Khandruyev, the deputy </F> chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, by announcer Yelena  Platonova; from the "Time for Business People" program -- live]    [Text] [Platonova] The resignation of the principal  reformers of the Russian economy, Yegor Gaydar and Boris  Fedorov, may be regarded as the main event of last week. Bowing  out as deputy prime minister and finance minister, Boris Fedorov  said that the new government of production fetishists would lead  the economy to financial collapse in the very near future. We  have asked today's guest, Aleksandr Khandruyev, to comment on  this pronouncement.    [Khandruyev] It does not really matter whether Boris  Grigoryevich [Fedorov] has resigned or not. It seems to me  quite simply unethical for a man who has done his utmost to  trigger off this financial and budgetary collapse to talk about  financial collapse. This is because the budget system is  disintegrating. Nobody wants to accept responsibility for what I  would call the restoration of a normal tax system, and the  collection of taxes and revenue. We have already learned the  preliminary results of 1993. They show that the Central Bank has  kept all its commitments to the IMF, as expressed in the joint  statement with the government, except for one. For technical  reasons we were unable to hold a credit auction, although we  have already adopted regulations on this auction. Our problem  now is simply to free up funds that can be sold at a credit  auction. But we have kept all our pledges.    Credit injected into our economy has not exceeded the  imposed  ceiling. On the contrary, savings have been made. So where  have we failed? In only one area -- the budget deficit.    [Platonova] Aleksandr Andreyevich, brokers are not confident  that the Central Bank has sufficient hard currency at its  disposal. Are they wrong?    [Khandruyev] When the Central Bank and the Russian  Federation  Government signed a joint declaration on economic policy on 24  May last year, we undertook not to maintain the ruble exchange  rate by artificial means. However, at the same time, we said  that we would use our hard currency reserves to influence the  range within which it would fluctuate. We have abided by this  commitment. We saw our main objective as being to prevent  abrupt collapses or rises in the ruble rate. Generally  speaking, the situation has never got out of control during the  last one-and-a-half, two years.    However, the situation that came about at the beginning of  1994 was a result of a coming together of numerous factors --  the break between trading sessions [during New Year and  Christmas holidays], and the fact that the ruble exchange rate  really was too high for a situation in which domestic prices  continued to increase. Exports became unprofitable.  Furthermore, as I have already said, the hard currency market  is still very fragile, very delicate. It influences all sorts  of unexpected factors. The possibility that there are certain  players on the currency exchange who took concerted action to  bring about a sharp fall in the ruble exchange rate cannot be  ruled out. In these circumstances the Central Bank has done its  utmost to make sure that this process does not become a collapse  and to keep the situation under control.    [Platonova] Our next question to Aleksandr Khandruyev is as  follows: What, in the Central Bank's view, are the reasons for  the slump in output?    [Khandruyev] Well, first and foremost, I would like to agree  with my eminent colleague, Igor Sergeyevich Korolev [deputy  director of the Institute of World Economy]. I know him well.  I agree with his assessment of the factors that are causing,  provoking the slump. The Central Bank reckons that the slump is  the result of a macroeconomic sickness throughout the economy.  The slump is, generally speaking, a natural reaction to the  excessively rigid conditions, the structure of the Russian  economy, and the impact of budgetary and credit restrictions.  It would be simply stupid to think that one could use monetary,  budgetary regulators to push through industrial and, in general,  structural policies.    When this collapse assumed universal proportions, it became  clear that you cannot shell out for everything. Therefore,  somebody must accept responsibility for doing the dirty work.  If you cannot sustain all areas of production, you must decide  which are the most promising and efficient enterprises and  sub-industries. This is precisely where you should invest  money. The rest must be given time to modernize themselves or  to diversify, or else face closure. So much has been said in our  country about bankruptcy, but not a single one of the reformers  has been willing to take responsibility for initiating the first  bankruptcy, even as an example of what should be done -- even  though they have been going on about this ever since the  beginning of last year.    [Platonova] Aleksandr Andreyevich, what does the Central  Bank  intend to do about GMM [Global Money Management, Inc.]?    [Khandruyev] First and foremost, I would like to agree with  my GMM colleague and his view of the article by Mikhail Leontyev  in the newspaper SEGODNYA. A real, self-respecting boxer never  hits below the belt. But my esteemed GMM colleague is mistaken.  Certain banking operations can, in fact, be transacted by a  non-banking institution. But, whatever happens, these  non-banking institutions must obtain a licence to transact the  range of operations listed in the Law on Banks and Banking in  the Russian Federation.    A mistake was made right at the start. When the GMM firm  registered itself, the organization that registered it should  have read through its rules. These rules mention operations  that come under the Law on Banking. Before issuing a  certificate of registration, this organization should have asked  for a banking licence. However, this question is not worth the  candle. It would have been enough for the GMM firm to apply to  the Central Bank and it would have received this licence --  provided, of course, all the documents were in order. Then none  of this fuss, so to speak, would ever have happened.</p>

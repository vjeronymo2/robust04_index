			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hopewell to create power unit HOPEWELL Holdings, the Hong Kong-listed property and infrastructure group, is to create a separately listed company for its power plant operations, which will have an initial stock market value of HKDollars 12.75bn (USDollars 1.65bn). Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA) will become the holding company for all Hopewell's power generation projects. Hopewell was the first Hong Kong company to construct a power station in China and it has expanded this business into the Philippines. It has completed three projects with a combined capacity of 1,010MW, and is constructing two more plants which would add a further 2,715MW. CEPA is to issue HKDollars 8bn of partly-paid shares to the parent company, and a further HKDollars 4.7bn of shares to outside investors, including Hopewell's largest shareholder Mr Gordon Wu and Mr Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong group. Peregrine International, the parent of the listed financial services group, and the large Japanese trading group Kanemaru will also take minority stakes. The public offer will be valued at around HKDollars 1.5bn, based on the projected issue price of HKDollars 10 a share. The Hopewell group's own share placement will be issued on a partly-paid basis, but assuming full subscription, it will control 63 per cent of the new company. The capital raising will enable the group to fund an aggressive expansion programme. The company claimed that 'a separate listing of CEPA will enable investors to assess the business of the CEPA Group and the other business of the Hopewell Group independently which, in the opinion of the directors of the company, will enhance the market rating of the Hopewell Group'.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFORESTATION, TRAFFIC;  </P> <P> FAST GROWTH: NEW TROUBLE IN STEEL TOWN  </P> <P> Environmental change -- from polluted streams to congested highways and  overdeveloped land -- is affecting the quality of life across the nation. Such  change is gradual and often goes unnoticed while it happens.  </P> <P>  To measure how various areas have been affected over the decades, The Times  dispatched reporters to the places they grew up. This occasional series of  articles examines how our hometown environments have been altered -- for better  or for worse.  </P> <P>  Each year at Christmastime, a star 81 feet high shines from its perch high on  South Mountain, the southern anchor of this steel town founded by German  immigrants on Christmas Eve nearly 250 years ago.  </P> <P> For tourists, the star symbolizes the religious Bethlehem, the nation's  self-proclaimed Christmas City. But wooded South Mountain, rising from gritty  neighborhoods near the rusty steel plant, has come to represent a less renowned  Bethlehem -- the one that survived a brush with economic ruin and now is  grappling with the consequences of its recovery.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Freeway Access  </P> <P> This fall, as the area marks five years of economic good times since the steel  industry's near-collapse, a four-lane freeway that slices south of the city is  to open. For the first time, South Mountain and its quiet foothills will be  exposed to development.  </P> <P> Builders are clearing patches of the mountainside and nearby flatlands for  houses and condominiums as they rush to cash in on an anticipated surge in  commuters to neighboring New Jersey and New York City. One proposal calls for  felling 500 trees to make way for luxury houses. Another ambitious plan  envisions a suburban mini-city that would cover 1,700 acres and employ 25,000  people over the next 30 years.  </P> <P> The environmental fallout of rapid growth -- well known in Southern California  -- is new and troubling to residents of Bethlehem and the surrounding Lehigh  Valley. For decades, environmental problems here meant having to rewash laundry  soiled on the clothesline by dust from blast furnaces, or avoiding the Lehigh  River because of waste water from the mills.  </P> <P> For many residents, pollution was never a serious concern. Indeed, it was  customary to look the other way, since the primary source of dirty air and  water was also the primary source of employment.  </P> <P> "When I was a kid, my mother took her clothes (from the clothesline) three  times a day and washed them because of the dust -- red dust . . ." said E.  (Chico) Curzi, a 57-year-old union leader who followed his father, uncles and  grandfather to work in the Bethlehem Steel mills. "But she didn't complain,  because her husband worked. It provided food on the table for her children."  </P> <P> Today, bulldozers and cement trucks have displaced smokestacks and discharge  pipes as the tools of environmental damage -- and residents are taking notice.  With the federal government on its heels, Bethlehem Steel has spent more than  $100 million on pollution-control equipment over the last 30 years. Scrubbers,  massive cooling towers and bag houses -- the equivalent of huge vacuum cleaners  -- have made air pollution from the steel plant a "non-issue," in the words of  one local environmentalist.  </P> <P> Attention has turned to the building frenzy that extends far beyond South  Mountain and the path of the new freeway, in the works for 20 years as an  alternative to the antiquated and hazardous Lehigh Valley Thruway.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lessons of Los Angeles  </P> <P> "I would hope that we would learn from L.A.'s mistakes," said Alfred Siess Jr.,  a former Bethlehem Steel engineer once assigned to the company's Torrance  office, who fought to block the new I-78 highway. "Freeways proliferate  development. They are a losing proposition for those of us who want to stay  here because of (the area's) rural character, clean air and clean water."  </P> <P> In a recent letter to a local newspaper, Elizabeth Winters, who lives in a  small town south of the mountain, wrote: "Who wants to see the bare or  developed hillsides of California here? Hasn't tearing up the landscape for  I-78 been enough?"  </P> <P> Local experts attribute the boom in part to a realignment of the region's  economy away from smokestack industries such as Bethlehem Steel and Mack Trucks  in nearby Allentown. The steel company, for example, employed 20,000 people at  the start of this decade but now provides only about 5,300 jobs.  </P> <P> New employment has emerged in light manufacturing, data processing, insurance  and medical services as industrial parks and suburban offices have become the  "clean factories" of the 1980s and 1990s. Taken as a single entity, Lehigh  Valley Industrial Park Inc., a nonprofit group that operates four industrial  parks, would be the region's largest employer, with 210 businesses providing  9,000 jobs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> High Employment Rate  </P> <P> "In 1983, the pot just started to get warm, and the high burner has been on  ever since," said Grover H. Stainbrook Jr., the company's executive vice  president. "Five years ago, we had unemployment of 13%. We now have 3.9%."  </P> <P> Stainbrook and others attribute much of the growth -- both commercial and  residential -- to a steady migration of businesses and residents out of New  Jersey, which lies across the Delaware River about 10 miles from downtown  Bethlehem. Local real estate agents say the newcomers -- some of whom drive 100  miles to work in New York City -- are attracted by relatively affordable  housing, lower taxes, good schools and a low crime rate.  </P> <P> "They pop on the bus at 5 in the morning and come back home at 7 in the  evening," said Kenard O. Natter, a Bethlehem real estate agent who has sold  houses to Wall Street stockbrokers, bank executives and corporate officials.  "Our buses have gotten very sophisticated. They are nicer than most of the  aircraft. You get on there and read your paper, and by (the) time you are  finished . . . you are in New York City."  </P> <P> One local government study estimated that 20% of property transactions in the  eastern half of the Lehigh Valley involved buyers moving from New Jersey. A  private survey conducted by Bethlehem economist Kamran Afshar concluded that  37% of new homeowners in the region were from outside the area.  </P> <P> "As soon as we drove here, we basically fell in love with it," said John  Francis, a helicopter pilot who moved to Bethlehem from Princeton, N.J., and  for two years commuted more than 90 minutes to work in New York City before  taking a local job.  </P> <P> "I had this preconceived idea of a 1930s steel town, but it wasn't anything  like that," he said. "It was well taken care of, orderly and clean. And it was  a much better deal for your money. Taxes are cheaper and automobile insurance  is about half of what you pay in New Jersey."  </P> <P> Thanks to immigrants such as Francis and his family, population in the Lehigh  Valley has grown almost 4% since 1980. It is a two-county region of about  500,000 people that includes the cities of Bethlehem, Allentown and Easton as  well as several dozen townships and boroughs. Overall population in  Pennsylvania, meanwhile, has risen just 0.2%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Taking Toll on Environment  </P> <P> The area's new popularity, while providing jobs and economic vitality, has  taken its toll on the environment:  </P> <P>  -- Deforestation on South Mountain has led to calls for limits on tree  removal, and some residents are beginning to worry about environmental damage  from new and proposed access roads on the south slope and nearby flatlands.  </P> <P>  -- Development has pushed some local roads to their limit and brought traffic  problems to previously uncongested areas. Developers are being asked to pay for  traffic studies, and some local governments are considering charging them for  road improvements. In a recent public opinion survey, respondents listed  worsening traffic congestion as the No. 1 drawback of economic recovery.  </P> <P>  -- Bethlehem has refused to extend water mains to new housing in its  fastest-growing suburb because the city's system is so overextended that it  cannot deliver enough water during hours of peak demand. A college that hoped  to build a dormitory was told it must provide its own water or wait until a new  municipal water tank can be constructed.  </P> <P>  -- Dwindling landfill space and soaring trash-disposal costs led several years  ago to establishment of a local waste authority, which sought to build a  $180-million incinerator. The proposal, opposed by environmental groups because  of pollution concerns, collapsed early this year, leaving each city to deal  with its own trash crisis. Bethlehem has a landfill it recently expanded, but  Allentown must haul its garbage hundreds of miles out of state.  </P> <P>  -- Four of the 13 public sewage systems in the Lehigh Valley have average  daily flows that exceed design capacity, and three others are approaching their  limits.  </P> <P>  -- Concerned about water shortages, the Delaware River Basin Commission has  proposed that low-flush toilets be required in all new buildings and renovation  projects, beginning in 1991.  </P> <P> "We are benefiting economically from the tremendous influx of people from New  Jersey and New York, but it is also a challenge to provide the infrastructure  for them," Bethlehem Mayor Kenneth Smith said. "Probably the greatest challenge  in government today is to continue to grow economically yet preserve the  quality of life, the green space and the quality of our water and air."  </P> <P> If the development trend continues, most of rural Lehigh Valley will be urban  or suburban by 2011, a recent government study predicted. Between 1982 and  1986, about 6,800 acres of vacant or agricultural land was developed,  two-thirds of it for housing. In 1987, 2,625 housing units were built and 4,103  lots were approved for subdivision, a record high.  </P> <P> The demand has pushed land prices so high that about half a dozen rural  townships have established "security areas" to protect farms from the  residential invasion. At the county level, farmers get a tax break if they  agree not to develop their land. Statewide, voters recently approved a  $100-million bond issue to purchase development rights from farmers.  </P> <P> "Everywhere you go, you'll see a flag or a stake in the field," said Roslyn  Kahler, who farms about 400 acres with his two sons and also heads the  Northampton County Conservation Service, which reviews subdivisions for erosion  control. "In the past few years, farm values north of Bethlehem have gone from  $2,000 an acre up to $10,000 and $15,000 an acre. . . . When the time is ripe,  it is being sold."  </P> <P> A public opinion survey conducted last year by the Joint Planning Commission, a  regional agency for the Lehigh Valley, found widespread concern about  disappearing farmland. Agricultural land being developed should be kept as  farms, 72% of the respondents said. About half of those people said the most  important reason for preserving the land was to retain open space.  </P> <P> In outlying parts of the Lehigh Valley, where the suburbs meet the country,  farmers and their neighbors in new housing tracts have at times found  coexistence difficult. Urban escapees seeking the peaceful life complain about  manure odors, flies, dead animals and wild plants that aggravate their  allergies.  </P> <P> Farmers, meanwhile, become enraged when teen-agers use their fields as race  tracks for all-terrain vehicles and dirt bikes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Newcomers' Complaints  </P> <P> "These Jersey people come in here and they try to tell the people who have  lived here for a long time what to do," said Kahler, the farmer and  conservationist. "They want open space, but they don't want you to spray (for  pests). They don't want you to spread manure. You know, it smells. . . . Hey,  if you want to live out here, put up with it!"  </P> <P> Farmers have also had run-ins with local government. School officials in a  rural township southwest of Bethlehem, anticipating rising enrollment, want to  build a high school on a 108-acre farm, but the family doesn't want to sell the  property. The district has condemned the farm and now is fighting for the land  in court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Schools  </P> <P> "Our community is preparing schools for people who don't even live here," said  Ollie Orth, president and founder of the Lehigh-South Mountain Woodlands Assn.  and a slow-growth candidate for county commissioner. "It is a self-fulfilling  prophecy. If you provide more school capacity than you need right now, you will  fill it by attracting people, especially from New Jersey."  </P> <P> Even within the city limits of Bethlehem, small family farms that survived past  building booms are being devoured by residential neighborhoods. A horse farm on  Butztown Road on the north side of town has been replaced by luxury  condominiums. Less than a mile away, a cornfield hidden behind a convenience  store and gas station has met the same fate.  </P> <P> The alarming loss of farmland inspired one group of determined historians and  environmentalists to rally the community to save six acres of one of  Bethlehem's earliest farms as a memorial to the city's agrarian past. Lehigh  County purchased the farm and turned it over to a nonprofit group.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Historic Plantation Saved  </P> <P> The Burnside Plantation, now sandwiched between a rusty paint mill and a  21-story office tower, was the Colonial homestead of James Burnside, who was  elected the area's first legislator in 1752. It once spanned 500 acres and was  tilled by Bethlehem's original religious settlers. The original stone  farmhouse, built in 1748, is still standing, and the preservationists plan to  move a 150-year-old barn nearby. The barn was donated by AT&amp;T, which  disassembled it to make way for a 450,000-square-foot research facility west of  the city.  </P> <P> "Kids nowadays don't know where chickens come from," said Gertrude Fox, a  73-year-old environmental activist who three years ago came up with the idea of  saving the plantation. "They think they come from the freezer. So we will have  teaching facilities here. This will be our last chance. It will be the last  farm left in the three cities."  </P> <P> There have been other environmental success stories here. Residents near  Monocacy Creek, in north Bethlehem, have monitored development to protect the  stream from runoff. Their efforts paid off when the state fish commission  designated it as a trophy trout stream. Several Lehigh Valley communities are  moving forward with curb-side trash-recycling programs in response to a state  recycling law that goes into effect in two years. And, last year, the Delaware  and Lehigh canals were designated a National Heritage Corridor so that they  will be preserved for recreational use.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Valley Has Awakened  </P> <P> Even so, the face and character of Bethlehem and its neighbors are changing  swiftly, and longtime residents recognize that the once-sleepy Lehigh Valley,  for better or worse, has awakened for good.  </P> <P> "You can't hardly find a place any more that isn't built up," said Ethel  Hunsicker, who has worked for 36 years at Yeager's Pharmacy on Main Street in  Hellertown, a tiny suburb of Bethlehem where the new freeway is expected to  dump much of its traffic.  </P> <P> "Sometimes it just isn't as friendly any more, but I don't think I would ever  want to move out. I don't think I could get used to another place."  </P></p>

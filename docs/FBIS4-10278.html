			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 8 Apr (AFP)--It has been officially  disclosed that for the very first time the Venezuelan Air Force  today used war planes to bomb several clandestine landing strips  used by garimpeiros [Brazilian gold seekers] in the southernmost  part of the country.    Defense Minister General Angel Montero Revette said after a  meeting with President Rafael Caldera that Tucano airplanes and  ultramodern F-16 fighter bombers destroyed the landing strips  with war bombs "to prevent the garimpeiros from violating  national sovereignty."    Although Montero did not disclose how many airplanes were  used or landing strips destroyed, he said that reconnaissance  efforts had been conducted previously by land in Sierra de  Parima and Delgado Chalbaud hill, over 1,100 km south of Caracas  and virtually on the Brazilian border.    The minister stressed that these actions were coordinated  with the Brazilian Armed Forces.    Government sources have disclosed that the Army and  militarized National Guard also participated in the operation.    A week ago National Guard troops clashed with a group of  garimpeiros. One of the gold seekers was killed, two were  captured, and four managed to escape.</p>

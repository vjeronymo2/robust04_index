			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Barr &amp; WAT A jump in profits in the motor distribution side enabled Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust to cushion losses in its leisure and holiday division. In the half year ended June 30 pre-tax profit fell from a restated Pounds 991,000 to Pounds 663,000, on turnover down to Pounds 108.2m (Pounds 110.5m). Earnings per share were 3.5p (5.2p) but the interim dividend is unchanged at 3p. However, Mr Malcolm Barr, chairman, expressed confidence that full year results would be similar to last year's, when a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.7m was reported.</p>

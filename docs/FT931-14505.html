			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: Reverting to old-fashioned policies - The proposed flotation of Independent Insurance NOBODY has managed to float a UK general insurance company in more than 20 years, but the backers of Independent Insurance will try this spring. The timing might seem surprising. After three years of record losses, general insurers are not exactly flavour of the month among investors. Many companies have been forced either to withdraw from or scale back their involvement in the London insurance market, from which the Independent draws about 30 per cent of its income. One reason is that they have been unable to raise capital to support their businesses. Yet in the six years since it was bought by the New Scotland Group from Allstate, the US insurance group, the 88-year-old Independent has won something of a reputation for bucking industry trends. At a time when some illustrious rivals have recorded their worst losses, Independent has consistently made profits. Growth has been financed partly from internal resources, while shareholders have also been tapped. It raised Pounds 10m, for example, in a rights issue earlier this month. Premiums have grown by more than 400 per cent since 1987, reaching an estimated Pounds 130m in 1992. New Scotland Group, formed by a group of Scottish businessmen with the backing of institutional investors, such as 3i, County NatWest and Foreign &amp; Colonial, has seen the value of its original investment of Pounds 15m nearly double. Four senior managers - Mr Michael Bright, Mr Robert McCracken, Mr Philip Condon and Mr Alan Clarke - all recruited by New Scotland's founders, as well as 170 staff, who together own 8 per cent of the company, have seen the value of their shares rise. Since 1991, Independent has been listed on the stock exchange under 535 rules, where trading is conducted on a matched bargain basis. It is now making the move to a full listing, making its shares more marketable and easing its access to fresh capital. Life assurance, brokers, subsidiaries of foreign companies and the household appliance insurer, Domestic &amp; General, have all obtained listings in recent years, but Independent will be the first general insurer to float for as long as most analysts and brokers can remember. Detractors attribute the company's success to a policy of under-reserving against claims that might emerge in the future. It is a charge that Mr Bright, the company's managing director, vigorously denies. He says that the reserves are low compared with the industry, but this reflects Independent's superior underwriting. Mr McCracken, general manager, says Independent pays claims more speedily than its competitors. 'Our reserves have been more than adequate. You may be able to get away with it for a year or two but it would be impossible to do this for more than six years.' Instead, Mr McCracken and Mr Bright insist that the reasons for the company's success are relatively simple. On the one hand, it has taken a fresh look at traditional management structures and technology. On the other, it has rigorously adhered to conservative underwriting disciplines and tightly controlled distribution, Compared with its bigger and slower moving rivals, Independent has been quick to introduce a less bureaucratic management structure. Pay has been closely linked to performance and it has done without at least two layers of middle management, providing for quicker communication and more efficiency. Expenses have stayed relatively high. Operating costs reached 43.2 per cent of net premium income in 1990, above the industry average. That figure included heavy expenditure on new technology and has fallen to 37 per cent in the first nine months of 1992. Mr McCracken acknowledges that because of its approach to staff and training, the company will inevitably have relatively high expenses. But he says the effect has been offset by a more disciplined approach to underwriting and much better underwriting figures. Independent has eschewed the rush for market share, which was highly fashionable among UK insurance companies as they adjusted to the more competitive markets of the late-1980s. Instead it has been selective about the risks it underwrites, concentrating its business with a small group of brokers and spending more of its resources on examining and surveying the risks it underwrites. 'Market share is irrelevant. While many other insurers have dispensed with surveyors and other expensive technical staff, the Independent employs 50 surveyors and insists on carrying out its own detailed surveys of the factories and offices which it insures. 'We survey every single commercial risk before it goes on the books,' says Mr McCracken. 'It's an old-fashioned discipline. Thirty years ago no UK company would have dreamed of doing things any differently.'</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: French, German insurers bring end to hostilities AACHENER und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second-largest insurance group, and Assurances Generales de France (AGF), one of France's biggest insurance groups, yesterday reached a surprise accord after months of bitter hostilities. The companies announced they had reached agreement over voting rights attached to AGF's stake in AMB, giving it full voting strength. AMB's management previously has refused to recognise the full voting rights on AGF's holding - as it is entitled to do under German company law - prompting legal action from the French company. AGF's stake will be limited to 25 per cent plus one vote. Hostilities were set to come to a head at AMB's annual meeting in Aachen on Tuesday next week, at which AGF had intended to launch a series of challenges to the German company. Yesterday, AGF said it would drop its legal actions and abandon its opposition to the AMB board at the forthcoming AGM. The agreement is also set to pave the way to bring in Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, as a majority shareholder in BfG Bank, Germany's sixth-largest private commercial bank. This is at present majority-owned by AMB and has been a substantial drain on AMB's resources since it bought its stake for DM1.9bn in 1987. AGF and AMB will implement a co-operation agreement first negotiated in 1990 but never put into effect because of AMB's insistence that the agreement was a barely-disguised bid for management control. A joint press release insisted that the agreement would not lead to the unscrambling of AMB's existing co-operation agreement with Fondiaria of Italy and Royal Insurance of the UK. They said they would do everything in their power to make sure that Credit Lyonnais would take a majority stake in the bank by the beginning of next year - thus giving the French bank access to the German banking market and relieving AMB of further financial strains. Together with BGAG, the trades union holding company which owns the remainder of BfG's shares, AMB has injected DM1.5bn (Dollars 980m) into the bank since the purchase and has recently indicated that a further DM950m will be needed before the bank is able to stand on its own feet in 1994. Another large French insurer, Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), is still locked in talks with Suez, the French industrial group, over its attempt to expand into Germany. UAP hopes to swap its shares in Victoire, a Suez insurance subsidiary, for a 50 per cent stake in Colonia, the German insurer that Victoire controls.</p>

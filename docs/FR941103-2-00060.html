			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western has made a conscientious effort to provide all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the information needed to develop the purchased power expense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis in a timely manner. Western's staff has provided explanations to customers and their consultants and are available and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> willing to provide additional clarification as needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Future Flow Restrictions at Glen Canyon Dam  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A large customer organization expressed concern that Western has overstated revenues of $3 to $8 million per year from short-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity sales through 2004.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is improbable that flows restricted for environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons will ever again provide enough firm power from the Glen Canyon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unit to reach levels used in past power projections. Western does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> know which of many possible flow regimes will finally be imposed at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Glen Canyon Unit. The treatment of short-term sales has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the firm power assumptions. Therefore, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impossible to modify power projections for the proposed rate adjustment to recognize the reduced power output. The only course of action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western is able to follow is to stay with historic power projection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figures, using the methodology already used in previous processes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until the Glen Canyon regime is finally determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western will evaluate the firm power rate then in place when the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow regimes from the Glen Canyon Dam are decided. If it is needed, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firm power rate adjustment will be proposed then.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An organization of several customers stated:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While it is understood that a degree of uncertainty surrounds the exact level of flows at Glen Canyon, Western  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should conduct a sensitivity analysis predicated on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative flow assumptions identified in the Operation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Glen Canyon Dam Environmental Impact Statement. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitivity analysis (sic) would give customers a range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible replacement power costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western has done extensive analyses of the power and rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of every flow regime identified for study in the GCD&hyph;EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Detailed descriptions of the studies and their results are reported in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the draft GCD&hyph;EIS, and will be contained in the final GCD&hyph;EIS when it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is published.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the meantime, Western is specifically required, by law and by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation, to use known or statistically probable estimates of future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity in creating rates. The level of uncertainty still existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the GCD&hyph;EIS prevents the use of any of its data at this time. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is noted above, when a decision about environmentally related flows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through Glen Canyon Dam is made, a revised PRS will be prepared, and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new rate will be proposed, if needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. O&amp;M-Related Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Western O&amp;M:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CREDA signed an agreement with Western and Reclamation dated September 24, 1992, which states:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western shall utilize the Work Program Information made available to its Customers by Western and Reclamation (including adjustments thereof which may result from reviews, from internal corrections or the dispute resolution process provided for in these Joint Procedures but excluding the costs of future transmission system additions in a Planning Year or Out Year which are conceptual in nature), to prepare the power repayment studies upon which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it relies to promulgate any interim or final rates proposed or adopted for SLCAIP firm power or transmission services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several customers and their member organizations are concerned about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the implementation of the 1992 Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (1) Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (One commentor) continues to be concerned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Western's inconsistent use of budgeted information in the preparation of the PRS . . . (the commentor) has been some-what frustrated in its attempts in this rate adjustment process to reconcile certain information used in the 1994 Rate Brochure PRS with the information previously provided in the Work Program review process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FY 1995 Work Program is merely a copy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed FY 1994 Congressional Budget Submission. It was used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the starting point in planning expenditures for the FY 1995  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> congressional budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CREDA's September 1992 agreement with Western and Reclamation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allows power customers to have meaningful input to the new congressional budget. However, this work program document is prepared too early in the planning process for either customers or Western to say that no further changes will be made. Western feels that the timing and use of documents stated in the agreement should be revisited. Western is willing to continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to work with the customers in improving the budget and work plan review process in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

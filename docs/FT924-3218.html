			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Plea bargaining 'favoured by most judges' NEARLY 90 per cent of bar-risters and two thirds of judges favour a formal system of plea bargaining, a survey of Crown Court trials by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice has indicated. The study, based on questionnaires sent to participants in every Crown Court trial in England and Wales during the last two weeks of February, found almost universal approval for the jury system. Little evidence was found of jurors being unable to understand evidence, although judges, barristers and defence solicitors said they had been surprised by the jury's verdict in about 15 per cent of cases. The police and the Crown Prosecution Service said they were surprised by the verdict in about 25 per cent of cases. The police found half of all acquittals surprising but thought that only 8 per cent of jury decisions were inexplicable in the light of the evidence. In 53 cases heard during the two weeks the defence barrister voiced concern that an innocent defendant had pleaded guilty either in the hope of getting a discount on sentence or a reduction in the indictment. Grossed up, this would mean that there were more than 1,000 such inconsistent pleaders in Crown Courts each year. Seventy per cent of defendants who pleaded guilty said they had committed the offence charged and a further 17 per cent said they had committed a similar offence. But 13 per cent claimed not to have committed the offence for which they had pleaded guilty. Prosecution barristers thought in 67 guilty-plea cases that the defendant would have stood a fair chance of being acquitted if he or she had pleaded not guilty. Grossed up, that would mean 1,700 such cases a year. In 89 cases, equivalent to well over 2,000 cases a year, the prosecution barrister thought the case was too weak and should not have been brought. Judges felt there were 116 (more than 3,000 a year) cases which were too weak. The survey results were presented in London last night by Professor Michael Zander, a member of the Royal Commission. Prof Zander said he was unable to comment on the findings until the Commission reported next summer. Howeverm, he offered the tentative view that the results might mean that the system was working better than had been first thought.</p>

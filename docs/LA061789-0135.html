			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FROM LIDO ISLE TO BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> IRS WILL OFFER 18 SEIZED PROPERTIES AT AUCTION  </P> <P> It is not everyone's favorite government agency, and most people, most of the  time, want as little as possible to do with it.  </P> <P> But on June 28, the Internal Revenue Service will make it possible for a  handful of people to pick up residential properties in Orange County at what  may be bargain-basement prices.  </P> <P> The IRS is holding a public auction of 18 properties -- ranging from a  multimillion-dollar oceanfront home on Lido Island to a 1,450-square-foot  condominium in Buena Park -- that have been seized from people who owe back  taxes.  </P> <P> It is only the second large public auction held by the IRS in Orange County.  And to avoid some of the problems that cropped up at the first one in March,  the agency is conducting a pre-auction seminar on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Both the seminar and the auction will be held at the Santa Ana Police  Department Annex auditorium, 23 Civic Center Drive.  </P> <P> "The first time we packaged a bunch of properties for a mass auction like this,  we had 209 registered bidders," said IRS spokeswoman Sally Ruhnau. "A lot of  them were first-timers, and they had a lot of questions and it took a long time  to get through it."  </P> <P> Among the information to be covered at the seminar, Ruhnau said, are the  mechanics of the auction, tips on checking out the properties and rules of the  game.  </P> <P> Those rules are pretty important.  </P> <P> For example, the IRS doesn't guarantee that the property is vacant, and the  successful bidder is responsible for any evicting that must be done.  </P> <P> In several cases, only one owner's interest in a jointly owned property is  being auctioned. The successful bidders for those properties will own only a  percentage of the homes (usually half), and others -- a spouse or a business  partner -- will retain ownership of the rest. It is helpful in that case for  prospective bidders to make a pre-auction arrangement with the other party,  Ruhnau said.  </P> <P> One important rule is that while the winning bidder is not responsible for  taxes owned to the IRS, he or she does assume responsibility for all other  liens and mortgages against the property. But those bills should be factored  into the bid, Ruhnau said.  </P> <P> For example, one of the properties to be auctioned is in an area where  comparable homes sell for $400,000 or more. In addition to the IRS lien on the  property -- which bidders don't have to worry about and which isn't disclosed  -- there are two mortgages with a total balance of $247,758, plus a California  Franchise Tax Board lien of $10,342 and two lawsuit judgments totaling $90,163.  </P> <P> That adds up to a total debt of $348,263 that the successful bidder will have  to pay off. An interested bidder should subtract at least that much from the  market value in figuring how much to offer for the house, Ruhnau advised.  </P> <P> To identify existing mortgages and liens, she said, the IRS runs a title search  and publishes the results but does not guarantee the accuracy of the search.  </P> <P> "So we will teach people how to do their own title search as well," IRS  spokeswoman Judith Golden said.  </P> <P> One other rule that is nice to know: the debtor, by law, can buy the property  back up to 180 days from the date of the auction by repaying the successful  bidder the price paid at auction, plus 20% annual interest and all other costs  incurred by the bidder.  </P> <P> The IRS obtains the homes in seizure actions against people who have not paid  back-tax bills.  </P> <P> Most IRS tax liens don't result in seizures, Ruhnau said. But some people who  get into tax trouble have borrowed so much against their homes that even in  Southern California's strong real estate market they cannot clear enough by  selling the properties to pay off all their debts and the IRS as well.  </P> <P> That, she said, is when they let the IRS seize the property and sell it to help  pay back taxes.  </P> <P> In the March auction, Golden said, winning bids for the 20 properties offered  ranged from $30,000 to $200,000. She said the IRS sets a minimum bid that is  based in part on the market value of the property, less liens and mortgages.  </P> <P> Winning bidders at the June 28 auction are required to make at 20% down payment  that same day and must pay the balance by 1 p.m. July 5, Ruhnau said.  </P> <P> The auction itself will begin at 11 a.m., but bidder registration begins at  9:30.  </P> <P> Photographs and physical descriptions of the properties to be auctioned are  posted in the lobbies of the IRS offices at the Federal Building in the Santa  Ana Civic Center and at the Chet Holifield Federal Building in Laguna Niguel,  she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PROPERTIES TO BE AUCTIONED  </P> <P> Properties in the June 28 Internal Revenue Service auction in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> BIG BEAR LAKE  </P> <P> 42713 Moonridge Road.

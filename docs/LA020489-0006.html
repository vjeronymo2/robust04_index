			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MCLINN HOLDS THE ANSWERS FOR TAFT, 55-51  </P> <P> Brooklyn McLinn spent a restless Monday at Taft High 2 weeks ago, answering the  perfunctory question from students with as little emotion as possible. Of  course, when the logical follow-up to the first question was asked -- the one  he secretly hoped his friends would not raise -- McLinn shrugged, rolled his  eyes, and pointed a finger.  </P> <P> Directly at himself.  </P> <P>  Did you guys win?  </P> <P>  "Uh, no, we didn't," McLinn would answer.  </P> <P>  How did you lose?  </P> <P>  "I committed the game-losing foul," he said.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, McLinn, in fact, did commit the critical foul in Taft's 1-point  loss to North Valley League rival Kennedy.  </P> <P> Friday night at Taft, however, he answered the lingering question -- how would  he respond this time? -- with 15 points to lead Taft to a 55-51 win in a  rematch with the Golden Cougars.  </P> <P> "I hated what happened last time," McLinn said. And no wonder. He had fouled  Kennedy's Cord Bailey, who hit a game-winning free throw with 3 seconds left.  "All that stuff that they ask. 'How'd you lose?' 'What happened?' All that."  </P> <P> But McLinn had all the answers in the victory that gives Taft (16-3, 6-2 in  league play) the inside track to second place in North Valley play with 2 games  to go. All second-place teams will play at home in the first round of the City  Section 4-A Division playoffs.  </P> <P> McLinn and backcourt mate Dedan Thomas combined for 39 points, and more  importantly, answered Kennedy's defensive challenge early. Kennedy used a  collapsing defense all game against Taft, which meant that McLinn and Thomas  would have to help loosen things by firing from the perimeter.  </P> <P> McLinn, of course, was only too aware of this. The last time the teams met, he  had missed his first few jump shots, and Kennedy stopped paying attention to  the 5-foot-10 senior.  </P> <P> "They just dropped right off me," McLinn said. "They stopped guarding me. It  was important that I hit the first couple tonight."  </P> <P> McLinn, in fact, made 4 of 6 field-goal attempts and scored 11 points in the  first half, including 3 3-point shots as Taft built a 40-36 halftime lead.  McLinn and Thomas scored all but 7 of Taft's points in the half.  </P> <P> Kennedy, however, was able to use its superior strength inside to make its only  run of the game in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Senior forward Randy Brown, who finished with a game-high 26 points, pulled the  Golden Cougars into a 32-32 tie with 4:33 left in the third quarter when he  scored on a bank shot to cap an 8-4 run.  </P> <P> "He's the most underrated player in the Valley," Taft Coach Jim Woodard said of  Brown. "He is a force, I can tell you."  </P> <P> Taft, however, outscored Kennedy, 8-4, to take a 40-36 lead entering the fourth  quarter. Kennedy (12-6, 5-3) missed its first 4 shots of the fourth quarter --  a harbinger of things to come -- and made only 5 of 20 in the period.  </P> <P> Taft, on the other hand, was handed all it needed by Thomas at the free-throw  line.  </P> <P> Thomas, an All-American point guard, made his first 6 free throws in the fourth  quarter and 8 of 9 in the period.  </P> <P> McLinn also hit a pair of free throws in the fourth quarter as Taft made 11 of  17. Kennedy made only 3 of 7 free throws in the quarter and 5 of 13 in all.  </P> <P> So, when McLinn holds his ground and again points a finger at himself next  Monday, it will probably be a thumbs-up sign.  </P></p>

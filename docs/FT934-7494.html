			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / With respect, ma'am 'My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,' the Queen might as well have read out yesterday, 'My Government will work day and night, in the hope that if it survives for another year it can float on an incoming tide of economic recovery for long enough after that to win the next general election. To this end, My Government has decided on a holding operation, while it waits for prosperity to return. Meanwhile My Prime Minister has bravely set out to find a political solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland. 'To keep you occupied while these processes work themselves out My Government has chosen 13 bills to put before you. Each has been rigorously selected according to a single criterion - 'Will it command Conservative backbench support?' The new laws may not do much good, but, with luck, they should do little harm. Most of the important bills  - on Deregulation, for example, or Law and Order, or Education - constitute a tacit admission that policies pursued by My Government during the past 14 years have failed. Much of the proposed new legislation is designed to put right mistakes made during that period. For example, the lion's share of the 3,500 regulations identified as unnecessary or stifling to enterprise have been promulgated since 1979. What does My Government think it has been doing since then? 'In spite of the revelation by my Secretary for Wales that the Health Service reforms have created new managers at many times the rate of addition of nurses and doctors, My Government proposes to add 'management' to the police services, tinker with the administration of the magistrates courts, and create a new quango to oversee the allocation of funds for training teachers. It does not expect these measures to reduce crime or improve education, but they may serve two useful purposes. They will provide ammunition for populist declarations by Conservative ministers, and they will strengthen My Government's control over traditionally local functions. The revitalisation of local government is not a basic to which My Government intends to go back, although its policy of annual tinkering with local authorities will be pursued with vigour, this time in Scotland and Wales.' Of course Her Majesty could not have said any of the above. Her script was written for her by Mr John Major, whose first ambition it is to reunite his party after a session during which it nearly split irrevocably over the Maastricht treaty. The new parliamentary programme  - the speech she actually read - is merely one component of the prime minister's strategy for success. Success? It would be a triumph if the prime minister brought the Tories together and restored the confidence of the electorate in his govern-ment. Your guess as to his chances of pulling it off is as good as mine. We may, however, usefully list the other elements of his strategy for political recovery. Step one: the pro and anti European wings of the party are expected to settle around the concordat that he negotiated in the summer and published as an essay in The Economist. The essence of it is to accept the Maastricht deal, but obstruct any further moves towards a European Union that could be remotely mistaken for an embryo super-state. It was carefully prepared. Mr Michael Portillo, the most powerful of the antis, was shown the text a fortnight in advance. Step two: Mr Major's speech at the Conservative conference last month told the audience what it wanted to hear: that Tories are tough on criminals, severe on 'trendy' teachers, and purveyors of common sense. He pursued this line again, to some effect, in his speech in the Commons yesterday. It is not noble, but some voters may fall for it. Next, we have the economic recovery. Last week's trade figures were less awful than expected. Inflation has been held below 2 per cent for long enough to be convincing; this week's surprise fall in the rate of increase in the retail prices index is a boost for the government. Unemployment has been falling for most of this year. The figures announced yesterday suggest an accelerated improvement in the jobs market. People are still hesitant about the end of recession, but Mr Major puts that down to pre-budget blight. The hesitant mood should pass when Mr Kenneth Clarke announces his tax and spending plans in 11 days. The chances are that the increases in taxation, and the cuts in expenditure, will have been discounted by the electorate before November 30. Mr Clarke is known to favour getting bad news out of the way as early as possible in a government's term of office, but it would be surprising if his package turned out to be as severe as people seem to fear. The prime minister, who is responsible for the Budget judgement alongside his chancellor, must balance the need to keep his own job next year against the party's need to fight an election before April 1997. Mr Major is out of urgent danger, but he is not likely to pile on unnecessary bad news now. That leaves Northern Ireland. Here the prime minister has been bold. He has put himself before the voters as the man in charge of the peace process. He did so in Brussels a few weeks ago, in his Guildhall speech on Monday, in the Queen's speech yesterday morning and, a few hours later, in a careful passage in the debate that opened the new parliamentary session. He has stuck to his tactic of putting the extremists on both sides on the spot. The recalcitrant unionists led by the Reverend Ian Paisley are on notice that if they sulk outside the conference chamber, that is where they will be left. Yet the unionists can veto any new constitutional arrangement. The IRA, and Sinn Fein, its political wing, have been told that it is they, and not the British government, who must blink first. If the IRA renounces violence, then in due course it can be included in the talks. With that made clear again yesterday Mr Major will now pursue a deal with Dublin, and, through one-to-one conversations, the leaders of the legitimate parties in Northern Ireland. It is the sort of thing he does best. Nobody, not even the prime minister, can gauge his prospects. Gladstone failed. So, in the end, did Lloyd George. Yet Mr Major's brave initiative must be taken seriously. He deserves all-party support for trying. If he succeeds, he will deserve much more than that.</p>

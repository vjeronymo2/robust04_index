			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All SBIR grant applications will be reviewed with the above considerations in mind. Organizations considering submitting an application are referred to the SBIR Program Policy Directive published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 26, 1993 (58 FR 6144) and to the regulations set forth at 13 CFR part 121 for further guidance regarding eligibility. In particular, to determine whether affiliation exists, the applicant should also refer to 13 CFR 121.401 for the definition of affiliation, which will be used as HCFA's guide on this matter. If it appears that an applicant organization does not meet eligibility requirements with respect to size, HCFA will request a size determination of the organization from the applicable Small Business Administration (SBA) regional office. The review of the application for scientific merit may be deferred until a definitive response is furnished by SBA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of particular concern in considering grant awards is the position of principal investigator. We wish to ensure that support is furnished to a carefully directed working group led by an individual personally committed to the development of the innovation. Accordingly, we are adopting the ``principal investigator'' concept from 42 CFR part 52. These regulations define the term ``principal investigator'' to mean ``a single individual designated by the grantee in the grant application .&blank;.&blank;. who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction of the project.'' (42 CFR 52.2.) In order to meet this standard, the principal investigator's primary employment must be with the grantee at the time of the award and remain so for the duration of the project. Primary employment means that more than one-half of the principal investigator's time is spent in the employment of the small business concern. Primary employment with a small business concern precludes full-time employment at another organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with SBA's SBIR Program Policy Directive published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 26, 1993 (58 FR 6144), we have further restricted the definition of primary employment of the principal investigator to accurately reflect HCFA's needs. The applicant must declare the principal investigator's employment, whether paid or unpaid, at the time of application, and must declare all employment relationships, whether paid or unpaid, that the principal investigator is expected to have at the time the SBIR grant awards are expected to be made and for the duration of the proposed project. In the event that, at the time of application, the principal investigator_(1) is, or expects to be, a less-than-full-time employee of the small business concern, (2) is, or expects to be, concurrently employed by another organization, or (3) gives, or expects that he or she may give, the appearance of being concurrently employed by another organization, whether for a paid or unpaid position, it is essential that documentation be submitted with the application to verify the applicant's eligibility at the time of the award. Thus, if the principal investigator is also employed or appears to be employed by an institution other than the applicant organization (for example, a university, nonprofit research institute, or a company other than the applicant organization), a letter must be furnished by the nonapplicant organization confirming that the principal investigator, if awarded an SBIR grant, is, or will become, a less-than-half-time employee of the organization and will remain so for the duration of the SBIR project. If the principal investigator is employed by a university, the letter must be furnished by the dean of the school or the departmental chairperson. If the principal investigator is employed by another for-profit organization, the letter must be signed by a corporate official. This documentation of the primary employment of the principal investigator is required for every application that is submitted, even one that is a revision of a previously submitted application. In the event that solicitation of this documentation would place the principal investigator's current employment in jeopardy should the grant award not be made, the applicant may delay submission of the documentation, provided the documentation is submitted no later than 30 days after receiving notice of a grant award, and provided that the applicant includes a statement with the grant application to the effect that solicitation of the documentation at this time would place the principal investigator's current employment in jeopardy, that the applicant will forward the documentation within 30 days of receiving notice of a grant award, and that the applicant understands that should it fail to provide the documentation, we may, at our discretion, immediately suspend or terminate the grant. If the principal investigator fails to furnish adequate documentation, the application may be returned without review. In the event a grantee is required to submit documentation of the principal investigator's employment, but fails to do so within 30 days of the date of the notice of grant award, we may immediately suspend or terminate the grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For both Phase I and Phase II, the research or R&amp;D must be performed in its entirety in the United States (U.S.), that is, the States, territories, and possessions of the U.S.; the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands; and the District of Columbia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The words and phrases that appear on the SBIR application form, or are needed in the application narrative, are not readily defined. Therefore, for convenience and clarity, we have furnished the following definitions, which, except as noted, are taken from SBA's SBIR Program Policy Directive that implements this program and was published on January 26, 1993, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 6144). This policy directive requires an agency to define in a separate section whatever terms it uses that are unique to either the SBIR Program, a specific SBIR solicitation, or a portion of the solicitation. The section must also include, at a minimum, specific terms as defined in the policy directive. Accordingly, in addition to the terms required by the policy directive, we are also defining the terms ``Contract'' and ``Grant'' and including the policy directive's definition of the term ``Research and Development.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A ``contract'' is an award instrument establishing a binding legal procurement relationship between a funding agency and the recipient, obligating the latter to furnish an end product or service and binding the agency to furnish payment for the product or service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A ``grant'' is a financial assistance mechanism whereby either money or direct assistance, or both, is furnished to carry out approved activities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

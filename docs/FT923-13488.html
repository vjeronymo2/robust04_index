			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / International Company News: Restructuring and consolidation keep generating large bids RESTRUCTURING and consolidation continue to generate large international bids and deals, writes Brian Bollen. The biggest of the week by far was the agreed bid by Cementos Mexicanos for Valenciana de Cementos, Spain's biggest cement group. This continues the rapid consolidation of Europe's troubled cement sector and reverses the long-standing trend in the sector for European companies to invest in North America. Moody's Investors Service, the US debt ratings agency, appeared less than impressed: it placed the Cemex rating under review for possible downgrade, saying such a large acquisition might indicate a more aggressive growth strategy than previously thought. Cemex decided in 1988 to concentrate on its core business. That one company's non-core disposal is another's growth opportunity was underlined again by British Petroleum's latest disposal, of its Germany subsidiary Globol. The transaction takes the buyer - the Jeyes cleaning products group bought out from Cadbury Schweppes and BP in 1986 - further into continental Europe and increases its sales by more than one-third. Debt claimed another prominent victim, forcing French businessman Mr Bernard Tapie to sell off yet another business, the German sporting goods company Adidas. Pentland Holdings of the UK thus adds another top-brand name brand to the portfolio assembled with the proceeds of its enormous profits on its Reebok investment. Niche markets continue to be fashionable. Specialist chemicals group Hickson International of the UK is moving into the supply of fine chemicals to pharmaceutical groups by buying Ireland's Angus Fine Chemicals. Simon Engineering of the UK said its purchase of the marine seismic data division of Teledyne Exploration of the US makes it the world's fourth-largest in that specialised sector. The week saw much speculation about further restructuring of international airlines, but only one small transaction emerged, the purchase of 26.5 per cent of Austria's Lauda Air by German flag-carrier Lufthansa.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CROSS BORDER M&amp;A DEALS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BIDDER/INVESTOR  TARGET           SECTOR        VALUE  COMMENT                                              (Pounds)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cementos         Valenciana de    Cement        658m   Cemex wants Maxicanos (Mex.)

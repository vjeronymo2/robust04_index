			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The press center of the Social Justice Movement  [Dvizheniye za sotsialnuyu spravedlivost] interregional strike  committee reports that the militia prevented the movement from  holding a rally at the Mayakovskiy memorial today. The rally  was to have been dedicated to defending the people's standard of  living and preparing for the second all-Russian day of protest  on 14 April. Even though Moscow's Taganskiy district court just  a week ago ruled as illegal any ban on holding such meetings,  the press center statement says, the cochairman of the  interregional strike committee Sergey Skvortsov was detained and  taken to militia station No. 10.</p>

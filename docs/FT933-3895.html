			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / French growth seen next year THE French economy should emerge from recession in the final quarter of this year and stage a recovery in 1994, according to the latest analysis by Bipe, a leading economics institute, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. Bipe expects the recovery to start slowly in the first quarter of 1994 and to gain momentum through the year. It sees GDP growth of 0.8 per cent (excluding invisible earnings) for 1994, following a fall of 1.5 per cent in 1993. The general trends in Bipe's forecast are similar to those outlined earlier this week by the Economy Ministry. However, the institute is less optimistic about the pace of recovery. The ministry expects growth (including invisible earnings) of 1.4 per cent for 1994. Retail prices were static in August, according to provisional figures published yesterday by Insee, the state statistics institute, bringing the annualised inflation rate to 2.2 per cent.</p>

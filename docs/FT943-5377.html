			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Blow to Swedish opposition Support for Sweden's opposition Social Democratic party, favourite to win the September 18 general election, fell significantly last week according to an opinion poll published yesterday. But the swing was strongly to the left and not towards the struggling right-centre government of Prime Minister Carl Bildt. The poll showed support for the Social Democrats slipping 3.2 percentage points to 47.4 per cent, the first time the party has fallen below 50 per cent since June. This suggested the Social Democrats would not win an overall majority. The shift is likely to unsettle financial markets, which have driven up long-term interest rates and weakened the Swedish krona because of uncertainty over the country's budget deficit and fast growing public debt. Uncertainty over the outcome of referendums in Finland and Sweden on their applications to join the European Union has also unsettled markets. The left in Sweden is strongly anti-EU and a poll in Finland on Saturday showed a strong swing there to the anti-EU camp for the first time in several months.</p>

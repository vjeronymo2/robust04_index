			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Property: Back to the basics - Investment funds have reached a new peak The property investment market turned up decisively in May, bringing the first good news in four years to a depressed sector. There was a change of mood, and with it a feeling that values had hit bottom and the decline was over. Yields have come down, even for central London offices. Although rents are still dropping, the fall in yields is enough to nudge values up. The reason for the change is not hard to identify: the amount of money available for investment in property is the highest for more than 10 years. Hillier Parker, the surveyor, has compiled a list of 145 buyers, each with at least Pounds 10m to spend and with aggregate available funds of Pounds 7.25bn. The contrast with the late-1980s period of heady development activity is best illustrated by the experience of insurance companies, whose annual net flow of investment into property barely topped Pounds 2bn in any one year in the 1980s. The 29 insurance companies on the Hillier Parker list alone now have a total of Pounds 2.7bn to spend. Most buyers are competing for a fairly narrow band of property where the quality of the tenant's covenant - financial strength - is of prime importance. There is a shortage of property in this band, so unless insurance companies relax their requirements, they will fail to find a home for their billions. Now the market has turned, the nub of the problem for investors is the mismatch of supply and demand. There is plenty of property to buy, much of it held by the banks, but with empty space still a problem, buyers have not yet been prepared to offer attractive prices unless the conditions of a first-class covenant are relaxed. A few brave souls bought in 1992, encouraged to do so by three main factors. First, in the short term they gambled on yields coming down when the investing herd followed them into the market. This would protect them against the continuing slide in rents. Second, if the covenant was good, which it usually was, they would gain a secure medium-term income at little risk and with better returns than gilts. Finally, in the longer term, there might be a faint prospect of genuine rental growth. In summary, the short, medium and long-term grounds for buying could add up to a combination of good capital growth and a high-yielding income stream. The position today is less attractive for investors wishing to buy properties with good covenants. This is because the opportunity for anticipating the turn in the market has passed. Yields could fall further, driven by the volume of money available for investment and greater confidence in the economy, but it is already too late to gain the full benefit from falling yields. The next stage of recovery in the investment market is dependent, in part, on a relaxation of the demanding definition of good covenant. Reliance on covenant was a natural haven during the recession. It led to preference being given to a poor property with a good tenant compared with a good property occupied by an insecure tenant. The normal property criteria of modern specification and accessible location leading to healthy tenant demand were given less weight than certainty of income. Eventually the balance between covenant strength and a property's fundamental attractions seems certain to tip in favour of the latter. Recovery will lead first to a reduction in the danger of a tenant defaulting on the rent. Next will come a pick-up in tenant demand, and finally empty space will start to be filled. This will all take time, and the naturally cautious institutional buyers will be reluctant to relax their desire for secure income until they are sure it is safe to do so. The effect will be to give opportunities for bolder investors to get into the market ahead of them, as happened in 1992 and the early part of this year. As the property market slowly returns to being a growth investment there will be an increasing distinction between 'prime' and 'secondary' properties. Property will be rated according to its size, specification and location, and to the extent it satisfies the needs of the market and can generate rental growth. Having a good tenant is only part of the criteria; if the property specifics are good a departing tenant can be replaced. Describing pre-recession prime property stills feels a bit like indulging in nostalgia. The past four years have left deep scars which will leave investors sceptical about property for years to come. Despite this, the focus on covenant is starting to recede and property investment is coming back to basics. The author is a partner with Hillier Parker</p>

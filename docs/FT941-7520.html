			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Bell, TCI call off Dollars 21.4bn merger The Dollars 21.4bn merger of Bell Atlantic , the US regional company, with Tele-Communications, the largest US cable television service company, has been called off. Bell Atlantic blamed the 'unsettled regulatory climate' in the US for the unravelling of what was to have been the biggest merger in the history of the US telecommunications industry. The proposed merger had been widely seen as the most significant move in a broad convergence of the telephone, cable television, computer and entertainment industries to create nation-wide 'information superhighways'. The Clinton administration has endorsed legislation that would allow telephone companies, such as Bell Atlantic, to enter the field of multi-media information services, including interactive television. 'This administration will not let existing regulatory structures impede or distort the evolution of the communications industry,' Vice President Gore promised at a recent meeting of industry leaders. Differing regulations that currently apply to telephone and cable television companies should be harmonised, the vice president said. However, such changes are yet to be enacted and it now appears that regulations have in fact deterred Bell and TCI from moving forward with their merger plans. The companies said a change in federal cable TV regulations, controlling prices, made it impossible to close the deal. 'We are disappointed, but the unsettled regulatory climate made it too difficult for the parties to value the future today,' said Bell's chairman Raymond Smith The companies initially set a December deadline to reach a definitive merger agreement. But the deadline was twice extended. The merger plan also included Liberty Media, a cable programming company which TCI spun off in 1991 and recently reacquired. Bell serves the middle part of America's eastern seaboard and has been one of the most aggressive companies trying to enter the multimedia industry. TCI has been built up by Mr John Malone, its chief executive, over 20 years into a company serving some 20 per cent of US homes.</p>

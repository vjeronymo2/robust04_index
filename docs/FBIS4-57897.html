			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: ``Domestic Security''] </F>   [Text] The decision by the executive branch to establish a  secretariat in charge of domestic security sparked off the  heated controversy within the federal government that has been  so lavishly reported over the last few days.    First reports stated that the new secretariat would directly  report to the Presidency of the nation and would control all  national security forces. This means that the Federal Police,  the National Border Police, and the Coast Guard would all come  under this new secretariat. Its official name would allegedly  be the Secretariat for Community Protection and, according to  what has been officially disclosed, it would be headed by Julian  Licastro.    Subsequent reports stated that some members of the cabinet  are against the all-encompassing role that the government  intends to give this secretariat. They suggest that the  National Border Police and the Argentine Coast Guard continue  under the jurisdiction of the Defense Ministry.    Those who support the first position -- the one that  encompasses all agencies without distinction -- contend that it  would be more suitable to unify the management of the nation's  security forces and to coordinate their respective intelligence  services to enable a greater control of government domestic  security spending and the optimum use of resources for drug  enforcement.    Those in favor of the second position argue that it is not  necessary to unify the management of security forces because  there is already a unified command -- that vested in the  president of the Republic, under whose natural command come all  the government's agencies in one way or another. It is also  alleged that the project for unification contradicts several  laws (internal defense and security, among them) and that it  ignores the fact that the Border Guard currently carries out  external security functions in addition to its task of internal  security. It is stressed that the creation of the super  secretariat could lead to an exaggerated concentration of power  in one branch of government and that it could encourage the idea  of the intention to create a repressive structure, which does  not coincide with the style and stamp of democratic societies.    Whether these arguments are valid or not, the proposal does  not seem to follow an imperious need at the present time. The  internal security problems facing Argentine society do not come  from the fact that the respective organizations are not in their  correct positions within the state's current organizational  chart, but from other factors, some of which have been  frequently mentioned in this column: The lack of budget  resources for the sector, the ever-increasing deterioration of  police professionalism, and the obvious fissures in the judicial  system, among others.    Nothing presupposes a change in the jurisdictional aspect of  the organizations will help to correct the endemic weakness of  the national security system or help to attenuate in some way  the feeling of a lack of protection that Argentine society is  experiencing in the face of an upsurge in crime and uncontrolled  drug trafficking.    One error that most governments have committed stems from  the  presumption that problems can be resolved by the creation of new  and enormous state structures. Experience shows that this  formula generally leads to a completely useless expenditure or  to the overlapping of organizations with similar or parallel  missions.    Internal security is, without a doubt, one of the  fundamental  values that the state must safeguard, but the right way is not  through atypical organizational mechanisms; it is through the  good use of existing structures and the removal of the obstacles  that prevent its efficient functioning. The Interior and  Defense Ministries have clearly established missions and  functions. If for some reason they are not carrying them out  with the necessary efficiency, then the needed adjustments and  behavioral changes must be made so that the organizations can  face the needs of society today with adequate moral and  technical competence.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Quest for fair value It will be a minor miracle if the Accounting Standards Board's latest discussion document provokes nothing more heated than talk. The proposal to outlaw balance sheet provisions for post-acquisition costs will make it far more difficult for acquisitive companies to show steady earnings growth. If the ASB gets its way, the cost of restructuring an acquired company in future will be charged squarely against profits as an exceptional item. That should be good for transparency. The right to make fair-value adjustments on acquisition has been open to widespread abuse. All manner of costs and anticipated losses have been dressed up as balance sheet liabilities. With acquired goodwill also written off against reserves, the cost of acquisitions has often passed without touching the profit and loss. Since businesses that have not just changed hands have to take rationalisation costs on the chin, that hardly makes for a level playing field between predators and prey. Under the ASB proposals, investors will still have to decide whether to include exceptional post-acquisition costs when adjusting the volatile earnings figures which arise from FRS3. But such costs should surely be regarded as a normal business expense for companies which make a habit of takeovers, and therefore a legitimate component of earnings. Whether this attitude would discourage speculative takeovers or depress asset values - including the share prices of potential takeover targets - remains an open question. Meanwhile companies such as Tomkins, which has yet to announce fair value provisions following its acquisition of RHM, must decide whether to toe the ASB line or take a stand in favour of the old rules.</p>

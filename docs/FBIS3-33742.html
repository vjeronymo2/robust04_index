			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by S. Vishwam of DECCAN CHRONICLE] </F>   [Text] One cannot recall a stretch of time in  India-Pakistan bilateral relations which was not characterized  by strain, stresses and tensions. Indeed, during the last four  decades the course of India-Pakistan relations has been variably  been marked by a pattern which has by now become quite familiar  to the students of South Asian politics. A prolonged period of  confrontation and hostility leads to expression of the desire  for normalization and friendship. This leads to some form of  dialogue which arouses expectations in both the countries. The  dialogue ends either in failure or in stalemate and relations  are back to square one.    The recent foreign secretaries level dialogue was yet  another  attempt to broker peace between the two neighbors. The outcome  was disappointing. In diplomatic parlance, it could be  described as both sides agreeing to disagree. But instead of  being put off by the failure, India has decided to go ahead and  make one more attempt to induce Pakistan to try and remove some  if not all of the irritants which (?clay) bilateral relations.  This attempt was in the form of handing over six nonpapers  containing detailed proposals in several key areas of contention  in India-Pakistan relations by the foreign secretary, Mr. J.N.  Dixit, to the Pakistan high commissioner in New Delhi. The  initial response to the proposals from Islamabad has predictably  been lukewarm, but one hopes that a detailed study of the six  proposals would persuade Pakistan to be more responsive.    These proposals may not been spectacular or sensational, but  they address issues which have aggravated tension and which  because of that very reason needed to be got out of the way.  Indeed, one of the most innovative among the proposals is the  Indian offer in the arena of building confidence and removing  mistrust of a no first-use of nuclear capability. This is to  ensure regardless of whether or not the two countries possess  nuclear capabilities that there is no chance of a nuclear  confrontation between the two. The proposal is of benefit to  both the countries and hence it ought to be acceptable to  Pakistan.    Again, Islamabad should consider the proposal for creating  an  institutional mechanism to preserve peace and tranquility along  the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. Since the porous  border has led to numerous instances of violations of the Line  of Control, any mechanism which can monitor such violations and  prevent them ought to be welcomed by Islamabad. It is worth  remembering that agreement between India and China on the  creation of an institutionalized mechanism along the border has  actually resulted in trans-border tranquility and lessening of  tension. There is no reason why a similar mechanism along the  Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir cannot work.    The proposal for implementing the agreement on Siachen  arrived at three or four years ago by the defense secretaries of  the two countries is an earnest of India's sincerity in settling  the Siachen issue once and for all. In fact, the suggestion for  ensuring peace and tranquility along the Line of Control and the  offer to implement the agreement on Siachen taken together  constitute a major peace-offering on the part of India. Both  countries have admitted that the Siachen agreement could not be  implemented two years ago because of the absence of political  will. Soon after returning to power after elections, the prime  minister of Pakistan, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, had said that an  agreement on Siachen would restore Pakistan's confidence in  bilateral negotiations. By offering to implement such  agreement, India is giving proof of its good faith. Indeed, the  spirit in which the Indian proposals have been made are  consistent with the spirit of the Simla Agreement of 1972. It  is on such a basis that Islamabad must assess the six proposals.  Islamabad demanding a plebiscite in Kashmir or raising the  Kashmir issue at the UN Conference on Human Rights in Geneva  will not take Pakistan too far.</p>

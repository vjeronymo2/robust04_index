			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Philippines Interested in 20 Belgian </F> Mirage-5's"]    [Text] The Philippines are very interested in purchasing 20  Belgian Mirage-5 fighter aircraft, according to BRTN  [Dutch-speaking Belgian Television and Radio Broadcasting]. The  negotiations are said to be in a relatively advanced stage, but  for the time being nothing is known about the price to be paid  by the Philippine Army.    When the Belgian Government agreed its medium-term  purchasing  plan for the Defense Ministry in the middle of last year, it  immediately gave the green light for the sale of 20 Mirage-5  aircraft. Sabca [Belgian Aeronautic Construction Company] was  instructed to seek buyers. The aircraft had just been refitted  when the government decided to slim down the Air Force.    At present they are deployed at the Weelde airbase. Before  long the base will also station a number of F-16's which are  also for sale. A number of countries have been contacted for  this sale including Pakistan and NATO ally Greece. For the time  being there has been no result here either.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Bank of America's Investment Real Estate Group is building a $12-million  business park in Santa Ana for client Bay 511 Corp. of San Francisco.  </P> <P> MacArthur Park will cover six acres with four buildings containing 94,000  square feet of office and warehouse space. The bank bought the land from Cabot,  Cabot &amp; Forbes in 1975 and has since managed the property for Bay 511. At  the time, there was a Rockwell International warehouse on the site, which was  recently demolished because it was outdated.  </P> <P> The bank says land is so expensive in Orange County that few industrial  buildings are being built, so it expects the new buildings to lease rapidly.  </P></p>

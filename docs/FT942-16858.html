			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Mitterrand and Balladur agree N-missile policy The French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, appears to have struck a compromise with President Francois Mitterrand on the country's future nuclear weaponry that could head off the development of 'smart' atomic arms and early resumption of nuclear testing, as many government backbenchers have been demanding. A meeting on Wednesday of France's defence council, called to finalise the government's framework law on military spending over the 1995-2000 period, decided that the entry into service of the planned long-range M5 nuclear missile should be delayed from 2005 to 2010. Mr Mitterrand has championed the M5 missile, France's version of the Trident submarine missile with a range of nearly 8,000km, to maintain France's traditional deterrent strategy of threatening any attacker with massive retaliation. By contrast, a growing number of conservative backbenchers, particularly from Mr Balladur's own Gaullist RPR party, fear the M5 will swallow up resources which they believe would be better used in developing smaller, more 'useable' weapons in the face of growing potential threats from the third world. But, in return Mr Mitterrand seems to have won Mr Balladur's agreement to prolong the life of France's land-based nuclear deterrent with the launch of a study into how an interim missile - the 6,000km-range M45, which is to be fitted to new French nuclear submarines in 1996-97 - might be deployed early in the next century, when the life of the existing S3 missiles runs out. A traditionalist in nuclear strategy, Mr Mitterrand has always believed that keeping land-based rockets in their silos on the Plateau d'Albion, a sparsely-populated mountain area north-east of Avignon, is essential to deterrence, because any attack on it would cause such damage that the attacker would know he would face massive retaliation. Mr Mitterrand faced down an attempt in 1986 by the previous conservative government, led by Mr Balladur's party rival, Mr Jacques Chirac, to abandon fixed land missiles in favour of mobile missiles, then in vogue in the US and the former-Soviet Union. This Mitterrand-Balladur compromise could reduce the need to resume underground nuclear testing, which Mr Mitterrand put under a moratorium in April 1992 in the face of opposition.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> JOLTS LINKED TO SONIC BOOMS  </P> <P> Residents from Long Beach to San Clemente reported a series of window-rattling  jolts, but authorities said the shaking was probably caused by sonic booms and  not an earthquake. Robert Finn, a spokesman at Caltech, said that no seismic  activity was recorded in the area, and he theorized that the jolts resulted  from sonic booms or Navy gunfire. A spokesman for the Naval Station at Long  Beach said it was possible that ships were conducting bombing exercises near  San Clemente Island and this could have caused the rattling about 2 p.m. Police  and fire authorities received several calls from residents concerned about the  jolts, but there were no reports of damages. Border Patrol Agent Howard  Schroeder said that the windows in his San Clemente office "rattled real bad"  but that the jolts did not resemble those of an earthquake.  </P></p>

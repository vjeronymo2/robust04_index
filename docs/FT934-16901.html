			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Observer: Molto diminuendo After attending a company-sponsored concert which included Schubert's Unfinished Symphony, a management consultant writes to the chairman of a European car manufacturer as follows: The four oboists, who were idle for lengthy periods, should be disposed of and their work spread over the rest of the orchestra. In each of the heavily staffed string sections, the players were all playing identical notes. Headcounts should be cut across the board, peak demands for volume being met by amplifiers. Much skill and energy were expended on playing demi-semiquavers. This excessive refinement should be dropped and notes rounded up to the nearest quaver, allowing use of lower-grade operatives and making an interval unnecessary. Passages played by one section, such as the strings, were frequently repeated by another. If such wasteful repetitions were also eliminated, the concert-time would fall from two hours to, at most 40 minutes, even if the symphony were played to a conclusion.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Fashion: I know what I like in your wardrobe - The difficult art of choosing your partner's clothes CHRISTOPHER WATSON, ex-army officer and district councillor, loves choosing and buying clothes for his wife, Anne. 'A man with a badly-dressed wife,' he believes, 'is half to blame as he is not paying her enough attention.' 'Choosing clothes,' he says, 'is not that different from choosing curtains, a car or a radio. If you see a half-dozen antique knives there will always be one better than the others. But you need the eye to spot that one. 'I keep a chart of Anne's measurements in my wallet as sizing is not always consistent. I used to like Hartnell when it was in London. Now I like the Scotch House for sweaters and Rigby &amp; Peller for bathing costumes and lingerie - my step-daughters are usually impressed with what I choose for them. Then there is Harrods, The White House for dressing-gowns, and Marks and Spencer is good for basics, although I always like to see the belts replaced.' Anne feels she is 'a country girl at heart' and is always 'rushing over the fields in a felt hat. I don't seem to have the knack of dealing with scarves or stoles. I don't mind Christopher helping me choose things as we have much the same taste. It's rather fun; he goes to endless trouble and if there is something I don't like I can usually wheedle my way around him. 'When I shop by myself I might bring several things home for him to look at. If he comes with me and I do not choose anything he calls me a fool for wasting his time. 'Where we differ is that I am rather more practical. He bought me a very good cream coat that is hardly worn as I do not go to many race days any more. One disaster was a pair of navy-blue shorts that came above my knee - I felt stupid in them and so they had to go back.' Christopher has strong views on style and feels that 'high fashion does not do women any favours'. 'It gives me so much pleasure to choose things for Anne, even though some people do think it's a little odd,' he says. JAN Kilroy-Silk met her television presenter husband Robert when he was still at school in Birmingham. Even then he was fashionable, wearing hand-made white shirts with his regulation blazer and flannels. While she was at art college, dressed in black from head to toe, Robert was parading in an Italian suit with lilac tie, matching socks, and winkle-pickers. It was not long before Jan took his wardrobe firmly in hand. She remembers in particular 'a very nasty white sports coat that he wore, which I had the bright idea of dyeing navy. Unfortunately, the thread stayed white.' He was gradually subverted and went on to sport the chunky sweaters, cords and Senior Service style favoured by university lecturers. When Kilroy-Silk became a Labour MP he adopted suitable suits, tailored under Jan's watchful eye. 'There was one pin-striped model that we used to call my MP suit. Then, when I started the Kilroy Show, five mornings a week on BBC1, I continued to wear suits but did not have time to visit tailors for fittings. To begin with they wanted me to wear Frank Bough-type sweaters but I didn't think that was quite me.' Basically, says Jan, 'Robert hates shopping - except for books - although he has definite ideas on what he likes. I usually go into Masons of Maidenhead in Berkshire, pick out lots of things and then persuade him to come in and try them on. He will buy about four or five suits at a time. He is a fairly stock size but needs the waists taking in.' Giorgio Armani and Hugo Boss are favourite designers for more formal suits and ties, but Ralph Lauren checked shirts, cashmere sweaters and Levis are the weekend look. 'I used to have about half a dozen cardigans all in bright colours but I now prefer cashmeres in dark navy or maroon. I always change into something more casual the minute I get in from town.' Robert has not bought any clothes for his wife since he experimented with a candlewick dressing-gown with a zip down the front ('if ever one's image felt crushed . . . ,' says Jan) but feels that she always look smart and sexy. 'I like her wearing classic Italian outfits. I am not keen on the baggy Japanese look. I know what I like but would not know how to achieve it.' Carolyn Hadden-Paton, who owns and runs Sam Browne, a shop specialising mainly in weekend clothes for City types, chooses nearly everything that her husband, Alasdair, puts on. Alasdair Hadden-Paton used to be a chartered accountant and then went into the venture capital business (or, according to Carolyn, became an 'adventure capitalist'). He has also, in partnership with David Neylor-Leyland, recently opened two up-market 'bed and breakfast' hotels in London. 'When Alasdair and I first met I was working as a buyer of women's clothes in Patsy Seddon's first Phase 8 shop, while Alasdair was still at school,' says Carolyn. 'Our relationship nearly ended on our first date when he arrived wearing a jeans-jacket, cowboy boots and jeans that were far too tight. His sister-in-law worked in the Midnight Blue store and he probably got a discount. 'The first thing I bought for him was a pair of bathing shorts from Douggie Hayward, the tailor. He now has 10 pairs in his wardrobe. But when we were first a couple we never went clothes shopping together. He was dressed by his mother from Marks and Spencer and, as he is rather ape-like, had his shirts made in either Hong Kong or Cyprus, where his brother was stationed. Mufti wear tended to be the too-tight jeans.' Now Carolyn chooses and buys all Alasdair's clothes, from double-seamed jersey boxer shorts, ankle-length dressing-gowns ('I don't want to see hairy legs over my morning muesli'), bright cord trousers with pleated fronts, brushed cotton shirts to tailor-made business suits. 'Luckily,' she says, 'he is incredibly easy to dress. I don't know what I would do if I had a husband with tiny little legs.' Alasdair buys his classic shirts from Thomas Pink in London and his ties from Yves St Laurent or Hermes, as Sam Browne's wonderful Italian silk ties tend to be snapped up by customers as soon as they arrive. 'He is a perfect house model, and I frequently make him try things on for me. When he goes golfing at the weekend with his men friends they are always asking him where his clothes come from. He is a very good advertisement for my shop.' Mark Leatham's office in Camberwell, south east London, gives you some clues to both his business and his private passions. There are glass cases full of stuffed birds, a Welsh dresser loaded with cans of olive oil, enormous packets of exotic coloured spaghetti, a 2ft cigar and acres of paperwork. His main business, Leathams Larder, sells dry goods to specialist shops. He also supplies quail to the multiples and game and fish to private clients. 'When I was in the army in my younger days,' says Mark, 'I was a bit of a peacock and wore suits made by my old Etonian tailor and shirts from Turnbull &amp; Asser. I was always correctly dressed in the right kit. My prep school headmaster said I was the most immaculate boy he had met during his 30 years there.' Jojo Leatham met her husband after he had left the army and was setting up a game-supplying business with his brother. Although he was very good looking, his sartorial elegance had vanished. 'He wore very tight trousers, never wore underpants, and rarely wore socks,' she says. 'The worst T-shirt I ever remember him wearing said 'Horny Toad' on the front. I thought, 'nice body, shame about the clothes.'' Mark soon realised that the rest of his management team was looking very smart and that it was time to polish his image. 'My priorities had changed; I was no longer a batchelor who had to flaunt his peacock feathers; I had caught my bird. I had to go out and look functional, not too flash or trendy, although I like ties to be a bit off-beat. I leave the designer suits to my younger brother, Quentin. However, I do like pink: I feel the colour softens me up a bit.' His blazer was 'built' by his old school tailor in 1987 and still has his regimental buttons. Most of his shirts come from Thomas Pink, and his country ones are by Johnny Boden. Gone are the tight white Midnight Blue jeans, replaced at weekends in Oxford by plus-fours for shooting or bright coloured cords from Hackett, bought quite frequently as Jojo has a tendency to shrink them in the washing machine. 'I don't consider dressing-up to be important and I wouldn't appreciate cashmere - cut-price Shetlands from Scotland are more the thing two years into a recession, especially with a brace of children. I like to buy Jojo the odd silk shirt when I go to Paris.' Mark still thinks of clothes as an extravagance and at least twice a year Jojo has to restock his wardrobe with necessities such as underwear, shirts and ties. Without her, she thinks, he would 'just carry on wearing whatever had, regardless of the state it was in. If he really had his way, he would go round in scruffy old corduroys looking like the gardener.'</p>

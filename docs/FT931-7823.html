			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Top Fiat executives held on corruption charges ITALY'S business community was shaken yesterday by the arrest of two top Fiat executives on charges of alleged corruption and illegal financing of political parties. Those arrested were Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, chief financial officer of the Fiat group and Mr Antonio Mosconi, chief executive of the Turin automotive group's insurance arm, Toro. Mr Mattioli, aged 52, is a key figure in the new management structure being devised by Mr Giovanni Agnelli in the run-up to his projected departure from the chairmanship of the group next year. A Fiat statement said the group had learnt of the arrests with 'amazement'. The company offered them its full support and said the two executives had always carried out their jobs with the utmost rectitude. Fiat shares, which have been rising strongly in the past two weeks, fell nearly 1 per cent on the news. The lira also slipped to a new historic low against the D-Mark of L964. Earlier the lira had begun to recover from Friday's slide in a favourable response to the Sunday reshuffle of the Amato cabinet. The two Fiat executives were arrested at their Turin homes. Carabinieri police also searched their offices in Fiat's Turin headquarters. The arrests relate to alleged illegal payments of L1.8bn (Pounds 821,000) made during the construction of the Milan metro in which Fiat's construction arm, Cogefar-Impresit, was involved. Last May, Mr Enzo Papi, the chief executive of Cogefar-Impresit, was arrested on a similar charge. Two other Fiat group executives were subsequently arrested on the same allegations - Mr Giancarlo Cozza, managing director of Fiat-Savigliano and Mr Luigi Capriotti, manager of Fiat-Iveco. In one of his roles in the Fiat group, Mr Mosconi was president of Cogefar-Impresit. Mr Mattioli has been with Fiat since 1975 and last November, when the management was split into two broad divisions - industry and industrial development, and financial control and resource management - he was given the newly created position of chief financial officer. Their arrests followed renewed interrogation of Mr Papi and Mr Mauricio Prada, former head of the Milan Christian Democrat party charged with alleged illicit collection of party funds. At least 10 prominent industrial and financial figures are now caught up in the ever widening investigation into corruption by Milan magistrates. Yesterday Mr Mariano del Papa, the managing director of the Anas, the state road building authority, formally resigned following notice that he was under investigation for alleged corruption in handling contracts. Yesterday, the small Republican party, which has promoted itself as the party of clean government, was recovering from the blow of the arrest on Sunday of Mr Giorgio Medre, a former member of parliament and until recently head of their political department.

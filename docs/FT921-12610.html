			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / The Long View: Gilts seek a home market WHATEVER MAY have happened in the economy at large last year, investors had a pretty good time. Consider your company's pension fund, for example. You may still have lingering doubts about whether your bosses, having studied the late Robert Maxwell's methods, are siphoning off the assets. But at least you do not need to have any worries about recent investment performance. It looks as though the typical UK pension fund enjoyed an investment return  -income plus capital gain - of 18 per cent or so last year, making up for the blip in 1990 when returns were slightly negative. The equity and bond markets around the world almost all performed well, and the UK property market was the only real dog. Because the liabilities of the pension funds will have grown only in line with pay levels, at just over 7 per cent, there has been a margin of surplus. Your boss will be able to enjoy his contribution holiday for a while longer, even if he insists on continuing to deduct your own pension instalments from your pay packet regardless. You do not easily change a winning investment formula. For many years, British pension funds have been chasing the high returns in the equity market with great success. The average fund's return over the past ten years has been 16 per cent annually. But the strategy has now become even more extreme. The latest figures from the WM Company, one of the two specialists which measure pension fund performance, suggest that the proportion of portfolios are invested in equities worldwide is 79 per cent. The rival service Caps, which focuses more on slightly smaller, perhaps more aggressively-run funds, calculates that the proportion is as high as 84 per cent. Plainly there has been absolutely no response to the full commitment 15 months ago by the UK to the European Monetary System. One logical result of that should have been a resurgence of fixed income investment in Britain. The persistent high inflation that destroyed the credibility of fixed interest bonds, notably government gilt-edged, was set to become a thing of the past. Over the past 20 years inflation in the UK has been 9.8 per cent a year, but only 4 per cent in Germany, where investing in bonds is hugely popular. But British investors are all too conscious of the large-scale robbery which has been a feature of the gilts market over the years. The problem has been pointed out once again this week in the latest annual version of the Barclays de Zoete Wedd long-term equity-gilt study. Since the war the average real return on UK equities each year has been just over 6 per cent, but has been about minus 1 per cent on gilts. In nominal terms, equities have outperformed on average by 7.5 per cent each year. No contest, at least until we hitched sterling to the DM. In fact, the EMS has not changed old habits one little bit. The continuing trend towards equities is confirmed by official figures for institutional investment. Last year the Central Statistical Office stopped publishing figures for pension funds because they were suspect. Now it has begun producing a new, improved version. Since these have magically expanded the cash flowing into pension funds and life assurance companies from Pounds 25bn to Pounds 35bn a year those stock market strategists who feared a liquidity crisis have been greatly cheered up. In fact, far from being strained by the Pounds 10bn of UK rights issues last year, fund managers had cash to spare to pour into a renewed spending spree in overseas stock markets. The average UK pension fund now has nearly 25 per cent of its portfolio in foreign shares. The other notable feature has been the continued retreat from gilts. Another Pounds 3bn of gilts were sold by pension funds in nine months to September, and they now have at least as much in foreign bonds as in sterling bonds. In fact the Caps funds now only seem to have 3 per cent in gilts, compared to the 25 per cent they held at the start of the 1980s. What is the point, say the fund managers, of bothering with fixed interest securities? They do not match the investment objectives of pension funds, which have liabilities linked to pay. Besides, equities will always perform better. Take 1991, when British inflation tumbled by more than half to 4.5 per cent, which should have been very favourable for gilts, while in the stock market earnings per share tumbled by over 10 per cent, which should have depressed equities. In fact, the UK equity market returned 21 per cent while gilts returned just over 16 per cent. But there are two reasons to think twice about this approach. One is that although equities do well in conditions of low inflation and strong economic growth, they would not shine in a prolonged period of depression. Equities are now discounting a strong profits recovery. If it does not happen they will fall back, but gilts could continue to prosper. Secondly, the government has a lot of gilts to sell. Unexpectedly it has slotted in an extra auction next week. So far, it seems, the gilts have been bought mostly by foreigners. But in a year or two a Tory government could be trying to sell at least Pounds 20bn net of gilts annually, a Labour regime Pounds 30bn or more. Domestic institutions will have to play their part. But because their attitude is poisoned by the long years of gilt-edged debauchery they may want a better interest rate than has been acceptable to the foreigners. Some of the big British institutions are shifting their strategies. Norwich Union, for instance, has raised its exposure to bonds somewhat. Yet bond returns are rarely exciting, and will only appear desirable if expectations for equity gains have been scaled right back. Most institutional fund managers have not yet been prepared to take that view. But the fact that in recent months they have been chasing supposedly greener grass overseas rather than chewing the apparently less digestible cud at home suggests that they are running out of reserves of optimism, although not of cash.</p>

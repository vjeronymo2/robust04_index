			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIVISION II GIRLS;  </P> <P> JALEWALIA RELIEVES PRESSURE AS LA QUINTA WINS, 44-38  </P> <P> The La Quinta and Sanger high school girls' basketball teams were feeling the  pressure Tuesday night in the opening round of the Southern California Division  II regional girls' basketball playoffs.  </P> <P> Sanger felt the crush of a full-court press and a half-court trap that forced  the Apaches into 30 turnovers. La Quinta felt the pressure that comes with  continually missing open shots and turning in a 12-of-60 shooting performance.  </P> <P> Finally, Amy Jalewalia stepped forward and ignored the pressure, hitting 10 of  10 free throws and a three-point basket in the fourth quarter to give La Quinta  a 44-38 victory at La Quinta. The Aztecs (28-2) will play San Diego Point Loma  on Thursday.  </P> <P> Sanger (20-12) started the game in a man defense but quickly switched to a  box-and-one after Jalewalia scored the Aztecs' 10 first-quarter points.  </P> <P> "We worked on the box-and-one all week because we knew she was a tremendous  player," Sanger Coach Roy Tanimoto said.  </P> <P> Until the fourth quarter, Jalewalia struggled with Erika Rodriguez or Renee  DeCanio shadowing her at all times. The rest of the Apaches formed a four-man  zone around the key, inviting the Aztecs to shoot from the perimeter.  </P> <P> The Aztecs obliged, taking the shots. Making them was a different story,  however. Excluding Jalewalia, the Aztec starters finished with a combined 13  points.  </P> <P> "In the CIF playoffs we were getting good performances from the (perimeter),"  La Quinta Coach Kevin Kiernan said. "They were knocking it down and getting  teams out of gimmick defenses. Tonight I thought we would do it again because  we were at home, but we didn't."  </P> <P> La Quinta disrupted Sanger's offensive rhythm with defensive pressure, holding  Sanger to five-of-26 shooting in the second half. "We just couldn't stop the  number of turnovers they forced us into," Tanimoto said. "A very fine ballclub  beat us."  </P> <P> Or a better ball player. Team Jalewalia scored 31 points, 16 from the free  throw line, and had 14 rebounds, five steals and three blocked shots.  </P> <P> The Aztecs trailed, 22-20, at halftime, but outscored the Apaches, 8-0, at the  start of the third quarter to take a 28-22 lead with 3:48 to play in the  quarter. Sanger took the lead again, 30-29, on center Cathy Isom's three-point  play a minute into the final quarter.  </P> <P> But Jalewalia made a three-point basket to give La Quinta the lead for good.  Isom, Sanger's leading scorer with 16 points, fouled out with Sanger down,  38-35, and 1 1/2 minutes to play.  </P> <P> Jalewalia made it to the free throw line five times in the final quarter. She  scored 13 of La Quinta's 15 points as the Aztecs outscored Sanger, 15-11.  </P></p>

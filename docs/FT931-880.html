			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trimmer HTV seeks alliances HTV, the independent tele-vision company for Wales and the west country, has set itself the target of creating a number of strategic alliances with international broadcasters. Talks have already begun and the company, which yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.1m for 1992 after an exceptional Pounds 3.77m charge, would like to attract both a US and a continental European minority investor. The aim would be partly defensive - ITV companies become liable for takeover from the beginning of next year - and partly to expand programme production. Mr Louis Sherman, chairman, said the year had been 'most difficult' both for HTV and the commercial television industry. The company's operating profit increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 5.4m on turnover of Pounds 133m (Pounds 172m). The pre-tax loss compared with profits of Pounds 441,000. When announcing the 1991 results Mr Sherwood had said that he expected 'a significant recovery in 1992.' The exceptional item related mainly to redundancy and restructuring costs. Losses per share deepened to 2.7p (0.5p) and there is no dividend (3.75p). The cost savings, which would continue, have included the merging of the Wales and the west divisions, salary reductions and the casualisation of most of the technical areas of the company. In the broadcasting division there are 413 staff compared with 599 at the end of 1991. An extraordinary Pounds 8.7m was partly to reduce exposure to further losses in the Fine Art division. HTV is trying to sell 10 non-television businesses including those involved in fine art. The shares fell 8 1/2 p to 29 1/2 p.</p>

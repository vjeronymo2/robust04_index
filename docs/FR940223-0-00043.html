			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> E. The development of adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their obligations under the CAA, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors, or at the option of the state, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the CAA; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. The development of procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Ombudsman  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDER has appointed a Small Business Ombudsman and established a Small Business Ombudsman's office which will act as the small business community's representative as required by section 507(a)(3) of Title V of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Compliance Advisory Panel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDER established a Small Business Air Pollution Compliance Advisory Council (SBAP CAP) effective on July 7, 1993, to meet the required November 1994 deadline of section 507(e) of title V of the CAA. The SBAP CAP is composed of seven members as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two members selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the state legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SBAP CAP has the following four responsibilities:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree and severity of enforcement actions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act; <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP to report on the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> compliance  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> of the SBAP with these three Federal statutes. However, since state agencies are not required to comply with them, EPA believes that the state PROGRAM must merely require the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering to the general principles of these federal statutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) To review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) To develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDER has incorporated section 507(c)(1) and defined a Small Business Stationary Source as a source that:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Operates in Florida;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Is not a major stationary source;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDER has established the following mechanisms as required by section 507:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A process for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the CAA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A process for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet the provisions of Sections 507(c)(1) (C), (D), and (E) of the CAA, but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants; and (3) A process for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation with the EPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for public comment, of any category or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcategory of sources that the FDER determines to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient technical and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this action, EPA is approving the PROGRAM SIP revision submitted by the State of Florida through the FDER. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates no significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective April 25, 1994. However, if notice is received within 30 days that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments, this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent notices will be published before the effective date. One notice will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. Approval of this action relieves EPA of any obligation to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan for the SBA PROGRAM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by April 25, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by ANC President Nelson Mandela on 31 </F> March; place not given]    [Text] The declaration of a blanket state of emergency in  Natal and kwaZulu was done in consultation with the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC] as a last resort measure to prevent the  further loss of life in that troubled part of our country.    I have personally been deeply saddened by the countless  numbers of ordinary people who have lost their lives in the  violence that has racked South Africa. Innocent blood has been  shed, and all South Africans, regardless of their political  affiliation, race, ethnic or language group, have been  diminished by it. These are losses to South Africa as a nation  which all of us should mourn.    Today's action, has one purpose and should have one purpose  only: that is to stem the tide of violence, which if left  unaddressed will engulf us all. It is criminal that the  citizens of this country - who ever they are - should be reduced  to pawns in the political games of ambitious leaders. People  deserve the right to be able to lead their lives without fear of  violence. They deserve the right to express themselves without  threats of death being visited upon them. They deserve the  right to choose for themselves whether or not they will vote in  the coming elections.    These are the issues at stake in Natal and kwaZulu and no  political rhetoric must be allowed to obscure that. The state  of emergency enjoys my wholehearted support and I appeal to all  South Africans to abstain from any actions that will impair its  purpose.    I shall expect all ANC organised structures in Natal and  kwaZulu to so conduct themselves as to assist the attainment of  the objectives I have underscored. ANC members and supporters  must take the lead in ensuring that the climate of violence and  bloodletting in that province abates so that our people in Natal  and kwaZulu can freely exercise their rights to participate in  the elections, if they so choose, or to stay away from the polls  if that is their decision.    I am making an appeal to all of us to remain calm. There are  those who fear democracy and are bent on creating the maximum  amount of chaos through acts of violence and mayhem. We have  already seen them in action in a number of cities.    We must all affirm our commitment to peaceful, free and fair  elections by protecting every citizens right to participate  without let or hindrance from any quarter. As leaders of  political opinion we must all affirm our commitment to peaceful,  free and fair elections by asserting and protecting the right of  every political party, however objectionable we might consider  its views, to express itself and canvass support without fear of  intimidation from any quarter.    That it has been necessary to have recourse to such measures  in Natal is highly regrettable. As a movement we have used  every ounce of the talent we have to try to find another way.  We remain committed to seeking a dialogue with King Zwelithini  Kabhekuzulu. We shall continue bilateral discussions with the  Inkatha Freedom Party. I am ready to proceed with the propose  summit among President de Klerk, Chief Minister Buthelezi, the  Zulu monarch and myself.    A number of measures become necessary if this limited state  of emergency is to achieve its stated purpose. I expect that  the security forces will with all deliberate speed take steps to  contain the perpetrators of violence and death. All those  persons whom investigations have implicated in hit squad  activities should be apprehended, charged and brought before the  law courts as swiftly as possible. All members of the security  forces who have similarly been implicated should be disarmed and  suspended from duty forthwith. This necessarily must include  the Caprivi Strip trainees who have since been absorbed in  various structures of the kwaZulu administration. I expect, too  that the training camps established with the express aim of  destabilising that province will be shut down immediately.    While these drastic measures have become necessary to save  life, we must not allow the draconian powers which the state has  assumed to become yet one more obstacle on our road to  democracy. The mini-state of emergency has been proclaimed so  that the elections may proceed in an atmosphere of calm. Its  provisions must not be subversive of free political activity nor  must they be employed to harass and intimidate the political  opponents of the kwaZulu administration. Police units, such as  the Internal Stability Division, that have demonstrably lost the  confidence of a wide section of the African community should not  be deployed in Natal.    The postponement of the April 27th elections is not an  option  that our country can afford. I reaffirm the ANC's stand that we  shall not contemplate such a postponement. The steps taken  today should enable us to proceed to the agreed election date in  a context of relative peace.    All of us must assume responsibility for seeing this  transition through to the end. The ANC will play its part. We  invite other political parties to do likewise. We cannot and  shall not allow the spoilers and the wreckers to succeed. To  succumb to their threats and bullying tactics now would be a  fatal error.    The ANC remains extremely confident about our country's  future. This is a truly historic moment of opportunity and  challenge. In years to come we will look back on these days as  but an interlude in a period of great optimism. The future we  can build as a nation beckons us. Let us all work together and  we shall surely build a better life for all South Africans.</p>

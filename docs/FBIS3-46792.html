Newtech Z II, a private computer research institute, built  the dual-microprocessor, dual-Operating System (O/S) Notebook in  a state-promoted "medium-tech" project over five months at a  cost of 1.2 billion won (1.4 million U.S. dollars), of which 750  million won was put up by the ministry.    The world personal computer market is mostly divided between  IBM and IBM-compatible microcomputers and Apple microcomputers,  and attempts have long been made to make the two compatible.    "Computer users can now have an IBM PC and Macintosh O/S on  the same computer," institute President Chong Chan-ik told  reporters.    The notebook has both an Intel 486-DX CPU (Central  Processing  Unit) and a Motorola 68030 CPU, which work together through four  home-grown chips.    The institute will complete a prototype by end of January  for  introduction at an international computer show in Hannover,  Germany, in March.    Production of the dual O/S Notebooks is due to begin in June  to export 100,000 units, Chong said.</p>

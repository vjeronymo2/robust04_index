			<p>BFN     [Text] UN Special Representative Dr. Aldo Ajello said today  that in his next report to the UN Security Council he will  inform them that despite the fact that Mozambique's peace  process has progressed significantly, there are still serious  problems to be resolved. These include the slow confinement of  government and Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] forces  and the need to find a speedy and realistic solution for the  formation of the new Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [FADM].  Ajello revealed that these and other issues of concern will be  thoroughly discussed in a Supervision and Control Commission  meeting scheduled for this afternoon. In this meeting, the UN  representative in Mozambique will propose a date for closing the  assembly areas and by then all soldiers who will join the new  army should be in training centers, and those remaining ones  should be demobilized. He said these guidelines should be  established immediately, stressing that the debate scheduled for  today will be an opportune time to discuss the issue.    In his normal Friday news conference, Dr. Aldo Ajello called  attention to the fact that 55 percent of government soldiers and  81 percent from Renamo have now been confined in assembly areas.  He expressed profound concern, saying this is a problem, and  added that if this tendency persists, there will be problems in  concluding the process.    Ajello revealed that 14,306 government soldiers and 561 from  Renamo have now been demobilized. The UN Operations in  Mozambique Technical Demobilization Unit has a list of 18,859  government soldiers and 1,112 from Renamo that should be  demobilized. Aldo Ajello said the process of demobilizing  soldiers from both sides is very slow. Renamo must demobilize  4,000 soldiers and the government 60,000. Meanwhile, he noted  that Afonso Dhlakama's movement is slower in demobilizing its  forces, although President Joaquim Chissano and the Renamo  leader agreed to speed up the process in their last meeting.  Ajello said that until now nothing of what they decided on the  issue has been fulfilled. The UN Security Council will discuss  these issues by the end of the month and it is expected that if  appropriate measures have not been taken by then, the UN will  take appropriate steps in accordance with the circumstances.    Concerning the process of the formation of the new armed  forces, the UN special representative in Mozambique revealed  that the movement of soldiers to training centers scheduled for  this week has been concluded, despite the fact that a number of  soldiers refused to join the new army. According to the program  for forming the new army, the soldiers will be trained in Boone  center, located in Manhica District, Maputo Province and Dondo  center in Sofala Province under the supervision of British  instructors. Since it is expected that a large number of  soldiers will be trained, the participation of Zimbabwean  instructors is being considered. Aldo Ajello said the most  important thing now is to completely demobilize all those who  will not join the new army and to consider the possibility that  the formation of the new forces may be extended to the post  electoral period.</p>

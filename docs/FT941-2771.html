			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (12): Doors open to foreign credit - Foreign Debt The agreement between Poland and its London Club creditors for a 42.5 per cent reduction and rescheduling over 30 years of its total Dollars 13.2bn debt to foreign commercial banks re-opens the door to Polish commercial borrowing on international capital markets. The deal signed in Frankfurt on March 11 is arguably the most important single economic and political event since former finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz inaugurated his shock therapy market reforms in January 1990. That is certainly the view of Poland's plenipotentiary foreign debt negotiator, Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, who steered negotiations for the Polish side. 'The London Club agreement means normalisation of financial relations. It will enable Poland to raise the finance needed to ensure continuing economic growth and to meet the hump in debt repayments ahead,' he said. 'Without such an agreement Poland would have been forced to renegotiate the Paris Club agreement (with official creditors) and that would have been suicidal. A window of opportunity opened up and we took it,' he says. Under the terms of the outline agreement the net present value loss to the banks of the write-off will be around 42.5 per cent. This is below the 50 per cent sought by Poland which was required by its 1991 Paris Club agreement with official creditors to seek a deal similar to the two-stage 50 per cent write-down in Poland's Dollars 33bn official debt. The banks refused to be bound by the Paris Club terms, however, and argued that Poland, a potentially rich country with considerable natural resources, a skilled labour force and a fast-growing economy, could afford to pay more. Poland will repay part of the Dollars 9.3bn principal and Dollars 3.8bn unpaid interest and a menu of instruments repayable over 30 years. These include 45 per cent discounted bonds, on which interest will be repaid at market rates, par bonds with interest well below market rates and 'new money' in the form of base debt bonds at below market interest, but repayable over five years. Mr Krowacki expects the initial cost to Poland of the London Club agreement will be around Dollars 1.3bn in 1994, of which Dollars 500m will be provided by the World Bank and Dollars 300m by the IMF, leaving Dollars 500m to be financed from the reserves of the Polish National Bank. Poland's total debt servicing charge, including London Club repayments, will probably exceed Dollars 6bn annually by the end of the first decade of the new century, Mr Krowacki calculates. By then the gamble is that steady growth, partly fuelled by access to international capital markets, will have greatly increased Poland's GDP - and its capacity to finance a higher debt burden.</p>

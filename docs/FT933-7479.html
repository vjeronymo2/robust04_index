			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Pakistan set for credit of Dollars 350m PAKISTAN is almost certain to receive a Dollars 350m (Pounds 235m) short-term credit from the International Monetary Fund to back economic measures announced by the interim government in Islamabad on Thursday. The IMF said that on the basis of the government's economic programme, the fund's management would recommend that its executive board approve a standby credit at a meeting in mid-September. The short-term financing would later be replaced by medium-term IMF loans expected to total about Dollars 1bn. Short-term financial assistance is needed because Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves fell to a low level during political turmoil which resulted in the resignation of the president and prime minister last month. Medium-term funding cannot be agreed until a new government is in place after elections on October 6. The IMF said the economic programme announced by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the former World Bank official who is caretaker prime minister, sought to reduce domestic financial imbalances and strengthen reserves. Mr Qureshi, attempting to tackle the chronic budget deficit, introduced a tax on rich landowners and promised to crack down on tax evasion as well as inefficiency and corruption in government. Import tariffs are to be reduced sharply over three years to between 35 and 50 per cent from the current average of 90 per cent. He took advantage of a lack of political affiliation to take sensitive decisions which previous governments have been unable or unwilling to address. Though there will be doubts about the ability of the next government to carry through Mr Qureshi's programme, the country's economic situation will put it under pressure to do so. The IMF medium-term money will also be a powerful incentive. The Pakistan Moslem League, the party of former prime minister Mr Nawaz Sharif, said the reforms were an endorsement of its own policies, but criticised Mr Qureshi for pushing through such important changes as a caretaker leader.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: Dutch inflation falls again Dutch inflation is continuing to slow. In the year to April, the consumer price index rose by 2.8 per cent, compared with a 2.9 per cent increase in March and 3.0 per cent in both January and February, the Central Statistical Office said. The April rise partly reflected higher telephone charges and increased government duties on alcohol and petrol. The statistical office also reported yesterday a rise in Dutch consumer spending to 2.5 per cent in real terms in the year to March. This compared with a 0.9 per cent rise in February and a 1.4 per cent decline in January. The sharp increase is partly because there were five Thursdays in the month compared with four in March 1993. Shops in many Dutch cities stay open late on Thursdays. March retail sales in Germany rose a seasonally adjusted 1 per cent from February in both nominal and real terms and rose a real 2 per cent and nominal 3 per cent year on year, the Federal Statistics Office said. Sweden's consumer price index rose 0.4 per cent in April from March bringing the annual inflation rate to 1.8 per cent in April, unchanged from a month earlier but down from 5.1 per cent in April 1993, the national statistics agency SCB said. Austria's merchandise trade deficit widened significantly in March, to Sch12.3bn, 21 per cent higher than in February and 29 per cent higher than in March, 1993, the Austrian National Bank reported yesterday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner replied to  the letter he received from Irfan Ljubijankic, foreign minister  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, on 23 December 1993 concerning our  initiative for Bosnia-Herzegovina's participation in the  Partnership for Peace. The letter stresses that  Bosnia-Herzegovina's application will be considered and that all  NATO members have been informed about this initiative.    Partnership for Peace does not represent formal membership  in  NATO. It implies mutual obligations of NATO member states and  those countries whose foreign and defense policies have the same  aims as those of NATO member states. This idea was initiated by  U.S. President Bill Clinton and, in the initial stage, it  referred to some Central European countries that have already  met the conditions for participation in Partnership for Peace.  In his letter to Ljubijankic, Woerner expressed the belief that  this year will bring peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina.    This was stated in a communique issued by the Foreign  Ministry of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

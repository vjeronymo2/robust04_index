			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED FACE IN SUNSET;  </P> <P> SKIPPER IS RESCUED AFTER FALLING OVERBOARD  </P> <P> Robert Hutchison stretched out in the folding chair on his boat deck Monday,  squinted into the afternoon sun and tried to explain why he was still alive.  </P> <P> "I was too embarrassed to die," joked Hutchison, he and a group of friends  dissolving into hearty laughter. " . . . It was bad enough that I'd fallen  over. I wasn't going to complicate things by dying."  </P> <P> But he had come close.  </P> <P> Shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday, as his 50-foot sportfishing boat made its way from  Santa Catalina Island to King Harbor in Redondo Beach, Hutchison tumbled over  the rear of the boat and into the 64-degree waters off Long Point.  </P> <P> Wearing only swimming trunks, the Redondo Beach general contractor swam for 4  1/2 hours, finally reaching a mid-channel buoy. An hour later, about 12:30  a.m., a Coast Guard cutter found him clinging to the buoy.  </P> <P> Hutchison, 37, who suffered mild hypothermia but was not hospitalized, said he  found Buoy 7TL by following the sound of its bell.  </P> <P> "I heard ringing in the distance and just kept going in the direction of the  buoy," said Hutchison, captain of the sportfisher Grand Slam. "When I got  there, I just hung on."  </P> <P> If he hadn't, a Coast Guard spokesman said, he might not have survived.  </P> <P> "He was really fortunate there was a buoy out there," Lt. Jim Milbury said.  "Otherwise, this could have been a real tragedy."  </P> <P> Indeed, it had all the makings of one, friends said.  </P> <P> "It looked bleak," said Bob Beauchamp, 41, who had been piloting the vessel  that carried him, Hutchison and two others from a weekend fishing excursion  Sunday. "About 10 or 20 minutes after he fell over, we saw that he was missing.  We spent 4 1/2 hours searching before the Coast Guard told us to go back (in to  port). . . . That's the limit they think a person can survive out there.  </P> <P> "I didn't think I was ever going to see him again."  </P> <P> But Hutchison, who fell overboard when the boat dipped suddenly as he emptied a  bait tank into the water, said he remained optimistic throughout the ordeal. "I  didn't want to be defeated," he said. "I wanted to see my family again. I  thought of my (three) children the most. I wanted to see them again. I wanted  to live."  </P> <P> Even after the helicopter and two cutters dispatched by the Coast Guard  arrived, rescuers had trouble spotting Hutchison in the darkness and  two-foot-high swells. Hutchison led the crew to him by whistling.  </P> <P> Had the cutter not discovered him, Hutchison said, he was prepared to continue  toward the mainland.  </P> <P> "I thought they had missed me," he said. "I was just going to keep swimming."  </P></p>

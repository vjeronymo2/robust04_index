			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Deadlocked Russian cabinet fiddles while the rouble burns: The currency approach 1,000 to the dollar IN THE ornate hall of a Stalinist-era skyscraper, the young men with the cellular telephones yesterday saw the relentless slide of the rouble as a reflection of everything that is wrong with the Russian economy. As the Russian currency teetered on the brink of the psychological threshold of Rbs1,000 to the dollar - only to be stopped at Rbs994 by the central bank selling what is thought to have been Dollars 30m dollars for roubles, so President Boris Yeltsin was telling the cabinet that stabilising the exchange rate should be one of its key priorities. Apart from making the politicians jumpy, the currency's slide is seen as a national humiliation by ordinary Russians brought up on decades of the artificially-fixed exchange rate where one rouble was worth more than the US dollar. 'This psychological aspect does not affect dealers and banks as it does public opinion, those who read the newspapers,' said an official on Moscow's Inter-bank Currency Exchange (Micex), where the rouble is traded twice a week. 'Those who are part of the market have a kind of objective view of what's happening. The round numbers do not make any difference.' Since the launch of market reforms a year and a half ago, the rouble's decline against the dollar from Rbs200 has been an unpleasant mirror of high inflation, lax credit policies, and a lack of faith in politicians' promises to make things better. Few observers doubt it will go through the Rbs1,000 barrier when trading resumes on Monday, as part of a new pattern of daily trading. 'It would be very strange if the rouble stabilised since credit emission is continuing despite all this talk of stabilisation,' said Mr Andrei Koshelev one of the dealers representing the Russian banks which trade on the exchange. 'Everybody is looking for a miracle to live better,' said Mr Alexei Osenmuk, the exchange's deputy director. 'But the rouble reflects the real situation in the economy.' In his office on the other side of the Moscow River, Mr Kakha Bendukidze, one of Russia's wealthiest men, smiles with satisfaction. As the head of a large private group of companies, he makes most of his money exporting Russia's rich natural resources for dollars, and is delighted that the central bank is no longer intervening aggressively to support the currency as it did last year because this means the currency's fall is uninterrupted and therefore more predictable. The slide has, however, caused him to stop importing consumer goods for sale in Russia. For state importers of commodities such as sugar and grain, which continue to enjoy subsidised exchange rates, the shock has been less brutal. But the subsidies indirectly fuel inflation because the central bank simply prints the money. For industrial companies which do not enjoy a subsidised exchange rate, spare parts and inputs are becoming unaffordable or are driving up prices even further. Officially, the government and the central bank have agreed that the latter will no longer sell precious dollars to support the rouble until inflation is brought under control. Apart from stabilising the country's finances by cutting the budget deficit, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, wants to widen and deepen the currency market through so-called technical measures. These include plans to allow foreign businessmen to open rouble bank accounts and sell hard currency, a move which has been resisted by the central bank as enabling foreigners to buy up Russian assets on the cheap. But many Russian officials agree with western lawyers and bankers in saying that opening the market will not help unless the Russian authorities define clearly what foreigners are allowed to do with roubles. 'It is practically impossible for somebody to invest in something without firm guarantees, and the right to private property,' says Mr Osenmuk. There is little doubt that the most important obstacle to the rouble's stabilisation is the authorities' lack of credibility, stemming from their failure to implement a united, and comprehensive economic reform package. Not only do the central bank and finance ministry not trust each other, but the cabinet itself is divided between radical reformers and conservatives. President Yeltsin has yet to use his victory in the referendum last month to break the deadlock.</p>

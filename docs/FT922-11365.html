			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Consumer confidence lifts hopes of slow UK recovery A RISE in consumer confidence and a sharp increase in import volumes have boosted prospects for a hesitant UK economic recovery later this year. A survey of consumer confidence by Gallup, the market research company, showed that the balance of people expecting economic conditions to improve was the highest for five years. The poll was held immediately before and after the April 9 general election. Meanwhile, Central Statistical Office figures showed that the underlying volume of imports grew by 3 per cent in the first quarter compared with the final three months of 1991. However, underlying export growth over the period was flat, reflecting the slowdown in the world economy which might damp the pace of a UK upturn. Other CSO figures showed that retail sales volumes in March fell to their lowest level for almost a year, but many in the City shrugged off the figures, arguing that they were distorted by electoral uncertainties and the lateness of Easter. The Gallup poll, on behalf of the European Commission, showed that 42 per cent of those surveyed expected the economy to improve over the next 12 months, compared with only 20 per cent who were pessimistic. It also showed that the balance of consumers expecting their own financial position to improve over the next year was the highest since August 1987. Retail sales volume fell by 0.8 per cent in March compared with February, bringing the year-on-year decline to 3 per cent. In the three months to March sales were flat compared with the previous three-month period. Although the drop in sales reversed the improvement in January and February, economists said a strong month-on-month rise in sales of household goods suggested a more encouraging picture of underlying consumer activity. In the three months to March, sales of household goods - a sensitive indicator of consumer confidence - rose by 2 per cent compared with the previous three-month period. The volume of sales fell in all other retailing sectors. Sales of clothing and footwear fell 2.6 per cent but the decline was most evident in mixed retail businesses where sales dropped by 3 per cent, month-on-month. The City will attach more importance to April's retail sales figures which should reflect Easter spending, better weather and post-election confidence.

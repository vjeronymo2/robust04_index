			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Peter Gill under the rubric "Opinion": "US in </F> Need of More Dexterity"]    Americans have never coped well with the possibility they  might be wrong. Even as others notice that Washington is  conspicuously out of step with the Asia Pacific region, the  Administration maintains the fiction that everyone else is  putting the wrong foot forward.    An important test of that perception will come next week  when  President Clinton decides whether to revoke China's "most  favoured nation" [MFN] trading status.    US singlemindedness on such issues as human rights (China  and  Burma), trade barriers (Japan), labour standards (Indonesia and  the World Trade Organisation) and even Singapore's corporal  punishment regime, could have serious implications beyond the  Beltway.    There is a strong chance the "tough" US stand on such issues  will undermine useful initiatives like the Asia Pacific Economic  Cooperation [APEC] forum in which its protagonists are members.    Place APEC at risk and you threaten the foundations of the  entire foreign-trade policy strategy to which the Keating  Government is now so strongly attached.    Indeed, unless APEC remains a credible centrepiece of  regional relationships in the Asia Pacific, Australia will be  left facing a dangerous vacuum. Bilateral relationships can  never, for a medium-sized power like Australia, substitute for  the clout of an effective region-wide body like APEC when it  comes to shaping the environment in which business is conducted.    Recent events have already shown it is not possible to  quarantine from APEC the impact of an aggressive US stand on  issues of regional sensitivity.    An informal APEC trade ministers meeting in the margins of  the GATT finale in Marrakech, Morocco, last month was pervaded  by the antagonism generated by US attempts -- ultimately  successful -- to get labour standards onto the agenda of the new  World Trade Organisation.    The developing world, in particular the ASEAN, remains  unconvinced by US claims that its position on labour standards  is based on a concern for human rights and adequate working  conditions.    Instead, they see it as undisguised protectionism aimed at  cutting the developing countries' comparative advantage of cheap  labour. As Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir put to a  receptive Beijing audience two weeks ago: "(The) professed  concern about workers' welfare is motivated by selfish interest."    At the Marrakech meeting, ASEAN showed its discontent. A US  offer to host an upcoming APEC trade ministers meeting was  rejected in favour of a rendezvous in Indonesia -- on ASEAN turf.    Workers' rights is one of a number of sensitive issues where  the US has shown an apparent disregard for the views of Asian  nations or given a relatively unsophisticated response to any  alternative opinion.    Relationships with Burma's military regime is another.  Again, there are no shades of grey in Washington's foreign  policy filter. The US wants Burma isolated while ASEAN is  pursuing constructive "engagement".    Sanctions threats are also the preferred device to pressure  China on human rights and Japan on trade.    The face-saving formula announced yesterday by the US and  Japan to revive their trade talks retains retaliation as a US  response if Japan fails to open its markets to the extent  required by Washington. Meanwhile, US protectionism -- in areas  as diverse as agriculture, entertainment, and government  procurement -- continues unabated.    Senior US officials seem to take an almost perverse pride in  maintaining that while many countries support US trade and  foreign policy goals, few support its methods. And little  effort is made to engender more positive views of the US in Asia.    From a country where respect for the law is profound, US  President Clinton inexplicably cast doubt over the integrity of  the Singaporean justice system by implying the recent vandalism  confession of Michael Fay may have been coerced.    US Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, compounded the  President's indiscretion. He said the US would oppose  Singapore's hosting of the first World Trade Organisation  ministerial meeting next year -- a move widely regarded as  retaliation for the caning of a US citizen.    But the bruised backside of a US teenager fades by  comparison  with the possible impact of a withdrawal of China's most  favoured nation status. MFN gives the emerging economic giant  of North Asia the same access as others to the US market. Its  removal would have a devastating impact on China's economy and  cause collateral damage throughout the region.    The President, and Secretary of State, Warren Christopher,  have been strongly counselled against such a move by many  outsiders, including Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Gareth Evans.    Insiders are now also sounding the alarm. According to a  recent Washington Post report of a confidential memo from  Winston Lord to his boss Warren Christopher, the Assistant  Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs warned: "A series of  American measures, threatened or employed, risk corroding our  positive image in the region, giving ammunition to those  charging we are an international nanny, if not a bully."    "Without proper course adjustments, we could subvert our  influence and interests," Lord said.    The Lord warning -- which cited Evans' criticism -- is being  interpreted in some quarters as reflecting a greater awareness  and recognition of regional sensitivities. A wider review of US  policy might even be under way.    Or Washington may simply have recognised it needs China's  support, or at least acquiescence, in any attempt to curb North  Korea's nuclear ambitions.    President Clinton's June 3 decision on China's trade status  will show whether Washington has started to develop the policy  dexterity required for a constructive relationship with the  region.</p>

Responding to suggestions on allowing direct cross-strait cargo  shipments and setting up a cross-strait free trade zone, Chiang  noted that the Ministry of Economic Affairs [MOEA] had drafted a  program on shipping services between designated points on the  two sides, but for political reasons it is not likely to be  realized in the near future.

The DGBAS noted that Taiwan manufacturers' unwillingness  to import high technology will affect the pace of technological  upgrading on the island.

According to the report, if tariffs are lowered by 10 percent,  Taiwan's manufacturing industry will suffer a loss of $NT3.1  billion [$120 million], but its consumers will benefit by as  much as $NT4.7 billion [$180 million]. The BOFT said the  economic benefits from Taiwan's GATT entry will outweigh  economic losses, except for household appliances and  automobiles, the economic benefits of which will be slightly  smaller than the corresponding losses.

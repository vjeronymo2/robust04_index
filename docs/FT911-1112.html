			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Curfew in Washington to prevent more riots CITY officials in Washington reimposed a night curfew late yesterday on a mainly Hispanic area of the city in an attempt to prevent a third night of riots and looting. The Mount Pleasant area of the US capital, about two miles from the White House, was under curfew and a state of emergency, as was the district of Adams Morgan, between midnight Monday and early yesterday morning. The disturbances have involved gangs of youths breaking shop windows and looting, fires, destruction of vehicles, and skirmishes with a thousand police officers. Calm prevailed during daylight yesterday. The new curfew last night was to be from 7 pm to 5 am. Deputy Police Chief Edward Spurlock said the disturbances were the worst in Washington since 1968, after the assassination of Martin Luther King jr, the black civil rights leader. The violence, though contained within a few hundred square yards, crossed 16th Street, one of the city's main arteries and came within walking distance of the main residential and office areas. The disturbances followed the shooting of a Hispanic man by a police officer who was trying to detain him for public drinking. According to the police, the man, now in a critical condition, drew a knife; a Hispanic witness said he was handcuffed when shot. This triggered the waves of violence against property and police on Sunday and Monday evenings in the Mount Pleasant and Adams Morgan areas. The latest events have underlined tensions between the generally poor Hispanic community and the District of Columbia government and police, which are predominantly black, reflecting the city's racial composition. Hispanic/black tensions in Washington have been matched in other US cities, where there are large Spanish-speaking populations, often made up of recent immigrants, who argue that they are badly treated. After the first night's riots, local residents told the new mayor, Ms Sharon Pratt Dixon, that Hispanic people were harassed by the police and poorly treated by city agencies. Many of the Hispanics are recent refugees from central America and speak only Spanish. Ms Dixon promised to improve communications and said district agencies would hire more Hispanic people.</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Crest project criticised as 'too complex' The Bank of England's handling of the Crest share settlement system has been sharply criticised by a former executive of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, in an article published late last week in a legal journal. The article argues that paperless share settlement, which is due to be in operation by 1996 or 1997, could have been achieved more cheaply and quickly by augmenting the stock exchange's existing Talisman and Institutional Net Settlements systems. It argues that Crest is unnecessarily complex and that it creates additional risks that do not currently exist in share settlement. The approach outlined would have left the stock exchange broadly in control of share settlement and left no visible role for the Bank of England. It is understood that the article, originally submitted last autumn for publication in Butterworths Journal of International Banking and Financial Law, was withdrawn at the request of the Bank of England, which wanted it delayed at least until after an important Crest taskforce report was published in February. The author, Ms Kathleen Tyson-Quah, who was an assistant director in SIB's capital markets division, resigned in March. The SIB has declined to comment on the article specifically. However, it said: 'We believe the Crest project is progressing successfully but we don't wish to make any further comment because we have a formal recognition role under the Financial Services Act.' The bank began setting up Crest immediately after the collapse of the stock exchange's own Taurus project for paperless share trading. The aim in both cases has been to reduce risk in equities trading by cutting the time between agreeing a bargain and receiving shares or payment, which requires the elimination of paper share certificates. Ms Tyson-Quah argues that instead of building a new system, shares could be transferred through electronic messages. Among the great shortcomings of Crest, she argues, is that it calls for 'gross' settlement of equity trades and is likely to require some securities firms to increase their bank borrowings substantially. Separately, the British Bankers Association is already holding talks with the Bank of England about this area. Responding to the article, the bank said it had considered the option outlined by Ms Tyson-Quah at an early stage of Crest development but 'all things considered' decided that Crest was a better option. A key factor was their view that Talisman is nearly 20 years old and its technology is insufficiently flexible. Waves of concern, Page 8</p>

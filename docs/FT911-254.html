			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: An alibi for pay rises Sir, the apparent logic advanced for a few top businessmen's recent large salary increases, as reported in the FT, has been (a) a bonus for the previous year's good trading; (b) that non-executive (ie independent) directors have determined and recommended the increase; (c) that a firm of outside consultants (also independent) have recommended it. Normally, the first of these reasons has much claim to merit as it is based on performance. But it carries less weight in the present difficult times when - as in the case of Prudential  - the rise was accompanied by a cut in policyholders' bonus rates, by nine figure losses on forays into estate agency and reduced profits. The second and third reasons advanced cannot easily claim any such logic, particularly if the companies whose boards have voted the increase have suffered huge losses, as in the case of Midland Bank. We live in a country of rising unemployment (with excessive wage settlements), an increasing number of bankruptcies and a still unacceptably high rate of inflation against which most people have little or no hedge. Awarding company directors large salary increases seems particularly unhelpful and insensitive in view of current economic conditions, even if boards believe they have an alibi in the shape of outside consultants' recommendations. In any event, the moral responsibility for the implementation (or rejection) of such recommendations lies with the boards which commissioned them. The antennae of some company boards seem inadequately fine-tuned for sensitivity. The disadvantages of living in an alibi society is that bad judgments are too easily overlooked.

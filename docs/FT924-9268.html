			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Magistrate says move in public interest 'THESE reports will be the guardian, rather than the foe, of justice and the public interest,' said Mr Christopher Bourke, the magistrate in the case of Mr Larry Trachtenberg, when he lifted reporting restrictions on the case, John Mason writes. His comment went to the core of the protracted legal argument over whether the media should be able to fully report the court hearings. Mr Trachtenberg, backed by the Serious Fraud Office, argued that the hearings would attract widespread press coverage and that this might prejudice his main trial, due to start in early 1994. Mr Trachtenberg and the SFO pressed for restrictions to be imposed which prevented the publication of any details which identified Mr Trachtenberg personally or made any reference to the Maxwell affair. They argued that public interest in the general question of defendants refusing to answer section two questions after they had been charged could still be served by anonymous reporting of the basic issues. However, lawyers for newspapers argued that such limited reporting was against the broad public interest and unworkable in practice. It could also lead to rumour and confusion, since readers might think the trial concerned the other defendants in the Maxwell case. They also cited the decisions of the judges in the Guinness and Blue Arrow fraud trials who had ruled that the public interest in the full reporting of the first trials outweighed any possible prejudice to subsequent trials. Mr Bourke initially applied the reporting restrictions, but lifted them two weeks ago pending Mr Trachtenberg's appeal to the High Court for a judicial review. Mr Trachtenberg's application was refused yesterday.</p>

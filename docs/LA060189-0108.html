			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The United States is extending a program allowing certain foreign visitors into  the country without a visa to include four more nations, the State Department  announced. The entry privileges, granted under a test program running through  1990, will now be given to citizens of France, the Netherlands, Switzerland and  Sweden, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. Earlier this month,  President Bush announced that Italians and West Germans would be able to enter  the United States without visas under a pilot program. First authorized in 1988  for citizens of Britain and Japan, the program permits a visa-free stay of up  to 90 days in the United States.  </P></p>

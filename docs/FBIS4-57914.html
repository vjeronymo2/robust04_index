			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 24 May (PL) -- Today, General Raul Castro,  minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, praised the work  done in the area of agriculture by the military youth  detachments, and he said this is one of the corps of which he is  most proud.    Castro, who is also second secretary of the Communist Party  of Cuba, made this statement during a tour of three integrated  farms administered by the Youth Labor Army (EJT) in Havana  Province.    Raul Castro visited the the Kent Martyr labor unit in  Artemisa Municipality, and the Calderon-El Cedro and La Flor de  Cuba units in Alquizar Municipality, where he showed interest in  crop yields, production costs, labor productivity, and rational  use of fuel and other resources.    There, the pass system used by the young soldiers, their  discipline, and the new organizational methods that have been  introduced -- such as working in blocs (the concentration of  manual labor and resources in one unit of land), which permits  an increase in productivity and the saving of resources -- were  all explained to him.    The Armed Forces minister congratulated the EJT members, as  well as the civilian agricultural workers who assist them in  their tasks, for the good results obtained, and he urged them to  continue their efforts to overcome the difficulties caused by  the lack of fertilizers and fuels.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Payments for EU programmes cut The drive to cut government spending next year has been helped by a large cut in payments to Brussels to fund European Union programmes, including farm subsidies. Payments to the EU in 1994-95 were set in the Budget at Pounds 1.35bn, a cut of Pounds 1.3bn on the Pounds 2.65bn envisaged in the March Budget. However, the cut is more than compensated for by higher UK spending on EU projects this year and in 1995-96. In these years payments have been boosted by Pounds 1.04bn and Pounds 890m respectively. Under the new plans, Britain is due to channel Pounds 2.45bn to EU projects this financial year and Pounds 2.89bn in 1995-96.</p>

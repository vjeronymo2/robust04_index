			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 25 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam proposed Thursday [24 March] that his country,  Japan and China work together to control environmental pollution  and promote joint study of oriental medicine and other projects.    Kim made the proposal during a breakfast meeting at the  guest  house with Korean correspondents stationed here.    Declaring that Korea, Japan and China are the three most  important nations in Asia, Kim said they must undertake joint  study of their common culture based on Chinese characters.    As China is rapidly undergoing industrialization, Kim said  the Yangtse River, which runs into the West Sea, is becoming  more polluted and the three countries must tackle the problem  immediately. The Chinese Government has already agreed to his  proposal at the working level, Kim said.</p>

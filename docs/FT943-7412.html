			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Business as usual for rubber pact Rubber producers did not renew demands for higher reference prices at an International Natural Rubber Organisation meeting here yesterday, leaving the group free to sell rubber at current prices, officials said, reports Reuters from Kuala Lumpur. Mr Aldo Hofmeister, Inro's outgoing buffer stock manager, said its executive council met and decided to continue with current buffer stock sales without changing the reference price. 'The executive council has decided to continue selling,' he said after the conclusion of the special executive meeting. Most of Inro's 26 members attended. Inro began selling from its 220,000-tonne buffer stock on July 8 after world prices spiralled to 6-year highs. The group has sold most of its stockpile, except for unspecified amounts in its US and British warehouses, but the disposals have failed to cool the world market. Mr Hofmeister said the option to revise the reference prices, which guide the buffer stock manager in buying or selling, was mentioned but not discussed. 'All three options of either suspending, reviewing the rate of sales or revising the reference price were brought up but the council decided on the status quo,' he added. Producing countries have long demanded higher reference prices - an issue holding up negotiations for a new price stabilisation pact, the International Natural Rubber Agreement III. The second round of talks to to negotiate Inra III will be held in Geneva from October 3 to 14. Several delegates who attended Monday's meeting said none of the delegates from the producing countries discussed the reference price issue. 'The producers must be satisfied with the price as it is,' one delegate said.</p>

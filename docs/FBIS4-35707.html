			<p>BFN     [Text] Asyut, Egypt, June 1 (AFP)--A suspected Muslim  militant shot and seriously wounded a policeman in southern  Egypt late Wednesday, a source close to the security services  said.    Salim Muhammad, a railway policeman, was in charge of  security on the Cairo to Aswan train when he was shot as it left  the station in Abu Mawas, in the al-Minya Province in Upper  Egypt, 270 kilometres (167 miles) south of Cairo.    Security services launched a manhunt, after his attacker  fled  the scene, the source added.    Asyut is a stronghold for militants who have waged a  two-year  campaign to topple the secular government of President Husni  Mubarak, which has left more than 400 dead, including policemen.    But until recently al-Minya had not witnessed many clashes  between security forces and militants.</p>

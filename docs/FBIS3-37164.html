			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Hold the Front Page!" </F> rubric: "Chief of General Staff Hands in Resignation"]    [Text] MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has come to learn that  Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Defense  Ministry General Staff, handed in a request to resign before  last weekend.    The chief of the General Staff sent the request to Supreme  Commander Boris Yeltsin right after Kolesnikov had met with  Pavel Grachev in person. In requesting his resignation, the  colonel general writes that he wants no part in the further  disintegration of the Russian Armed Forces. It is still unknown  for how long the president will consider the request.  Consultative meetings of Yeltsin with Grachev, his deputies,  and commanders of combat arms are being planned already this  week, however, where the question of the resignation of the  chief of the General Staff will no doubt be raised.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government plays down U-turn on pit closures THE GOVERNMENT was last night putting a brave face on its imminent climbdown over the future of the coal industry following a cross-party committee's agreement on plans which would save at least half of the 31 pits threatened with closure. As ministers finalised a draft of the white paper on the mining industry, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, denied the government faced a U-turn on the pit closures. Pledging to take 'very careful account' of what the committee had to say, Mr Eggar warned that any proposals were 'likely to cost the economy as a whole more than the proposals we came forward with in October'. Ministers have focused on plans by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to create an additional market of just 12m tonnes. But advance warnings yesterday from potential Tory rebels, including Mr Winston Churchill, chairman of the Conservative Coal Group, suggested the government would be unlikely to get away with proposals to save fewer than the 15 or so pits the select committee report implies. Mr Heseltine is due to meet representatives of Mr Churchill's group in the next couple of weeks to discuss the government's plans ahead of publication. One school of thought last night was that the government would risk defeat in the Commons debate due after its plans are published if it conceded too little. Labour might win over some Tories by tabling an amendment calling for the adoption of the select committee's recommendations. The cabinet body also discussed which pits should make up the total number to be reprieved, with one line of argument that British Coal should take the decision on the basis of which pits would be most able to survive when the support was fully withdrawn. Other ministers have suggested, however, that the government should decide and be able to take into account factors such as local unemployment levels, and the readiness to alter working practices. The select committee's 300-paragraph report states that there should be no increase in consumer electricity charges as a result of a proposed five-year subsidy. It expresses a strong preference for raising the funds needed by diverting part of the nuclear levy to coal. As an alternative, the money could be obtained direct from the Treasury. Ministerial opinion appears to be hardening against using the nuclear levy as a subsidy route. This money would help finance the installation of clean coal technology and subsidise 16m tonnes of extra domestic coal output - enabling British Coal to deliver it to the electricity supply industry at world prices. The first-year cost of the report's proposals is estimated at Pounds 300m, of which the direct coal subsidy would account for about Pounds 120m, equivalent to Pounds 7.50 a tonne. The extra market would be created by postponing the planned liberalisation of the UK electricity market, giving power companies freedom to sign more long-term contracts. The report also suggests measures to achieve sales of a further 3m tonnes of coal outside the electricity sector. The report proposes both a new licencing authority and an Energy Commission with powers modelled on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It also recommends that all proposed pit closures be referred to the modified colliery review procedure.</p>

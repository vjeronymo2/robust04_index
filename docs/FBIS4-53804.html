			<p>BFN     [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] made  an urgent proposal to North Korea today that it will immediately  send its negotiators [hyopsangtim] to Pyongyang to discuss  necessary steps [pilryohan chochi] regarding the replacement of  fuel rods at a nuclear reactor. We have news from Vienna-based  reporter Cha Man- sun:    [Begin Cha recording] A few minutes ago, the IAEA issued a  special statement regarding North Korea's replacing fuel rods at  the nuclear reactor. After assessing that it can take all  necessary steps to implement the nuclear agreement in the  initial stage of replacing fuel rods at the North Korean nuclear  reactor, the IAEA has made an urgent proposal that it will  immediately send a working- level delegation [silmu taepyodan]  to North Korea to discuss the issue.    The IAEA has issued the statement because it believes that  it  cannot verify the conversion of nuclear materials by North Korea  if North Korea continues changing fuel rods without taking any  necessary steps -- such as taking samples from the spent fuel  rods -- for the inspection team.    In particular, the IAEA warned that it has no alternative  but  to report to the IAEA Board of Governors, as well as to the UN  Security Council, because North Korea's changing of fuel rods  without taking any steps according to the nuclear agreement  required by the IAEA is a grave violation of the agreement.    The IAEA has asked North Korea to immediately cooperate on  necessary steps according to the nuclear agreement  [haekhyopchongsang pilryohan chochie chukkak hyopcho] and, at  the same time, urged it to delay changing the fuel rods.    Finally, the IAEA warned that it cannot but make a  conclusion  that it cannot verify the previous conversion of nuclear  materials by North Korea [kwago pukhanui haekmulchil chonyongul]  if North Korea continues changing fuel rods in the future.

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Venezuela (2): Jittery prelude to a year of elections - Lessons of the coups that failed VENEZUELA'S political system was pushed into crisis in February by a military uprising aimed at toppling the elected government of President Carlos Andres Perez. It is too early to tell whether last week's second abortive coup of 1992 will further retard - or accelerate - efforts to restore stability to the system. The small group of officers who led the February rebellion in the army said, among other things, that they wanted to eliminate corruption in the political and military establishments, get rid of a vitiated political system, end economic policies that condemned most Venezuelans to poverty and guarantee Venezuela's sovereign rights in dealings with foreign powers. Last week's attempt suggested the disaffection spread further into the armed forces than had hitherto been expected, with units of the air force, navy and national guard joining the army in the rebellion. The rebels' February statements struck a chord among Venezuelans, but after the November putsch the public reaction appeared more negative. Many people appeared to reject military government. The attempted coups, actions not seen in Venezuela since the days of left-and right-wing violence in the early 1960s, unleashed waves of anti-government and anti-system sentiments, and pushed the political parties into crisis. The military remained uneasy after February and political violence erupted when a small group of civilians tried to assassinate individuals they identified as corrupt. Violent street protests organised by leftists and students caused widespread public concern during the first half of the year, but tapered off after July. Last week, military appeals for people to take to the streets in support of the rebels were largely ignored. President Perez, whose five-year term of office is due to last until February 1994, has had to fight off public calls for his resignation, and his administration has been under constant attack for its support of free market reforms and its failure to make any significant improvements in public services such as water, health, education, transportation and public safety. The two main political parties, President Perez's Accion Democratica (AD) and the main opposition group, the Christian Democrat Copei Party, have been wracked by divisions and contradictions. Sometimes supporting Perez on key issues, the two groups have also attacked his government on fundamental policies. They have failed either to establish a clear line of support for the besieged government or to offer a coherent and credible opposition. Perez's AD party has been sharply divided over his economic policies since the first months of his presidency. Only two small leftist parties, MAS and Causa R, have been consistent in their demand for his resignation and the scrapping of economic reforms initiated in 1989. Most people now focus their anger on President Perez, blaming him for practically everything that is wrong in Venezuela. Ironically, it is Mr Perez, a product of the old system (where a small group of AD and Copei leaders controlled most major policy decisions) and a man severely criticised for allowing widespread corruption during his first presidential term in 1974-79, who for nearly four years has made the greatest efforts at reforming Venezuela's economic and political systems. Public opinion polls taken since February consistently give Mr Perez and his administration very low approval ratings. (They also received poor ratings before the putsch.) And to varying degrees, most of the country's prominent politicians - including the AD and Copei leaders who want to run for president in 1994 - also obtain poor rankings. Two figures have remained highly popular since February: Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who led the February uprising, and former President Rafael Caldera, the founder of Copei who was chief executive from 1969-74. Chavez, who has become something of a folk hero, is still in jail awaiting a court martial. Mr Caldera, 77, is widely respected for his honesty and intelligence. His popularity rocketed on the day of the February revolt when, in an impassioned speech to Congress, he said it was difficult to ask Venezuelans to sacrifice themselves to defend a regime that failed to feed the people. The former president currently is a leading potential candidate for the presidential race in 1993, in competition with his former protege, Mr Eduardo Fernandez, secretary general of Copei. Mr Caldera and Mr Fernandez fell out after the younger politician defeated the Copei founder in a vote for the party's last presidential candidacy. If Mr Caldera cannot reconquer his party for the 1994 campaign, he is likely to run as a candidate for the socialist MAS. After the February putsch the president promised to install a constituent assembly to reform the Constitution. But the Congress, dominated by AD and Copei, ignored the idea and developed a long and controversial list of amendments it planned to approve this year or next. These proposals were shelved after the Venezuelan media proprietors started a public campaign against changes that would restrict ownership of media by individuals and economic groups, and oblige them to allow a 'right to reply' from citizens attacked in the press. Venezuelans are scheduled to elect state governors, mayors and city councils in elections on Sunday but the outcome is unpredictable. It is already clear, however, that most Venezuelans oppose the Perez government's economic policies. The main uncertainty is how many people will bother to vote. Abstention in regional elections in 1989 reached 54 per cent nationwide and 73 per cent in Caracas, despite the fact that voting is obligatory under Venezuelan law. A high abstention rate would probably favour AD and Copei which are geared to 'get out the vote' for their candidates. Elections to choose a new president, national Congress and state assemblies are scheduled for December, 1993. In past years, it was clear by this stage who the main candidates would be. But now the outlook is clouded by turmoil within the two main parties. Venezuela's military, like most of the population, wants sweeping reforms. For the time being, the rift between middle-rank officers (who generally want rapid change) and the high command (who have supported Mr Perez and the institution of the presidency) has not caused problems. Venezuela's political system, like the economy, is undergoing a transition that probably will take several years. Despite many efforts to derail his reforms, Mr Perez has indirectly shaken up the traditional power of Venezuelan politicians who served as intermediaries for businessmen, students and other favour seekers under a highly controlled bureaucracy. By opening up the Venezuelan economy and reducing government interference, he has dramatically reduced opportunities for corruption, as well as the power of party leaders and followers to 'get things done'.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / ICI faces tough talks on HFCs ICI, the UK's biggest chemicals company, faces tough negotiations with the government over the future of Pounds 250m of investment in production of gases that are now seen as environmentally damaging. In a document published yesterday on meeting obligations under treaties to protect the atmosphere, the government says it is committed to reducing emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. HFCs are used in refrigerators and air-conditioning units to replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which damage the ozone layer. But HFCs are themselves greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming and, because they are new products, UK emissions in 1990 were negli-gible. ICI insisted yesterday that HFCs did not damage the environment any more than other products. Mr John Beckitt, ICI's business manager for the product, which is sold under the name Klea, said: 'In many applications they reduce energy consumption and therefore carbon dioxide emissions.' It has three plants - one in Runcorn, Cheshire, one in Louisiana in the US and half of a joint venture in Japan. Total investment is Pounds 135m, of which Pounds 30m is in the UK. The document acknowledges that the UK will have difficulties meeting the emission target by 2000. It says the government 'will therefore be exploring further with HFC producers and consumers how best to make progress in relation to the UK commitment'. It says it will be 'exploring the scope for voluntary agreements to ensure that (HFC) emissions are minimised and not used where unavoidable if safe, practical and more environmentally acceptable alternatives are available.'

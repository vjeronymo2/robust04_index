			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices for wool in Australia continued to drift lower this week, but yesterday the decline was checked, and the market indicator rose 3 cents to 505 cents a kg. This recovery was only achieved after quite large withdrawals by growers of wool before the auctions being held, due to dissatisfaction with prices likely to be realised. The quantity passed in was also large, about 17% at Melbourne and Sydney, 12% at Fremantle. Even the appearance of a firmer close before the Christmas recess, which starts at the end of this week, will help the market tone.</p>

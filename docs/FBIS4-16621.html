			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>   [Text] Almaty 19 April, TASS -- The new Supreme Soviet of  Kazakhstan began work here today morning. It will be half the  size of the previous parliament and will work on a permanent  professional basis.    The MP's, who have won their mandates during the 7 March  elections, are to decide some organisational questions first,  particularly the structural pattern of the parliament. They are  also to elect their speaker. Then the parliament will go over  to the endorsement of the agenda and to the discussion of the  items included in it.    But this may prove to be a difficult job. Several parties  and public movements of the republic have declared that they  would join the opposition against the present executive  authorities. And if the MP's, sharing their views, decide to  form their own blocs, the Supreme Soviet will hardly be able to  avoid an acute factional struggle for power from the very outset.    The MP's will also be influenced by the situation around  parliament house. More than 300 veterans of war and labor,  invalids, and representatives of work collectives are picketing  it from early morning today. They demand better living  conditions, steps to curb the inflation and growing prices. A  large meeting began there a short while ago. Its participants  are protesting against the government's economic and social  policy, which has placed many people far below the poverty line.</p>

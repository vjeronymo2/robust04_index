			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREPS;  </P> <P> CARSON'S VOLLNOGLE HOPES 5TH TIME IS REPEAT CHARM  </P> <P> With the 1989 City high school football season starting this weekend, Carson's  Gene Vollnogle is in a familiar position -- coaching the defending champion.  </P> <P> Last season, Carson defeated arch-rival Wilmington Banning, 55-7, in the City  4-A Division final, earning Vollnogle his seventh City title at Carson and his  ninth overall.  </P> <P> With several key players back from last season's 12-1 team, the Colts and  Vollnogle, who is starting his 27th season at Carson, are favored to repeat.  </P> <P> Winning consecutive titles has been difficult for Vollnogle, however. He has  accomplished the feat only once at Carson, in 1971 and '72. Since then,  Vollnogle's Colts have lost in the title game after a City championship season  four times, in 1973, 1983, 1985 and 1987.  </P> <P> Leading the way for the Colts this season will be quarterback Armin Youngblood,  who played mainly as a swingback last season and scored 11 touchdowns. His  primary targets are Tydus Winans and Michael Ross.  </P> <P> Linebacker Nkosi Littleton, 6-feet-2 and 220 pounds, an All-City selection last  season who has been chosen on several preseason All-American teams, is the key  to Carson's defense. The secondary will be led by junior defensive backs  Clayvand Thomas and Tarriel Hopper, who also punts.  </P> <P> As usual, Banning stands as the Colts' main threat to repeating, having  defeated Carson in title games in 1983 and 1985. Last season, the Pilots  finished 11-3, losing twice to Carson. Despite the loss of fullback Derek  Sparks, who transferred to Montclair Prep in Van Nuys this fall, Banning is  loaded with talent.  </P> <P> Returning is quarterback John Ma'ae, who completed 56% of his passes for more  than 1,200 yards last season. Ma'ae, also a dangerous runner, is one of the  best quarterbacks in Southern California. The main target of his passes will be  junior Michael James, who excelled in passing leagues this summer. On defense,  linebacker John Herrera is the Pilots' main force, along with defensive back  Nizam Walter.  </P> <P> San Fernando finished 8-4 last season and figures to be a strong contender,  largely on the passing of 6-3 senior quarterback Michael Wynn, who completed  108 of 209 passes for 1,614 yards and 24 touchdowns last season. In last  season's semifinal playoff game against Banning, Wynn threw for nearly 250  yards and four touchdowns.  </P> <P> Granada Hills, which defeated Carson two seasons ago in the City championship  game, is another talented San Fernando Valley team. Quarterbacks Chris  Gadomski, who passed for 1,158 yards last season, and Bryan Martin, a transfer  from Illinois, will lead an offense loaded with experienced skill-position  players. Leon Glasgow and Brett Washington will handle the Highlanders' rushing  attack, with William Moringlane and Jermaine Love the top receivers.  </P> <P> Last season, Dorsey had what many considered the most talented team in the City  in finishing 9-3. The Dons played every game tough, suffering two close losses  to Carson and one to Banning. In their semifinal game against Carson, the Dons  led 13-0 before losing 14-13 on a late Colt touchdown.  </P> <P> This season Dorsey will rely on the talents of wide receiver-defensive back  Kevin Copeland, who scored 11 touchdowns last season. The versatile Copeland  caught 33 passes for more than 660 yards last season, and returned two punts  for touchdowns.  </P> <P> South Gate, the defending 3-A Division champions, finished with a 14-0 record  in winning its first City title since 1955. The Rams will again be the team to  beat, thanks largely to running back Ivan Wilson, the 3-A player of the year  last season. As a junior, Wilson rushed for 1,979 yards and 23 touchdowns.  Returning with Wilson is Marco Diaz, who made all-conference last season at  center.  </P> <P> Franklin, which has won two of the last three City 3-A Division titles, will be  strong again, despite the graduation of All-City running back Lamont Lovett,  who became the City's first 2,000-yard rusher last season. Returning for the  Panthers is Lamont's brother, Lamar, who also made All-City last season as a  defensive back, and quarterback Santiago Alvarez, who directed Franklin to a  11-1 mark last season.  </P> <P> Westchester, which lost to South Gate in the title game last season, will be  looking for its third consecutive appearance in a City final. In 1987,  Westchester won the last 2-A Division title. This season, the Comets will be  led by tailback Tim Holliday, who averaged 7.1 yards a carry in rushing for  1,202 yards last season.  </P> <P> Holliday rushed for 172 yards in Westchester's upset semifinal playoff victory  over Franklin, which ended the Panthers' 20-game winning streak. Returning with  Holliday will be backfield mates Walter Grissom and Chris Bacus, who will run  behind a veteran offensive line led by three-year starter Calvin Dotson.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prep Notes  </P> <P> Backs to watch: Armin Youngblood of Carson, John Ma'ae of Banning, Michael Wynn  of San Fernando, Kevin Copeland of Dorsey, Ivan Wilson of South Gate, Lamar  Lovett of Franklin, Tim Holliday of Westchester, running backs Mario Mattison  of Fairfax, Jerome Casey of Sylmar, Shon Ellerbe of Crenshaw, Ontiwaun Carter  of Kennedy of Granada Hills and Jay Fields of Hamilton.  </P> <P> In Southern Section games last week, the Times' second-ranked team, Bishop Amat  of La Puente, lost on the road to No. 9 Riverside Rubidoux, 14-7. Also losing  was No. 4 Canyon Country Canyon, which played without injured star tailback  Chris Peery, to Newhall Hart, 30-12. On the winning side, top-ranked Fontana  rolled to a 47-0 victory over Montclair; Loyola of Los Angeles defeated St.  Paul of Sante Fe Springs, 28-6, with tailback Kahlil McAlpin running for 133  yards in eight carries; Paramount defeated Johnson of Sacramento, 39-6, with  Leon Neal rushing for 166 yards on 10 carries, and Los Alamitos crushed Marina  of Huntington Beach, 42-22, as quarterback Todd Gragnano passed for 280 yards.  </P> <P> In Los Altos' 13-0 victory over El Rancho of Pico Rivera, defensive end Mike  Collins made 11 tackles, caused three fumbles and returned an interception 25  yards for a touchdown. In Lompoc's 45-24 victory over Beverly Hills, junior  running back Napoleon Kaufman rushed for two touchdowns and returned a kickoff  and an interception for two more, with one punt return touchdown nullified  because of a penalty.  </P> <P> Tustin Coach Marijon Ancich, the winningest active coach in the Southern  Section, will have surgery for a broken right leg this week, after being hit by  one of his running backs last week in practice. Ancich, who coached at St. Paul  for 19 years and is in his sixth season at Tustin, has 218 victories and claims  that he has not missed a game in 28 years. He is doubtful, however, for the  Tillers' game against Mater Dei Friday night.  </P> <P> Key games this weekend include two Southern Section-City matchups. Friday  night, Carson, whose only loss last season was to Bishop Amat, will travel to  La Puente for a rematch, and Banning will take on Long Beach Poly at Veterans  Stadium in Long Beach. Thursday night, Los Alamitos will play host to Anaheim  Servite at Gahr High.  </P> <P> TIMES' PREP POLLS  </P> <P> Southern Section  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.64IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> No. School, League  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Record  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1.

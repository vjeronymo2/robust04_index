			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Metalrax improves margins METALRAX, the engineering components, housewares and storage equipment group, improved its margins in the first half of 1992 by 'matching costs to volume', according to Mr Eric Moore, managing director. Pre-tax profits rose by Pounds 13,000 to Pounds 3.32m on turnover lower by Pounds 1.8m at Pounds 30m. In the branded storage equipment and housewares divisions, which each account for a quarter of the business, Mr Moore said heavy discounting had been avoided and that product development was the key. In components, where the shrinkage in volumes was not unexpected, the investment in plant and equipment helped the group stay competitive. Mr Moore said the group was 'keeping its nose in front' in its trading in the second half, though the third quarter was traditionally quiet. Earnings were unchanged at 3p per share and a rise in the interim dividend to 1p is declared (0.91p adjusted).</p>

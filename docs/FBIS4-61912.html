			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 11 May -- Russia and Germany must look to  the future. After the pullout of Russian troops from the  territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, a new stage of  national reconciliation will begin between the two countries,  said Boris Yeltsin today at Vnukovo airport before his departure  on an official visit to Germany.    According to Boris Yeltsin, he will start the Russian-German  summit with "the most difficult question": the procedure of the  withdrawal of the Russian troops. There is no disagreement with  the German side as to the timetable for the pullout. The  president said it will be completed by 31 August. However,  there are still differences on the procedure. The Russian side  maintains that the last Russian troops will leave Germany from  Berlin, while the German side says that they should leave from  Weimar. "This is not the same thing," Boris Yeltsin stressed.  [sentence as received]    Boris Yeltsin stressed particularly that in the social  sphere  Germany had met all its obligations with regard to construction  of settlements for the military and accommodation for officers.  "It is the only country to have taken this approach; moreover,  additional social commitments worth 550 million German marks  have recently been adopted."    Boris Yeltsin revealed that during the visit a wide-ranging  package of documents on economic cooperation would be discussed  and that a mutual return of cultural valuables would not be  raised as a separate issue.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Welsh may get aid for cable growth Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, yesterday forecast an expansion of cable television in Wales with the possibility of financial help to take the service to rural areas. Mr Redwood told a Welsh Development Agency media seminar in Cardiff that the Independent Television Commission was preparing to advertise new franchises for much of south Wales early next year. After a long gap, the ITC has again been advertising franchises and recently offered a single franchise covering, at least in theory, all of Northern Ireland. Mr Redwood said yesterday that franchises for north Wales would follow. 'If companies think they need government help in remote rural areas, they should say so when submitting the possible extent of their interest,' Mr Redwood said. Mr Redwood's remarks are surprising because the cost of laying cable means that it is usually only viable in urban areas.</p>

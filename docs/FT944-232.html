			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Derivatives accounting Derivatives pose a challenge to those who devise accounting standards, not least because part of the raison d'etre of complex financial instruments is to circumvent existing disclosure rules. But derivatives have the power to transform a company's risks - for little cash outlay  - in a way which is not reflected in conventional historical cost accounting. The UK's Accounting Standards Board, currently examining ways of improving financial reporting in this area, is thus right to tackle the issue. The ASB is likely next year to recommend increased disclosure so that users of accounts get more information about the risks taken on by the company. Thus, companies may be required to disclose the impact of fluctuations in exchange or interest rates on balance sheet ratios. Some groups release this information voluntarily now, as part of a review of treasury policy in the operating and financial review which forms part of a set of accounts. The ASB should go further, for example requiring companies to recognise unrealised gains and losses incurred on derivatives. Given derivatives' inherent complexity, though, there is a danger that greater disclosure will sow confusion rather than understanding among users of accounts. But if the process of complying with such rules helps companies better to identify the risks they are letting themselves in for, neither management nor investors should complain.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Brittan says No to job as WTO chief Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, moved swiftly yesterday to damp speculation he could be in the running to head the new World Trade Organisation in Geneva, due to come into force at the beginning of next year. Mr Peter Guilford, his spokesman, said Sir Leon 'has no interest in the job and can foresee no circumstances whatsoever under which he would be interested'. There was speculation at the EU's Brussels headquarters that the linking of Sir Leon's name with the WTO vacancy was 'French mischief', part of a campaign by Paris to ditch Sir Leon's candidacy for the European Commission presidency. France is backing Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, to succeed Mr Jacques Delors. Sir Leon's name is not among those circulating in Geneva as serious contenders for the WTO post, who include Mr Renato Ruggiero, former Italian trade minister and now deputy chairman of Fiat, Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazilian finance minister, and Mr Philip Burdon, trade minister of New Zealand. Trade officials take a cool view of suggestions that the WTO might be some sort of consolation prize for failed candidates elsewhere. Lord Lawson, who is bidding for the OECD top job, has also been mentioned as a possible WTO chief. Mr Peter Sutherland, whose decision to step aside as director-general of the Gatt has created the WTO vacancy, is being mooted as a possible compromise choice as European Commission president. Mr Sutherland, who is Irish, has denied seeking the job. The workability of the new WTO will be established quickly through the use of its trade disputes procedure, according to Mr Sutherland.</p>

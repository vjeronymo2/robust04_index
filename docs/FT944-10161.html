			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Survey of Hungary (5): In politics, time proves a great healer Politics can make for few bedfellows stranger than the Socialists and Free Democrats, partners in the new centre-left coalition government. One would not guess from their present intimacy that they were formerly implacable opponents. The Socialists were once the communist satraps of the Soviet Union and their most vocal critics were precisely the dissident intellectuals who went on to found the Free Democrats, writes Nicholas Denton. This being Hungary, the truth is more subtle. The founders of the Free Democrats often came from communist family backgrounds and passed through Maoism to their final, liberal political destination. Meanwhile, Hungary's Communist rulers, chastened by the 1956 uprising, treated dissidents quite gently. 'With few exceptions, these oppressed people were not physically hurt,' says Mr Viktor Polgar, head of the Socialists' Budapest campaign. 'They had BMWs while I was driving around in a Toyota.' But Free Democrats still remember how, even in the late 1980s, police directed by the Communists beat up demonstrators on sensitive anniversaries. Wiretap reports of the Free Democrats' kitchen-table conversations were sent to ministers in the Communist government. The dissidents have no monopoly on hard feelings. Some reform Communists feel that they did the tough work of the transition while the opposition basked in the admiration of the west. 'The Socialists are people who fought for change, in a different way: they had to work within the system,' says Mr Polgar. 'I would have loved to have been in opposition.' Time has proved a great healer. Mr Ivan Vitanyi, a Socialist ideologist, now argues for an eventual merger of the coalition parties. One forgiving intellectual close to the Free Democrats has pushed for a liberal gesture to rehabilitate the former communist regime and give it credit for its relatively benign character. Political imperatives have dictated the rapprochement. The Socialists, despite their 54 per cent parliamentary majority, are still former communists. They are distrusted and even hated. The Free Democrats bolster their legitimacy. As for the liberals, Hungarian politics appears increasingly bipolar. Apart from an alliance with former communists the Free Democrats had unappealing options: going in with conservatives they detest or inhabiting and eventually dying in a no-man's-land between the political blocs. Mr Miklos Haraszti was one of Hungary's most hounded dissidents. He backs the coalition, but it is not easy. 'I support it and I hate it. We know we have to do it but we don't have to be happy about it. It is the least awful alternative,' he says. 'But that is democracy, isn't it?'</p>

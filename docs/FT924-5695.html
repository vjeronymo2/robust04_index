			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Big Blue recants its mainframe heresies - Louise Kehoe explains why IBM is placing new emphasis on 'client-server' computing CHANGE has become the only constant at the 'New International Business Machines', as the computer giant overhauls its operations, cuts its workforce and transforms itself into a decentralised 'federation of autonomous businesses'. The announcement this week that it is forming a business unit to focus on 'client-server' computing - in which mainframe computers are replaced by networks of desktop computers and 'servers' providing services, information and software - is, however, seen by some as the most fundamental shift to date. With its new emphasis on client-server computing, IBM has thrown out one of its most sacred tenets; the belief that the computing world revolves around the mainframe. For IBM, known in the industry as 'Big Blue', this is akin to the Catholic church's recent decision to recognise publicly the work of Galileo. Like the church, IBM has long privately acknowledged the truth of the matter: the mainframe is not the centre of the computer universe but merely one of many planets. However, by announcing an initiative to promote client-server computing, IBM has for the first time publicly put the mainframe in its proper place. 'The mainframe may or may not fit in. It does not have a pre-ordained role in every client-server system,' says Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM president. The new emphasis on client-server computing does not mean, however, that IBM has abandoned its mainframe strategy. 'This does not represent a shift away from the mainframe,' Mr Kuehler is quick to point out. He does not accept the notion that the 'mainframe is dead', as some of IBM's competitors would like computer users to believe. But rather than risk losing customers who decided to swap mainframe computers for networks of workstations or PCs, IBM will now offer systems integration services and software to help them move towards the new computing model. 'We see this as an important growth opportunity,' says Mr Kuehler. The new IBM division will focus on helping customers to 'migrate' toward client-server computing - finding ways to link different types of computers and optimise their performance. The client-server computing unit will work with IBM's existing business units, such as those that make PCs, mid-range computers and mainframes, to design customised client-server systems for clients. This may involve assembling hardware and software products from several IBM businesses, or looking outside IBM to third-party suppliers. As a last resort, the new business unit may develop 'glue' software needed to put together client-server systems. Although the new unit is designed to focus IBM's client-server products and strategies, this does not signal a reversal of the company's move to decentralise management, Mr Kuehler said. Putting together a complex client-server system using existing computers as well as new hardware and software 'transcends what IBM's individual lines of business can do', he explains. The new unit will not, however, try to dictate product strategies to IBM's newly independent product-line business units. Nor will it attempt to establish standard computing models, as IBM has in the past. Instead, IBM views the new unit as a marketing support effort that will help to boost sales of services and software as well as the hardware provided primarily by the company's product groups. IBM's pragmatism reflects the computer giant's renewed efforts to respond more rapidly to changes in the computer market and improve its financial performance. One measure of IBM's determination is that the new business unit was first proposed only five weeks ago at a bi-annual meeting of executives from all of IBM's business units. 'That is how fast we move in the 'New IBM',' Mr Kuehler boasts.</p>

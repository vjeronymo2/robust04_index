			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Warburg profits fall to Pounds 51.2m AN ABORTED leasing venture in Germany and trading losses stemming from the crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism this summer have cost SG Warburg more than Pounds 20m and dented its reputation as the UK's pre-eminent merchant bank. Warburg yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 51.2m for the six months to September 30, down from Pounds 91.5m in the same period in 1991. Its share price lost 45p to close at 479p. Warburg's fixed-income division lost Pounds 10m during the period, due to the upheaval in European bond markets following Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty and the exit of sterling from the ERM. Holdings of Ecu bonds accounted for much of this loss. 'We would have been running, as we always are, fairly big positions between the markets, and the Ecu was one of the positions we had,' said Lord Cairns, chief executive. The losses were at least partly balanced by foreign exchange profits, which helped the bank's treasury operations to record a strong half, but these had not been substantial enough to cancel out the fixed-income losses. The group's fixed-income division has now been merged with its treasury operations and the bank has changed its approach to marketmaking, said Lord Cairns. The group would in future be less willing to trade unless clients were prepared to reward the bank for its commitment. 'The balance of accommodation is changing and we need to recognise that.' He added that Warburg had no plans to withdraw from markets as a result. Warburg also announced a loss of Pounds 11.6m on its German office equipment leasing business, which was launched in the late-1980s. Credit losses experienced so far had led it to conclude it would never make substantial profits from the market. The Pounds 11.6m covers closure costs and 'very conservative' provisioning against possible losses on the leasing book, the bank said, though it did not release further details of the provisioning levels. The group's profits were bolstered by Mercury Asset Management, its 75 per cent-owned subsidiary, which recorded profits up to Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 35.5m, after writing off its investment in Isosceles with a further Pounds 4m provision.

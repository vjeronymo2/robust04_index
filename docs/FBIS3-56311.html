			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report from Moscow by correspondent Natalya </F> Chernyshova, including recording of interview remarks by Belarus  leader Stanislav Shushkevich; from the "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] On the eve of the Russian-U.S. summit, Belarus  leader Shushkevich arrived in Moscow for talks with Boris  Yeltsin. According to him, he has brought a whole package of  economic proposals, the purpose of which is the integration of  the two republics' economies.    [Chernyshova] Serious economic issues were discussed. The  market of our closest neighbor may be assessed as being in an  even greater plight than that of Russia. The inflation rate has  risen to more than 25 percent per month. The official rate of  exchange is 4.5 coupons for a ruble. The difference between  imports from and exports to Russia ranges from $36 to 100  million. Enormous amounts of money are being spent on  eliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.    Today, according to our correspondent, there was a wave of  rallies throughout the republic staged by industrial trade  unions. The main slogan called for halting the collapse of  production.    Recently, both in political circles and in the mass media,  there has been discussion of the desire of the two countries to  sign agreements on setting up an economic alliance and ruble  zone of a new type. These agreements will make it possible to  remove the technical barriers which restrict cooperation in what  is essentially a single people. At the same time, both the  Belarus opposition press and some Russian observers think that  such a decision will be detrimental to our countries. Belarus  will turn out to be subject to Russia once again and will lose  its sovereignty. Russia will be forced to provide additional  food to its closest but poor relative.    Such suggestions were rejected by Stanislav Shushkevich who  agreed to give us an interview after meeting Boris Yeltsin.    [Shushkevich] Where did all this talk come from about the  confrontation, lack of understanding, and selling out of the  interests of Belarus? Read our communique from today. We have  tried to state in the most concise form that the Republic of  Belarus and the Russian Federation are seeking ways of achieving  an extensive, real rapprochement of the two peoples. They are  seeking ways of expressing this drawing together in a  legislative document so that people should not experience  difficulties. We need to conclude a wide-ranging treaty on  cooperation which takes into account the actual situation today.    For us the main issue in setting up a ruble zone is that the  Russian ruble -- if we set up the zone on the basis of the ruble  -- should have the same value both in Belarus and in Russia. If  a variant like this can be found, then it must be done as soon  as possible.    [Chernyshova] If an agreement like this is signed, then a  new  basis for the rapprochement of our peoples will be opened up.

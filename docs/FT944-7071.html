			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Trident submarine escapes protest net Greenpeace protesters yesterday tried to stop the nuclear submarine HMS Vanguard from leaving its dock at Faslane near Glasgow as it was moving to a nearby dock at Coulport to have its Trident II nuclear warheads loaded for the first time, Bernard Gray in Faslane writes. A Greenpeace tug, Solo, and inflatable rafts tried to block Vanguard's path through a narrow channel in Gare Loch, which leads into the river Clyde. The protesters also attempted to tie a fishing net across the bows of the submarine. The net was removed by Vanguard crew members (above). Vanguard, Britain's first Trident submarine, was en route to Britain's main nuclear weapons storage base at Coulport. The submarine has completed its trials and nuclear warheads are being added to its missiles in preparation for its first deterrent patrol due to start in the next few weeks. A small group of anti-nuclear protestors also demonstrated outside the gates of the Faslane submarine dock as Vanguard began its early morning voyage which marked the start of its effective operational deployment. To load the warheads on to Vanguard's missiles, the 16,000-tonne submarine, which is almost as large as the Invincible class aircraft carriers, will be raised out of the water on a giant 85,000-tonne floating dock and shiplift. Raising the boat will take several hours. The delicate task of fitting the warheads will begin today and last until the middle of next week. The floating dock and shiplift are needed to provide maximum stability and to avoid an accident while loading the plutonium-powered, thermo-nuclear bombs. After completion of final tests once the warheads are fitted, Vanguard will begin its first operational patrol, replacing one of Britain's two remaining Polaris nuclear submarines. Cmdr Peter Wilkinson, who will captain Vanguard's first patrol, said he was 'well aware of the awesome responsibility' which he carried. He added that in spite of the end of the cold war the nuclear deterrent fleet carried out its mission exactly as it had always done. Cmdr Wilkinson acknowledged, however, that following an agreement between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, the submarine's missiles were aimed on an empty spot in the ocean. Switching the missiles to military or civilian targets would take 'a finite amount of time'. Just how finite was not made clear.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jovan Divjak, deputy chief of staff of the </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, by Franjo Bosnic in Sarajevo; date not  given: "The World Will Not Bring Us Peace"]    [Text] Once a lieutenant-colonel in the former JNA  [Yugoslav People's Army] and presently deputy chief of staff of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, Jovan Divjak is often both praised  and disputed in Sarajevo. He was even arrested in Konjic once,  suspected of selling ammunition to the Serbs. Our brief meeting  in Sarajevo was used for this interview, and we first asked him  to comment on conflicts between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and  the HVO [Croatian Defense Council].    [Divjak] It was difficult for members of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO to engage in a conflict,  which is a result of political desires to divide  Bosnia-Herzegovina that fit into the longing for Greater Serbia  and Greater Croatia. I have been in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army  and in the Supreme Headquarters from the very first day, and all  the while, we have been trying to involve patriots in the  defense of Bosnia-Herzegovina in its internationally recognized  borders. Unfortunately, some estimated that Bosnia-Herzegovina  should be divided on principles originating from Garasanin, on  the Serbian side, and from World War II, on the Croatian side,  not taking into consideration that all three nations have lived  and will continue to live in these parts. It is true that the  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina became even more complex and  that the attitude of Europe and the world toward it has changed  since the conflict began between the extreme parts of the HVO  and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. These conflicts have escalated  to the point where former friends and allies who were fighting  the common aggressor together are now perpetrating massacres  against each other, killing women, children, old people, and  burning each other's homes. Unfortunately, politics determined  some relations that do not suit the nations of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The aggressor from the east is best at this  game, the aggressor which began all this -- the fascist SDS  [Serbian Democratic Party] and parts of the former JNA with  extremists from Serbia and Montenegro. Joint goals of the HVO  and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in the beginning of the war are  now distanced due to some territorial pretensions and divisions,  due to the demand that a part of the territory be controlled by  some kind of Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian (Muslim) republic, which  is definitely not a referendum wish of the majority of people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Those conflicts will continue for a while,  for neither the Geneva talks nor any other negotiations under  the pressure of Europe and the world can produce any results.  Conflicts will stop only when all three warring factions agree  to sit together and have peace. That can happen in six months,  in a year, or more, but conflicts will rage on until the world  stops interfering.    [Bosnic] Tell us something about the Tuzla recipe for  relations between the Croats and the Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Divjak] This is not only the case in Tuzla; fortunately, it  is also alive in the Bosnian Sava Basin region and, to some  extent, in Sarajevo. It is a recipe of how one should live in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Representatives of the Croats and Muslims  on this territory have convinced us that they can and will live  together. There is yet another fact -- a new-old initiative on  the Bosnian nation is emerging. Many people spoke about the new  national organization. That is not bad, but the Croats,  Muslims, and the Serbs must not lose their national identity.    [Bosnic] As a soldier, what do you think about the Geneva  talks?    [Divjak] This is an attempt to forcefully solve the problem  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, former Yugoslavia, and the Balkans, and  not according to the wishes of citizens and nations that have  been living here for centuries, but according to the desire of  the old lady Europe. Let me remind you that in February 1993,  at the time when he was leaving his "throne," U.S. President  Bush talked to Russian President Yeltsin about the division of  interest spheres according to the Yalta agreement. Past  relations in Europe, in the Balkans, and in former Yugoslavia  mirror the relations between the United States and Russia. When  Russia pulls, the United States pushes its allies and injects a  couple of billion dollars into Russia. Even recently, the  United States gave $2 billion to Russia. We know about the  historic friendship of Russia and Serbia and that Serbia depends  on Russia, and Russia is protecting the "endangered" Orthodox  Church from Islam and Catholicism. History accepts the  destruction of a nation, ethnic cleansing, and those who want  integral Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Croats and the Muslims --  will suffer. Ethnic cleansing in this war mostly affected the  Muslims, but the Croats will not be spared either.    [Bosnic] Are you a Serb or an orthodox Bosnian?    [Divjak] I have always been a citizen of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  I have lived in Sarajevo for 28 years, and all the while, I feel  that I am a citizen without losing my national identity. I have  never accepted any nationalism and I never will. I am a citizen  of Sarajevo, a citizen of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a Bosnian and a  Herzegovinian. I feel like most honest people in these parts,  if you will. Bosnia is my only country; I have no other. The  Croats, the Muslims, loyal Serbs, all those who live in it, have  the same right to my country.    [Bosnic] Is there anything you would like to say to the  Croatian public?    [Divjak] Since this interview will reach the public in  Croatia and parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina in which there are  mostly Croats, I would like to clarify something. The Chetniks  -- the Serbian side -- accused me of being a criminal of war and  a traitor of the Serbs, while the Croats accused me of being a  member of the JNA intelligence service, a communist, and a  founding father of the Muslim army. In this war, I am fighting  for the equality of the Croats, the Muslims, and those Serbs who  fight in the Bosnia- Herzegovina Army and in the HVO. My  intentions were never aimed toward any single nation in  particular. Accusations that I advocated conflicts between the  Croats and the Muslims are senseless; this is propaganda by  those who are against integral Bosnia-Herzegovina in its  borders. Even if it is divided under pressure, those who live  here will arrange their relations as they have done for  centuries. Present leaders of all three national parties in  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be forgotten, but Bosnia-Herzegovina  will remain.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Insurer set up for London buses London Transport has been forced to set up its own insurance company to provide affordable cover to the 10 London bus companies which are due to be privatised later this year. Dublin-based Routemaster Reinsurance, named after the best-known of London's red buses, is intended to fill a gap in the insurance market. Mr Clive Pracy, head of risk management at London Transport, said the company would allow newly established management buy-out teams, which had no operating record to put to the insurance industry, to buy insurance at reasonable rates. Insurance premiums are expected to be the largest cost item in the bus companies' accounts after wages. The move by London Transport will be watched closely by the soon-to-be privatised train-operating companies which will also face difficulties in obtaining affordable insurance. Initially each of the 10 bus operators will become a shareholder in the new company, although membership could be widened to include bus companies from other parts of the UK. The company has been set up with Willis Corroon, an insurance broker, which will act as manager for Routemaster in the Irish Republic, and with Zurich Municipal, an insurance company which will provide cover in the UK. For many years London Transport covered its own insurance risks. In 1991 it moved to Municipal &amp; Mutual, now the Zurich Municipal, but it still carried a large 'excess', meeting the first Pounds 250,000 of each claim. Under Routemaster Reinsurance bus companies will meet only the first Pounds 5,000 of each claim.</p>

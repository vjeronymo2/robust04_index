			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / People: British Telecommunications The business logic behind British Telecommunications' investment in MW Marshall, one of the world's biggest foreign exchange brokers, may not be as powerful as it was, but for Barry Cameron Smail, who negotiated the deal, it has a happy ending. Cameron Smail, a 38-year-old Scottish accountant, has been BT's representative on the board of Marshalls Finance, MW Marshall's parent, since the Pounds 175m management buy-out in February 1989. After four and a half years working for Britain's biggest company he has decided to give up his job as finance director of BT's personal communications division and return to the financial services industry as an executive director of MW Marshall. His decision to return to full-time City life - he used to be treasurer of Commercial Union - is not entirely unrelated to the shrinkage in the size of BT. He was recruited to be BT's treasurer by Barry Romeril, the BT finance director, who recently departed for Xerox. The BT workforce has shrunk from 240,000 to 170,000 in Cameron Smail's time and he says that he missed the financial services industry. Mike Knowles, Marshall's chairman, says that now that the company has paid back much of its MBO debt it wants to start filling in some of the gaps in its activities and Cameron Smail will be responsible for expanding the capital markets side. 'We are very strong in cash markets but want to grow in off-balance sheet areas,' says Knowles. One of the reasons that BT took a 30 per cent stake in the MW Marshall buy-out was so that it could learn more about what its customers in the foreign exchange markets wanted. Although the market for sophisticated foreign exchange dealing equipment has not proved as lucrative as once thought, it is understood that in financial terms BT's investment in Marshalls has turned out well.</p>

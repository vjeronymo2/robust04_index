			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT MOVES TO EASE CASELOAD;  </P> <P> ATTORNEYS: JUSTICES PROPOSE GIVING STATE BAR AUTHORITIES BROAD NEW POWER TO  DISBAR LAWYERS.  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court, in a move to ease its heavy caseload, has  proposed giving State Bar authorities broad new power to disbar or suspend  attorneys for professional misconduct.  </P> <P> Up to now, only the justices themselves have performed that task, automatically  reviewing and issuing opinions in dozens of cases annually in which lawyers  contest Bar recommendations for punishment by the high court.  </P> <P> But concern has grown that the justices were spending too much of their limited  time on these relatively routine disciplinary matters, forcing them to neglect  important civil and criminal issues. A recent study showed that of 104 court  opinions issued in a one-year period, a record 43 came in lawyer disbarment and  suspension cases.  </P> <P> The court Friday released the text of proposed new court rules under which, in  all contested lawyer-discipline cases, the justices would grant oral arguments  and issue opinions only when there are "sufficient grounds" to do so.  </P> <P> Under the new rules, all rulings by the newly created State Bar Court ordering  suspension or disbarment would become final, unless the justices decide to  grant review of any resulting appeals.  </P> <P> Lesser punishments -- such as public reprovals -- will continue to be  administered by the Bar, as they have in the past.  </P> <P> "The new procedures are expected to result in a substantial decrease in the  number of cases in which the Supreme Court must hold hearings and write  opinions," a court statement said.  </P> <P> State Bar President Charles S. Vogel of Los Angeles welcomed the high court's  action, saying the new rules could both ease the justices' workload and speed  the overall lawyer-discipline process. "We're very, very pleased," Vogel said.  </P> <P> The proposed rules have been approved by the State Bar and now will be  circulated to local Bar associations for further comment. Final adoption of new  rules could come by January, a court spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Friday's action follows the court's adoption last month of rules that, as of  Dec. 1, will give the State Bar similar power to impose punishment in  uncontested cases. But those cases, while more numerous than contested cases,  have been handled by the court without time-consuming argument and opinions.  </P> <P> The State Bar Court, made up of nine full-time judges selected by the Supreme  Court, was created by the Legislature in 1988 to replace a system in which  part-time, volunteer attorneys heard and resolved complaints against lawyers  for breaking the law, mishandling funds, neglecting clients and other  misconduct.  </P> <P> More than 5,000 complaints are being filed annually charging errant conduct  among the state's 124,000 lawyers. Last year, a record 89 disbarments and 221  suspensions were recommended by Bar officials.  </P></p>

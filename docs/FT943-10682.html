			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Latest data fail to provide fresh impetus Wall Street US stocks paused after a two-day rally yesterday in spite of more economic data which may help to delay the Federal Reserve's next move to tighten monetary policy, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 1.95 at 3,796.22, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.45 at 460.56. Volume on the Big Board amounted to 295.6m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite edged up 0.12 to close at 439.74, while the Nasdaq composite eased 0.05 to 724.80. When the session commenced, stocks appeared to be heading for their third big gain in a row. The Dow industrials opened 12 points higher, building on a powerful 67-point advance which began late last week. Yesterday's economic news provided additional support to a scenario which had triggered the rally on Friday. The Commerce Department announced that sales of new single-family homes had dropped by 14.1 per cent in June to an annualised rate of 591,000. Analysts, who had expected a much more modest decline, said the downturn was evidence of the effect of more restrictive credit conditions. The data supported the view, advanced by last week's GDP report, that the Fed would hold off its next move to put up interest rates. In spite of the favourable news, stocks ran out of steam. Most equity investors were content to sit tight, delaying their next big moves until after Friday's crucial employment data. The keenly watched report may provide the Fed with the last piece of evidence it needs to make a decision on when to lift rates again. However, investors were showing no inclination to cut and run. Stocks across the board hovered within a tight range of their opening values, mirroring activity in the bond market. In pharmaceuticals, investors shrugged off an early report that SmithKline Beecham was negotiating an asset swap with American Cyanamid. But minutes from the close, news broke that another company, American Home Products, was offering to acquire shares in Cyanamid for 95 cents each. Trading in both issues was halted on the annoucement, with AHP at Dollars 56 3/4 , down Dollars  3/4 on the day, and Cyanamid at Dollars 63 3/4, up Dollars 3/4. SmithKline added Dollars 1/2 to finish at Dollars 32 1/8. The takeover bid gave a late boost to the entire sector, with Warner Lambert jumping Dollars 4 to Dollars 68 1/2, Schering Plough up Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 66 1/4 and and Pfiser ahead Dollars 2 to Dollars 63 1/2. Among the Dow industrials, a few cyclical issues showed improvement. International Paper was Dollars 1 3/8 stronger at Dollars 75 1/4 amid a general upturn among paper and pulp stocks. Elsewhere, Georgia Pacific gained Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 69 1/8 and Scott Paper added Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 60. United Technologies climbed as high as Dollars 64 1/4 during the morning but dropped back to close at Dollars 63, a net gain of Dollars 1/4. Over the last few sessions the stock has retraced some of the losses it had suffered on the release of its second-quarter results. Bethlehem Steel, up Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 23 5/8, appreciated amid reports of higher prices being paid by Chrysler for raw materials. National Steel moved Dollars 1 higher to Dollars 22 5/8 .</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "PLO Spokesman Praises Italy, Denies </F> Rumor"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 8 -- Italy was praised today for  the role the nation has played in the Mideast peace process in a  statement made by Nimr Hammad, the Palestinian general delegate  in Rome, who said rumors that Italians tapped for the observers  force in Hebron would be replaced by Spaniards were "absolutely  false."    Hammad told the Italian news agency ANSA that these rumors  "do not favor the peace process and the presence of observers in  Hebron" on talk picked up by the press according to which  Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasir 'Arafat was  preparing to ask Spain to send observers in Italy's place  because of political uncertainties in Rome.    This version of events originated Wednesday [6 April] in  Cairo where consultations had been started up on the Hebron  force of 160 lightly-armed Norwegian, Danish and Italian  observers.    The head of the PLO office here said that Italy is  well-liked  by Palestinians because over the years, since 1975, this nation  has extended its good offices to allow Israelis and Palestinians  to meet. "Unlike other countries, Italy never made propaganda  out of its activities within the peace process (and) in effect,  provided great help.    ``Since the beginning, since 1975, Italy has hosted many  secret meetings between Palestinians and Israelis. Various  ministers, in the present government as well, like Peres'  deputy, Yossi Beilin, have had their first contacts with PLO  officials in Rome or Milan,'' said Hammad with reference to  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres.    The PLO delegate also said that Italy contributes  substantial  financing for the Israeli-occupied territories and for  assistance for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and spoke of what  he said was the "virginity" or pristine nature of Italian  cooperation in Palestine where "everything is regular and  everything goes well."    These factors, he added, have created a climate of  "affection" for Italians. "In the territories, just say you are  Italian and you immediately feel the warmth of the people. Like  in Lebanon, moreover, where the Italian presence is highly  appreciated, you feel that the people's reaction to Italians is  positive."    On the international force to send to Hebron, Hammad said  discussions were under way on expanding the number and that it  is not now possible to name a date for the deployment of these  observers because there are numerous problems still open between  the PLO and Israel. One of these problems is the presence of  Jewish settlers.    "Their presence, with the ongoing presence of the Israeli  Army, would cause great tension, making the work of the  observers difficult," he added.    Last night, it was learned here that members of the  three-nation observer force to oversee peace in Hebron may visit  that city next week to lay the groundwork for their mission  there. The three working groups set up to prepare the mission,  which will involve 35 Italian, 35 Danish and 90 Norwegian  observers, were scheduled to gather separately today in Rome,  Tel Aviv and Cairo. They will then get together next week for a  reconnaissance trip to Hebron, sources said.    The observers force, dubbed Temporary International Presence  in Hebron (TIPH), was requested by Israel and the Palestine  Liberation Organisation March 31, after the Hebron mosque  massacre carried out by a Jewish extremist February 25. It will  mark the first time that armed foreign observers have been  allowed into the Israeli-occupied territories.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Management: From sexual simile to sexual 'crime' - Stuart Bentley on the dangers of a politically correct definition Few modern plays have generated as much controversy as David Mamet's Oleanna. It portrayed a disastrous series of miscommunications between a male college professor and a female student which finally destroyed the professor's career. In a disturbing example of life mimicking art, a male college professor at the University of New Hampshire is now on indefinite suspension without pay following a sequence of events remarkably like those portrayed in Mamet's play. The events raise important questions about academic freedom, individual rights and 'political correctness'. Donald Silva, 59, pillar of the local Congregational Church, and a faculty member at the University of New Hampshire since 1972, taught a course on technical writing. In one of his lectures, he compared an aspect of the creative process to sex. The simile was based on the to and fro quality of the movement and the sense of fulfilment that came at the end. On another occasion, when discussing the use of similes, he suggested that the movement of a belly dancer might be described as being 'like Jell-O on a plate with a vibrator under the plate'. These sexual allusions offended some of the female students who complained to the university authorities. Was this all there was to it? Apparently, yes. In subsequent enquiries it was reported that some female students felt the professor stood too close to them on certain occasions, but there was no definition of how close was too close. An administrative tribunal nonetheless found Professor Silva guilty of sexual harassment, defined in this case as 'creating a hostile and intimidating atmosphere' in his class. The professor was suspended without pay for a year, during which time he was required to undergo psychotherapy - at his own expense - to correct his supposedly deviant tendencies. He chose instead to bring legal action against the university, demanding reinstatement to the faculty, compensation for lost income and undisclosed damages. He thus remains suspended without pay pending the outcome of his law suit. The Silva case has split the University of New Hampshire community into those who see it as a question of academic freedom and those who see it as a question of women's rights. Both positions have merit and are defended passionately: an unlikely basis for rational dialogue. The university administration is understandably reticent about discussing the case but Eve Goodman, head of the university's sexual harassment and rape prevention programme, is prepared to comment. She says that if female students felt afraid to go to a professor's lecture, then 'we got a problem here'. We certainly have. As an American academic, I feel a personal interest in the Silva case, but its ramifications extend far beyond the confines of American academia. Sexual harassment is becoming an increasingly important issue throughout the developed world and definitions of what may or may not constitute sexual harassment have profound implications for working relationships in general. With attempts to define the limits of acceptable behaviour comes the image of a society dominated by politically-correct thought police. While such a prospect may be interesting as a dramatic premise, does it have any basis in reality? In the light of events at the University of New Hampshire, I am less complacent than I was. In my day-to-day dealings with students, I find myself increasingly aware that even the perception of 'inappropriateness' could be disastrous. This is especially true with female students, in whose company I now feel a level of personal vulnerability more appropriate to a minefield than a classroom. This is not paranoia. Official guidelines in most private and governmental organisations in the US include 'creation of a hostile and intimidating atmosphere' under the general heading of sexual harassment. The Silva case shows clearly that even casual references to personal bodily functions - especially those pertaining to reproduction - may be deemed to create such an atmosphere, constituting grounds for censure. This censure carries the same stigma as a conviction for indecent assault. The question of stigma is crucial to this debate. What is important in the Silva case is not what he was accused of but what he was not accused of. There was no suggestion, for example, of improved grades in exchange for sexual favours. No mention of groping, fondling or even 'inappropriate touching'. And if his similes generated an environment that his accusers found 'hostile and intimidating', where might these women feel comfortable? Surely not on the campus of a modern university, where ideas are expressed freely - sometimes even offensively - and established opinions are open to constant challenge. Most important of all: is the academic equivalent of a death sentence reasonable punishment for the 'crime' of using sexually-suggestive similes? It is now up to the courts to decide. Meanwhile, I am reminded of a song, extolling the politically-incorrect delights of 'standing on the corner watching all the girls go by'. I remember particularly the line that goes 'you can't go to jail for what you're thinking'. Such optimism may soon be out of date.

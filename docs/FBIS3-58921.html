Delcroix was asked about the general's departure by Pierre  Scharff of the PSC [Social Christian Party], Hubert Van Wambeke  of the CVP [Christian People's Party], Francis Vermeiren of the  VLD [Flemish Liberals and Democrats], and Claude Bougard of  Ecolo [French-speaking Green Party]. The minister made use of  the opportunity to heap praise on this "unusual general who  listens to the people, who is not out looking for war, and who  does not allow himself to be led by personal ambitions."    "Briquemont was driven in Sarajevo by a personal concern to  prevent bloodshed," said Delcroix. "He rightly refused to  resign himself to the senseless tragedy that was taking place  around him." In saying these words, the minister took out an  article from the OSLOBODENJE, the last newspaper in Sarajevo,  praising the general.    "General Briquemont has not neglected to alert the outside  world and international organizations to the weak points of  their intervention," continued the minister. He then said that  Briquemont "had not seen much" of the additional 4,000 troops  that had been promised months ago.    Delcroix reported how Briquemont had told him he intended to  write a book about his experience in Sarajevo, entitled "Do  Something General." That was the message delivered by "the  various diplomats who sometimes came to visit him." The  minister then subtly added that "the military must be given  precise orders to be able to function properly."    Delcroix decided that he has no regrets about letting the  general speak his mind freely. Once again he showed  understanding for "the physical exhaustion and mental fatigue"  of someone "who, in seven months never had a substantial night's  rest, continually had to negotiate with unreliable dialogue  partners, and also had to lead an army under the most difficult  circumstances."</p>

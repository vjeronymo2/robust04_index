			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE FOLLOW THE SCENT, TRACK DOWN COOKIE TAMPERING SUSPECT  </P> <P> A Mrs. Fields Cookies store policy that links employees with batches of cookies  they bake helped police Saturday track down a 20-year-old employee suspected of  adding staples to a white chocolate cookie.  </P> <P> Michael Steven Connors of Anaheim, who had worked at the Mall of Orange store  five weeks, was arrested at his home in connection with the incident and also  on $2,700 of outstanding traffic warrants.  </P> <P> Connors became a suspect after a customer returned a cookie to the store about  6 p.m. Friday. Company officials ordered the store closed and employees turned  over to police the remaining stock of 48 cookies and three trays of brownies,  some of which had been sprinkled with staples. No injuries were reported and  police called the case an isolated one. The store was open Saturday.  </P> <P> Debbi Fields, president and chief executive officer, said it was the first such  incident in the cookie chain's 12-year history. "I am shocked and concerned  that this could happen," Fields said in a written statement from the company's  headquarters in Utah. "I am especially pleased to know that the police found  there has been no one injured."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the company said store policy that requires employees to rotate  from sales to baking positions at different times of the workday helped tie the  suspect to a batch of cookies made between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. Friday.  </P> <P> Orange Police Sgt. Ed Falkenstien said Connors could be charged with adding  harmful substances to food, a felony. Police have not determined the motive  behind the tampering.  </P></p>

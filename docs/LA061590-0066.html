			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COURT UPHOLDS KILLER'S DEATH SENTENCE;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: A 6-1 DECISION REJECTS AN APPEAL BY A SANTA ANA MAN. HE WAS CONVICTED  IN THE 1983 RAPE AND FATAL STABBING OF A BANK TELLER OUTSIDE A GARDEN GROVE  BAR.  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the death sentence of a Santa Ana  man convicted in the rape and frenzied fatal stabbing of a Norwalk bank teller  outside a Garden Grove bar in 1983.  </P> <P> The justices, in a 6-1 decision, turned down an appeal by Richard Raymond  Ramirez, 31, a thrice-convicted felon found guilty in the murder of Kimberly  Gonzalez, 22. Ramirez is not the Richard Ramirez sentenced to death for the  series of "Night Stalker" murders in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> In Thursday's ruling, the high court acknowledged in a majority opinion by  Justice Allen Broussard that there were procedural errors in the case but  concluded that they were not significant enough to overturn the conviction and  sentence.  </P> <P> In one instance, the court said, the prosecutor was improperly allowed to  cross-examine Ramirez's mother and elicit admissions about the defendant's  criminal record as a juvenile and his use of narcotics.  </P> <P> Such questions went beyond the scope of the mother's previous testimony for the  defense about the family's troubled home life and thus was inadmissible, the  justices said. But the incidents she related were "relatively innocuous"  compared to the other evidence of criminal activity the jury properly heard,  Broussard wrote for the court.  </P> <P> The justices also said the trial judge, in upholding the jury's recommendation  of death, had erred in considering a probation report that referred to parts of  Ramirez's criminal record that had not been presented to jurors.  </P> <P> But in making his decision, the judge relied primarily on evidence that was  placed properly before the jury and the incidents in the report did not play a  significant role in his ruling, the court said.  </P> <P> In his ruling, Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin found that  the factors favoring the death penalty clearly outweighed the factors against  it.  </P> <P> The victim's body, containing 19 stab wounds, was found early on the morning of  Nov. 21, 1983. Ramirez, who was on parole after previous convictions for  forcible rape, possession of a concealed weapon and receiving stolen property,  admitted leaving the bar with Gonzalez but he denied killing her.  </P> <P> The prosecution presented evidence showing Ramirez's fingerprints were on a  beer bottle found near the body and offered testimony from a woman Ramirez had  raped at knife-point in 1977. She said Ramirez cut her face in the same way  Gonzalez was cut.  </P> <P> An Orange County Superior Court jury convicted the defendant of murder, rape  and sodomy. But in the penalty phase of the case, the jury deadlocked 11 to 1  in favor of a death sentence, forcing a mistrial. Another jury, convened for a  penalty retrial, voted unanimously for a verdict of death.  </P> <P> Thomas M. Goethals, the former deputy district attorney who prosecuted Ramirez,  called it a difficult case to prove in court but "a very strong case" for  prosecutors on appeal.  </P> <P> Goethals called it "a brutal crime" that might never have been solved except  for a beer bottle found near the victim's body in an alley behind the bar.  Ramirez had been seen with her inside the bar, but no one saw them afterward.  However, Ramirez's fingerprints were found on the bottle, proving to jurors  that he had been in the alley with her.  </P> <P> Prosecutors sought a death verdict against Ramirez based on his four prior  felony convictions, one of them for rape.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Criticism of Mandela `Attack' on Police--Johannesburg THE  STAR in English on 2 February in a page-4 editorial commends  African National Congress (ANC) President Nelson Mandela's  pledge to restructure the police force so that it can be more  effective in combating crime. However, his "attack on the  police for being `part of the problem' merely skirts the issue  of current legitimacy and the ability of the force to deal with  crime. Couched in electioneering rhetoric, Mandela's call for a  more efficient force was short on both detail and consistency."  "Granted, the police force needs to be transformed into one  serving all sections of society fairly and equally. But its  task is made more difficult when it is being vilified by  important leaders such as Mandela."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Criticism of ANC Resisting Double Ballot--"The ANC's  rationale for resisting a double ballot is facile," declares a  page-6 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 2  February. Its leaders say "it is based on the experience of a  few voter education exercises which showed that about 30 percent  of people voted for their second preference party in the second  ballot. Some believe the ANC fears losing regional votes to  smaller parties. This shows a paternalistic disrespect for  either voters' freedom of choice or their intelligence." "The  ANC's hard line on this issue negates many of the statesmanlike  concessions made on other issues. Unless it yields, the ANC will  rue its folly."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Gaborone Meeting Marks Country's Acceptance--Johannesburg  BEELD in Afrikaans on 28 January notes in a page-8 editorial:  "The meeting in Gaborone between President F.W. de Klerk and  President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe completed a remarkable  diplomatic circle. The moment when South Africa's formerly  hostile neighbor extended his hand to President de Klerk it  finally signalled South Africa's complete reacceptance into the  international community. The fact that it was Mr. de Klerk who  shook Mr. Mugabe's hand says a lot. After all, it was a National  Party government which took South Africa into the political  wilderness." "The Gaborone meeting ought to sound the death  knell for the so-called Frontline States" and "lead to a new  line, with South Africa at the head, forming a front against  stagnation, economic collapse, and political violence." "South  Africans can indeed look forward to exciting times ahead,  provided no one forgets how easy it is to destroy everything  through faulty politics."    Right Wing Needs To Promote Cause--In his "Political BEELD"  column on page 8, Willie Kuhn points out: "Two reports this  week confirm how dramatically South Africa has changed in the  last few years. First, the ANC and the Orange Free State  Agricultural Union held a meeting," and later the union's  spokesman Mr. Pieter Gous said they "could not ignore the fact  that the ANC is an important factor in the province, and that  the two major forces in the province had spoken with one  another. Second, Transvaal Agricultural Union Chairman Dries  Bruwer, who is also a Conservative Party [CP] MP said the  farmers and the ANC had almost reached agreement on a homeland."  "The right-wingers are in fact following in the steps of the  National Party [NP]. The NP's first meetings with the ANC were  also initially through moderates like Mr. Thabo Mbeki, but  eventually they met face to face with the Joe Slovos and Joe  Modises, and thus began the negotiations. So now it is only the  Afrikaner Resistance Movement, and those to the right of them,  who refuse to talk with the ANC. But then the resistance  movement have always been a moth eaten lot." "Once the various  forces in the country identify, recognize and respect one  another, negotiations begin to take on a live-and-let-live  approach. That is what happened to the NP, and what is now  happening to the CP and the right-wing agricultural unions."  Kuhn concludes: "If the right wing could drop their racism,  prejudices, and fears like the NP did, they could become part of  a larger group of participants sharing the same principles. By  becoming a full part of the negotiations and election process,  they could, with credibility, legitimacy, as well as a larger  platform, begin to promote the cause of an Afrikaner homeland."    Right Wing Wants War, Not Settlement--An editorial on page 8  of Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 31 January notes that:  "While South Africa is involved in a heated election campaign,  it is also in the midst of a potential war situation. The  latter was confirmed by the obstinacy of the right-wingers who  gathered in Pretoria at the weekend to establish a `transitional  assembly' and a `transitional parliament.' A large part of the  `assembly' viewed continued negotiations as treason. In the  process General Constand Viljoen was humiliated, and lumped  together with the National Party which opted for the path of  negotiation. Yesterday's hero can quickly become today's  political traitor in a movement which treats issues so  emotionally. It is difficult to see how Gen. Viljoen can  continue his prominent role within the Afrikaner National Front.  He, the militarist, suffered strategic defeat at the hands of  politicians and their followers." BEELD continues: "We have  long felt that the foremost political leaders on the right are  not interested in a settlement, only in war. They viewed Gen.  Viljoen as a vehicle, and when it seemed he would not storm  blindly ahead, he had to be sacrificed in public."</p>

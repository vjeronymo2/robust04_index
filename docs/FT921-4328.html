			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Warning from Tec on its funding BEDFORDSHIRE Training and Enterprise Council has warned Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, that it cannot sign a contract for training young people and unemployed adults because of a reduction in its funding. Tecs have been involved in negotiations over their funding for the past few weeks. Two have already signed contracts, 48 have agreed and 32 are still negotiating. Mr Jack Mather, chairman of the Bedfordshire Tec, said it had reached a stale-mate. Mr Mather has told Mr Howard that his co-directors 'are unwilling to authorise the 1992-93 contract as it currently stands'. He said unemployment in Bedfordshire had doubled in the past year, yet the Tec's funding offer was down to Pounds 9.3m from Pounds 9.6m, which would result in a cut in youth and adult training. The Department of Employment said its regional director was still negoiating with the Tec and hoped to reach an agreement soon.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Mario Brothers' maker warns of weakened profits The Mario Brothers are feeling the pressure, according to a forecast of a sharp profits decline this year from the computer-game characters' creator, Nintendo. Japan's largest maker of computer games yesterday warned that recurring profits - before tax and extraordinary items - would fall 9.6 per cent to Y104bn (Dollars 1.05bn) in the year to next March. Sales would be down 27.2 per cent to Y340bn over the same period, it said. The yen's strength has squeezed margins on the some 50 per cent of sales Nintendo makes abroad, while European markets have been hit by price-discounting and a fall in demand. Nintendo's report for the first half of the year showed a fall in recurring profits of 16.4 per cent to Y51bn, in line with market expectations. Sales declined even faster, by 36.2 per cent to to Y166bn. Nintendo's forecast is less gloomy than the outlook last week from its rival, Sega. Unlike Nintendo, it is exposed to the amusement hall trade, where business has been as poor as in computer games. Like its rival, Nintendo is pinning its hopes on a new generation of products to stimulate flagging demand for computer games. These include a 16-bit game, Super Donkey Kong, a version of an existing Nintendo line with new graphics, to be released shortly. A 32-bit hand-held game called Virtual Boy is due out in April.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup": "China's Key Coal Mines Play a Growing Role"] </F>   [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- China, in an effort to  ensure a steady supply of coal to numerous power plants,  factories and households, has given special emphasis to the  building of key coal mines.    Dozens of key mines which enjoy preferential treatment in  capital and raw material supply have been built over the past  ten years to meet the growing demand.    "They have formed the backbone of the coal industry," said  an  official from the coal ministry.    China relies heavily on coal for its energy supply.  Statistics show coal accounts for over 75 percent of the  country's consumption of primary sources of energy.    By 1993, 45 key coal mines were completed with an increased  production capacity of 110 million tons per year. Of the total,  12 are classified as extra large mines each with annual  production capacity well above three million tons.    China produced 1.14 billion tons of coal last year, ranking  first in the world.    Experts said investment for those key mines over the past  decade totalled 39.8 billion yuan, making up 44 percent of the  gross budget for the coal industry.    Meanwhile, their production capacity, at 110 million tons  annually, accounted for 56 percent of the total increase, the  experts said.    China began listing coal mines as key construction projects  in 1982 to escalate the development of the coal industry. Since  then, the number of projects has been increased from eight to  twenty-five.    Up to now, three projects have been completed. The remaining  22 still under construction are on the list of 151 key projects  for this year.    "This indicates China's preferential investment in energy  and  raw materials industries," which have been the bottleneck in  China's economic development, said the official.    He said those key mines were characterized by their large  scale, high speed and short construction period, indicating  better returns on investment.    With advanced technology and equipment, those mines enjoy  higher mechanization in coal production, he added.    At present, four coal mines -- Datong, Gujiao and Pingshuo  of  Shanxi Province and Huolinhe of Inner Mongolia -- boast annual  production capacities of more than 10 million tons.    The official said that the construction of these mines  played  a pivotal role in stabilizing China's coal output and promoted  China's development of the whole coal industry.    China will pour 6.78 billion yuan into the key projects and  the production capacity of the mines under construction is  expected to hit 79 million tons.    He admitted that problems still exist for these projects,  such as a short supply of capital funds and building materials,  which delay construction and put the projects behind schedule.    He suggested that a system be set up to guarantee and manage  the supply of funds and building materials to ensure the smooth  construction of the projects.    He said that the shortage of coal is bound to recur in the  long run despite the present excess supply of coal on the  domestic market. China plans to produce 1.4 billion tons of  coal by the end of this century.    "The government should exert macro-control over the coal  industry and make sure the key projects being carried out to  keep abreast with China's economic development," he said.</p>

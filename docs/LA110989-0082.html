			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LA CANADA ENDS SPONSORSHIP OF TEEN CENTER  </P> <P> With little opposition from the teen community of La Canada Flintridge, the  City Council voted unanimously Monday to withdraw its sponsorship of the Teen  Center that closed last month at La Canada Elementary School.  </P> <P> The city staff recommended the closure of the facility, citing low attendance,  insufficient staff, a lack of funds and community complaints over noise.  </P> <P> No teen-agers spoke at the City Council session, and city officials said they  encountered little protest from teens when the closure was announced.  </P> <P> The city spent $11,330 on the center, which it viewed as "an experiment,"  Councilwoman Joan Feehan said.  </P> <P> The center opened Oct. 1, 1988, and closed Oct. 4, 1989.  </P> <P> "I hate to see it go, but obviously it has not worked," Councilman O. Warren  Hillgren said.  </P> <P> The council intended that a private organization would eventually take over the  administration of the center, Councilwoman Joan Feehan said.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed it didn't get more support from the community. . . . The  program really limped along. Nobody in the community wanted to take it over,"  Feehan said. "We're not big enough to run and staff a full teen center . . . ,  and the teens didn't seem to want it." The center was opened in response to  community concerns that La Canada Flintridge teens "had nowhere to go," Feehan  said.  </P> <P> Much of the initial attention for the project began after an 18-year-old La  Canada High School senior, reportedly drunk at the time, fell from a porch roof  during a classmate's party and died as a result of head injuries.  </P> <P> "We did everything we could to fill a void in the community, and it just wasn't  successful," she added.  </P> <P> The program worked at first because it was new to the teen-agers and because  staff members spent lots of time on the program, said Katy Duanis, coordinator  of the city's Parks and Recreation Commission.  </P> <P> Attendence continued to fluctuate, from 150 for dance events to three or four  on nights when no particular program was planned. The average attendence  hovered at about 20, Duanis said.  </P> <P> The center's one-year history was also fraught with other problems, Mayor Pro  Tem Chris Valente said.  </P> <P> "It never really got off the ground to start with," Valente said. "It was  originally intended for 11th- and 12th-graders and ended up attracting junior  high school students."  </P> <P> The center's original site was in the gymnasium at Foothill Intermediate  School. It was moved in mid-January to an auditorium at La Canada Elementary  School after attendence declined markedly, Duanis said.  </P> <P> Property damage at the La Canada Elementary School site also detracted from the  center's image with the community, Valente said.  </P> <P> When it first opened, the center had a sign-in policy restricting access. But  the regulation was soon abandoned to create a less structured environment so  that more students might be attracted.  </P> <P> One resident who lives across the street from the school said she is "certainly  glad they're doing away with the center. There were kids running through our  yard, some of them ripped a tree of ours in half. They threw fruit against the  side of the house, and they trashed our front lawn."  </P></p>

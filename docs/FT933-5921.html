			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / North Sea oil output rises 17% NORTH SEA oil output rose by nearly 17 per cent in July to more than 2m barrels a day for the first time this year, figures from the Royal Bank of Scotland show. The bank said the increase may have been because production was delayed earlier in the year to take advantage of Budget changes, which took effect in July and reduced petroleum revenue tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. However falling prices meant oil-company revenues rose by just 5 per cent to Pounds 22.5m a day.</p>

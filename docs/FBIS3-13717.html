			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] On the eve of the Iranian new year, and on the  last Friday of 1372 [year ending 20 March], the  political-religious rites of Friday prayers were staged  throughout the country today, with the extensive participation  of the worshiping masses. In Tehran, the Friday prayers were led  by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati.    The acting Friday prayer leader of Tehran expressed  congratulations on the occasions of the blessed 'Id al-Fitr and  the auspicious new year. He stressed that people should use  such occasions in order to perform good deeds, in particular  deeds such as giving charity and aid to the poor and the  underprivileged. [passage omitted]    In his second sermon, Ayatollah Jannati thanked the Majles  for its careful, timely, and skillful debate on the budget bill.  He then referred to the anniversary of the Halabjah tragedy and  the silence of international forums, in particular the so-called  defenders of human rights, on that and other tragedies, such as  the recent atrocity at the Hebron mosque and the continuing  criminal acts in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said: These realities  show that what is at present being said in the West about human  rights is nothing but a political ploy. This ploy, however, is  now old and rotten, and it should be clear to every one now that  the greatest violator of human rights in the world is in fact  America.    He stressed: Such insinuations do not, and will never, have  any effect whatsoever on the resolute will of the Muslim nation  of Iran, and the struggle of the resilient nation of Iran  against global arrogance will continue under the wise leadership  of His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i.

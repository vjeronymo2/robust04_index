			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA also proposes, as recommended in the AMA Report, that bipolar disorder be added to the list of disqualifying conditions. Previously called manic depressive psychosis, this common, major affective disorder now is separately classified by DSM III and may include individuals who have manifested only mania. Bipolar disorder is not specifically referenced in current part 67. In consideration of potential risk to flight safety, individuals with this diagnosis are rarely granted certification. Those few individuals who are determined to be eligible for certification through the special issuance provisions of the FAR must be followed closely for relapse and recurrence of symptoms. By including the new terminology, the standards will clearly reflect the agency's concern about this disorder. (Discussion of how a proposed disqualifying condition may affect a current medical certificate appears under ``Additional Standards for Disqualification.'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Substance Abuse/Dependence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additional proposed changes in the mental standards for airmen are influenced by DSM III nomenclature for conditions involving dependence on or abuse of alcohol, drugs, or other chemical substances. Current regulations list as disqualifying ``alcoholism'' and ``drug dependence.'' The AMA Report points out that DSM III eliminates the term ``alcoholism'' and substitutes the diagnosis of ``substance dependence'' and ``substance abuse.'' As disqualifying conditions, the AMA Report recommends ``substance abuse, substance dependence and related substance use disorders, including but not limited to those associated with alcohol; barbiturates; other sedative/hypnotics; muscle relaxants; anxiolytics; opioids; central nervous system stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines; and hallucinogens such as phencyclidine, cannabis, and volatile solvents and gases.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule differs from the AMA recommendations in that (1) ``barbiturates'' are not specified separately since they would be included with ``sedatives and hypnotics;'' (2) the phrase ``and similarly acting sympathomimetics'' would be added to the grouping of ``cocaine'' and ``amphetamines;'' and (3) ``phencyclidine or similarly acting arylcyclohexylamines,'' ``cannabis,'' and ``volatile solvents and gases'' are listed separately rather than grouped under ``hallucinogens.'' Additionally, the phrase ``related substance use disorders,'' as proposed, but not defined in the AMA Report, is not included in this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed standard defines ``substance dependence'' and ``substance abuse.'' A medical history or clinical diagnosis of ``substance dependence'' would disqualify a person for a medical certificate under the standards unless there is evidence of recovery satisfactory to the Federal Air Surgeon. The proposed changes also are intended to provide specific regulatory medical standards for excluding from aviation a person who, though not substance dependent, has abused alcohol within the preceding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 years or other substances within the preceding 5 years. These proposed standards respond to the AMA Report as well as to national concerns about substance abuse. These standards would enhance the agency's ability to examine and to exclude, where medically appropriate, those airmen who have abused a substance within the time frames stated above or who have a medical history or a clinical diagnosis of substance dependence. The proposed mental standard retains, however, current language that permits medical certification under the standards upon presentation of acceptable evidence of recovery and a specified period of abstinence in the case of alcohol dependence. The proposed rule provides that clinical evidence of recovery would include sustained total abstinence from alcohol for not less than the preceding 2 years in the case of alcohol dependence, and in the case of other substance dependence, sustained total abstinence from the substance for not less than the preceding 5 years. The time periods for sustained total abstinence are based on the AMA recommendations. Other factors considered in determining recovery include the natural history and severity of the problem; the period of satisfactory recovery since manifestation of the problem; any treatment, as well as any continuing requirements for treatment, and its nature; any current or recent psychiatric symptoms, aberrant behavior, or psychiatric or other medical findings; the need for or use of chemical agents; any personality traits or other recognized factors involving the risk of future recurrence of the problem or the risk of other adverse events; the period of the person's abstinence from the substance or substances; the number of times treatment was sought and relapse occurred; the quality of the final treatment effort; the presence of residual medical complications, especially neurologic manifestations; progress in marital, social, vocational, and educational areas, as appropriate, since rehabilitation began; commitment to rehabilitation by virtue of continuing contacts with social or professional agencies, or both, and their opinions and recommendations; and the findings of recent psychiatric and psychologic evaluations, if appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed definition of substance abuse includes two criteria (the first relates to alcohol, the second to other substances) that state a person would be disqualified if he or she demonstrated recurrent use of a substance in situations in which that use was physically hazardous. At least one of the uses would have to have taken place within the preceding 2 years in the case of alcohol or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 years in the case of other substances. Under this criterion, use in physically hazardous situations need not involve the same substance or substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A third criterion states that a person who used a prohibited drug as that term is defined in part 121, appendix I of the FAR would be disqualified. The prohibited drug use would have to have taken place within the preceding 5 years. ``Prohibited drugs'' as defined in the FAR do not include all substances; however, ``substances'' as defined in this proposal do include all prohibited drugs. Alcohol, for example, is a substance which may be abused but is not a prohibited drug as that term is defined under appendix I of part 121.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A positive drug test result for a prohibited drug is one type of evidence of use. The FAA recognizes that the probative value of a drug test result varies depending on several factors, including the type of test, circumstances under which the test was conducted, and other corroborative evidence of drug use. The FAA considers a positive drug test conducted under any rule or internal program of the Department of Transportation (such as the FAA program required by &sect;&sect;121.457 and 135.251 or any other Administration within DOT) to be compelling proof of the use of a prohibited drug for which the drug test was positive. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

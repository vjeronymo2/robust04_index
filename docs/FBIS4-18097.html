			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brussels, March 30 (AFP) -- The successful  conclusion of membership negotiations with four new members is a  "message of hope for the future of the European Union [EU]," the  Greek presidency of the EU said Wednesday [30 March].    But the "Greek compromise" on voting procedures which  unblocked the process of enlargement, formally agreed by the 12  current and four new members on Wednesday, was not legally  binding as Britain has claimed, Greek ambassador to Brussels  Yannis Kranioditis said.    The compromise formula, an annex to the main membership  treaties, was only a political declaration, he said. [passage  omitted]    A date for signing the treaties, which should take place  before the EU summit on June 24 and 25, will be set at the next  meeting of foreign ministers, Kranioditis said.    Wednesday's session also agreed on the number of deputies  each new member would have in the European Parliament. Sweden  is to have 22, Austria 21, Finland 16 and Norway 15 out of a  total 639 deputies.    In the expanded new Council of Ministers, Austria and Sweden  will each have four votes and Norway and Finland three each,  under rules which allocate seats according to population size.    Hungary and Poland will officially present their  applications  for EU membership in Athens on April 1 and April 8 respectively,  Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos added on  Wednesday.    Kranioditis said that after the EU expanded northwards and  eastwards, Greece would like it to open the door to new members  in the south, and the candidature of Cyprus and Malta was to be  considered at the start of 1995.</p>

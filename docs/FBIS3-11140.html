Alarcon said that the workers  parliaments have served for collective discussion of possible  measures in general so that each worker can express his or her  opinion and hear the opinions of others to form a collective  criterion.    The leader of the Cuban parliament pointed out that just as  important as this aspect was the identification by the workers  parliaments of problems in each work center as well as the  necessary decisions that would permit reduced costs and  increased efficiency. Alarcon underscored that, with that in  mind, they have been able to obtain thousands of proposals and  specific measures, many of which have been implemented.    Alarcon went on to say that the solution of economic  difficulties is a problem concerning the entire nation and not  just a group of legislators. He concluded by saying: We must see  the people's government as it really is: a parliament inserted  in our society.</p>

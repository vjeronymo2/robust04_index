			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Speech by Kamil Iskhakov, chief of the administration of </F> the city of Kazan, at the 17th session of the City Soviet of  People's Deputies]    [Text]  <H5>  On the Socioeconomic Situation of Kazan </H5>   Esteemed people's deputies!    The relative stability in the Republic of Tatarstan and its  capital has become a fact, a phenomenon against which many  regions of Russia are "measuring themselves."    But a "slice of life" from the economy shows that positive  tendencies have been achieved in far from all spheres and,  moreover, the picture has many contrasts. What has brought this  about? An in-depth analysis confirms that results are achieved  in places where an active role is assigned to the city's  executive team. In other words, we are speaking about  possibilities--legal and financial--of pursuing a strong  municipal policy.    And, conversely, where our positions have been weak--weak  from the standpoint of power of the authorities and instruments  of administration--there the situation remains difficult.    I have in mind above all, of course, the capital's  industrial  sector.    We have always been proud of the fact that Kazan is a large  industrial center, a city whose economy is deeply integrated  into the economy not only of the republic, but also of the USSR,  which is now a part of the past. And now this situation is a  kind of heavy cross which the city has to bear. Suffice it to  say that the financial situation [part of text missing].    Searches for the most effective model for combining market  relations with state regulation of the economy have been under  way for a whole year. And although stability has not come to the  industrial sector, certain positive strides cannot but be noted.    The results of 1993 show that the decline of industrial  production, as predicted, has slowed somewhat, amounting to 14  percent of the 1992 figure. This is somewhat better than in the  republic as a whole, where the decline was 14.9 percent and for  the Russian Federation, where it reached 16.2 percent.    We are very alarmed by the way 1994 has begun. According to  the January results, industrial enterprises have allowed  production to drop by 21.6 percent.    It does not help much to know that the major and  deepest-seated reasons lie beyond our reach. They include a  narrowing of the sales market, a sharp reduction of state  orders, the lack of a reliable mechanism for mutual settlements,  etc.    Suffice it to say that as of 1 January 1993 consumers owed  enterprises of Kazan 304.6 billion rubles [R]. This sum is no  more or less than about three times the monthly production  volume. Naturally, this did not simply exacerbate the financial  position of the enterprises, it dealt a blow to their  capabilities. If there is nothing with which to buy raw and  processed materials, there is no production and no final  product. For the city this means a decrease in tax revenues.  Such is the vicious circle.    Incidentally, almost half of the debt is from orders from  the  Government of Russia that have not been paid for. And if we  throw in the money that has slipped out of the budget of Kazan,  we are looking at a figure of R100 billion. With this kind of  "makeweight," we could cover all of our shortfalls.    This pertains particularly to the question of why we should  go to the Russian elections and whether we need defenders of our  interests in the legislative assembly of Russia. As you see, we  need them, and not so much from a political as from a pragmatic  perspective!    The crisis is being felt especially strongly by "defense,"  which accounts for about half of all the fixed capital of the  city's industry. And the record decline of production--22.7  percent--naturally had a painful effect on the economy of the  city as a whole. This is where we felt the full measure of what  it means to be one of the capitals of the military-industrial  complex!    The republic and the city have unilaterally tried to ease  the  crisis here too. They have developed the concept of structural  transformations of the economy. We have seen the first--so far  modest--experiment in competitive enlistment of the potential of  the military-industrial complex to solve the problems of the  agro-industrial complex, public health, and the construction  complex.    From the fund for structural rearrangement under conditions  of targeted preferential credit the enterprises of the city were  allotted more than R6.7 billion in 1993. The situation was eased  considerably by the bill of exchange from the National Bank of  the Republic of Tatarstan, which made it possible to make  one-fifth of the mutual settlements. It should be stipulated  that we cannot allow ourselves the luxury of using purely  cost-oriented mechanisms. Project and business plans of  enterprises must meet the requirements of both economic  expediency and the possibility of recoupment.    In the summer of 1993, on the initiative of the  administration, the first trade fair, called "Entrepreneurs and  Production," was organized in the city. Participating in it were  84 entities of the nonstate economy. In so doing they managed to  generalize and bring to the enterprises of the  military-industrial complex, which were experiencing an extreme  shortage of orders, a whole package of proposals from  entrepreneurs of the "new wave."    Last week, from the 24th through [text missing] which  received a positive response from both industrial and trade  enterprises. Displaying their products at the exhibition were 91  enterprises with various forms of ownership not only from the  city but also from other regions of the CIS. For the first time,  broad masses of the population had an opportunity to see  peacetime products from the city's converted enterprises, since  Kazan alone was represented by 22 enterprises and organizations  of the defense complex. The preliminary results show that during  the course of the exhibition, its participants scheduled the  conclusion of about 350 agreements for a total of more than R20  billion. About R30 million worth of goods was sold to retail  trade. Thus, the results of the exhibition show the expediency  of taking such measures.    As I have already said, all these measures were unilateral  in  nature. And, undoubtedly, such a counterbalance is not capable  of halting the decline of state orders for the  military-industrial complex, which has gathered immense speed.  Thus, while in 1991 the Government of the Russian Federation  reduced orders for "defense" by 22 percent, in 1993 the volume  of the state orders here engaged less than one-fourth of the  capabilities of our enterprises.    Now, after signing the agreement with Russia, we have the  hope of a civilized solution to such collisions. The more so  since the federal government, judging from everything, has  followed Tatarstan to the conclusion that the course of the  reforms in this stage require not weakening but strengthening of  the state's role.    If we listen, we will hear that Moscow is starting to speak  our language. State authority must be strengthened, and the  economy requires control in the transition stage. But the main  thing is that the agreement is already producing concrete,  positive results: The federal government has begun to pay its  debts, and the process of granting credit for conversion has  started. Enterprise managers who have visited Moscow share the  impression that there has been a sharp change in the attitude  toward Kazan's initiatives, and the atmosphere in the high  offices is fundamentally different.    As concerns the relatively narrow scope of the municipal  policy, its object has been and still is to produce goods that  are useful to the people. A careful selection of objects for  financing, in-depth expert appraisal of business plans, strict  control over the expenditure of target funds, and other  instruments are gradually proving their effectiveness. Thus, the  Tochmash Plant assimilated the output of more than 40 items in  barely three years. During the same period, Elekon assimilated  the output of more than 50 new items. The most promising and  significant of them are various kinds of laser equipment and  instruments for diagnosis and treatment of diseases in the areas  of dentistry, cardiology, and gynecology. They have been  supplied to the first laser center in the CIS, which was created  on the basis of the association's polyclinic. At the present  time the helicopter association has developed and introduced  about 20 kinds of consumer goods. Among the latest innovations  of the engine construction association are synchronized electric  motors to be used for various purposes. The Terminal Association  is producing equipment for counting banknotes, money accounting  machines, strongboxes, computer equipment, anti-hijacking  devices, and a broad assortment of consumer goods. In  conjunction with the Medinstrument scientific production  association, they are producing a mobile pneumatic drill for  dentists.    As a result, 11 percent more goods have been produced with  the trademark of the military-industrial complex than in 1992.  True, in the city as a whole, according to the results of the  year, the volumes of output of consumer goods has decreased by  4.9 percent. [Text missing] the decline was twice as great.    The condition of the industrial "knights in shining armor,"  including the flagmen of the military-industrial complex,  undoubtedly has a painful effect on the economy of the city as a  whole and on its social microclimate. The downsizing of  production leads to a reduction of the tax base and,  consequently, to a reduction of budget capabilities.    All that is fair.    At the same time, the practice of reform forces us to pay  more and more attention to microeconomic processes. And because  of their nature and position, the local authorities are  responsible for precisely the "trivia of life."    The picture, briefly, is as follows. The production of  foodstuffs in 1993 as a whole increased by 11.9 percent. Here is  the breakdown of the growth for individual groups: sausage  items--7.8 percent, fatty cheeses--40 percent, butter--almost  1.5-fold, and confectionery items--17.2 percent.    Note that this is not a decline but actually growth. And in  the high echelons of power they have heard this assessment,  expressed with relief: Kazan is finally working independently in  the area of the food policy.    On the whole, the results of the year make it possible as a  minimum to maintain the existing level of consumption of the  main food products. Consequently, we need not speak about a  crisis of the food complex. As for rumors about famine among the  people, let these discussions remain on the conscience of failed  politicos.    The agrarian sector of the republic, in which we are also  investing a good deal, is becoming a field for studying  experience. The Government of Russia has expressed a readiness  to make large investments in our food complex. And here, as we  see, the seeds of the agreement are already beginning to sprout.    Of course, a strong food policy comes with its own price  tag.  Stable provision of food products was achieved through active  state support of the commodity producers. The budget took over  half of the costs for increasing the fertility of the land, and  building enterprises of the food and processing industry; there  are still significant subsidies for grain and milk, etc., etc.    The money for a strong food program, naturally, does not  grow  on trees; it has been earned and collected, including on the  territory of Kazan. Thus, we have every reason to say that the  city is responding adequately to the condition of the food  market.  <H5>  On the Situation of the Construction Complex </H5>   Runaway inflation, which has made long-term investments  disadvantageous, and the state's investment policy, which is  growing weaker and weaker--these two factors are quite enough to  lead the construction complex to ruin.    And in Kazan this means 118 construction organizations and  17  enterprises of the construction industry, which employ more than  33,000 people.    Thus, radical steps were necessary in order to preserve the  capital's construction potential. And the basic regrouping of  the client forces became such a turning point. Thus, while in  1991 enterprises and departments accounted for 70 percent of the  construction of facilities of the social sphere, and the local  soviets--only 30 percent, and this was largely with capital of  debtor enterprises, now the ratio has changed to exactly the  opposite. Namely, the municipal order has grown to 70 percent.    And it must be noted that the solutions to all the problems  related to the development of the city, which used to pass  through numerous departmental channels, is now fully our  responsibility. During January-December 1993 R77 billion in  capital investments were made in construction of facilities of  the social sphere.    It is clear that when the city administration was the main  client, it was possible to change the ratio between facilities  for production and nonproduction purposes in favor of the  latter. As compared to the previous year, 1.5 times more  accommodations for schoolchildren were introduced, polyclinic  accommodations--4.2 times, and seating in public catering  facilities--double.    At the same time, there were arrears in municipal services  networks--by 20 percent, and trading areas--by 40 percent.    It must also be noted that for the first time in many years  not a single children's preschool institution has been released  in turnkey condition, although they are being constructed, and  the same is true of consumer service enterprises. Little  consolation is provided by the fact that because of the higher  prices there has been a sharp decline in the demand for  municipal services, and the number wishing to attend  kindergartens is not increasing but decreasing.    As before, the most burning problem is housing, which is  aggravated even more by the problem of Kazan slums. The program  for resettlement of residents from damaged, dilapidated, and  flooded buildings must reach the mark of releasing 500,000  square meters of new residential space per year.    In 1993, of the overall volume of nonproduction capital  investments, 57 percent was used for housing construction. The  result was 361,300 square meters, which is 100.4 percent of the  projection.    I can say unequivocally that construction workers are far  from reaching the limit of their capabilities. One of the  reasons lies within the complex itself. This is the poor  effectiveness in the organization of construction.    In 1993 construction organizations with all forms of  ownership introduced fixed capital valued at R41.8 billion,  which is R64.5 billion less than the amount of capital  investments utilized. For each ruble of invested capital, there  are only 39 kopeks (in the republic as a whole--46 kopeks) in  fixed capital that is introduced, while back in 1985 this  indicator reached 82 kopeks. Thus, as compared to 1985 the  effectiveness of the introduction of fixed capital has decreased  by half.    Market mechanisms in capital construction have not yet been  fully set in motion. As before, most of the introduction of  facilities comes at the end of the year, the construction front  remains extremely broad as before, and capital investments are  being dispersed among a large number of construction projects.    On the other hand, one cannot but recognize that a strong  investment policy requires full-fledged financial support from  the client. And the city has been catastrophically short of  money, especially recently. Thus, our debt to the construction  workers as of today is about R24 billion.    Problems of finances and the budget as a whole will be  discussed later. Here I shall limit myself to the remark that  the administration is placing a certain amount of hope on  housing auctions. We laid the groundwork for this new mechanism  back in the middle of last year, when we took out credit for the  construction of a building. Today at least two sections are  ready for sale "on the block."    At the same time, there is no doubt that the proportion of  alternative investments in housing should increase. In  particular, individual housing construction is being  increasingly developed. While five years ago 11,900 square  meters were introduced, this figure has now doubled.    But serious problems are standing in our way here. As a  rule,  individual construction is done on vacant areas of urban  settlements or in the suburbs. Thus, "mini-cities" appear, which  have to be provided with all the necessary facilities for social  and cultural-domestic purposes, that is, all the amenities, it  is necessary to build roads [text missing] public health, etc.  All this social infrastructure requires large additional  expenditures and is one more burden that the city must take on  itself--there is nobody else. Even cooperation with the funds of  individual builders can provide for the construction of only an  individual facility, and it can in no way handle the project of  comprehensive building development.  <H5>  On the Condition of Branches of the City Economy </H5>   With the breakdown of the previous system of branch  management, the disturbance of economic ties, and other changes  in our society in recent years, there have been serious  contradictions and disproportions, which have entailed a  considerable increase in problems of developing branches of the  urban economy. In order to make it easier for these branches to  exist under market conditions, throughout 1993 the city  administration worked to transfer all branches of the urban  economy to municipal ownership of the city. All of the following  have been accepted for municipal ownership: 25 public health  facilities, 36--public education, 300--trade, 57--public  catering, 2 sports facilities, 12 movie theaters, 8 housing and  municipal services enterprises, and the housing supply of the  local soviets.    The State Committee on the Administration of State Property  notes that Kazan is still the only region in the republic where  municipal ownership is fully formed.    The basis of the economy of any city is the reliable  functioning and further development of its municipal services,  which determine the degree of architectural development of the  housing supply, the provision of water, gas, heat, the discharge  of waste waters, etc.    The housing supply of Kazan as of the beginning of this year  amounted to 16.9 million square meters. One should note,  however, the alarming tendency toward ever-increasing wear and  tear on the housing supply. Over 10 years the volume of capital  repair has decreased almost threefold: from 182,000 square  meters in 1983 to 70,000 square meters in 1993.    The delivery of water into the network, including for the  population and for municipal needs, increased more rapidly than  did the housing supply and the number of city dwellers. This, of  course, is gratifying. Something else is alarming: Every sixth  (!) cubic meter of purified water in 1993 was wasted, being  reflected in the indicator "leakage."    Another problem of the water and sewage works, which is  typical, incidentally, of other public works systems as well, is  the wearing out of the water and sewage systems, which exceeds  40 percent and is increasing every year. The city is still using  systems that were built in the last century--35 percent of the  water mains and 25 percent of the city sewage systems are  completely worn out. The wearing out of mains is especially  great in Baumanskiy Rayon, where 68 percent of the water mains  are completely worn out. As a result, over five years the amount  of damage has increased threefold, which, in turn, disorganizes  the work of city transportation, causes appreciable economic  damage, and leads to millions in expenditures on repairing them.    For the sake of illustration, allow me to give just one  figure: In order to fill the gaps in 1993, Vodokanal spent R138  million. Obviously, it is impossible to refurbish all the  existing mains in a short period of time. So we must provide for  control of the condition of existing collectors without  excavation. We need new equipment--special machines with remote  control. And among the many [text missing] this problem should  be priority.    When it comes to the city's energy supply, here one can  clearly see a course toward increasing the amount of gas used in  households. During the past five years, street gas networks have  been extended by 35 percent and the number of apartments  supplied with gas has increased by 20 percent.    As for heating, the development of this area is somewhat  behind schedule. The balance of heating capacities and the load  from consumers on centralized sources is developing today with a  deficit of heat in a number of rayons of the city, above all  Leninskiy and Moskovskiy. The city administration has recently  adopted a number of decisions regarding this issue, and measures  are being taken to stabilize the situation. Unfortunately, the  problem is exacerbated to a considerable degree by the increased  losses of heat in the systems. During the past five years, they  have increased by 17 percent, and consequently, reserves for  economizing exist here too.    As of today almost all branches of the urban municipal  economy are operating at a loss, requiring an annual subsidy of  up to 40 percent of the city budget. Today the city  administration is taking measures to adapt the branches to the  new management conditions. Versions of an economic plan for  their functioning in contractual relations with the city  administration are being worked out. In order to maintain the  necessary level of reliability of fixed capital, it envisions a  transition to economically substantiated rates and other  decisions. Ultimately it will be proposed that all municipal  services get away from subsidies and earn their own money in  keeping with the quality of their service.  <H5>  Trade </H5>   A most important role in the life support for the capital of  Tatarstan is assigned to branches of trade, public catering, and  the sphere of services. The stability of the operation of the  aforementioned branches determines the standard of living of the  population.    Despite certain difficulties of the transition period, the  situation in the consumer market remains relatively stable, with  a tendency toward activation. The aforementioned branches are  actually switching to market relations.    An ever greater role in the activity of the branches of  trade, public catering, and consumer services is being played by  the nonstate sector, whose proportion of the commodity turnover  last year amounted to about 5 percent and, according to  predictions, will increase to 25 percent this year. Market  relations have promoted a considerable expansion of the  assortment of the goods offered to the consumer, but at the same  time the growth of prices for goods and services has  significantly limited the consumer demand of the population.    The situation on the food commodities market is improving  somewhat. The supply of bread, flour, cereal, sugar, and meat  and dairy products last year was normal, for the most part. As  early as the second half of 1993, the city was able to abandon  the system of norm-setting for the main kinds of foodstuffs.    Unfortunately, at the present time the consumer market is  being filled to a considerable degree through purchases from  abroad. Some directors of local enterprises that produce  foodstuffs have already begun to complain about the domination  of goods from overseas. But the market is the market, and its  laws cannot be changed. Prices in the stores have come very  close to prices in the markets, and for certain products, such  as sugar, they are even lower on the market than in state trade.    Thus there has been a steady tendency toward saturating the  market with goods, expanding their assortment, and toward the  possibility of improving the art of service [text missing] ends  up with more stable prices. It is intended to continue working  in this direction. The main thing under these conditions is to  clearly analyze the tendencies in the development of the branch,  promptly correct mistakes and omissions, and achieve more  complete satisfaction of the demand of the population.    The experience of many regions of Russia where the level of  privatization of trade is much higher than in Tatarstan, for  example, shows that an unregulated, "savage" market has led to  partial elimination of self-service in trade and to  interruptions in the sale of small and unprofitable goods  (matches, salt, bread, and milk).    Hence, our task is to start in our policy not from theory,  but from practice, from the realities of the day.    There is a serious lag in the republic industry for the  production of industrial goods. Because of this, and in order to  saturate the city consumer market, goods valued at R17.4 billion  have been purchased outside the republic.    Problems of getting started, naturally, are reflected in  prices. So far, they are still somewhat higher than, say, in  Moscow. But when this mechanism is developed and stabilized,  when signs of saturation or a certain surplus appear, and the  levers of competition begin to function among producers and in  trade--then the price mechanism will be regulated.    A great deal, of course, will depend on the course of the  economic reforms in the republic.  <H5>  On the Course of Privatization </H5>   Privatization is an indispensable part of the process of  creating competitive market relations during the course of the  implementation of the economic reform. A detailed analysis of  the state of affairs in this area of our activity will be  presented in the report from the Committee on Management of  Communal Property. Therefore, I shall discuss only certain  aspects, which cannot but be noted when evaluating the  socioeconomic and political situation.    As of today, what are the results of privatization in the  city of Kazan, and what is the dynamic of this process? From the  standpoint of numerical indicators, they do not really satisfy  us. But something else gives us hope: We have laid a reliable  foundation for further work.    During the course of privatization, we have revealed many  problems that have demanded solutions and have naturally  directed all of us toward increasing the efficiency of the  operation of enterprises. What percentage of the shares should  remain under state ownership for now, how should "gold shares"  be introduced and where, and what should be done so that  facilities for social and cultural purposes do not suffer?    The results of privatization in 1993 are practical  experience  whose study will enable us to avoid a number of mistakes and  blunders in the future and also to carry out the process of  privatization in the city more fruitfully and at accelerated  rates.    By the beginning of this year, 13 industrial enterprises of  the city had been converted to joint-stock companies. After  January, their number had increased to 28. Among them are such  giants as Organicheskiy Sintez, KMPO, KVPO, and others. Although  it must be noted that the results of the production activity of  joint-stock companies has still not produced the desired effect.  As of 1993 the decline of production volumes at their  enterprises amounted to 18.5 percent, which is higher than in  the city as a whole. During January the reduction of production  volumes at them amounted to 26.7 percent.    Of course, conclusions here would be premature; the  joint-stock companies are only at the beginning of their path.  At the same time, it is clear that the creation of joint-stock  companies in and of itself is not [text missing].    When speaking about the course of so-called small-scale  privatization, one should note that its main areas have been the  spheres of trade and public catering.    At the present time 26.9 percent of the stores turned over  for municipal ownership have been privatized and six trade  facilities have been sold at auction. In the sphere of public  catering, three enterprises have been privatized and seven  facilities have been sold at auction. Of the consumer service  facilities, eight enterprises have been privatized, as have two  in the sphere of municipal housing.    And although the rates of privatization still lag behind  those earmarked, all the conditions for speeding this work up  already exist.    We are disturbed more by another aspect of  privatization--not  quantitative, but qualitative. We understand quite well that the  administrative-vertical system of administration, at least in  the sphere of service, has run its course. But it is also  impossible not to manage, while bearing responsibility to the  population for assortment and for working conditions and for the  quality of services. Still, the economic and legal levers are  very, very weak so far.    Actually, it is now impossible to dissolve a leasing  agreement or to take away a license or to force trade in what  the population needs and where it needs it. This means that it  is necessary to have laws on administrative liability for  violation of the rules of trade and service and on trade and  state trade employees. There is also a need to create a  department for protecting the rights of the consumers, and thus  the administrations of the city and rayons will have the  possibility not only of controlling the process of  privatization, but also of influencing its components in the  interests of the population.    One of the most important elements of the process of  redistribution of the property is the privatization of the  housing fund. Preparations for this began long before the  adoption of the law; a unified city automated information system  was created, and it is already on-line.    As of 1 March 1994, in Kazan 9,522 applications had been  submitted from citizens wishing to gain ownership of their  apartments and 4,698 families, or 1.7 percent, have already  become owners of housing, while more than 7,000 contracts have  been prepared to be issued to citizens.  <H5>  Foreign Economic Issues </H5>   One of the important areas of concern under the conditions  of  the transition to the market should be the attraction of foreign  investments. We regard the activity of foreign capital in the  city's economy as one of the factors contributing to making  economic life more active.    Foreign investments may be made through granting credit,  buying shares in enterprises of the city and real estate, and  also through having foreign firms create their own and joint  enterprises.    At this stage, foreign investments are made mainly through  creating enterprises with foreign investments. As of today there  are 78 of these in the city, which make up 67 percent of all the  joint ventures of the Republic of Tatarstan. There are also 23  representative offices of foreign firms operating in the city.    Active work for attracting investors to the city economy is  continuing. Thus, for example, in order to develop a base for  the construction industry, the creation of the Plastbau joint  venture is now being completed. The plant opening is scheduled  for 31 March. The enterprise's main task is to produce  construction elements according to Italian technology for 1,000  cottages or apartments per year. The amount of the investments  from the foreign partners was 7,200,000 [text missing]    The bidding for reconstruction of the Kazan airport, which  was summed up this past 22-23 February, resulted in a victory  for the French firm Bouygues, which proposed the best plans and  financial arrangements for the reconstruction work.  Additionally, this same firm, getting its stride, is taking on  the reconstruction of the Kazan Hotel. The project is estimated  at $68 million, and the French are investing $54 million, or 80  percent.    The example of the construction of a modern pavilion on the  area of the VIKO [expansion not indicated] (the former VDNKh  [Exhibition of the Achievements of the USSR National Economy])  is curious and instructive. The German firm was unable to return  to the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan the credit it had  taken out, and as a result the pavilion became our property.    Let us note that we have managed to invigorate foreign  economic activity with practically no legal base, no laws, and  being bound hand and foot.    But now, since the Moscow "summit," the Iron Curtain has  been  lifted. One of the first examples: The grand joint  Russian-Tatarstan project has gotten off the ground--the Kazan  Logistics Center. The TASIS (Technical Assistance to the CIS)  Committee in Brussels has approved the program for technical  assistance to the Russian Federation from the European Union,  one of whose points is the plan for the creation of a logistics  center. The next stage will be for the corresponding EU  Commissions to hold bidding for designing the center.    In order to regulate the legal, organizational, and economic  principles of foreign economic activity, the session of the  Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan adopted the law "On  Foreign Investments." A program for attracting foreign  investments is being prepared at the city level, and incentive  funds will be created for them: land, real estate, and  financial. For those foreign financial groups that will be  investing money in branches that are priorities to the city and  thus contributing to solving the city's crucial problems we  intend to grant tax and other benefits.  <H5>  Social Policy </H5>   Our entry into the market has generated quite a few  previously unfamiliar problems, whose solutions require  additional expenditures. Thus, the stratification of the society  according to income has defined that part of the Kazan residents  who are now faced with the problem of survival. And today we are  all disturbed by the question of how to organize social  protection for people who need it and make it more active.    Targeted protection of the population is undoubtedly the  radical solution that practically everyone today regards as a  complex of timely state measures capable of if not balancing out  then at least easing the pressure of market forces.    In order to solve this problem, the city has created a  unified service for social protection of the underprivileged  strata of the population, and the organization of an information  bank based on the official passport of the individual is in the  stage of completion. Card files have been created of orphan  children, disabled persons, families with many children, elderly  couples who are living alone, participants in the cleanup after  the disaster of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and other  categories of the population who are in need of our increased  attention. Today we include among them more than 115,000 Kazan  residents to whom just last year material aid in the amount of  R29 million was given out of the city fund for social support.  The sum not so [text missing] of the entire complex of work  conducted on this plane.    Designating 1 October as the Day of the Elderly has become a  good tradition in the city. In spite of certain difficulties, 17  Veteran stores are continuing to function in the city, emergency  social assistance departments have been opened up in two rayons  of the city, and work is being done to create a network of  medical-social facilities. The city social rehabilitation center  for disabled children was opened up in December 1993, and work  is being done to create facilities to stay overnight and a  center for comprehensive service for pensioners.    Questions of a stage-by-stage transition to payment for  housing in an amount that provides for reimbursement for  outlays, taking into account benefits for certain categories of  the population, are in the stage of being developed.    The market is the market, but today we cannot let city  dwellers go without our attention and assistance.  <H5>  On the Condition of the Fight Against Crime </H5>   The fight against crime remains one of the major areas in  the  activity of state administrative organs of the republic and  city. The law "On Extraordinary Measures for Fighting Crime" has  become the basis that enables us to step up our attack on crime  even more.    The reinforcement of the city militia personnel is  continuing; in 1993 it increased by 1,200 people. This year it  is planned to introduce an additional 1,000 staff units.    It was proposed to the leaders of the seven largest  enterprises of the city that they create on their territories on  a contractual basis militia divisions for protecting the  facilities belonging to them. These subdivisions have been  created at the imeni Gorbunov Kazan joint-stock production  association, the Orgsintez joint-stock company, the Polimerfoto  plant, the KVPO, and others.    In order to prevent apartment burglaries during 1993, 1,636  apartments were equipped with burglar alarm devices.    Proposals for financing and additional material and  technical  support for all rayon internal affairs administrations and the  internal affairs administration of the city of Kazan were taken  into account when compiling the budgets for 1993-1994. For  financing the municipal militia and measures of the "Complex of  Immediate Measures for Fighting Crime in the City of Kazan  During 1993-1995" during the report year, R1.4784 billion was  allotted from the budget of the city of Kazan, including for  financing the program--R841.3 million. From the city budget,  R840 million was allocated for acquiring automotive  transportation, supplies, and equipment for the Patrul-Kazan ASU  [automated control system].    The main thing that law enforcement organs have gained is  confidence in their forces; they are filled with resolve to curb  the flow of crime, which has threatened to become uncontrollable.    According to the results of 1993, the solution of crimes has  risen from 53.9 to 63.8 percent. The courts received 3,314 cases  more than in 1992, and this is very important.    People regard the work of law enforcement organs primarily  from the standpoint of the inevitability of punishment, and we  must do everything possible.  <H5>  On Execution of the Consolidated Budget </H5>   The city budget is becoming a basic and ever more decisive  instrument of our socioeconomic policy. Today I could not name a  single municipal problem that could not be solved if we had  enough monetary resources.    The year 1993 was marked by exertion of all forces to  mobilize incomes. Tax, financial, inspection, law enforcement  [text missing] rayon administrations for the first time  collected R245.5 billion in revenues on the territory, 55.7  percent or R137 billion of which, in keeping with existing  normatives, went into the city budget.    The over-fulfillment of the revenue part of the budget  amounted to R89 billion (or 265 percent).    At the same time, because of price factors and other  well-known reasons, budget expenditures have grown at even more  rapid rates. In essence, the city administration has come up  against the problem of choosing to cancel certain municipal  orders or continuing to work while increasing municipal debts.    I can say definitely that the latter path was chosen,  because  otherwise it would have been impossible to avoid the threat of  the collapse of such a complex as the construction complex and  services so necessary to the city such as the association for  urban planning. This is why the city's carryover budget  indebtedness for 1993 for the various branches of the municipal  economy amounted to more than R28 billion.    The system of strict financial discipline I have introduced,  which presupposes strictly specified expenditure of funds,  pushes us toward the objective inevitability of such a factor as  indexation.    Compare. Unprecedented amounts have been spent on capital  repair and current maintenance of roads and other facilities for  outside urban development--R16.2 billion. As a result, 1.718  million square meters of roads and sidewalks have been repaired.  And almost the same amount--R15 billion--was spent to increase  the wages of workers in the social-cultural sphere.    For the development of housing and municipal services  enterprises, R25.1 billion were allotted from the budget; for  capital repair of the housing supply and landscaping the areas  around buildings--R3 billion. At the same time, because of the  application of regulated rates, housing and municipal services  enterprises were allotted R19 billion just in the form of  reimbursement.    Analysis shows the city's need for funds for indexation of  expenditures amounted to R170 billion during the year. Republic  organs reimbursed the Kazan budget for only a small proportion  of the funds--no more than 15 percent. As a result, practically  all of the extra revenues collected--more than R80 billion--went  precisely for indexing expenditures and increasing wages.    Work done for capital construction (a large part of which is  free housing) cost the budget R50.5 billion. On compensation for  housing construction collectives, R2.6 billion was spent.    Such is the price, in the first place, of inflation, and, in  the second place, of a socially oriented economy.    In addition to this, the city budget was formed and executed  far beyond its capabilities.    At the same time, it is possible arbitrarily to separate the  problems that are within our reach from those that are  completely beyond our capabilities.    The payment discipline of the departments remains one of the  most crucial problems. According to data for 1 March of this  year, the arrears on one of the leading taxes--on  profit--amounted to more than R4 billion for the city.    The second most important is the income tax from citizens.  The steady increase in the untaxed minimum wage--generally a  good thing--leads to a narrowing of the base of this tax.  Moreover, the decline of production, or rather, its  consequences, have a negative effect, as do the reduction of the  staffs and the work week, forced administrative leaves, etc.    In a word, the income tax is shrinking like shagreen  leather.    Against this background it is quite [text missing] negligent  attitude toward the budget and financial discipline.    Unsatisfactory supervision on the part of the  Gorelektrotransport association led to a reduction of the volume  of paid transportation. It transported 25 percent fewer paying  passengers than last year and failed to receive a total of R138  million in revenues.    The production association Kazgorzhilkhoz is not taking the  proper measures to reduce defaulted indebtedness on apartment  rent and municipal services. As of 1 January 1994, this amounted  to R35.8 million or 22.7 percent of the monthly amount.  Defaulted indebtedness is especially great in Baumanskiy (40.1  percent) and Vakhitovskiy (35.5 percent) rayons.    As a result of reducing the volumes of bathing services by  25.4 percent and laundry services by 12.2 percent as compared to  the corresponding period of last year, the Kombytservis leasing  association failed to receive R88.6 million in revenues.    Inspections conducted by financial organs of the city  established cases of unauthorized use of funds allotted from the  budget for the development of housing and municipal services  amounting to an overall sum of R34 million.    Under the conditions of the transition of the city economy  to  market relations and the critical shortage of financial  resources for solving the city's problems, questions of local  taxation become crucial. Local taxes are still an unutilized  reserve for Kazan. In essence, in a situation with a critical  budget deficit, we have indulged in an impermissible luxury by  introducing only 12 local taxes and fees of the 20 that are  envisioned by legislation.    The mistake that was made must be rectified here. In this  hall, at this session. The more so since the situation has  become even more severe. The financial organs--federal and  republic--henceforth will regard local taxes as reserves that  have not been taken into account and will predict them in the  revenue part of the city budget. And, in particular, all of our  appeals "to above" with one or another financial initiative will  be rejected, referring to the seven unutilized sources.    Actually, local taxes and fees make up a relatively small  proportion. Their essence lies elsewhere; everyone must learn to  live within their means and fill the treasury from their own  sources.</p>

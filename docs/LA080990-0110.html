			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRAIN'S MARIJUANA 'RECEPTOR' IS IDENTIFIED;  </P> <P> MEDICINE: RESEARCHERS SAY THE DISCOVERY SHOULD HELP 'FULFILL THE PROMISE' OF  THE SUBSTANCE AS MEDICINE.  </P> <P> After two decades of searching, government researchers have finally identified  the specific site on the surface of brain cells where marijuana binds to induce  its mood-altering effects.  </P> <P> Identification of this so-called cannabinoid receptor, reported today in the  British journal Nature, should provide a major step forward for researchers who  are trying to produce drugs that have the positive medical effects of marijuana  without its accompanying intoxicated feeling, disorientation and impaired  perception and memory.  </P> <P> Marijuana has been found to have therapeutic effects on epilepsy, glaucoma,  asthma, nausea, pain and hypertension. It is now used to only a limited extent  in treating nausea in cancer patients, however, because of both the moral  issues associated with its mood-altering effects and the severe restrictions  the government has placed on the growth and sale of marijuana.  </P> <P> The existence of a receptor means that the brain almost certainly produces its  own chemicals, similar to those found in marijuana, that are used in  communication between brain cells. Moreover, the location of the cells involved  suggests the chemicals may be involved in memory and intelligence, as well as  having therapeutic properties.  </P> <P> "The receptor's not there just so people can go out and smoke pot and get  high," said pharmacologist Tom I. Bonner of the National Institute of Mental  Health in Bethesda, Md., a co-author of the paper.  </P> <P> Those naturally occurring compounds or synthetically produced derivatives could  be the foundation of a whole new family of drugs.  </P> <P> The identification of the cannabinoid receptor should "vastly accelerate drug  development, fulfilling the . . . promise of marijuana as medicine," said  neuroscientist Solomon H. Snyder of the Johns Hopkins University School of  Medicine. "I'd say it's one of the most important discoveries in marijuana  research."  </P> <P> Pharmacologist Lisa A. Matsuda and her colleagues at the institute sifted  through genetic material in the brain cells of rats until they found a gene  that looked like a good candidate for the cannabinoid receptor.  </P> <P> They then inserted the gene into cells from the ovaries of Chinese hamsters.  These cells, which are widely used in research, do not normally respond to  marijuana. But when Matsuda exposed the genetically altered cells to  delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the primary ingredient of marijuana, they  exhibited a biochemical response that could only have been stimulated by the  receptor.  </P> <P> Although the Nature paper reports only on the rat brain receptor, Matsuda said  in an interview that her group has found a similar gene in human brain tissues.  </P> <P> The researchers also determined where in the rat brains the receptor was being  produced. They found that is was most common in the cerebral cortex, which is  the seat of all conscious sensations and actions, memory, will and  intelligence. The concentration of cannabinoid receptors is also high in the  hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in short-term memory.  </P> <P> In addition to new forms of disease therapy, identification of the cannabinoid  receptor could lead to development of new compounds to ease the craving of  people who have become habituated to marijuana.  </P> <P> Matsuda also speculated that some mental disorders whose causes are currently  unknown may be the result of defects in the cannabinoid receptor. Because of  the discovery of the receptor, she concluded, "we can learn a lot more about  how the brain works."  </P> <P> The discovery also provides a definitive solution to a dispute that has been  roiling the drug abuse research community for years.  </P> <P> Many researchers did not believe that a cannabinoid receptor actually existed.  Because delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is a molecule that dissolves readily in  fats, researchers long assumed that it exerted its effects by dissolving in the  membrane of brain cells and disrupting normal activities.  </P> <P> That is the mechanism, for example, by which most anesthetics work.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Allyn C. Howlett, a pharmacologist at the St. Louis University  School of Medicine, reported experiments that strongly indicated that a  cannabinoid receptor did exist and that predicted many of its properties. The  work suggested that the receptor was found primarily in parts of the brain  involved in thought, learning and memory.  </P> <P> "Her work . . . was probably not accepted by a large group of people because of  a lot of evidence that argued against a receptor theory," Matsuda said.  </P> <P> "Our results show that there is a gene present that produces the protein that  she described," thereby confirming Howlett's work and vindicating her  arguments, Matsuda said.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview Wednesday, Howlett said that she and her colleagues  have isolated a chemical that they believe is the brain's naturally occurring  cannabinoid, but that the work is too preliminary to discuss.  </P></p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Poll tax bills may be 'near Pounds 100' - Wales MR David Hunt, Welsh secretary, told the Commons yesterday that the average poll tax should be 'around Pounds 100' in Wales in the coming financial year. He also announced that the increase in the business rate poundage would be limited to 4.1 per cent. Mr Barry Jones, the shadow Welsh secretary, dismissed the forecast level of poll tax as 'unrealistic', and argued that the increase in total local-authority spending - just over 5 per cent  - was 'nothing like enough'. He maintained that an increase closer to 10 per cent was needed to provide for the additional duties of local authorities. Mr Hunt condemned Labour's 'spend, spend, spend' approach, but failed to secure a response when he challenged the Labour front bench to say whether the demands for extra expenditure made by Mr Jones had been approved by Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor.</p>

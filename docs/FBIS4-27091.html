			<p>BFN     [Text] A court has banned the East Timor conference.  Earlier, Judge Marciano Bacalla of Branch 216 of Quezon City  Regional Trial Court issued a temporary restraining order [TRO].    Under Judge Bacalla's directive, Renato Constantino Jr.,  Augusto Miclat and their colleagues have been barred from  conducting the East Timor conference.    Judge Bacalla has also ordered University of the Philippines  [UP] President Emilio Javier and UP Law Dean Pacifico Agabin not  to allow UP and its facilities to be used for the conference.    The court's restraining order will take effect on 30 May and  will last until 4 June.    Meanwhile, Renato Constantino Jr., in reaction to the  restraining order said their lawyers are studying the order of  Judge Bacalla. Constantino's group is organizing the conference.  UP President Emilio Javier has declined comment. It will be  recalled that Javier had denied Malacanang's [presidential  office] request not to hold the conference at UP.    Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Renato De Villa said the  conference cannot be held anywhere in the country.    [Begin recording in English] [De Villa] It says here very  clearly, whether the venue be within or outside of the premises  of the University of the Philippines. So, they cannot hold it  anywhere until this TRO is lifted.    [Correspondent] Sir, don't you think this will create more  trouble?    [De Villa] I cannot say because we don't know what's going  to  happen. [end recording]</p>

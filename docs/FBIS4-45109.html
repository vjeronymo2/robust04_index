There are many  reasons for this. The biggest reason is that cotton crops during  the last two years were badly damaged by special kinds of pests.  Since the whole textile industry depends on good and plentiful  harvests, the textile industry and other related industries are  facing a crisis now. In addition to cotton, the wheat production  this year was not as good as expected. Therefore, wheat had to  be imported from the United States. The continuous drought  during the last three years has effected agricultural production  as well as electricity generation because of shortage of water.  Our agricultural and industrial production is also reduced  because of load shedding. Thus, Pakistan's economic graph is not  more than 3.5 percent. V.A. Jaffery, prime minister's economic  expert, claims that our GDP is about 4 percent. Anyhow, keeping  away from these figures for a while, we have to admit that all  in all our economy is not satisfactory and production in two  main departments--agriculture and industry--is declining  gradually. Thus, Pakistan's budget is being prepared keeping  this information in mind. This budget is being prepared  accepting all the conditions laid down by the IMF. As I wrote in  my column recently, this budget will let the genie of inflation  out of the bottle and will drown every thing with it. The  present government accepted the IMF conditions and first decided  to levy the general sales tax (also known as weight and value  aided tax). The general sales tax will be levied on every thing  manufactured in this country. When manufactured goods are taxed,  the investors will pass this burden to the consumers. This way  the common people who are already screaming under the weight of  high prices will also have to bear the burden of general sales  tax. It is said that the government is planning to increase all  government salaries by 35 percent. The government will have to  bear an additional 12 billion rupees expense this way. How will  the government meet his additional expense? I think it important  to mention here that when a general sales tax was introduced in  Europe, consumers had strongly demonstrated against it. The  government had to use force to control that. Such demonstrations  are expected to take place in Pakistan also. However, we have to  see how our government controls these demonstrations. The bosses  of the IMF want to push Pakistan and other third world countries  into the trap of unreasonable taxes so that these countries are  unable to make economic progress because of social upheavals.  This is a major joke against Pakistan and other third world  countries. The IMF is demanding reduction of duty on imports to  help the developed nations benefit and keep their factories  running. At the same time, it is getting taxes imposed on the  people to block all ways for them to live proudly.    In the context of Pakistan's economic development, it is  important to mention that the leaders here have no sympathy for  the poor. Although these leaders come to power by crying about  the problems faced by the poor people, once they gain power they  do not even listen to the complaints of these poor people. Also,  the landlords and investors control power in Pakistan. This  groups believes that it should rule by keeping people hungry and  naked. Thus, they do not let the government take any step that  might benefit the poor. Instead, the poor are told to be  prepared to face tougher times. It is surprising that only the  poor are expected to face unfortunate and unfavorable  conditions. Some of them do not even get a shroud when they die.    It would not be out of place or unnecessary to mention the  Soviet Union in the context of the present economic situation.  Its merciless bureaucracy and unscientific economic policies  played an important role in the fall of the Soviet Union. The  people were silent against the flawed policies and the  propaganda. No major movement was launched against the  government there. The result of the "silence" of the people was  the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The economic problems  that the people are facing there is known only to them. A  similar economic and political situation exists in Pakistan. We  are obeying "orders" from such economic agencies that are not  ours and are forcing us to take steps in the name of a market  economy that we might lose everything. Why do we want to make  progress with aid? Cannot these landlords reduce their luxuries  and improve the economy of our country? We have India's example  also. It owes more money than us, but still refused to accept  the IMF and World Bank conditions. India's Finance Minister  Manmohan Singh gave such a reply to these organizations that  they were silenced. The problem in Pakistan is that the people  in power lack feelings for their country. The middle class is  not involved in our politics. This results in almost no national  unity. Meanwhile the bureaucracy and the government are making  decisions and sending the message to the people to be prepared  for the coming hard times. The former government had started tax  on agricultural products to include as many people as people in  the tax base. However, the state governments have not taken any  step in this area. One World Bank representative told me that  the state governments have no plans to levy agricultural tax.  The question arises: How will the government create additional  resources? Perhaps, the government itself does not have the  answer to this question. Those economic experts who are working  for a specific lobby here do not have any answer to it,  either!</p>

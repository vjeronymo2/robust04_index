			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin gave his backing to  the establishment of a pro-presidential party during his meeting  with Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar in the Kremlin on  Friday. However, Yeltsin does not intend to become a member,  Gaydar told journalists after the meeting.    Gaydar stressed that the new party Russia's Choice would not  be a party of high officials led by the president. "Boris  Yeltsin believes that no narrow party of the his supporters must  be established and that is why he is not going to head it or to  be a formal member," Gaydar said.    Gaydar considered the firm agreement that there would be no  other presidential party other than Russia's Choice to be the  most important result of the meeting. "We will coordinate our  organizational activities with the president. This is necessary  since there is much misunderstanding between supporters of  democracy due to different initiatives on the structuring of the  democratic movement," Gaydar pointed out.    Commenting on the correlation between the establishment of  the president's party and the memorandum on accord, Gaydar said  the significance of the agreement on civil accord was that the  document speaks of the unacceptability of violence and tension  in the society. However, Gaydar stressed that the head of state  as a politician was not a "sterile being raised in a tube with  no past or political supporters, no own views or program." He  must have political allies.    Gaydar announced that the Russia's Choice faction would meet  Yeltsin on Monday. The meeting is to discuss the situation in  many Russian regions and the threat of administrative  countermeasures. "We will also discuss issues concerning the  memorandum on accord and the efficiency of the democratic  forces' activities in the State Duma," Gaydar added.    The Russian president's Press Secretary, Vyacheslav  Kostikov,  stated after the meeting that Yeltsin and Gaydar had much in  common, especially in the fields of economic reform and renewal  in Russia. However, he stressed that despite this the Russia's  Choice Party would be independent of the president. They will  closely cooperate, Kostikov suggested.    Kostikov said the coming meeting between the president and  the Russia's Choice faction was the first one opening a series  of meetings between the president and representatives of  different blocs and parties. It was not by chance that the  first meeting would be held with Russia's Choice. This shows  that the president's political orientation remains the same,  said Kostikov.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with south Yemeni "President" 'Ali </F> Salim al-Bid by Nura Fakhuri in al-Mukalla; date not given:  "Penetration of Aden Would Not Be Easy; I Support Stopping the  War, Even Internationally"]    [Excerpt] [Introductory passage omitted] In al-Mukalla,  where crows which like Yemen's climate are not much in evidence,  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT was granted the first interview to an Arabic  publication by President 'Ali Salim al-Bid since the declaration  of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY].    On his assessment of the current military and political  situations, al-Bid said:    When unity started facing problems we sought dialogue and  the  quest for solutions with others in a peaceful and democratic  way, and that will remain our position. When war was imposed on  us we had to defend ourselves. After the agreement was signed,  the other side found itself unable to implement it. It was not  convinced of the agreement to begin with, and that is why it did  what it did. That did not surprise us because he ('Ali 'Abdallah  Salih) does not understand that approach. What surprised us was  the position of the other forces around him, including the  patriotic forces and influential figures we had a dialogue with  for long months. How did they agree to go along with him or  remain silent after what has happened?    Despite that, we will continue to offer our grounds for  dialogue once we finish with this war which was imposed on us  and in which our army which was in the north was hit. We are  now defending ourselves in our homes after the intensity of the  aggression, plunder, looting, and murder reached a climax in  Abyan, Shabwah, and every other point they [the northern forces]  reached. Militarily, they have not been able to achieve any more  than they achieved in the first few days. They are in a  to-and-fro situation around Aden at a distance of 70-120 km.    When we said to al-Bid that the figure of 30 km from Aden  had  been mentioned, he replied:    If they were 30 km from Aden the city would be under  relentless artillery fire. Had the city been within the range  of their artillery, life would have come to a standstill in Aden  but that has not happened.    On the statements made by Yemeni Planning Minister  'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani and President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih about  penetration of Aden and al-Mukalla soon if the negotiations  fail, al-Bid laughed and said: They are welcome to try.    On the possibility of penetration and occupation of Aden and  al-Mukalla, al-Bid ruled it out, and added: Personally, I have  no problem with penetration. How would he maintain his army and  occupation if such a penetration did occur?    The problem is not breaching a place but keeping it. Would  he be able to do that? We are at war and war is advance and  retreat and constant motion, but when the logic of occupation  prevails then such occupation is rejected. The people would  reject and resist it. It would not then be a question of  military balance or of a brigade facing another because the  people would reject annexation and occupation and everyone would  therefore cooperate with the armed forces. You should bear in  mind that it would be very difficult for them to penetrate Aden  or al-Mukalla, and if they did, the price would be very high. I  do not believe that they would be able to pay such a price. We  would resist and it would be difficult for them to pay the price.    Are Aden and al-Mukalla considered red lines?    Al-Bid replied: Yes, they are red lines.    On the initiative submitted to the Security Council and the  possibility of UN forces moving in to disengage the combatants,  al-Bid said: I am in favor of stopping the war by any means  even if that means the entry of UN forces. In this war there is  no victor and vanquished. The Yemeni people are the only loser.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that over 3,000 fighters have  arrived in Aden from the camps around al-Mukalla, coming from  the Shabwah area. They are now being reassembled and redeployed  in areas from al-Mukalla to Mayfa'ah in the direction of the  city of 'Ataq. The next few days are expected to witness a  fierce battle for the recapture of the positions lost by the  southern forces in Shabwah.</p>

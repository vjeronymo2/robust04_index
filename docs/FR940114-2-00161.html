Section 301(a) of the CWA provides that the discharge of pollutants is unlawful except in accordance with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. Although such permits have been issued to individual dischargers, EPA's regulations do authorize the issuance of ``general permits'' to categories of discharges (40 CFR 122.28) when a number of point sources are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Located within the same geographic area and warrant similar pollution control measures;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Discharge the same types of wastes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Require the same effluent limitations or operating conditions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Require the same or similar monitoring requirements; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) In the opinion of the Director, are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under individual permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Like individual permits, a violation of a condition contained in a general permit constitutes a violation of the Act and subjects the owner or operator of the permitted facility to the penalties specified in section 309 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. A Notice of Intent (NOI) to be covered under this General Permit is required (40 CFR 122.28(b)(2)(i)). The requirements are outlined in Part I.E. of the permit. An Annual Placer Mining Application would be acceptable if it contains all the items specified in the permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: UAP set to challenge for top position in insurance UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP) has achieved its aim of becoming a force in the European insurance industry following this week's acquisition of a controlling stake in Colonia, the German insurer, according to Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman. He said UAP, the largest force in French insurance, was Europe's second-largest insurer and planned to challenge Germany's Allianz for pole position. 'UAP is now clearly a force in Europe. We're pleased to have moved into a position where we can prepare for the race to the top.' UAP, a candidate for privatisation by France's centre-right government, has for four years been trying to take over Colonia, the second-biggest German insurer. It sought to negotiate a deal with Suez, the French holding company that owns Victoire, the French insurer with a majority interest in Colonia. Mr Peyrelevade, who was anxious to conclude the deal before UAP's privatisation amid speculation that he was about to become chairman of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, concluded the deal on Tuesday. The agreement, a complex combination of cash payments and share swaps, is valued at FFr8bn-FFr10bn (Dollars 1.4bn-Dollars 1.8bn). However, UAP had paid FFr14bn for a 34 per cent minority stake in Victoire which it has ceded to Suez. Mr Peyrelevade said the transaction would dilute UAP's earnings per share by 10 per cent in 1994 and 6.7 per cent in 1995. UAP intends to consolidate its interests. 'The focus of the group will change dramatically to internal growth and profitability,' said Mr Peyrelevade. 'After all, we've run out of money and we wouldn't want to be imprudent.' UAP still plans to expand its UK interests beyond its existing life insurance business. Mr Peyrelevade said that he hoped next year to conclude talks with a UK partner.</p>

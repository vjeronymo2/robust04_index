			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Japanese paper lifted by continued strength of yen THE continued strength of the yen against the US dollar helped lift Japanese government bonds, which ended the day above Friday's close. Bonds rallied as the dollar fell below Y120 in Tokyo, since a strong yen means it is easier for the Bank of Japan to lower interest rates. The US currency traded at around Y119.45 in London. The yield on the benchmark No 145 issue opened at 4.78 per cent and moved to 4.77 per cent on yen strength. It ended the day at 4.785 per cent, against Friday's close of 4.80 per cent. Volume in the cash market was average, with dealers accounting for most of the activity. The strengthening of the yen is partly accounted for by the flight of Japanese capital out of Europe and back to Japan ahead of the end-September book-keeping. Mr Ian Rosser, economist at Nomura International, points out that it is 'unlikely that this flow will be reversed until the situation in Europe becomes clearer and the US presidential election is out of the way - consequently the yen should strengthen further.' Tomorrow, the Ministry of Finance is due to auction about Y800bn of 10-year bonds. Traders expect a re-opening of the No 151 issue, with a coupon of 5 per cent. GERMAN government bonds drifted lower, with dealers complaining the market had been overbought on Friday on talk of a two-speed Europe whereby Germany, France and the Benelux countries would move more quickly towards Emu. EC finance ministers were quoted last night as firmly rejecting the possibility of a two-speed Europe. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 90.69, close to the high of the day of 90.71, and drifted down to a low of 90.28. The futures contract ended at around 90.34, and volumes were below average. Dealers said the market ignored fairly favourable inflation figures from the state of Bavaria, where the cost of living climbed 0.2 per cent in the month to mid-September, giving a year-on-year rise of 3.9 per cent. FRENCH government bonds ended lower in spite of a strengthening of the French franc. Wholesale money market rates remained high, even though the franc recovered to reach 3.3690 to 3.3700 per D-Mark, closer to its EMS pivot of 3.35386 than the 3.4305 floor. SPANISH government bonds ended lower as the peseta continued to hug the floor of its fluctuation band in the ERM. Dealers said the Spanish market spent yesterday waiting for the outcome of the EC finance ministers' meeting in Brussels. The 10-year government bond fell from 85.50 to 84.90. Dealers said foreigners continue to shun the Spanish bond market following the introduction of capital controls last week. They were intended to hit currency speculators, but increased funding costs for buyers of Spanish bonds. HOPES of a base rate cut helped to support short-dated UK government bonds yesterday, while inflation fears pushed long-dated gilts lower. Among short-dated issues, the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 firmed from 102 27/32 to 102 7/8 to yield 8.13 per cent. At the long end of the market, the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 fell from 98 3/8 to 98 3/32 to yield 9.23 per cent. Index-linked issues continued to gain from doubts about the government's anti-inflation resolve with the 2 1/2 per cent index-linked issue climbing from 99 3/32 to 99 21/32 . US Treasury prices firmed yesterday on hopes of an interest rate cut in the wake of last week's bad economic news. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 98 7/8 , to yield 7.337 per cent. The two-year note was also slightly firmer at the halfway mark, up  1/32 at 100 13/32 , yielding 3.771 per cent.</p>

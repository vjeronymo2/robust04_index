			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS CARRY THE MESSAGE OF 'ROMANCE' FOR FALL  </P> <P> When fall showings begin in Europe this weekend, the world's great designers  will once again etch their fantasies in cloth, drape them on some of the  world's skinniest women and send them down runways to be observed by the most  sophisticated retailers on the planet.  </P> <P> It will be, as it is twice each year, an exercise in artistry rather than  commerce.  </P> <P> Judging from these exclusive advance photos of new styles from Milan, the mood  for fall is romantic. Shoulders are rounded; shapes are soft; draping and  pleating and lavish use of fabric implies an overall opulence reminiscent of  bygone eras.  </P> <P> Of course buying a new look for each new season seems an antiquated notion to  most U.S. women.  </P> <P> But the idea of dressing beautifully, dramatically, distinctively or simply  appropriately retains its allure. The business of fashion may ebb and flow, but  the romance of it remains constant.  </P> <P> How else to account for the increasing use of clothing as an indicator of  character, status, even political leanings in the films and literature of the  '80s? How else to account for the public's unceasing interest in all things  related to fashion and personal style?  </P> <P> And clothes as appealing as some of those shown here may just prove to be the  catalyst needed to start U.S. women shopping again.  </P> <P> Relatively few will be able to afford the real European clothes once they are  imported by American retailers to U.S. stores. But eventually the mood and  shape of these exquisitely crafted and expensive outfits will become the basis  for fashions that show up at all price levels in stores around the country.  </P></p>

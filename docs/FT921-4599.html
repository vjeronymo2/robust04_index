			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Arts: British pavilion pulls it off - Architecture / Colin Amery pays an early visit to Expo '92 in Seville The problem is a difficult one. How does an architect design a pavilion that, in one bold gesture, symbolises the spirit of a nation and conveys a memorable message to the world? At Expo '92 in Seville, the architects Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners have pulled it off. All the best buildings are built around one clear idea. The idea behind the British pavilion was to bring the sound and presence of moving water to the dry, hot island of of La Cartuja. This is right for Seville, where temperatures in high summer can sometimes reach as high as 49`C (120`F). It would have been easy to design another fountain or a leafy courtyard, but Grimshaw decided to make the whole front of the pavilion a wall of moving water. The architect has been able to achieve this wonderful effect with the brilliant collaboration of the sculptor William Pye. The British pavilion is sited at the head of the avenue devoted to European Community members' pavilions. The design is clear and rational; the architects have taken care to avoid any elements of 'Disney' and razzmatazz. Visitors approaching from the east will see a crystal box some 25m high, 70m long and 40m wide. The whole entrance facade is a cascade of falling water rushing over the glass wall into a wide moat. Two 'curtains' of water mark the entry point, which is a narrow bridge passing over the blue waters of the moat (I did wonder whether this relatively small entry point will cope with the anticipated millions of visitors). Once the visitor has crossed the bridge, he will emerge into an enormous glass exhibition hall that is strongly reminiscent of views of the interior of Sir Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace of the 1851 Great Exhibition - the source and origin of the idea of universal expositions. The structure of the pavilion is an example of the most recent techniques of steel and glass assembly. Every element was designed and made in Britain, the parts shipped to Spain and erected on the site in the short period of 42 weeks. This 'kit of parts' approach is very much Grimshaw's trade mark, and at Seville he seems to have simplified things so that the high-tech elements seem to be more under control than in some of his British buildings. The main steel structure is supported on deep piles driven some 18 metres into the sediment of Cartuja island. Some of the wall and roof trusses are 25 metres long and they had to be escorted by the Spanish police on their six-day lorry journey from the port of Santander in Northern Spain. It is the east wall that everyone will remember. It is made of panes of glass suspended from stainless steel brackets and in front of the glass is the continuous waterfall designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and William Pye. Pye is best known for his two water sculptures, 'Jetstream' and 'Slipstream' that passengers pass on the way to their flights at Gatwick's north terminal. Water for the Seville cascade is pumped by solar-powered pumps from the pool at the base of the building to some 1,400 nozzles at the top. These nozzles are adjustable so that the effect can be varied from a slow, slithering creeping effect to a thundering cascade. Some three million litres of water is kept moving constantly. Water is brought right inside the pavilion over a gleaming stainless steel weir to provide a vast apparently still reflecting pool. The whole effect is undoubtedly a tour de force. Apart from the visual beauty of the moving water, I was impressed by the sound it makes. Outside, it has a cool and calming effect. Once you are inside the pavilion, the sound makes you feel as though it is permanently raining (perhaps this will reinforce foreigners' views about the British climate). I was told that despite the intense heat of a Sevillian summer there will always be enough water to ensure that the 'biggest water wall in the world' (to quote the publicity material of the pavilion's sponsors, the Department of Trade and Industry) will flow until October. I suspect it will be a hard job to prevent exhausted visitors from taking a refreshing dip. Inventive efforts have had to be made to ensure that the whole pavilion is cool. The most exposed west wall demonstrates a completely new technique. It is made of steel freight containers which are lined by an impermeable membrane and filled with water. This thick wall of stored water will absorb heat and should work to keep the interior cool in the same way as thick masonry walls ensure that medieval cathedrals are always cool in summer. Of course there has to be some mechanical air handling and cooling and one of the problems of the whole Expo has been to find ways of avoiding the raising the temperature of the site that would occur if all the pavilions expelled hot air into the atmosphere. The flat roof of the British pavilion has had to be protected from the extremes of the summer sun by shading louvres that also ornament the roofline. On these louvres are 150 panels of solar cells that provide the power for the water pumps. These solar cells and pumps will be used to provide power in 150 villages in the Third World after the pavilion is dismantled. The only element of rampant nationalism about the British pavilion is the giant Union Flag that can be seen through the water wall - and the water and flag do evoke a sense of a maritime nation. (The theme of the Expo '92 is 'Discovery', as the whole event is a commemoration of the explorations and discoveries that began with Columbus in 1492.) The designers of the interior of the pavilion are RSCG Conran Design and their brief has been to arrange exhibits that will help the visitor to discover Britain. Moving on giant travelators and escalators, and escorted by 'Navigators', the visitor will see video sculptures, an electronic tapestry composed of 275 screens giving a variety of images of Britain. There is a large theatre, and displays on the top floor look at the scientific development of the four elements. But the pavilion itself is the main exhibit, and it is the element of water that visitors will always remember in all its moving splendour.</p>

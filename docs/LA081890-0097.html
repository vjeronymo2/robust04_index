			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAM FANS EXPECTED TO GET LONGER LOOK AT WARNER  </P> <P> In an exhibition that otherwise offers little, tailback Curt Warner will make  his first start as a Ram tonight. The San Diego Chargers will provide the  opposition in the 46th annual Times/Rams Charity Game at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> Warner, 29, has rushed for 6,705 yards and 55 touchdowns in the NFL. Still,  there is much anticipation to see whether he remains the runner he was for the  Seattle Seahawks, who obviously didn't think so when they made him an  unprotected Plan B free agent last spring.  </P> <P> So far this summer, the Rams have guarded Warner's workload, careful not to  expose him to excess scrutiny. Last week in West Berlin, Warner made only a  token appearance, rushing for 12 yards in five carries, leaving the foreign  spotlight to Gaston Green.  </P> <P> But tonight, Warner will line up with the first-team offense -- at least what  is left of it -- and perhaps carry with him a glimpse of the team's future.  </P> <P> While Coach John Robinson maintains that Warner will never again carry the ball  300 times in a season, as he has in previous years, he believes the former Penn  State star can be an effective runner and leader on a young team with its  sights set on the Super Bowl.  </P> <P> In that sense, Warner begins a new chapter in his career tonight, although  Robinson said he has nothing to prove.  </P> <P> "In games, no," Robinson said. "He just has to show me that he's ready to do  what he can do, and he shows that on the practice field -- he still has the  zest for playing. He has demonstrated that the last couple of weeks."  </P> <P> Warner showed it again in Thursday's practice when he popped linebacker Fred  Strickland in the face mask after being tackled during a heated goal-line  rushing drill.  </P> <P> Warner has also been pushed somewhat by the emerging Green, who rushed for 115  yards last Saturday against the Kansas City Chiefs. With Cleveland Gary still  sidelined because of a lower back strain, Green will attempt to further improve  his stock in relief of Warner tonight.  </P> <P> "Warner will kind of have the lead role, with Gaston playing a lot," Robinson  said.  </P> <P> The rest of the game will be typical of most exhibitions. Quarterback Jim  Everett, who played a quarter last week, will play no more than the first two  offensive series against the Chargers. Chuck Long, resigned to mop-up duty with  the reserves last week, will get a shot with the first unit, which will not  include injured starting receivers Flipper Anderson and Henry Ellard.  </P> <P> Robinson said he might alternate both backup quarterbacks, Long and Mark  Herrmann, throughout the game so that they can be evaluated against the same  competition.  </P> <P> Both the Rams and the Chargers are teams trying to survive another summer of  contract disputes. The Rams have five veteran holdouts: Jackie Slater, Kevin  Greene, Damone Johnson, Doug Reed and Michael Stewart.  </P> <P> The Chargers still haven't signed two key players on defense -- outside  linebacker Leslie O'Neal and first-round choice Junior Seau.  </P> <P> Coach Dan Henning said there's little he can do but wait.  </P> <P> "In this day and age, I don't know how you can get concerned," he said of his  two holdouts. "I don't know how you compute the numbers. There doesn't seem to  be any rhyme or reason on the numbers; that people can be so far apart and  then, eventually, it gets done. When you start out a million (dollars) apart, I  can't get concerned with that. I don't even want to think about it."  </P> <P> Henning has turned his attention instead to quarterback, where he must choose  between second-year player Billy Joe Tolliver and Mark Vlasic, who missed all  of 1989 recovering from knee surgery.  </P> <P> Henning said he will play his starters for about a half against the Rams.  "We'll give Tolliver the lion's share of the work," he said. "Where we'll give  it to him in the game, I'm not sure at this point. Then the next priority is to  get Vlasic a good deal of work."  </P> <P> As for the season opener, Henning said: "Right now, the plan is to play with  Tolliver."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> George Menefee, who is in his 36th season as Ram trainer, will be honored at  halftime tonight. He has been with the team since 1955, having been hired by  Sid Gillman. Menefee will turn 75 in October. . . . Former Ram linebacker  Richard Brown is trying to catch on in San Diego and reportedly is doing well.  "Richard's had a good camp," Coach Dan Henning said. "He's worked real hard and  he has a shot."  </P> <P> The Rams might be catching the Packers at the right time when they open the  regular season in Green Bay, Wis., Sept. 9. The Packers, who have yet to sign  quarterback Don Majkowski, lost running back Brent Fullwood Friday. He  underwent arthroscopic surgery to remove cartilage in his right knee. The team  is saying he could miss the opener. . . . NFL teams must trim rosters to 60  players by Aug. 28, then to 47 by Sept. 3.  </P></p>

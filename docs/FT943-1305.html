			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Survey of Residential Property (7): Free house even if a pub won't pay - Gerald Cadogan looks at the economics of buying an inn and finds that even those that lose money can be good buys 'If I were buying a pub again', says Tony Hackett, landlord of the Bartholomew Arms in the Northamptonshire village of Blakesley, and a licensee for 35 years, 'I'd start by visiting other pubs around - before I went to the one I was interested in - just to see how much beer was being drunk in the area. If they're clean and bright but empty, it means no trade.' A rural pub needs a village of 500-600 people to be viable. Most of these need to live near enough to walk or roll home. Blakesley, says Hackett, is alright, but 'Maidford's never been a drinking village.' The trade is not what it was, Hackett says. Gone are the days when licensees wore their best suits for the Brewster Sessions in February (when licences are renewed). The magistrates would have a report in front of them from the watch committee on what needed repairing and a man turned up from the brewery with a big book to note it all down. 'Sometimes, the beaks went round to check for themselves. Nowadays licensees come in T-shirts and jeans. I stopped going seven or eight years ago,' he says. His life has been in Northamptonshire pubs. One he took in 1962 cost Pounds 126 for the fittings, fixtures and stock, and had a rent of Pounds 16. 'An old couple had had it. It was very run down.' But he built it up and soon it was the only pub in the county, outside Northampton, to have tanks fitted because the cellar did not have enough room for the increased amount of beer he needed. Pubs divide into the traditional and the gimmicky. Hackett has no tolerance for the gimmicky. 'They are only good 'til the pub down the road comes up with a better gimmick.' That explains why many publicans are in and out of the trade in two or three years. Theme pubs have a shifting population. 'There is no allegiance. At gimmicky pubs with youngsters you must be prepared once or twice a week to get your head thumped.' For food, he says, stick with what a pub does best, and remember that it is not an expensive restaurant and should not compete with one. 'A good ham, egg and chips is far better to offer than coq au vin,' even if the husband has qualified in catering and the wife fancies herself as a cook. Hackett also believes pubs should concentrate on creating the atmosphere of a welcoming family pub at the centre of village life to improve business. If there is an unruly element, 'get rid of it straightaway,' he says. The police 'take the attitude that you took the troublemakers' money helping them to get drunk. So you sort it out yourself.' Hackett stocks two traditional beers - 'real ale' - and three keg beers. Drinkers stick to one beer. 'A Phipps man didn't dream of drinking a Charles Wells.' This made problems for the darts teams when players refused to go to some pubs. Therefore, says Hackett, a large choice of traditionals has little point as they must be kept well and sold quickly, or they go off. The drink-driving laws are not really a problem. People have adapted. One person drives, often the wife, if they cannot walk home. You can become a publican as a tenant, or manager or owner. Breweries are disposing of tied houses and there are some repossessions in the market, although far fewer than a year ago. So there is a range of free houses available. The choice, says Paul Reilly, west country manager of specialist licensed agents, Business Sales Group, is whether to take a run down pub cheaply, trade up and move somewhere else in a few years, or buy a sound business. Buyers need to decide on their aims, and how they want to live and - most importantly - how strong their marriage is, before they start looking. How long will they stay? Can they improve it? Does it have outline planning permission for an extension? Banks are more likely now to lend, says Reilly, and the brewers will help free houses with loans. Pub sellers achieve best prices if they have good trading accounts, preferably for three years, and the house is is in good order. 'If it needs a new carpet, do it before you put it it on the market,' says Reilly. The usual price is about one and a half times turnover net of VAT. An alternative guide is how many barrels it sells. If the pub sells less than five barrels a week, it is not viable. Five barrels a week is about 250 a year, which can be capitalised at Pounds 500 a barrel - or a price of Pounds 125,000. So, occasionally, with a low-turnover pub, the bricks and mortar may prove more valuable than the business. A pub like this could sell at prices far below comparable houses - or cottages - that are not pubs, although sometimes VAT is added to the purchase price. In tenanted pubs a typical rent is Pounds 38 a barrel. Managers, of course, do not put up their own money but normally have a share of the profits as well as their salary. Although the beer is the prime commodity, the publican's income comes less now from the 'wet trade'. The ratio used to be 80 per cent wet, and 20 per cent from food; but now the food may be 40 or 50 per cent of turnover. Gaming machines, known as AWP (amusement with profit) machines, are another source of income. The publican normally receives half the take. Even so if, if a publican cannot sell beer, other income will not keep a pub afloat.</p>

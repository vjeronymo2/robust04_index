			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Leading Article: New concerns on development The troubles of the African Development Bank that have emerged this week - its mounting arrears, problem loans and poor management - reflect in part the dire economic circumstances of the continent it serves. They also raise fundamental doubts about the wisdom of encouraging the bank to lend substantial sums at market interest rates to low-income countries, many of which were already severely distressed by heavy debt burdens. The bank's management bears a large part of the responsibility for the mess, though shareholders from donor governments and other international financial institutions cannot escape their share of the blame. These failures must be comprehensively rectified. More than that, questions have to be asked about the institution's future and the extent to which its non-concessional loans are appropriate for Africa. Questions also arise for other regional development banks. The latter are in better shape than the African bank, but do share some of its problems. Most suffer from internal politicisation. Lacking the technical strengths and the diversity of membership of the World Bank, the regional banks have also been more vulnerable to the ideological and political disputes between donors - especially the US - and recipients. An atmosphere of distrust has too often existed between borrowers and non-borrowing members and also between shareholders and management. Battles have raged among member governments over important positions within the institutions. The banks have been encumbered by big and costly boards of directors, which have interfered frequently - but often, as the African bank's troubles suggest, to little effect. Meanwhile, managements have been more influenced by quantity than by quality, in making loans. Ideological baggage With the dumping of the ideological baggage of the cold war, there is now an important opportunity to rid the regional development banks of these damaging disputes. The US government, the most powerful shareholder of these institutions, has recently emphasised their importance to the new world order, in the most positive terms. According to US Treasury undersecretary, Mr Lawrence Summers, the regional development banks are now 'as important to the new world order as the regional security organisations were to the old one'. The task of fighting communism had, he said, been replaced by that of sharing prosperity. Greater expertise Despite past failures, there is much to commend Mr Summers's point of view. Multilateral lenders are able to leverage large amounts of finance from capital markets and banks, so stretching donor taxpayers' dollars further. Multilateral assistance is almost always more effective than bilateral aid. This is partly because multilateral institutions possess greater expertise than most governments, but also because bilateral aid is often for political, rather than developmental purposes. But concentrating multilateral aid in one institution - the World Bank - would create an undesirable monopoly. There is, in any case, a virtue in creating pools of regional development expertise. A new consensus between rich and poor countries puts the market at the centre of the development agenda. The main role of the regional development banks should become that of encouraging the development of markets, helping correct market failures, and alleviating the hardship created by reform. Since each continent faces specific problems, the regional development banks need separate, if overlapping, agendas. The US administration and other donor governments wish to give the regional development banks a new set of lending conditions, covering 'good governance' - the extent to which governments are democratic and free from corruption. These new conditions are well-meant, but must be treated with caution. Apart from being difficult to operate in a non-arbitrary fashion, they will be viewed as another attempt by rich countries to impose their will on poorer ones. The banks must not be politicised anew. They must also not be deprived of the clear-cut objectives essential to effective operation.</p>

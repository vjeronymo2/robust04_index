			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: Axa enters joint venture with BBV AXA, one of the leading French insurers, plans to expand its presence in Spain by forming a joint venture with Banco de Bilbao Viscaya (BBV), the Spanish bank which has substantial interests in the insurance sector. The two groups are negotiating to merge their Spanish insurance subsidiaries  -Axa's Seguros and BBV's Aurora Polar - into a new company in which each would have a 50 per cent stake. The new group would be the fifth biggest Spanish insurer with annual premiums of about FFr3.22bn (Dollars 649m). The bulk of the new company's business would be in the motor insurance sector, which would provide 49 per cent of its premiums. It would receive 22 per cent of its premiums from life insurance and the remainder from general (non-motor) policies. The companies said they expected the joint venture to 'optimise the efficiency of both existing companies'. For Axa, the second largest insurer in France, the Spanish initiative forms part of its international expansion strategy. Last year it made a move into the US by investing Dollars 1bn in Equitable Life Assurance, a leading US insurer.</p>

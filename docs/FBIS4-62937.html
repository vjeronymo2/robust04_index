			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In Vilnius today Wieslaw Walendziak, the  president of Polish Television, and Laimonas Tapinas, the  director general of Lithuanian Radio and Television, extended  for one year the agreement on cooperation between the two  television networks. This agreement was signed two years ago.    [Correspondent Aleksandra Akinszon] [passage omitted] After  the agreement was signed, Lithuanian journalists returned in  their questions to the incident of a week ago, when the  Lithuanian side refused to sign an agreement on the  retransmission of Polonia TV in the Vilnius region. President  Wieslaw Walendziak stressed that it had indeed been a  regrettable incident, but it had been resolved successfully, and  he proposed that these matters now be left alone. This is  Aleksandra Akinszon reporting from Vilnius.</p>

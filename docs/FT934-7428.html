			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Apartment sales help Regalian to cut losses REGALIAN Properties yesterday announced losses sharply reduced from Pounds 21.5m to Pounds 869,000 for the six months to end-September Mr David Goldstone, chairman, said the outcome showed that the group had survived recession and turned the corner. While the situation remained difficult on the commercial side, 'there is just that slight buzz in the residential market,' he said. The improvement was chiefly attributable to the sale of 16 out of 20 apartments at Kensington Palace Gardens, the luxury block near Kensington Palace. Sales of the group's London portfolio had made dramatic progress, he said, adding that only seven apartments were now left to sell. The recently announced joint venture to convert Alembic House, on the south bank of the Thames opposite the Houses of Parliament, from an office block to residential apartments marked a turning point in the group's fortunes, he suggested. Net debt at the end of September was down to Pounds 21m, compared with Pounds 64.5m at the end of March. Net interest payable fell from Pounds 4.68m to Pounds 1.92m. There were no provisions against the portfolio, compared with Pounds 18.3m last time. Total turnover rose to Pounds 50.5m compared with a previous Pounds 48.2m. Losses per share were 0.74p, down from 16.22p. Net assets per share were 35.76p (36.51p). The shares rose 2p to 23 1/2 p.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Output of cars rises 4% on year CAR PRODUCTION in April was 4 per cent higher than in April last year, helped by higher output for export markets, but production of commercial vehicles fell heavily for the third month in succession. Car production increased to 113,286 from 108,902 in the same month a year ago statistics released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Government's Central Statistical Office show. Car output in the first four months was 477,795. That was 5.7 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year ago. Production has been boosted by higher output for export markets in spite of the steep fall in new car sales in continental Europe. Production in the UK is rising as a result of the increasing output of Nissan, Honda and Toyota, the three Japanese carmakers that have located their first European car plants in the UK. Nissan is still planning to raise production at its Sunderland plant by 51 per cent this year to 270,000 from 179,000 last year, in spite of falling sales of its UK-built Primera large family car. Honda, which started output at its Swindon plant last October, is due to produce 32,000 cars this year, while output at Toyota's Burnaston plant near Derby is expected to total 36,000. Car output for export markets in April was 11.9 per cent higher than a year ago, while export production in the first four months increased by 8.2 per cent year on year. Production of commercial vehicles in April plunged by 33.5 per cent year on year to 14,989, while output in the first four months at 74,188 was 17 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year ago. Production has been hit by the collapse into receivership of Leyland Daf in early February. Output has continued at both the Leyland Daf vans plant at Birmingham and at the truck plant at Leyland, Lancashire, but it has been at a much lower level than a year ago. At the same time, van output by General Motors at its Vauxhall plant at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire and its IBC Vehicles plant at Luton has also seen a sharp fall.</p>

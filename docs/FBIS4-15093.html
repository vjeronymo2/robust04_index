			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Vinogradov: "Russia Takes On Mission as </F> Chief Peacemaker in Georgian-Abkhazian Conflict"]    [Text] Two Georgian-Abkhazian agreements have been signed  in Moscow, inspiring hope of the long-awaited end to the  conflict.    Russia's peacemaking role in securing these accords has  received an unequivocally high rating. Moscow is still pressing  for the UN Security Council to confer on Russia the status of  international peacemaker. Butrus Butrus-Ghali seems not to be  opposed to this. He cautiously confirmed that possibility. But  only in theory, in other words if multilateral forces are sent  to Abkhazia at any time and the Russian Army might be involved  in these forces and total 20-30 percent of the entire  contingent. At the same time Butrus-Ghali agreed that Moscow is  the most feasible force capable of influencing policy in the  "nearby foreign countries" and it holds the keys to a settlement  of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict.    Therefore the prospects of Russian citizens trying UN blue  helmets for size in the immediate future are hardly brilliant.  Experiencing financial difficulties as it is, the world  community is simply unwilling to literally pay for peace in the  former Soviet empire. Russia will obviously have to perform  this mission itself in one way or another. It is no coincidence  that Eduard Shevardnadze, who pinned so many hopes on UN forces  and observers, described their activity as passive and futile  when there was fighting under way in Abkhazia last week and  people were dying.    The first document pertaining to a settlement in Abkhazia  constitutes pledges on a cease-fire and refraining from using  force. The second represents the terms for the return to  Abkhazia of over 200,000 refugees who have gathered on the  Georgian bank of the Inguri River. The signing ceremony was  attended by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, his  personal representative Eduard Brunner [name as transliterated],  and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. Such lofty  patronage ruled out any possibility of either side pulling out  at the last minute as has happened repeatedly, and at the same  time creates guarantees for the implementation of the accords.    In an interview with IZVESTIYA, Eduard Brunner particularly  noted the peacemaking efforts made by Russian diplomacy, thanks  to which, he said, a major step has been taken toward solving a  very complex situation in one of the regions of the Caucasus.    The Moscow agreements were largely the result of compromise  and concessions on Tbilisi's part. They resolve current  problems and lay the foundation for talks on the main issue --  the political status of Abkhazia. Georgia lost the political  initiative with its edict dissolving the parliament in Sukhumi.  During recent combat operations it suffered another defeat.  And now Tbilisi has been forced to accept the kind of wordings  that it refused to hear of previously.    So, for the first time, the agreements do not mention  Georgian territorial integrity -- a fundamental principle at all  the previous talks. Russia and the United Nations nevertheless  underline their commitment to this principle. Andrey Kozyrev  once again confirmed that Russian foreign policy is still based  on recognition of Georgia as a unified state.    Tbilisi has also renounced its previous demand for all  refugees without exception to return freely. This agreement  does admittedly stipulate terms for admitting those who have  laid down their arms and have promised not to take them up  again, even if they fought on Georgia's side. Only those  formations and field commanders that are continuing the war are  barred from crossing the Inguri River. Presumably, the  repatriation mechanism will be finalized still further with the  participation of UN observers at local level and the Russian  military. A schedule has not yet been drawn up. The  international commission for refugees is to convene in Sochi.  Then there will be peacekeeping forces on the banks of the  Inguri River. The operation is expected to begin within the  next few days in order to give people a chance to carry out  spring field work. In the prevailing situation battalions of the  Russian Group of Forces in the Transcaucasus are the main  guarantor of stability.</p>

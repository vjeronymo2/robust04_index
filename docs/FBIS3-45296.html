			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 15 Jan (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, National  People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee chairman, met here  today with Richard Gephardt, majority leader of the U.S. House  of Representatives. Qiao Shi expressed the hope that the  Chinese NPC and the U.S. Congress would enhance exchanges and  cooperation with each other and make joint efforts to promote  the healthy growth of Sino-U.S. relations.    During the meeting, Qiao Shi extended his warm welcome to  Gephardt and his delegation. He said: The November 1993  meeting between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President  Clinton in Seattle was a new start in bilateral relations.  Since their meeting, many U.S. congressmen have visited China.  Such visits have helped promote the U.S. Congress's  understanding of the situation in various fields of China and  have provided opportunities for the two sides to exchange views  on issues of common concern.    On the issue of the most-favored-nation [MFN] trading  status,  Qiao said that the MFN treatment is an arrangement of equity and  mutual benefit between China and the United States. He  emphasized that China opposes linking the MFN treatment with  issues that have nothing to do with trade, such as the human  rights issue. He said he hoped that the MFN issue would be  resolved "once and for all."    Qiao Shi said: During the new period, a sound political,  economic, and trade relationship between the two countries is in  line with the fundamental interests of the two peoples and is  conducive to world peace and development.    Gephardt said: U.S.-Chinese relations are "most essential"  to the two countries and to the rest of the world as well.  Dialogue and exchanges would improve U.S.-Chinese ties. The  United States hopes that progress will be achieved in bilateral  relations in the period to come.    The U.S. guests arrived in China on 12 January at the  invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.  Liu Shuqing, president of the institute, was present at today's  meeting.</p>

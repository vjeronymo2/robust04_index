			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / 'Green' audit figures up THE PROPORTION of companies mentioning environmental issues in their annual reports has doubled to almost a fifth in the past year, but few provide much useful information, according to Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monthly monitoring service. About 18 per cent of companies that produced accounts in the last 12 months address 'green' concerns, but half of those provide vague and general statements that do not describe any action being taken, it says. For example, Kingfisher, the retailing group, which has projected an image of corporate responsibility, simply states its commitment to improving environmental performance and agreeing a policy with its board, without giving any details. Among the more interesting disclosures, National Westminster Bank says it takes environmental considerations into account when assessing loans. Austin Reed, the clothing manufacturer and retailer, encourages suppliers to meet environmental standards it sets. Separately, Company Reporting says that less than 3 per cent of companies provide any forecast information in their annual reports, in spite of a call for details of future developments in the European Community's 7th directive on company accounts. From a sample of 590 companies, 1.7 per cent highlight forecast information, a further 1.2 per cent provide some forward-looking details, and 0.3 per cent state that it is too difficult to make any forecasts.</p>

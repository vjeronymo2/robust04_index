			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Barclays suffers firebomb attacks Police urged vigilance after six firebombs were posted to London branches of Barclays Bank. They said that more might still be in the mail. One worker suffered shock and another was slightly injured but declined treatment when two devices went off as staff opened the post at branches in Hampstead High Street and Ladbroke Grove. There was no claim of responsibility. The bombs were in video cassettes and wrapped in Christmas paper.</p>

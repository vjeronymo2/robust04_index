			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Digesting the bad news at Alcatel - A look at why the French group's shares have weakened For Alcatel Alsthom, one of France's largest industrial groups, yesterday was the darkest day in a harrowing year. The telecoms, transport and engineering group watched almost 14 per cent of its market capitalisation disappear in a sell-off on the Paris bourse. The immediate cause of the rout was a warning late on Wednesday that profits for the year would fall much more sharply than the 10 to 20 per cent decline forecast in January. Mr Pierre Suard, chairman, predicted a net result of about FFr4bn (Dollars 758m) this year, some 40 per cent below the FFr7.06bn recorded in 1993. Alcatel said a fall in the share price was to be expected following its profits forecast. But it said the decline was excessive, and emphasised that the company remained one of France's most profitable business groups. For some observers, however, the scale of the sell-off reflected a succession of setbacks which had surprised investors and raised questions about the group's prospects. As well as the profits warnings - the first since 1987 when rapid expansion elevated the company to the ranks of the country's most profitable industrial groups - investors have also been unsettled by a legal case involving Mr Suard. In July, the Alcatel chairman was placed under investigation by a prosecuting magistrate in Versailles, accused of irregularities relating to payments at his Paris properties. He strongly rejected the allegations. 'There have been a number of incidents which have worried investors. But Wednesday's announcement was the really nasty surprise,' said one telecommunications analyst at a Paris merchant bank. 'It raises some important questions,' he said. Among the most important are why has this year's performance deteriorated so sharply? More broadly, does the decline reflect deeper problems at the group and in the international telecoms equipment industry? For Mr Suard, the questions are a cause for concern, but not alarm. Announcing his forecast on Wednesday, he described 1994 as a difficult year, blighted by specific problems. But he said it would mark 'the low point in the group's fortunes', and that next year would bring improved results. The specific problems referred to concern the company's telecoms operations. Its engineering activities, which include the construction of power stations and manufacture of the high-speed Train a Grande Vitesse with its UK partner GEC, performed largely in line with expectations and with last year's results. In telecoms, however, the group was badly derailed. In Brazil and Turkey, government austerity programmes and a consequent tightening of budgets for telecommunications equipment prompted a fall in sales and the freezing of contracts. The effect will be exceptional losses of about FFr300m in each country this year. The biggest problem, however, is Germany. The decline in investment in eastern Germany, and the shift by Deutsche Telekom, the state telecoms operator, to increase competition for supply contracts, are blamed for a sharp fall in demand and prices. For the full year, Mr Suard expects revenues at SEL, Alcatel's German subsidiary, to decline by about 20 per cent. Losses relating to the operation are expected to total about Ecu200m (Dollars 161.8m) for the year. Alcatel had warned of its German difficulties in January, but resolving the problems proved harder than expected. One reason, according to Alcatel, was that the necessary restructuring measures at the company's German plants had been delayed by the system of co-management with workers. Cost-cutting measures are now under way. By the end of next year, the company will have reduced by about 20 per cent its 20,000-strong workforce, says Mr Suard. For some observers, however, this provides limited reassurance. 'The most worrying aspect is that the scale of the problems in Germany was lost on the management,' said one analyst. Another concern is that developments in Germany reflect a deeper structural challenge for Alcatel. Deutsche Telekom's shift to a more open system for awarding supply contracts shows the pressures confronting many international telecoms operators in an increasingly competitive sector. With the liberalisation of the European telecoms market, scheduled for 1998, and with several large operators, including Deutsche Telekom, heading for privatisation, the pressure to reduce costs and prices paid to suppliers is sure to increase. Mr Suard accepts the trend is under way. He draws a parallel with the deregulation of the airline industry in the US, which prompted a period of turbulence and fierce competition. However, he believes that much of the fall in prices facing equipment suppliers has already happened. More important, he claims, is that Alcatel's problems are outweighed by its strength in new technology and new markets. He mentions the company's success in winning more than 40 per cent of the contracts to supply fibre optic networks for Germany. In the US, Alcatel Network Systems has become the biggest supplier of SDH digital transmission systems, and has established a strong position in broadband telecoms switching equipment. As well as the new technology, which will play a central role in the development of multimedia and information superhighways, the company has continued its aggressive expansion into international markets. In China, for example, a stream of contracts from central and regional governments this year has reinforced Alcatel's position as the dominant player in the world's fastest-growing telecoms market. The problem for Alcatel, however, is that demand for multimedia equipment will take time to become a substantial profit centre. In its markets such as China, competition is intensifying. 'The group has some attractive prospects. But the problems they face are more immediate,' says one analyst. Closer to home, there is another important contract on the horizon. The French government is set to announce the winner in the fiercely contested competition for France's third mobile telephones licence. With the country's mobile phone market now rapidly, if belatedly, expanding, the licence is regarded as a lucrative source of business by the three contenders: Alcatel, Lyonnaise des Eaux, the utilities group, and Bouygues, the construction group. A victory for Alcatel would provide a badly needed boost after all the bad news. However, after the shocks of the past nine months, it will take more to assuage investors' concerns.</p>

(GWISS), whose general partner is noncarrier GWI Dayton, Inc., has filed a notice of exemption to operate a rail car storage yard owned by CMC Railroad I Ltd. (CMC), and to operate under incidental trackage rights over a rail owned by Southern Pacific Transportation Company (SP) between CMC's yard and SP's rail yard in the vicinity of Dayton, TX. SP's rail car storage yard is located at Lafayette Main Line SP milepost 328.0; CMC's rail car storage has entrance connections at Baytown Branch SP mileposts 2.0 and 3.3. The incidental trackage rights cover the rail line between the two rail yards from the Baytown Branch SP milepost 5.0 to Baytown Branch SP milepost 0.0, which is also Lafayette Main Line SP milepost 327.8, and then from that point to the entrance to the SP yard at Lafayette Main Line SP milepost 328.0. The proposed transaction was expected to be consummated on or after April 5, 1994. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under 49 CFR 1150.32(b), a notice of exemption does not become effective until 7 days after filling. Here, because the notice was not filed until March 29, 1994, consummation should not have taken place until on or after April 5, 1994. Applicant's verified notice of exemption states that consummation is scheduled for on or about April 4, 1994, or immediate following the effective date of the notice, whichever is later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proceeding is related to Finance Docket No. 32482, Genesee and Wyoming Industries, Inc._Continuance in Control Exemption_GWI Switching Services, L.P., wherein Genesee and Wyoming Industries, Inc., has concurrently filed a notice of exemption under 1180.2(d)(2) to continue in control of GWISS and eight other class III rail carriers <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  when GWISS becomes a class III rail carrier upon consummation of the transaction described in this notice. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Allegheny &amp; Eastern Railroad, Inc., Bradford Industrial Rail, Inc., Buffalo &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad, Inc., Dansville and Mount Morris Railroad Company, Genesee and Wyoming Railroad Company, Louisiana &amp; Delta Railroad, Inc., Rochester &amp; Southern Railroad, Inc., and Willamette &amp; Pacific Railroad, Inc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) has filed a petition to reject the notices of exemption and the United Transportation Union (UTU) has filed a petition to revoke the notices of exemption and a motion to stay the transaction. BLE argues that the notices should be rejected because the Commission does not have jurisdiction over the transaction in Finance Docket No. 32481, as it involves yard operations which are exempt under 49 U.S.C. 10907 and not operations over a line of railroad under 49 U.S.C. 10901 and 49 CFR 1150.1. UTU argues that the exemption in Finance Docket No. 32481 should be revoked, alleging that this is a sham transaction to avoid Commission regulation and labor protective conditions under 49 U.S.C. 11343. These issues will be addressed in a separate decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any comments must be filed with the Commission and served on: James B.

(6)"]    [Excerpts] Former National Defense Ministry [KAM] leaders  set up a commission to determine prices, headed by Deputy  Minister S. Vasiliauskas. [passage omitted] I had a chance to  speak with the latter the day before yesterday. He said that  seven firms had offered helicopters for sale. Four of them were  professional commercial companies directly associated with  aircraft making plants with a strong record of providing  repairs, spare parts, and specialists. As the commission  chairman noted, the prices proposed by all of these companies  had matched their helicopters. According to S. Vasiliauskas,  the choice of the firms "Akvel" and "Mingrin" was not  accidental, because the latter proposed the latest technologies.  In addition, these firms guaranteed one year of free  maintenance, and the commodity offered by the firm "Akvel" was  in Lithuania. These facts decided their choice as the partners.  The experts' commission assessed the "Akvel" helicopter at  $900,000, while the price set by the firm was $1.2 million. The  KAM commission announced that the terms proposed by the partners  were acceptable. Thus, it suggested that agreements with the  companies "Akvel" and "Mingrin" be concluded. In reply to the  question of whether there had been any public bid, Mr. S.  Vasiliauskas said that there had not been any public  announcement. The ministry was preparing to buy helicopters  from a foreign country, and Lithuanian law does not require any  publicity in such cases. The commission received proposals from  Air Force Commander Z. Vegelevicius. It had only to vote on  whether one or another proposal was good or bad. "The role of  our commission was silly," acknowledged the deputy defense  minister. "I think that prices should be set differently." S.  Vasiliauskas claimed that the helicopter deal with the companies  "Akvel" and "Mingrin" had been very successful. However, when I  asked him why the ministry paid $3.5 million for three  helicopters, when it was possible to buy similar aircraft much  cheaper from Russia last year, the deputy minister replied that  he had commanded his subordinates to "knock down" the prices as  much as possible. The deputy minister could not explain why the  helicopters had arrived without certain parts, why they had not  been removed from Russia's air register, and why they had  differed from the type indicated in the agreement. Under the  agreement, Lithuania had to receive transport helicopters, while  the National Defense Ministry got helicopters for tourists.  [passage omitted]    Who will answer for all of this? As far back as 21 July  1993, Minister A. Butkevicius issued an order approving the  conclusions submitted by the KAM price commission and  authorizing Air Force Commander Z. Vegelevicius to sign  contracts with the stock companies "Akvel" and "Mingrin." The  agreements on the purchase of three helicopters were signed on  time, and even more quickly than usual. However, as we have  already reported, in the early summer of 1993, the KGB unit in  Smolensk prevented an operation whereby 10 military MI-8MTV  helicopters had to be transferred to Lithuania through the  Russian air transport company "Vitiaz" and the Kaunas  association "Selma." [passage omitted]    Ex-Minister A. Butkevicius claimed to RESPUBLIKA that the  firm "Selma," headed by a three-time convicted president, had  been proposed as a partner is supplying arms and ships by the  Russian Baltic Fleet leadership itself. "Selma" had been  entrusted with the construction of military housing in  Kaliningrad Oblast. Knowing that the firms "Selma" and "Vitiaz"  were authorized to conduct the helicopter operation, one could  assume that the companies "Vitiaz" and "Mingrin" were also  imposed on Lithuania's national defense leaders by the Russian  Baltic Fleet command. A. Butkevicius is trying to construe the  opinion that the refusal of the Russians' proposal would have  meant the burying of hopes for the Russian Army's timely  withdrawal. The KAM and its leaders were allegedly pursuing  noble goals. However, the deplorable and unsuited explanations  of the former KAM leaders can hardly justify their inability to  work honestly and properly, or the abuse of their  responsibilities.    Last spring, Chief State Inspector V. Kundrotas documented  dozens of financial violations at the Defense Ministry. Under  the 23 December 1991 instruction, 57.86 million rubles [R] were  transferred to one of the ministry's structural subunits -- the  Information Service -- for the alleged acquisition of  facilities. S. Vasiliauskas, its former manager who later became  deputy minister, concluded three delivery agreements: With the  joint Lithuanian-U.S. venture "Litvit" -- on the acquisition of  a military outfit for R38.5 million; with the same stock company  "Akvel," which had supplied the ministry with helicopters -- on  the purchase of special facilities for R16 million; and with a  commercial enterprise of technical supplies -- on the  acquisition of material assets for R2,226,000. Unfortunately,  the millions were transferred the very next day to private  companies which did not fulfill their commitments. [passage  omitted]</p>

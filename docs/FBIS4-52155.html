			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 7 KYODO -- Justice Minister Shigeto  Nagano resigned Saturday [7 May] over his remarks that the 1937  Nanjing massacre never happened and that Japan was not an  aggressor in World War II, and was replaced by Hiroshi Nakai of  the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP].    Nagano, a 71-year-old former serviceman who served for only  10 days as justice minister, submitted his resignation to Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata, who just returned from a six-day tour of  four European countries.    Hata accepted Nagano's resignation and named a successor  from  the DSP, a party in the ruling coalition. Nagano is a member of  Shinseito, a core party of the coalition led by the prime  minister.    Nakai, 51, is a House of Representatives lawmaker and a  former deputy secretary general of the DSP.    Nakai's appointment is scheduled to be attested by Emperor  Akihito at 10 A.M. Sunday, government sources said.    Nagano apologized to Hata for the trouble caused by his  "inappropriate remarks" and vowed personal action to show that  Japan will not start a war again, Nagano said after meeting Hata.    Nagano told Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai earlier  in the day that he would resign because his comments had caused  so much turmoil among Japan's international relations.    Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the largest opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), called Nagano's resignation a  "matter of course," saying the remarks spoiled the LDP's  diplomatic efforts with neighboring nations during its 38-year  rule which ended last August.    Nagano said in an interview published Wednesday in major  daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN, "the Nanjing incident was a fabrication."    He also said, "I think it is wrong to define the war as a  war  of aggression (by Japan) ... Still, I doubt the Greater East  Asia War, as it was called in Japan, was aimed at aggression."    Following criticism from China, North and South Korea and  other Asian countries Japan invaded before and during World War  II, Nagano retracted his remarks and apologized at a news  conference Friday.    China estimates that imperial Japanese Army troops massacred  more than 300,000 Chinese civilians following their invasion of  the then Chinese capital of Nanjing in December 1937. But  Japanese historians tend to give lower estimates -- mostly to  the order of 100,000.    Nagano is the third minister to resign in eight years over  similar remarks about the war.    In September 1986, Masayuki Fujio resigned as education  minister under the administration of Yasuhiro Nakasone after  provoking China and Korea with his remarks on Japan's prewar  actions.    Fujio said Japan's annexation of Korea in 1910 was based on  an agreement between the two countries and justified the  Japanese act of colonization of the Korean peninsula. He also  criticized Nakasone for canceling his visit to Yasukuni Shrine,  which is dedicated to 2.4 million war dead, including A-class  war criminals.    Seisuke Okuno resigned as National Land Agency chief under  the administration of Noboru Takeshita in May 1988 over his war  remarks.    "Japan fought the war in order to secure its safety ... Asia  was colonized by Caucasians at that time. Japan was by no means  a nation of aggression," he said.</p>

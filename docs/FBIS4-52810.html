			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by U Chong-chang: "Making a Living Is More </F> Important Than Ideology -- Members of General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan, Chongnyon, Are Wavering"]    [Text] Chongnyon [General Association of Korean Residents  in Japan], a source of money for North Korea and its overseas  subordinate organization, is wavering. The organization itself  is still following the North Korean line, but its constituents  are wavering. The possibility of their collective secession from  Chongnyon is still slim because their families are held in North  Korea as hostages, because they would have no means of  livelihood if they leave Chongnyon, and because of the sense of  loyalty that they should not betray the organization that gave  them help. Although they are physically involved in Chongnyon,  their sense of disappointment with North Korea, which they  believed to be a paradise on earth, has increased over the years  and their expectations for reunification are growing distant.  As a result, an attitude of attaching more importance to  "oneself" than the "organization" is being created.    The nationality of pro-Chongnyon people is simply "Korean"  [Choson], neither North nor South Korean. On the other hand,  members of the Federation of Korean Residents in Japan [Mindan--  pro-ROK organization] clearly have the nationality of the ROK.  Because there are no diplomatic relations established with North  Korea, the Japanese Government does not recognize the  nationality of "Korean" as the title of the nation. The Japanese  Government regards it merely as an "emblem." If pro-Chongnyon  people want to visit North Korea, they have to obtain a "voyage  certificate" from the Japanese Government without fail. If they  do not obtain this certificate, they will not be allowed to  return to Japan.    This is not all the inconveniences that affect their daily  life. With its past record of "destructive and violent acts"  committed in the course of its formation, Chongnyon is an  organization subject to application of the Japanese "destruction  prevention law." If Chongnyon commits acts destroying Japanese  order, the Japanese Government may issue an order for forcible  dissolution of Chongnyon at any time according to the law. This  is why Chongnyon headquarters frequently hand out an order to  its subordinate organizations to abide by the law. On the  contrary, Mindan is not subject to application of this law.    There are many factors threatening Chongnyon organizations,  including various restrictions, a sense of upcoming economic  unrest if economic sanctions are imposed on North Korea, and  human rights issues for Japanese living in North Korea that have  been raised among the people in Japan. Moreover, even its  constituents tend to show a move to seek "oneself" instead of  "organization" and "welfare" instead of "ideology." As a  result, Chongnyon's Central Standing Committee is in a difficult  position of having to simultaneously deal with outside threats  and internal discontent.    In testimony at the Japanese Diet on 30 March, Ogata  Shigetake, director-general of the Japanese Agency for Public  Security and Investigation, said that there are about 680,000  South and North Korean people residing in Japan. Of them,  369,000 are pro-Mindan and 247,000 are pro-Chongnyon. He also  revealed that among pro-Chongnyon people 56,000 are actively  involved in Chongnyon. These 56,000 people are "main force"  [Chonjong yowon] who sustain Chongnyon organizations. They are  only one-fourth of all Chongnyon constituents.    This "main force" is further classified into "organizational  staff," "full-time workers" and "activists." The organizational  staff and full-time workers are paid every month by the  Chongnyon Central Standing Committee and activists are those who  positively participate in Chongnyon activities. They play the  role of shock brigades by actively opposing anti-Chongnyon  forces within Japan by violent means in disguise of lawfulness.  Organizational staff and full-time workers are afraid that  diplomatic relations will be established between Japan and North  Korea. They fear that if Japanese-North Korean diplomatic  relations are established, Chongnyon's properties and  organizations will be absorbed and they will lose their jobs to  those who North Korea assigns to Japan.  <H5>  500,000 Yen Per Person for a Meeting With Kim Il-song </H5>   North Korea's Kim Il-song sent a congratulatory message to  Han Tok-su, chairman of Chongnyon, on 1 January 1993, and  emphasized the strengthening of Chongnyon organizations and the  establishment of an ideological guidance system. In this  message, Kim Il-song urged Chongnyon to promote its patriotic  work--the work of supporting North Korea--to a higher stage and  to prepare Chongnyon to be a "reliable defender of the socialist  fatherland."    Experts in issues concerning Chongnyon unanimously noted  that  the popularity of North Korea within Chongnyon began to  gradually decrease starting in the early 1980's and began to  fall rapidly in the late eighties. The amount of money remitted  to North Korea by individuals fell to 10 million yen from 100  million yen, and has even fallen to 1 million yen subsequently.    Since the amount of money remitted to North Korea has  decreased, North Korea resorted to various means to deprive  Chongnyon of money. Mr. Chang Myong-su (60), senior secretary of  the "Council for Measures for Compatriots Repatriated to North  Korea," who is waging a movement for human rights of the  compatriots repatriated to North Korea, said:    Two hundred students of Chongnyon-affiliated Choson  University were collectively repatriated to North Korea in 1972.  North Korea tried to send 50 students of the 200 to Japan in  1991 for the purpose of begging money from their former  classmates who inherited wealth from their parents and who were  now engaged in large business by pleading their difficult life  in North Korea. North Korea gave up this plan because of a  possibility of diplomatic friction and fear that the students  would escape and not return to North Korea.    North Korea also attempted to sell grave sites to Chongnyon  in 1984. A Chongnyon-affiliated leading businessman said: Any  man, after getting old, thinks of his native home. This is more  true for Chongnyon's first generation, which is older than 60.  North Korea, keenly sensing such feelings by Chongnyon's first  generation, proposed the sale of grave sites in an attempt to  earn foreign currency. In other words, North Korea wanted to  sell excellent sites in native towns for grave sites for the  sake of money. This work was urged under Kim Chong-il's  leadership. The concrete amount of payment for each pyong [land  measurement] of land was bargained for. Kim Il-song, learning  of this, opposed the sale, and stated that "although earning  foreign currency is important, the act of selling land in a  socialist country cannot be tolerated."    An even more serious incident occurred during the Pyongyang  youth festival in 1989. The Pyongyang festival was an  international event arranged by North Korea in an attempt to  cope with the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Yim Su-kyong, a student of  Korea University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, voluntarily went  to the North in order to attend this event. In the wake of this  youth festival, North Korea advanced the following propaganda in  an effort to induce donations to Chongnyon: "If you pay 5  million yen [$49,000] per person, you will be allowed to meet  the great leader by visiting Pyongyang by a special plane."    Nevertheless, the response to this propaganda was  negligible.  Therefore, North Korea lowered the amount of payment, and in the  final stage, the amount was decreased to 500,000 yen per person.  The condition of meeting Kim Il-song by visiting Pyongyang in a  special plane remained unchanged. As this was revealed,  Chongnyon's main force publicly complained, stating that they  devotedly worked for the socialist fatherland throughout their  life but they were unable to meet the great leader. Now,  however, if one pays money, a meeting with the great leader will  be granted. How on earth can this happen?    One of the impending difficult problems to which Chongnyon  shows a most sensitive reaction is the anti-Chongnyon movement  being waged in Japan. Anti-Chongnyon activities in Japan are  categorized by two movements: One movement is pushed for and  led by Ogawa, a professor of Tokyo University, and is waged by  Japanese human rights organizations calling for the promotion of  human rights in North Korea. The other movement is led by Chang  Myong-su and is waged by former Chongnyon's core members calling  for human rights protection of Korean compatriots repatriated to  North Korea.    Chongnyon Organization    Central Standing Committee    (One chairman, One first vice chairman, Nine vice  chairmen)       Secretariat       Organizational Department       Propaganda Department       Political Department       Education Department       International Department       Economy Department       Social Affairs Department       Cultural Department       Planning Department       Finance Department       General Affairs Department       Home-Visiting Department    Local headquarters: 48       Chapter offices: 300       Branch offices: 1,550       Subordinate organizations: 18, including  Chongnyon Chamber of Commerce       Schools: 148       Enterprises: 23, including CHOSON SINBO  Daily    Professor Ogawa is a person well-known to us who revealed  and made an issue of human rights in our country during the  fifth and sixth Republics. However, he has now changed his  attitude and presented human rights violations in North Korea to  the Japanese Government.    An anti-Chongnyon rally was held last April in Osaka and  Tokyo. The rallies were disturbed by an organized opposition of  the main forces [chonjong yowon] of Chongnyon. The Chongnyon  main forces checked and frustrated the Osaka rally by force of  arms.    As this became a controversial issue in Japanese society,  the  Japanese police searched 13 Chongnyon offices in Osaka. Such a  hard-line attitude of the Japanese police was said to be  unprecedented. The Chongnyon could not counter the Japanese  police's hard-line measures. Herein lies Chongnyon's dilemma.  The dilemma is that if Chongnyon ignores anti-Chongnyon  activities, a situation endangering its organizations will  result and if it uses force against anti-Chongnyon activities it  will result in the Japanese police further cracking down on  Chongnyon organizations and may lead them to eventually apply  the "destruction prevention law." It is known that Chongnyon  has enough strength to the extent that it can buy off leading  figures in Japanese political circles. However, it seems to be  difficult for Chongnyon to check and frustrate human rights  groups' activities.    Under such a crisis, there have been signs that the unity of  the organization is shaky. A typical example is its members'  complaints against Ho Chong-man, its responsible vice chairman.  Ho assumed the post last July. He is virtually the No. 2 man  of Chongnyon and is regarded to succeed Chairman Han Tok-su.    There still is controversy inside Chongnyon over the  appointment of Ho to that post. Chongnyon was originally  supposed to be made up of one first vice chairman and nine vice  chairmen under the chairman. If the chairman is in an accident,  the first vice chairman is supposed to be the acting chairman.  Disregarding this stipulation, the Central Standing Committee  of Chongnyon appointed Ho to that post on the grounds it was  ordered by Kim Chong-il. At that time, Yi Chin-kyu was the  first vice chairman.    On the grounds that it is wrong to appoint a formerly  expelled person to the post of vice chairman, there was  prevalent criticism against the appointment of Ho--who had been  expelled in 1968 after being branded a factionalist in an  internal feud involving Chongnyon's command system--to the post  of responsible vice chairman. Any decision of the Central  Standing Committee should be referred to an enlarged central  committee for deliberation and then to a plenary meeting for  approval. This appointment, however, did not follow such a  procedure. This move has been criticized as being an expedient.  Since the appointment of Ho, the Chongnyon Central Committee  has held a succession of support rallies or study meetings for  bureau chief-level and above officials, thus preventing this  from becoming an issue.    Despite this, Chongnyon members have been keeping a keen eye  on the activities of Ho as he is smart in `money.' Ho had been  trained in the International Affairs Department and the  Financial Affairs Department of Chongnyon. He has never worked  in the Organization Bureau or Social and Cultural Bureau. Those  inside and outside Chongnyon say that he is a careerist who has  handled only money. Therefore, it is believed he will forcibly  sell Chongnyon's property in Japan and send it to North Korea if  it is necessary to advance his career. The issue of disposing  of Chongnyon property is a sensitive one between North Korea and  Chongnyon.  <H5>  Fight Over Property Between North Korea and Chongyon </H5>   Chongnyon members have shown responses of "it is unexpected"  or "it is a mystery" regarding Kim Il-song's appointment of Ho  Chong-man. They suspect it is a calculated step to divert  Chongnyon property to North Korea as Ho is a colleague of former  Chongnyon Vice Chairman Kim Pyong-sik, who was appointed vice  president of North Korea in an abrupt manner.    Chongnyon property is estimated to amount to as much as  between 20 trillion yen (about 200 billion dollars) and 30  trillion yen from a combination of bank deposits of Chongnyon  people and stationary assets, such as buildings affiliated with  Chongnyon. This is several tens of times as much as North  Korea's GNP of $21.7 billion as of the end of 1992. As of the  end of July 1993, deposits at finance institutions, such as the  Choson Bank, Credit Union, and Kumgang Insurance Company,  amounted to 2,390 billion yen (about 25 billion dollars).  Buildings such as Chongnyon Central Hall, Choson Publishing  Hall, and CHOSON SINBO are located in the center of downtown  Tokyo, where land prices are the highest in the world. A total  of 148 schools affiliated with Chongnyon are also stationary  assets with immense value.    Originally such stationary assets belonged to each  individual. As their owners die, ownership has experienced a  change in type. The type differs by regions. In the case of  Osaka, there are four Chongnyon headquarters in the eastern,  western, southern, and central regions. The land and buildings  in the eastern, southern, and central regions are all under  individuals' names. The land in the western region is under an  individual's name, but the building is under the name of  Kongyong Corporation. The corporation is known to be affiliated  with Chongnyon. Property in some regions are under the names of  a responsible person of a Chongnyon chapter, a responsible  person in the commercial and industrial sector, or a third  person.    North Korea claims they own this property. Some people in  Chongnyon, including responsible vice chairman Ho Chong-man,  sympathize with this claim. The majority assert, however, that  the property should be used for the welfare of all of Chongnyon.  Their logic is that it should be used for such welfare because  individuals have donated the central headquarters, the  publishing hall, and schools to the Chongnyon organization.  Cadres of North Korea and Chongnyon have had frequent contacts  to discuss this issue since the 1988 Seoul Olympics, but it is  reported they have failed to reach a conclusion.    Those inside Chongnyon were greatly shocked in September  1990  when Kanemaru, vice president of Japan's Liberal Democratic  Party; and a vice chairman of the Japan Socialist Party,  issued--when they visited North Korea--with North Korea's  Workers Party a "Three Parties' Joint Declaration" related to  establishing diplomatic relations between Japan and North Korea.  They were shocked because they felt uneasy that if North Korea  and Japan should establish relations, the nationality of those  affiliated with Chongnyon would be changed to North Korean and  they would have to abide by North Korea's Constitution. Thus,  they had misgivings that their rights to their property in Japan  might not be recognized.    With Kanemaru's visit to North Korea as momentum, Chongyon  organized a project team to make a detailed examination of such  an issue. Such a move was discovered by the ROK Embassy in  Japan. Around that time, our government supported Chongnyon from  the standpoint of compatriots by publishing a booklet entitled  "An effect of the normalization of relations between North Korea  and Japan on the compatriots affiliated with Chongnyon" in  cooperation with Mindan. It is reported that the Chongnyon's  own project team has failed to do anything due to obstruction  from North Korea. It is said that the movement to protect  Chongnyon property is still under way.    Under such complicated circumstances, the assumption of the  post of responsible vice chairmanship of Ho Chong-man, a finance  expert and a colleague of Kim Chong-il, has further agitated  Chongnyon members. It is said that some Chongnyon cadres are  secretly hiding their property to avoid it being confiscated by  North Korea and that some are demanding the return of donated  land through law suits. It is said that a perception  "Chongnyon's property is of the nation" is widely spreading in  Osaka where many Chongnyon-affiliated people are living.    In fact, people affiliated with Chongnyon are said to have  almost neglected preparing for their old age. They have been  inculcated by Chongnyon that "if reunification should  materialize, you could return home." Thus, they have eagerly  waited only for the day of reunification. With the dream of  returning home some day, they are said to pin almost all of  their hopes on that organization, which would make such a dream  come true at an early date. So, they donated their own money to  build schools and spared no money to be sent to North Korea with  a view to contributing to the development of their fatherland.  This notwithstanding, as they are aging and their children are  growing up, their expectations for reunification are becoming a  more and more remote dream.    In November 1993, the Chongnyon Central Committee discussed  the issue of "protection of compatriots' rights" as an important  agenda item. It was the only agenda discussed. According to  the ROK Embassy in Japan, it was the first time the Chongnyon  Central Committee ever convened with the single agenda item of  "protection of rights." The ROK Embassy understood that this  was a sign of change on the part of Chongnyon, which has thus  far shouted political slogans, but is now paying attention to  its members' welfare.    Many Chongnyon-affiliated schools are now faced with the  crisis of closure due to the drastic reduction of the number of  students. This is because parents are reluctant to send their  children to such schools on grounds that "it is difficult to  adapt to Japanese society, where competition is fierce, if you  graduate from Chongnyon-affiliated schools where ideological  education is emphasized." All the Chongnyon-affiliated schools  in the Osaka area took down placards of Kim Il-song hung in  school buildings last year. This is a sign showing that a wind  of change--today's life is more important than ideology--is  blowing within Chongnyon.</p>

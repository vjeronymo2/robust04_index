			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Zagreb denies troops in Bosnia: Moslems claim thousands of Croat forces have been thrown into war Officials in Zagreb have denied that thousands of Croatian army troops are fighting Moslems in central Bosnia, contradicting mounting evidence of Croatian and Yugoslav military involvement in carving out ethnic mini-states there. Zagreb and Belgrade have consistently denied they are trying to partition Bosnia at the expense of the Moslems. But the recent accord by Croatia and Serb-led Yugoslavia to normalise relations has compounded fears that they are intent on the carve-up. The head of the Croatian army political section, Mr Drago Krpina, admitted on Saturday that up to 2,000 private citizens, some possibly wearing army insignia, might be fighting as volunteers in Bosnia. His denial of Croatian troop involvement was followed by a Sarajevo radio report that the Croatian army yesterday used helicopters to bombard Kute, a village in central Bosnia. The mainly Moslem Bosnian army said that the Croatian army had deployed its seventh brigade to fight in disputed towns in central Bosnia, even sending 12,000 fresh troops, bringing the total to some 20,000 regulars, according to Sarajevo radio. UN officials say some 5,000 Croat army troops with helicopters, tanks and other military hardware have been deployed in Bosnia. Despite frequent threats, the international community has stopped short of imposing economic sanctions on Croatia, like those in force in Serbia. Meanwhile, General Momcilo Perisic, chief-of-staff of the Yugoslav army, in an interview yesterday, denied any involvement in Bosnia. However, UN soldiers and local inhabitants have repeatedly witnessed the despatch of Yugoslav troops and equipment across the frontiers. Despite the abundant evidence of Yugoslav army involvement, western governments have remained silent, apparently at a loss after 20 months of punitive sanctions against Belgrade have failed to prevent the carve-up of Bosnia. Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist Russian MP, promised in Belgrade last night that 'any military intervention by the west on Bosnian Serb forces would be seen as a declaration of war on Russia'. In accordance with his pan-Slavic rhetoric, he said it would be ideal if Russia were to share a frontier with Serbia, vowing to win the lifting of sanctions. Britain will today resume its relief convoys in Bosnia, ending a three-day suspension imposed after the murder of an aid worker, Mr Paul Goodall.</p>

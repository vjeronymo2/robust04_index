			<p>BFN     [Text] The minister of finance's tour, which has taken him  to a number of Western capitals, seems to have made some  progress towards gaining more financial support for the  country's plan for economic revival.    After Washington, Mr. Benbitour is expected to arrive in  Tokyo later to meet with Japanese financial circles. Here are  more details with Bachir Hedibek:    [Hedibek] Finance Minister Ahmed Benbitour yesterday ended  his tour which had taken him to Washington, after visiting Paris  and Brussels. During his visit, the Algerian minister of  finance met the U.S. deputy secretary of the treasury in charge  of finance, the president of the world bank, and the IMF general  secretary.    Mr. Benbitour affirmed from Washington that he had received  Western financial circles' full support for the government's  program for economic revival and that they were fully prepared  to give all the necessary aid to secure the success of the  program, particularly the flexibility of debt rescheduling and  the release of new loans.    Concerning the debt rescheduling, Mr. Benbitour pointed out  that the aim was that Algeria should receive a percentage of  loans to build an acceptable level of money reserves in order to  avoid a fresh request for debt rescheduling in the future.  Algerian demands received great understanding and support from  American financial circles, he added.    Mr. Benbitour pointed out that furthermore, he had dwellled  upon the program of loans for supporting the Algerian  institutions and the Algerian monetary and banking system,  estimated at 175 million dollars from the World Bank and 150  million dollars for the Export- Import Bank of Japan, with the  director of the World Bank.    The minister had guarantees that the abovementioned loans  would be released as soon as possible and that a new plan with  the World Bank would be drawn up.    His meeting with IMF director general Mr. Camdessus was an  opportunity to deal with the development of the situation  following the dispatch of Algeria's letter of intent to the Fund.    The Algerian file, including the program for economic  revival  will be the subject of a serious examination by the IMF board,  which is due to meet on 27 May.    Also, the Paris Club will be holding a meeting later this  month to examine the rescheduling of Algeria's foreign debts.    Always in Paris, the French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has  also disclosed that Washington and Tokyo had agreed to  reschedule Algeria's debts.</p>

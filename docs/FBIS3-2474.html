			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One  Network in Mandarin at 1305 GMT on 7 February broadcasts the  54-minute second of a 10-part series consisting of nine  lectures, and one question and answer session, entitled: "TV  Lecture Series on Several Current Major Programs for Reforming  the Economic System."    The second lecture, entitled: "The Industry and Business Tax  System," is given by Jin Xin, deputy director of the State  Administration of Taxation.    Jin Xin begins by noting that tax reform is one of a series  of reforms for building a socialist market economy drafted in  the decision on establishing a socialist market economy adopted  by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee.  He goes on to discuss five issues concerning China's reform of  the industry and business tax system:    1. The purpose of tax reform: Jin says: "Tax reform is  conducted to meet the needs of developing a market economy." He  explains the reasons why it is necessary and imperative to  reform the tax system on a large scale and supports his  arguments by pointing out that shortcomings in the tax system  already implemented have hindered the development of a market  economy.    2. The guiding ideology for tax reform: Jin says: "Tax  reform should follow the guiding principles of unifying tax  laws, imposing taxes fairly, streamlining the tax system,  dividing power rationally, rationalizing distribution relations,  standardizing distribution methods, ensuring revenue, and  establishing a tax system in conformity with a socialist market  economy." He goes on to expound the guiding ideology and  outline of the draft for tax system reform. He also names seven  major categories of taxes which have come into force in the tax  reform package: Value-added tax, consumption tax, business tax,  institutional income tax, individual income tax, resource tax,  and increment tax on land value.    3. The main points of tax reform: Jin says the scope of the  current tax reform includes the reform in the turnover tax  system, enterprise income tax system, individual income tax  system, and most local taxes. Jin defines turnover tax as "a  general designation of all taxes imposed on the production and  circulation of commodities and on the sale or operation of labor  services," and emphasizes: "The reform of the turnover tax  system is the crux of this tax reform, because turnover tax has  been the main category in the structure of the tax system since  China's founding." He also elaborates on the reform of  value-added tax, consumption tax, and business tax, which are  included in turnover tax, as well as other taxes; and gives  examples for each one.    4. Tax reform, and the policies and principles for solving  some important problems: Problems arising from tax reform are  reflected mainly in the burden of taxes and the enforcement of a  preferential tax policy. Explaining the turnover tax imposed on  foreign-invested enterprises after the new tax system comes into  force, Jin notes: "In order to maintain the continuity and  stability of the tax policy for foreign investors as well as  China's reform and open policy, proper measures should be taken  to solve the problem that taxes have actually increased for some  foreign-invested enterprises." To solve such problems, policies  and measures will be adopted to make sure nobody suffers a sharp  increase in taxes and the state does not lose sources of revenue.    5. The reform of tax collection and management: To ensure  effective tax collection and management, and enforcement of tax  laws, Jin puts forward six proposals, including establishing the  system of declaring taxes, promoting the system of taxation  agencies (such as accounting firms and law offices), stepping up  the computerization of tax collection and management,  establishing a strict taxation auditing system, establishing  separated central and local taxation systems in line with the  tax assignment system, and stepping up taxation legislation.    At 1359 GMT Jin concludes by saying that tax reform will  play  a positive role in strengthening and improving macroeconomic  regulation and control, in stepping up taxation legislation,  advancing reform and opening, and promoting sustained, healthy,  and rapid economic growth as all relevant measures are unfolded.</p>

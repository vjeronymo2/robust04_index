			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Technology: Lasting future for IS Big companies will continue to maintain a central computer or information systems department although the need for in-house programmers and other specialised information technologists will decline. Facilities management or 'outsourcing' is not expected to take over permanently the central IS function. These are the chief conclusions of a study* published this week which seeks to explain the recent phenomenon that many information technology specialists in large companies, whose jobs only a few years ago looked secure, have found their careers derailed if not on the buffers. The study concludes there are a number of tasks which only a central IS function can fulfil. These include ensuring that the IT infrastructure of the company is in place and flexible enough to respond to a rapidly changing business environment. It must ensure company-wide standards are applied and advise senior management on the significance and applicability of new technologies. Most critically, it has to provide the quality assurance for large business systems projects. Companies are likely to lose in-house expertise, however, as they avoid, for example, bespoke software developments in favour of cheaper, packaged solutions. Furthermore, IS staff who lose their jobs as the recession bites are unlikely to be re-employed when the economy recovers. The study projects that from 520,000 personnel in 1991, numbers will fall to about 400,000 by 2000. Facilities management or outsourcing has been seen as an answer to expensive and hard-to-manage IS departments, but the study argues it is principally a short-term reaction to a need to cut costs. Some companies use outsourcing as a way of disposing of old technology, intending to refurbish the internal department with modern systems. *What is the future for the central information systems function?

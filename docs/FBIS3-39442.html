Only ten days after he was forced to withdraw blanket  criticism of foreigners, Mr Portillo condemned the Community's  reluctance to open up its markets to imports from East Europe  and attacked its record on job creation.    "We have to recognise the intimate connection between  political and economic freedom, and between economic freedom and  free trade," Mr Portillo told the American Chamber of Commerce  in London. "We have put restrictions on Polish suits, we have  been very reluctant to admit Czech and Slovak steel, and we have  been niggardly about sauerkraut and jam," he said.    Comparing the European Union unfavourably with the United  States and Japan, he said that long holidays and short working  weeks meant that in some European countries an employee cost as  as much in "extras" as in wages. Although he was careful not to  stray beyond the bounds of Government policy, Mr Portillo's  Thatcherite critique of the EU served to highlight the tensions  within the Tory Party as it prepares for the European elections  in June.    These divisions were exposed yesterday by Michael  Heseltine's  scornful dismissal of Norman Lamont's call for a referendum if  Britain ever wants to join a single European currency. The  President of the Board of Trade, one of the Cabinet's foremost  pro- Europeans, said: "Norman has his view.... But I don't  think you will find that, in the pubs and clubs of Britain, the  words of Norman Lamont are on everybody's lips."    Mr Heseltine said that a single currency was "not on the  agenda." He suggested that in the eyes of many Tory MPs Mr  Lamont's outspoken criticism of the European exchange-rate  mechanism and a single currency were motivated by pique at being  sacked as Chancellor.    Mr Heseltine's comments were privately echoed by loyalist  ministers, who described the former Chancellor as a "sad man"  without a following in the Commons or the country. But Mr  Lamont received support from the Euro-sceptic wing of the party.  Roger Knapman, MP for Stroud and a ringleader of the Maastricht  rebels, said: "Norman was a Chancellor who absolutely understood  financial and economic policies and as a consequence many  colleagues will be listening carefully to what he has to say.  When it comes to the choice between style and substance, most  of us prefer the latter."    In his speech yesterday Mr Portillo said that Britain's  continental partners were pricing themselves out of jobs.  Praising President Clinton's support for free trade, he called  for a joint Anglo-American effort to reverse the tide. "The  world does not owe Europe a living.    "Europe as a whole tends to have the highest wage costs  without high productivity, some of the longest holidays and some  of the shortest working weeks in the world."    Over the past 20 years America had created jobs at the rate  of 2 per cent a year and Japan had managed 1 per cent, Mr  Portillo said. The EU had lagged behind at the rate of less than  0.5 per cent a year, because of high unit wage costs.</p>

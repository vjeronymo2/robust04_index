			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US farmers 'face more income cuts and cost rises' US FARM groups yesterday warned that budget cuts and a new energy tax proposed by President Clinton would put many of the nation's efficient middle-sized farmers out of business. Mr T. Ray Chancey, national office director of the American Agriculture Movement, said farmers had borne the brunt of previous budget reductions. 'While we are still trying to adjust to those 'savings', we are told that we are going to have to 'save' some more. We are just about to be 'saved' out of business,' he said. Mr Clinton's struggle to reduce the US budget deficit will be initially hampered by this year's leap in the cost of farm subsidies, which are likely to exceed Dollars 15bn, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Although the new budget puts most of the cuts off until after the 1995 farm programme is written, the payments will again decline to about Dollars 8bn a year between 1994-1995. Huge crops and continued high outlays for export subsidies and disaster payments will push the cost of maize subsidies to almost Dollars 3bn this year, the CBO said. Maize subsidies would be even higher were it not for projected increases in exports and industrial use. By 1998, CBO projects, ethanol use will be 70 per cent up from 1991. Wheat subsidies are likely to rise by 24 per cent this year to Dollars 2.1bn. Unlike maize, use of wheat is expected to fall, and prices may fall below Dollars 3 a bushel later this year. Agriculture will also suffer the pain of increased fees on inland waterway usage. This could raise the cost of grain and soyabeans by 8 per cent a bushel. The president's proposed energy tax will raise production costs by Dollars 1bn a year, American Farm Bureau Federation estimates. Mr Ronald Knutson, director of the Texas-based Agricultural and Food Policy Center farm predicted that programme payments over the years 1996-1998 would decline by 14 to 20 per cent. Average net cash income will fall about 7 per cent for a large Iowa maize and soyabean farm and up to 36 per cent for a Kansas wheat farm.</p>

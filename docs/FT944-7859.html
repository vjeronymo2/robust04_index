			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Angola ceasefire due to start A ceasefire ending Angola's 19-year civil war, due to end at midday yesterday, got off to an uncertain start yesterday when the Luanda government accused Unita rebels of attacking the northern town of Uige. Representatives of the warring parties had agreed in Lusaka yesterday on final details of the implementation of the ceasefire, due to come in effect 48 hours after the Angolan government and the Unita rebel movement signed a peace pact in the city on Sunday. African diplomats expressed relief that yesterday's meeting, which put the final touches to arrangements for disengagement of the two armies and the monitoring of the exercise, had ended successfully. Some had feared that had Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader, intended to hold up the settlement, yesterday's talks would have run into difficulties. The outcome also allayed concern that hardliners in the MPLA government of President Eduardo dos Santos (pictured above) might wish to press ahead with an offensive against Unita positions. But leaders of southern African states, led by the Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, had made clear to Mr dos Santos that they regarded the recent intensification of fighting as a breach of the negotiating process. African officials expressed confidence that the ceasefire would come into effect, but warned that there were likely to be breaches as a result of communications difficulties and indiscipline.

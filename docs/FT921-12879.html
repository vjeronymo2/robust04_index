			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Denmans ahead in spite of sales decline In spite of a small, recession-induced decline in sales Denmans Electrical, the USM-quoted electrical goods wholesaler, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.22m to Pounds 1.26m in the year to September 30. Turnover slipped to Pounds 34.5m (Pounds 35.1m) and operating profits were lower at Pounds 1.52m (Pounds 1.63m). However, interest charges were reduced sharply to Pounds 263,000 (Pounds 410,000), impacting favourably on the pre-tax line. The proposed final dividend is lifted to 4.2p for a total of 5.85p (5.65p) and is payable on earnings down slightly at 18.75p (18.86p) per share.</p>

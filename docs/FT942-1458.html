			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Durable goods orders increase 0.9% in May New orders for US durable goods rose more strongly than expected last month, underlining the strength of the US industrial sector, official figures indicated yesterday. Orders rose 0.9 per cent between April and May, twice the increase projected by most Wall Street analysts. Orders have risen in nine of the past 10 months and are now running 16.7 per cent higher than in May last year. Orders for primary metals were especially strong, rising 4.7 per cent last month and by 21.3 per cent in the year to May. Orders for transport equipment were also vigorous, rising 2.2 per cent and 20.5 per cent respectively. The figures are not adjusted for inflation, running at less than 3 per cent per annum. Durable goods shipments, a guide to present capital spending, also rose. Excluding the aircraft sector, shipments of non-defence capital goods rose 2.2 per cent last month and by 17.9 per cent in the past year. The orders figures reinforce the findings of a recent upbeat assessment of investment intentions by the commerce department. This indicated US companies were planning to raise spending on plant and equipment by 8.9 per cent in real terms this year. Much of this investment is expected to raise industrial capacity and thus enable the economy to expand without putting strong upward pressure on inflation. The strength of investment and orders contrasts with a dip in personal spending in April and May.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Russian Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council </F> Decree "On Conducting Agrarian Reform in the Russian Federation  and Reviving and Developing Agro-Industrial Production Through  the Year 2000," signed by V.F. Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian  Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council, and dated 27  April 1994]    [Text] The Federation Council notes that in accordance  with the Russian Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council  decree dated 26 February 1994 No. 51-I FC "On Legislative  Support for the Functioning of the Russian Federation  Agro-Industrial Complex," the Federation Council Agrarian Policy  Committee, together with the Russian Federation Government,  Federation Council and State Duma committees, and federal organs  of state power organized parliamentary hearings 18 March and 4  April 1994 on questions connected with conducting agrarian  reform in the Russian Federation and reviving and developing  agro-industrial production through the year 2000.    The majority of participants in the parliamentary hearings  recognized that the agrarian reform in the Russian Federation  begun in 1991 is being conducted in the absence not just of a  state program for transformations in the agro-industrial  complex, but also of a scientifically validated concept of it.    At the same time, many of the edicts of the Russian  Federation president and Russian Federation Government decrees  and directives in accordance with which agrarian reform is being  conducted are frequently contradictory, and sometimes simply  wrong. They are not divided into phases, the measures carried  out are not comprehensive, and it has not been determined to  what extent they are effective. Decisions by representative  organs of power on agrarian questions are frequently not carried  out. As a result of the implementation of an ill-considered  economic policy, the country's agro-industrial complex is in the  grip of a serious crisis. Production of agro-industrial output  is falling sharply. The country is becoming increasingly  dependent on export purchases of food, which is leading to  Russia's dependence on foreign states not only in terms of food  and economics, but also politically.    Price, credit, taxation, and investment policy has  completely  wrecked the financial state of the sector and stopped the  process of expanded reproduction in the agro-industrial complex.    Practically all farms have found themselves insolvent  because  of the unequal growth in the price of industrial and  agricultural output.    State programs for the development of land fertility,  agricultural machine-building, the construction of housing and  public amenities, roads, and gas, electricity, water supply, and  telephone communications plants in villages have been wound up.    Believing the aforementioned attitudes to reforming the  agro-industrial complex to be profoundly wrong, the Federation  Council decrees:    1. To instruct the Russian Federation Government:    To task the Russian Federation Ministry of Agriculture and  Foodstuffs and the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences,  together with other interested Russian Federation ministries and  departments, with doing further work on the state program for  conducting agrarian reform in the Russian Federation and the  program for reviving and developing agro-industrial production  through the year 2000 as quickly as possible. To submit the  government program for conducting agrarian reform in the Russian  Federation for examination by the State Duma and the Federation  Council no later than May 1994, and the program for reviving and  developing agro-industrial production through the year 2000 no  later than June 1994;    To elaborate and ratify concrete measures of protectionist  policy for 1994 and 1995, ensuring a solution to the crisis and  the stabilization of production in the agro-industrial complex;    Together with the Russian Federation Central Bank, to  elaborate conditions for the preferential short-term and  long-term crediting of the agro-industrial complex.    2. Within the process of work on the draft federal law "On  Agricultural Scientific Institutions and Their Science and  Production Base," to task the Federation Council Agrarian Policy  Committee with conducting parliamentary hearings on the  aforesaid draft law in May-June 1994.    [Signed] V.F. Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian Federation  Federal Assembly Federation Council    Moscow    27 April 1994    No. 111-I FC</p>

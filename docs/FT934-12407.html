			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Record year for unit trust sales NET SALES of unit trusts were Pounds 668.6m in September, down from Pounds 981.2m in August, Philip Coggan writes. But the figure still took net sales for the year to date to Pounds 6.91bn, more than in the whole of 1987, the previous record for a calendar year. The popularity of personal equity plans, which offer tax-free returns, has been a significant factor behind sales of unit trusts. Of net unit trust sales of Pounds 2.6bn in the third quarter, Pounds 612m was in Pep form. Funds invested in unit trust Peps now amount to Pounds 6.5bn out of a unit trust total of Pounds 84.1bn. The slight dip in sales from August's total may have resulted from the weaker performance of stock markets in September, although the markets have rebounded to new highs this month.</p>

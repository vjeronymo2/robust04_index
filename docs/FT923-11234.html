			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Books: Why the real live spark is missing - Isabel Quigly has her hopes of an eccentric talent dashed CURRICULUM VITAE by Muriel Spark Constable Pounds 14.95, 213 pages MURIEL SPARK'S name was put on the map by The Seraph and the Zambesi. She awoke one morning and found herself famous - at least among readers of The Observer, whose short-story competition she had won out of 6,700 entries. That was in 1951, and the story still seems memorable, containing the mixture of themes, moods and tricks that has characterised her fiction ever since. With hindsight, even its title seems prophetic, the mystical and the exotic being coupled as they are in her personality and in everything she writes. For however much she may make literary use of the facts of her life - people, situations, places - she is no realist: her strength lies in the bizarre, the unexpected, the contrived, in the sheer quirkiness of her vision, a sort of psychic squint that distorts, often beguilingly, the everyday world and our boringly accepted expectations and emotions. Which may explain the disappointing result when she recalls her life straight, in an autobiography. For the Spark view to work its magic, as it often does in her fiction, we need to know that there stands between her and us an acerbic irony, that glinting, glittering eyesight that dazzles and blurs, that combines the sacred and the profane, that shocks and delights and never quite gives away where the author stands or what is expected of the reader. The first half of Curriculum Vitae deals with childhood and adolescence in Edinburgh. It is hard to pigeon-hole the family socially: of modest means and ambitions, it seems to have been happy and hospitable. That the remarkably gifted daughter left school for dull secretarial jobs, without university, seems to have worried no one, not even the daughter, born Muriel Camberg. Her father and her maternal great-grandfather were Jewish, and her son, as she puts it, 'decided to be a Jew.' Her mother's family, with the exotically unpronounceable name of Uezzell, kept a small general shop in Watford. The early years are recalled affectionately, with attractive titbits of social history. Fans of Miss Jean Brodie will relish the account of the schoolmistress on whom she was closely based, Miss Kay, clearly a spellbinder, even if she pinned a picture of Mussolini's marching Fascists up in the classroom. But in all this there is nothing very remarkable. Anyone born in 1918 is bound by now to have things of social interest to recall, and the long-winded recollections of school are, apart from the specialised interest of the Miss Brodie original, not all that different from Old Girls' accounts of teachers and jolly japes in school magazines. Then comes adult life, and here the inability to treat facts satisfactorily is startling: all the more so when you have read how carefully (memory being the weak and guileful thing it is) Spark treated her past and how determined she was to use nothing unsupported by documentary evidence. On the one hand, there is a reserve that suggests autobiography is impossible, a lack of candour about almost everything important, certainly every close relationship; on the other, a mass of detail, trivia, self-justification and petty retrospective revenge. A long section is devoted to Spark's editorship of the Poetry Review and her stormy relations with the Poetry Society. Old scores are settled 45 years on, old letters quoted at length, old battles refought, and an often-embarrassing retrospective view of the author as wronged heroine (young and pretty, as we are told in so many words) makes one wonder how someone so obviously aware of others' reactions can play into her readers' hands, raising hackles, arousing suspicion of motives and memories. If they had been seen askew with the fictional Spark eyesight, that magical, malicious blend of skulduggery, spirituality and exact detail, and without personal, acknowledged involvement, these years might have made a dazzling story: her picture of Marie Stopes, for instance, is Swiftian in its venom but spoiled by complacent comparisons between the appalling old woman and her own fresh and perky young self. Smugness, even at a distance, is never a pretty sight. Then there is the lack of exploration about almost everything. At 19, Muriel Camberg became engaged to a man she met at a dance and knew little about, with the fictional-sounding name of Sydney Oswald Spark, 'or SOS, as we called him.' 'It was a disastrous choice,' she tells us. '. . . The poor man had mental problems, not obvious at the time.' And that is more or less all. Of the marriage, which soon crumpled, and the son it produced, we are told almost nothing. When the child was five, he was left in the care of nuns in Rhodesia, while his mother took off for wartime Britain: 'My plan was to prepare for Robin to go and live with my parents, who were pining to have him.' Eighteen months later, he arrived and his grandparents took him over. Of what his mother felt in all this we are told nothing. The writing itself is disappointing - names often repeated where a pronoun is needed, punctuation inexact, a general air not so much of fluency as of carelessness. Certain words pull one up: 'boyfriend,' for instance, anachronistically and even confusingly used in the 1940s and 1950s. Descriptions are often so vague as to be meaningless: 'a young, very pretty and natural woman,' 'a fine couple from Mauritius,' 'a clever English society woman.' Spark has said that she writes as if addressing a friend and there is much in human terms to recommend this, for warmth, immediacy and simplicity. But even letters to friends, however unpretentious, should surely be stylistically a pleasure. So, all in all, a case of hopes dashed, for the thought of an autobiography from such a hand had raised them high. This is the first volume, taking us just over halfway through the life, with Spark on the brink of fame and fortune and expatriate life, rocketing into the curious world of international celebrity. All this her novels have richly deserved: for wit and originality, variety and inventiveness, they have no current equal. Their world is conjured outside and beyond the humdrum one of facts and events; on what merely happened in real life her gloriously eccentric talents, it seems to me, are wasted.</p>

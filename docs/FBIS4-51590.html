			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sinister Confab To Strengthen `Cooperation System'" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam  reportedly called Hata, the new prime minister of Japan, on the  phone on May 1 and agreed with him to strengthen the  "cooperation system" between South Korea, Japan and the United  States on the pretext of North Korea's "nuclear issue".    Abominable, indeed, is the act of the traitor Kim Yong-sam  who ringed up Hata, who had consistently been engaged in the  anti-DPRK campaign, as soon as the latter seated himself in the  prime minister's office, to "congratulate" him upon his  "assumption of office" and agreed with him to strengthen  "cooperation system" against the DPRK.    In the phone call the traitor Kim threw his weight behind  the  "unstable Hata regime" by saying "stability of the Japanese  political situation is beneficial to Asia as a whole". And he  ridiculously begged Hata to maintain the "foundation of  diplomacy and cooperation in the international community" which  had been agreed upon between South Korea and Japan while  Hosokawa was in office.    This eloquently tells that the Kim Yong-sam group is a group  of special-class pro-U.S., pro-Japanese sycophant traitors who  cannot subsist even a single day without the backing of the  United States and Japan.    Hata, taking issue with the DPRK's "nuclear issue", said he  would "maintain a steadfast stance" and "carry forward the  Japan-South Korea cooperation system" established during  Hosokawa's office as prime minister. This vividly indicates the  Japanese authorities' insidious attempt to take an active part  in the moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK.    It is a futile attempt for the South Korean puppets and the  Japanese reactionaries to try to contain the DPRK militarily  through tieup with each other.    The Kim Yong-sam group must refrain from seeking a system to  do harm to the nation, clearly mindful that the invocation of a  "cooperation system" would finally result in ruining themselves.  And the Japanese reactionaries had better discard their  anachronistic daydream of harming others and act with discretion.</p>

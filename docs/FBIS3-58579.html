			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kostakis Andoniou] </F>   [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has privately expressed  his strong discontent with the absoluteness that characterizes  the stance of certain political parties on the issue of  confidence-building measures. Specifically, President Kliridhis  stresses: The stance of these political parties makes his  handling of policy more difficult and does not allow him to  develop easily the policy he has in mind, especially in view of  the expected acceptance of the confidence-building measures by  the Turkish side and the beginning of talks.    Political circles have characteristically said the message  these parties have sent to the world creates a negative  impression of the Greek Cypriot side's sincerity about the  negotiations; and on the other hand, it gives the Turkish side  material for propaganda.    In light of the above, and despite the fact that he accepts  the right of these parties to express their positions as they  believe appropriate, President Kliridhis feels that their  behavior makes it difficult for him to develop his policy on the  issue of the confidence-building measures.</p>

President Husni Mubarak and his aide  Usamah al-Baz are the good guys who steer the peace process,  mediate between Israel and the Palestinians, and dispatch  messages of friendship to the other side of the border.    In this relationship, the role of the bad guys is played by  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and his assistant Nabil Fahmi, who  heads the Egyptian delegation to the arms control talks. These  two lead the Egyptian effort to disarm Israel of its nuclear  capability, waging a relentless battle against Israel in every  possible international forum: the multilateral talks, the  United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency  committees.    The Egyptians want Israel to sign the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and to divest itself of its  strategic assets. If not at once, it should at least occur in  agreed-on stages as part of an open political dialogue on  nuclear issues. Cairo rejects the Israeli stand that the  process should start with confidence-building steps by countries  in the region, such as the creation of circles of communication  and the laying open of military activities, and that the nuclear  debate should be postponed until "due time," after peace  arrangements mature and stabilize. [passage omitted]    Musa's and Fahmi's inexorable stance is explained by  personal  and political motives: Both had worked for the United Nations  in the past, during which time they embraced regional nuclear  disarmament as a policy line -- which also happened to  contribute to their personal promotion. The battle against  Israel is explained also by Egypt's aspirations to lead the Arab  world and its desire to show that even after the peace  agreement, it remains the leading factor in the Arab quest for  balance with Israel.    Arab countries do not fully subscribe to the Egyptian line.  The Palestinians do not fear Israel's nuclear potential, and  neither does Jordan. The Syrians believe that territorial  restitution and the solution of the Palestinian problem come  before the nuclear disarmament of Israel, as Syrian expert  Zuhayr Di'ab has recently written. The Gulf states are more  concerned about Iran and Iraq. Egypt has thus failed to form an  Arab bloc united in its refusal to sign the chemical  nonproliferation treaty until Israel joins the NPT. The Gulf  and Maghreb states adopted the U.S. line and joined the chemical  treaty.    Israel is not particularly worried about the confrontation  with Egypt in the arms control talks. Israel is not interested  in accelerating the arms control debates, and it adheres to its  timeframe: first peace, and then the nuclear issue. Various  Israeli elements reacted to the Egyptian stand saying that "they  can say it 10 times a day," or that "they say they will go on  talking, so we will listen and do whatever we deem appropriate."  Yet the introduction of the nuclear waste issue into the  environmental talks and at the steering committee talks  infuriated Jerusalem, because it contravened an earlier Israeli  consent to explain the problem at the bilateral talks.    Some believe, however, that the battle for the deactivation  of the Israeli deterrent power has a detrimental long-term  impact on the peace process, because this attempt to divest  Israel of strategic assets vital for its sense of security in an  era of political concessions is forcing Israel to assume a  self-defensive attitude. People who embrace this view find it  difficult to buy the appeasing messages conveyed to Jerusalem by  Usamah al-Baz. They point to the fact that Mubarak has given  Musa full freedom of action in his nuclear war on Israel. In  the meantime, the relationship with Egypt is going to be  conducted with smiles on the peace tracks -- as if there was no  nuclear issue, and with harsh confrontations on the arms control  tracks, as if there was no peace process.</p>

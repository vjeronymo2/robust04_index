			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT PROPERTY: BATMAN'S GIRL BUYS IN THE HILLS  </P> <P> Actress KIM BASINGER, who starts work this month with actors Alec Baldwin and  Robert Loggia on Hollywood Pictures' production of Neil Simon's period romance  "The Marrying Man," has purchased a Hollywood Hills hideaway for nearly $1  million.  </P> <P> Basinger, who most recently co-starred with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson  in "Batman" -- one of the top-grossing movies of all time -- bought the  1,728-acre town of Braselton, Ga., in January with a Chicago company for $20  million. They plan to develop a film and recording center there.  </P> <P> Her one-story, 1,700-square-foot Hollywood Hills house has only one bedroom,  but it's behind gates, on half an acre, and has a spa. She plans to use the  pied-a-terre as a retreat and place to work when she's in town, sources said.  </P> <P> "It also has view of the city that would rattle your teeth," said selling  broker Alan Long of Dalton, Brown &amp; Long.  </P> <P> Long wouldn't discuss financial terms of the deal but described the house,  which was built in the 1950s, as being "a wonderful Spanish bungalow that the  former owner turned into a Faberge egg, it was done in such detail."  </P> <P> The seller is a co-owner of a trendy beauty salon on Burton Way in Beverly  Hills. He purchased a larger home behind gates farther west through Long.  </P> <P> Cheryl Crane, daughter of actress Lana Turner, represented Basinger through  Long's firm, though Crane is now with Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young. She was  unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> TED FIELD, executive producer of the movies "Bird on a Wire" and "Three Men and  a Baby," has put his Westside estate, known as "Greenacres," on the market at  what is believed to be the highest price ever asked for a private home in the  United States: $55 million.  </P> <P> He has also listed his two-house Aspen, Colo., compound at $29 million. "It is  probably the most expensive Alpine chalet in the United States," said Paris  Moskopoulos of Paris Realty in Beverly Hills, who represents Field on both  properties.  </P> <P> Field bought the larger, 15,000-square-foot house in Aspen a couple years ago  from Chris Hemmeter, who developed the Westin Kaui Lagoons and other hotels in  Hawaii. Field then purchased a 4,000-square-foot house next door from a doctor  and connected the two homes, using the smaller one for guests.  </P> <P> Field, an heir of Chicago department store magnate Marshall Field who is listed  in the Forbes 400 as having a net worth of more than $500 million, and his  third wife, Susie, recently filed for divorce after 2 1/2 years of marriage.  </P> <P> "But they are on very good terms," Moskopoulos said. "In fact, they are dating  each other."  </P> <P> He is buying her a 23,000-square-foot Beverly Hills house near Greenacres,  however, which is in escrow at close to $14 million, its list price with Bruce  Nelson of John Bruce Nelson &amp; Associates. Until that deal closes, in a  couple of months, Susie, who is expecting the couple's third child, is staying  at Greenacres, which Field owns and also calls home.  </P> <P> That house is 36,000 square feet in size, with five family bedrooms and four  bedrooms for the staff.  </P> <P> Greenacres, partly in Los Angeles and partly in Beverly Hills, was built in  1928 by silent-screen star Harold Lloyd, who lived in it until he died at age  77 in 1971. It was a museum for a year, when it was sold because funds to  maintain it ran short and neighbors were complaining about the traffic it  generated.  </P> <P> The 16-acre property was subdivided in 1976, and the Italian Renaissance-style  house, on a bit more than 5 acres, was sold in 1979. The new owners restored  it, had it designated a historic monument, then sold it, when they were  divorced, to Field.  </P> <P> He moved into it in May, 1987, after buying it for what was considered a low  price at the time: $6.5 million. Then he practically gutted the mansion,  restored everything and installed an 80-foot-long swimming pool.  </P> <P> Field has held a number of political and other fund-raisers at Greenacres since  completing the restoration, including a sit-down dinner in February for 850  people. Field also owns a Malibu Colony house that he bought from actor Michael  Landon last August for $6 million, then nearly razed and is almost completed  rebuilding.  </P> <P> He owns a Bel-Air house that he bought from comedienne Joan Rivers last August  for about $5 million, which is being used by his second wife, and he owns  another Bel-Air house that is being used by his first wife.  </P> <P> He also owns a 40-acre ranch in Santa Barbara and the 16-story Murdock Plaza in  Westwood, where the Interscope Group, encompassing his movie production and  record companies, are headquartered.  </P> <P> Lakers guard LARRY DREW and his wife, Sharon, just purchased a new,  4,500-square-foot house in Encino for close to its asking price of $1.15  million.  </P> <P> "They just had a baby, Larry Drew II, and that's why they wanted a big house,"  said a spokeswoman for Fred Sands Realtors, which had the listing through Sandy  Brickman and Cynthia Leech.  </P> <P> The Drews had been living in Inglewood, according to selling broker Stephen  Shapiro of Stan Herman &amp; Associates, Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Shapiro also represented realtor Herman in the purchase of a Carbon Beach house  with 100 feet of ocean frontage for nearly $5.5 million.  </P></p>

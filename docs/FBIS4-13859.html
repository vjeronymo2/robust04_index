			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 24 Apr (MENA)--AL-AHRAM states that President  Husni Mubarak's visit to China was succesful.    The paper says Egypt's political gains from the visit are no  less important than the economic gains.    These gains, AL-AHRAM explains, are represented by the two  countries' complete agreement on regional issues in Asia and the  Middle East in particular, and international issues in general,  especially the future of the world in light of the new world  order, which is now being formed.    In its editorial today the paper says that Egyptian-Chinese  relations have been strong and firm for years. They have never  cooled and are becoming stronger. The paper adds that Egypt's  policy under President Mubarak has always been balanced and  eager to support and promote relations with all nations.</p>

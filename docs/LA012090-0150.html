			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIVING AGAIN IN GLASS HOUSES  </P> <P> Elyse Froehlich was overwhelmed the first time she made a nighttime visit to  her nearly completed custom home in Capistrano Beach. Exterior lights glowed  and twinkled through a 21-by-21-foot curved stairwell wall of jewel-like glass  blocks, creating a stunning, dramatic effect.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to understand what something like this is actually gonna be  like from a drawing," Froehlich says. "The impact, it's like so strong. And  when you come down from the top of the bridge (staircase) to the landing, it's  just such a powerful experience."  </P> <P> Froehlich, a painter, had told the architect that glass block was one of the  elements that she and her husband, Richard, a cardiologist, really liked. And  she wanted the house to function as a sculpture, an artwork in its own right.  </P> <P> The result was a 6,000-square-foot house that incorporates glass block as a  major design element throughout, giving this contemporary home with classical  elements a flowing continuity.  </P> <P> Glass blocks, which were at a peak of popularity in this country during the  1920s and '30s, enjoyed a resurgence in the 1980s as homeowners and architects  rediscovered this aesthetically pleasing and functional building material.  </P> <P> Glass blocks are being used with increasing frequency in contemporary custom  homes being designed in Orange County, according to local architects, designers  and masons who install them. Tract-home designers are also beginning to  incorporate glass block. One 133-unit tract of Huntington Beach homes will  include thousands of glass blocks to provide diffused light while maintaining  privacy.  </P> <P> Glass blocks are being used for walls, facades, stairwells, windows and  interior partitions, including curved shower stall walls. The blocks are  durable and easy to maintain, and provide more security than regular glass  because they are hard to break. And they are available in varied designs,  ranging from clear to opaque, allowing a clear view, an obscured view or  complete privacy.  </P> <P> Blocks are also available in varied sizes, from four-inch-square to  12-inch-square. Rectangular blocks are also available in some sizes. Prices  vary from $3 for a small, simple block up to $100 apiece for glass blocks that  are custom-etched.  </P> <P> In most installations, however, labor is the biggest cost, ranging from $28 to  $60 per square foot. Frequently masons must make tricky on-site adjustments to  turn an architect's concept into a reality.  </P> <P> The demand for glass blocks has gone up significantly, especially in the  residential market, according to Richard Carey, architectural representative  for the Angelus Block Co. of Orange.  </P> <P> Angelus is a distributor for Pittsburg Corning Corp., the only U.S.  manufacturer of glass blocks. He says his company has enjoyed "substantial  increases every year."  </P> <P> "Architects suddenly latched onto the product and started doing some very  unique designs," Carey says. "A product like this allows them to design-in  privacy and allow light and incorporate architectural elements that were never  used, can't be done with other materials."  </P> <P> "We almost use it in every appropriate project," says James Gartner of his  Santa Ana firm, James Gartner &amp; Associates, Architects. "We're going back  to the decorative style of architecture."  </P> <P> He says people are returning to "a combination of contemporary and decorative  (styles), and glass block seems to work in both cases. It works as a high-tech  material, and it works as a decorative material."  </P> <P> In the Froehlich home, for instance, the blocks do not have the cold feel that  might be expected. Instead, the light that flows through is warm and soothing.  </P> <P> In a large, white, ceramic-tile shower in the master bath, for instance, there  are two windows made of eight-inch-square glass blocks. The window facing a  neighboring house has textured blocks for privacy at a lower level and clear  blocks higher up. The window facing the ocean has clear blocks and allows a  person to shower while watching the waves.  </P> <P> Also in the master bath, a whirlpool tub is surrounded by white ceramic tile  and black marble. An eight-foot-long, glass-block window above the tub lets  light in but provides privacy too.  </P> <P> The eight-inch-square blocks used in the curved stairwell wall are a mix of  clear blocks and ones with a wavy design that partly obscures the view of a  neighboring house. Through the clear blocks, the sky and tall trees are  visible,and there is a glimpse of the neighboring house. Columns of  earth-colored caldura stone and a wool Berber carpet in a peach/mauve color add  to the warm feeling.  </P> <P> Froehlich's studio has an eight-foot-by-12-foot glass-block window with a  special feature. Six windows that open are set into the rest. And in the living  room and family room, 12-inch-square glass blocks are set into the wall about  two feet apart, above French doors with a view of the ocean.  </P> <P> "I think that the uniqueness of it isn't just the fact that it's glass block,"  says Jim Pepperell of Jim Pepperell Enterprises Inc. of Laguna Niguel, the  general contractor on the Froehlich home. "It's all the different ways it's  been used. It's just about covering the whole spectrum of any possible way you  could use glass block."  </P> <P> The cost of elegance is not cheap, however. The glass block and the  installation of the curved stairwell wall alone cost about $19,000, according  to Tom Justus of Justus Masonry, Cerritos. His company did the installation,  which took about three weeks to complete. Special reinforcement of the wall  brought the total cost to about $30,000.  </P> <P> Less elaborate installations of glass blocks are more common.  </P> <P> Arta Alexander of Fullerton wanted to brighten up a dark doorway. She had two  narrow doors in the entry of her home replaced with one standard door and one  vertical row of 7 1/2-inch-square glass blocks. Alexander, a landscape  designer, is pleased with the result -- a warm, brighter entry and light for  nearby planter.  </P> <P> Designer Pete Rose of Balboa Pacific in Balboa was asked to create a design  using glass block to brighten a remodeling effort by a development company on a  Balboa home. In the master bath, he designed two pyramid-shaped windows that  are mirror images on each side of a corner above the bath. There are four rows  of 12-inch-square glass blocks in the windows, laid in stairstep fashion from  five blocks on the bottom row to one at the top.  </P> <P> The bathroom floor and walls are dark brown, gold and black slate, so the  windows provide much-needed light. Another vertical row of three glass blocks  is used on a slate divider between the tub and toilet. And in the bedroom, a  five-foot-by-six-foot glass block window provides diffused light with privacy.  The windows will be lighted at night with spotlights.  </P> <P> He is also planning a counter that will have a wood top and a glass block base.  A fluorescent light under the counter will shine down on the glass blocks.  </P> <P> Ocean Pointe, a tract of 133 homes built closely together in Huntington Beach,  features still more uses of glass block. Mike Araujo of Mike's Masonry,  Huntington Beach, says he will use 14,000 glass blocks in the 83 homes being  framed.  </P> <P> Since neighboring houses are so close, a conventional kitchen window would  provide only a view of someone else's wall. So the designers put two long  vertical rows of eight-inch glass blocks over the cooktop. The result is light  and airy. The blocks are also used for windows upstairs and near the  first-floor powder room, and as curved windows in entries.  </P> <P> In one model, a bath has three 12-inch blocks set into the wall above a mirror,  about a foot apart. In a guest bedroom, three 12-inch blocks are set into the  wall in a vertical row, about six inches apart. Another use is to place five  12-inch blocks in a horizontal row, high on a bedroom wall and spaced about a  foot apart.  </P> <P> "What I like about it," says Araujo of glass block, "is the way the sun  illuminates it."  </P> <P> He says that when sunlight hits glass blocks just right, it's akin to looking  at a kaleidoscope because of all the colors refracted in the glass.  </P></p>

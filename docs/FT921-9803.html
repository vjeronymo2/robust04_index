			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Algeria's rulers declare state of emergency ALGERIA'S military-backed rulers, assuming new powers to crush widespread unrest by Moslem fundamentalists, declared a state of emergency last night. The Interior Ministry soon afterwards announced it would take steps to dissolve the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) for imperilling public order through subversive actions. Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, leader of the ruling High Council of State, decreed the one-year emergency after at least 40 people were killed and more than 300 wounded in two days of fighting between security forces and FIS supporters. About 400 people have been arrested. The Moslem militants want a return to the electoral process cancelled last month when the FIS looked set to win control of parliament. Under the state of emergency all demonstrations are banned and local authorities can order an end to all activities affecting public services. The Algiers authorities had already banned a march called by the FIS for the capital next Friday but the fundamentalist movement said it would go ahead regardless. The decree gives the interior minister power to close meeting places and authorise the security forces to search houses day or night. The authorities could use this provision to close mosques, which the FIS has used to campaign against the new rulers. The latest unrest erupted after weekly prayers on Friday, when security forces tried to enforce a ban on FIS imams (mosque preachers) focusing on politics. State television said people threatening security could be taken before military courts under the state of emergency. Local authorities can be dissolved or their activities frozen, it added. The FIS controls more than half the country's local authorities. Workers taking part in unauthorised strikes can also be detained. The FIS called a general strike last year as part of an earlier protest. The FIS, in its last communique before Mr Boudiaf issued his decree, said confrontation would continue with what it called 'the infernal apparatus of repression'. Riot police shut down the movement's headquarters in Algiers shortly afterwards and arrested five of the staff. The FIS communique, signed by fugitive militant Abderrazak Rajam, demanded that security forces lift their siege of Algerian mosques and allow freedom of speech in them. Scores of imams have been arrested for inflammatory speeches. The jailing of one last Tuesday sparked three days of battles in the eastern town of Batna in which 14 people died and 66 were wounded. Two courthouses were set on fire in other towns during the last two days of unrest. Trouble continued in certain of the FIS strongholds in Algiers such as Kouba, Badjarah and Hussein Dey throughout the weekend. There was confusion last night as to whether Mr Tedjini Haddam, who is rector of the Paris mosque, had resigned his position as a member of the Council.</p>

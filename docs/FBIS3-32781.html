			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An article in today's JUVENTUD REBELDE newspaper  explains the events that occured in the vicinity of the U.S.  Interests Section in Havana over the past three days, after the  counterrevolution launched rumors that the Cuban security guards  had been withdrawn. The item claims that Miami  counterrevolutionary organizations and special services of  imperialism are wholly responsible for the incidents that  occurred on 10 and 11 February.    They had tried to create a massive influx of Cuban citizens  to the U.S. Interests Section as a way to denigrate the  Revolution and create an incident that would further damage the  nonexistent relations between the two countries. The paper  points out that to do this, they used the rumor technique,  spreading false reports that the Cuban Government was interested  in encouraging an event of that nature.    JUVENTUD REBELDE says: The rumors began on the morning of 10  February when the counterrevolution began to spread the news  that the sentries had been withdrawn, and that the U.S.  Interests Section was expeditiously issuing visas to anyone  applying for them at the U.S. Interests Section.    During all [several seconds lost due to tape change] from  Centro Habana [Municipality] and from the Cojimar neighborhood  expressed their intentions of going to the place, while others  went to the U.S. Interests Section. Those people were joined by  a number of residents from Arroyo Naranjo Municipality.    On 11 February, the internal forces of order cordoned off  the  streets that provided access to the U.S. Interests Section to  prevent the crowds from getting near the Section offices. At  around noon on Friday [11 February], according to JUVENTUD  REBELDE, the presence of lumpen in the area was obvious, again  showing that this is the natural medium from which the  counterrevolution draws its sustenance.    During the course of the incidents at the U.S. Interests  Section, 82 people were identified and detained for a few hours.  At present, a number of citizens are still under arrest, and the  instigators of the events are being identified.    In its Sunday item, JUVENTUD REBELDE reports that several  participants in the incidents said they heard rumors from Miami  radio stations that visas would be freely granted.    It is obvious who masterminded the incidents at the U.S.  Interests Section. This is how the mechanisms of the  counterrevolution and imperialism operate -- on the basis of  deception and cynicism. Responsibility for what has happened  belongs wholly and exclusively to imperialism, to the  counterrevolutionaries in Miami, and to the agitators disguised  as dissidents. Cuba does not practice policies based on force.  The force of Cuba's policy lies in its proverbial justice,  crystal clarity, and fidelity to its proclaimed principles,  according to today's article in JUVENTUD REBELDE, entitled,  "What Happened at the U.S. Interests Section?"    The embassies in Cuba will always be able to count on the  protection and facilities they need to carry out their tasks and  ensure the the security of their members. Nothing happened  inside the U.S. Interests Section. There are no Cuban citizens  inside the offices. No one was hurt or injured. Once the rumor  about free issuance of visas was denied, everything returned to  normal.    Nevertheless, JUVENTUD REBELDE adds, these kinds of  incidents  and this type of irresponsibility have the potential to provoke  more serious consequences. The onus falls entirely on whoever is  responsible for promoting this kind of thing. Let this incident  serve as an experience for the unscrupulous authors of this  escapade.</p>

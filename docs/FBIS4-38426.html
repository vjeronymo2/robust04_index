			<p>BFN     [Text] President Boris Yeltsin has given instructions to  develop 11 important social and economic programs. In addition  the government is preparing some 20 programs to resolve several  key problems in industry. This was reported to Interfax by the  head of the presidential staff Sergey Filatov.    According to him, presidential programs concern primarily  health and environmental protection. The medical industry must  be promoted, in particular the production of insulin and protein  for the food industry. Another program provides for the  transition to energy-consuming technologies in different  branches of the economy, including the auto industry.    Filatov stressed that the implementation of this important  program will give a new impetus to Russian engineering. He said  things have gone to a point when Russian vehicles are not  permitted to Europe because they do not meet international  environmental safety norms.    Filatov also hopes that the planned reduction of the  consumption of gasoline and gas will considerably improve  transport energy supplies.    A public telephone program, Filatov said, will help  radically  improve communications in rural areas as well as cities. Some  of the new programs provide for the development of natural  resources, in particular new deposits in Tyumen and the Barents  sea, the expansion of the transport network and others.</p>

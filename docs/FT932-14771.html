			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME postpones pre-market trading session THE LONDON Metal Exchange has postponed the introduction of a pre-market trading session on the floor to mop up early morning business now carried out between traders' offices, writes David Blackwell. The decision to put off the move was widely expected following the outraged reaction of several ring-dealing members. 'I don't think there is any LME ring-dealing member who sees any sense in it at all,' said one prominent trader at the time. The LME wanted to introduce pre-market ring trading before the end of the year in order to give a better service to Far Eastern and Australasian clients. 'Following extensive consultation the board has decided to postpone for the time being the implementation of its proposal for the experimental introduction of a pre-market ring,' LME members were told yesterday. The original proposal sprang from a study by an LME working party into the exchange's membership structure. The study itself was set up after complaints by ring-dealing members that they were carrying a greater share of the burden of running the exchange. They felt that they were facing more risks than the non-ring dealing members, and not reaping commensurate rewards. The LME said yesterday that 'the board continues to examine the external directors report on market structure'.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Evander Holyfield, the No. 1 heavyweight contender, is asking for a restraining  order that would prevent heavyweight champion Buster Douglas and boxing  promoter Don King from interfering with scheduled purse bids for a  Douglas-Holyfield title bout.  </P> <P> A hearing is scheduled for today in New Jersey Superior Court on Holyfield's  request, which charges the fighter would be irreparably harmed if anyone sought  to prevent the purse bids, which are to be scheduled next month by boxing's  three governing bodies -- the World Boxing Assn., the World Boxing Council and  the International Boxing Federation.  </P></p>

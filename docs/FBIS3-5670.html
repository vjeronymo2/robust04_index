The Group of Seven (G-7) nations apparently will adopt the  chairman's draft statement noting that international trade will  help boost employment, baring in mind the relation between trade  surpluses and unemployment.    The statement, to be released after the two-day summit, will  avoid singling out individual nations for criticism. But Japan  may be the exception if the nation leaves its huge trade surplus  untouched, the sources said.    The economic ministers of the G-7 countries will participate  in the jobs summit, to be held March 14 and 15. Labor Minister  Chikara Sakaguchi will represent Japan.    According to the sources, these are the main points of the  chairman's statement:    -- Major industrial nations have been battling against  unemployment.    -- The unemployment rate has been rising in Europe and  Japan, whose rate is the smallest among the G-7 nations.    -- Each nation needs to provide equal opportunities to all  workers, particularly those in the low-skill sector.    -- Structural reforms will only be effective when they are  supplemented and supported by appropriate macroeconomic policies.    -- International trade is essential to boost wealth,  employment and wages.    -- The development of new technology regarding data  processing, has the potential to increase the wealth of  participating nations.</p>

Answering a question, the  minister for external affairs, Mr. Dinesh Singh, said government  constantly monitors developments having a bearing on India's  national interests. He said government remains committed to  policies in consonance with India's national interests and to  take all steps necessary to safeguard the country's territorial  unity and integrity. Mr. Dinesh Singh said all the recent  developments in the United States regarding India have been  discussed with the Clinton administration, both in Washington  and Delhi. He said the response has been that these constitute  and should not be construed to imply any change in U.S. policy.  The minister said Kashmir is and will remain an integral part  of India and no mediation will be allowed. He expressed the  hope that the U.S. Administration will recognize that the  Pakistan sponsored terrorism is a major obstacle in restoring  peace and tranquility in Jammu and Kashmir.    Answering supplementaries, the minister of state for  external  affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, informed the Lok Sabha that a lobbyist  firm is engaged in United States to project India's viewpoints  on several issues and to neutralize anti-India propaganda.

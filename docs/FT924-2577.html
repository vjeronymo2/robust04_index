			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: Mercedes' Brazil arm to report first loss MERCEDES Benz do Brasil, part of the German motor group, will this year report its first loss in Brazil. Mr Rolf Eckrodt, president of Benz do Brasil, blamed persistent high inflation and deepening recession for a Dollars 300m drop in sales. In spite of record exports, truck production was the lowest since 1970, dropping to 14,200 units compared with 22,400 in 1991. Bus production rose slightly to 20,000. Mercedes has 83 per cent of the local bus market. To compensate for falling domestic sales, the company focused strongly on exports, achieving a 31 per cent increase in sales to Dollars 600m, more than one-third of which was accounted for by Mexico. Total sales slipped to Dollars 1.4bn and as a result the company plans to lay off 2,000 workers next month. The news of the losses - the first in 36 years - concludes a bad year for Benz do Brasil, which is one of the companies implicated in the corruption scandal that recently led to the suspension of President Fernando Collor. Nestle, the Swiss foods group, is to cut investments in Brazil because of falling sales and profitability. Investments are to be reduced from Dollars 105m to Dollars 60m as sales continue to be hit by Brazil's declining per capita income. Like many companies in Brazil, Nestle has tried to compensate through boosting exports which this year rose 50 per cent to Dollars 50m, largely to Argentina.</p>

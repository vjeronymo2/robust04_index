			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Bonds: Heavy supply of issues in French franc sector TWO further issues totalling FFr2bn brought the level of supply in the French franc sector of the Eurobond market to FFr3.5bn in the past two days . Credit National, the French financial institution, and a unit of Deutsche Bank each launched FFr1bn of paper yesterday, following Banque Nationale de Paris' FFr1.5bn deal on Wednesday. Secondary market spreads in the French market sector have tightened over the past month or so due to the shortage of paper in the primary market. Most government-owned borrowers, having lost their government guarantees for Eurobond issues, are sticking to the French domestic market rather than pay a premium to tap the Eurobond market. At the same time, the strength of the French government bond market, and its gains against the German market, have buoyed foreign demand for French franc Eurobonds. The tightening of spreads has allowed borrowers to achieve their funding targets through the swaps market. The Credit National deal was swapped in the floating-rate French francs at a couple of basis points below the Paris interbank offered rate (Pibor). A number of other issuers are currently looking at the market. The market was able to absorb the heavy supply quite easily, as the paper was spread across a wide range of maturities, from four years for Credit National to 10 years for Deutsche, and among different groups of investors. The Credit National deal, fungible with an outstanding FFr1bn issue, was placed mainly with domestic institutions, while the Deutsche deal met strong demand among German retail investors. Another short-dated dollar deal, for Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the Finnish Bank, emerged. The Dollars 200m four-year issue was priced to yield 85 basis points over the average of three and five year US Treasuries (the four-year Treasury is not a liquid benchmark). The Treasury yield curve between three years and five years is unusually steep, with a differential of about 50 basis points. This has created arbitrage opportunities in the swaps market. However, dealers say the volume of short-dated dollar deals has exceeded demand. National Westminster Bank has raised Dollars 750m of subordinated debt in the Yankee bond market, the first bank to tap the sector this year. The 10-year bonds, launched by Goldman Sachs, were priced to yield 140 basis points more than the comparable US Treasury. Dealers said the Yankee market was currently the cheapest source of subordinated funding, which banks are keen to raise in order to meet capital adequacy requirements. There is a strong appetite for high-yielding products among US institutional investors, according to traders.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah in London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT </F> bureaus in Sanaa and Aden, and Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo:  "Yemeni Initiative To End the Fighting Between the Two Sides"]    [Excerpt] The leadership of the Democratic Republic of  Yemen in al-Mukalla and Aden yesterday studied an initiative  from the Sanaa leadership offering a cease-fire in return for a  cancellation of the declaration of a state in southern Yemen  without any other conditions such as the conditions previously  laid down by Sanaa about surrender and trial of what it  described as the "mutineers" in the leadership of the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP].    As speculations continued all day yesterday about the likely  reaction of the southern command, observers said that the aim of  Sanaa's initiative was to "try to block international  recognition of the new republic which the southerners, faced  with President 'Ali Salih's intransigence, were forced to  declare as a last resort to save whatever they can after the  failure to reach understanding within the context of unity."    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Salim Salih Muhammad,  member of the Yemeni Presidential Council in the unified state  and of the southern Presidential council; 'Ali Nasir Muhammad,  former south Yemeni president; Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib,  deputy prime minister in the unified state; and Foreign Minister  Muhammad Salim Basindwah, all participated in drafting the  initiative which was promptly accepted by President Salih. A  high-ranking source said "we are waiting to see what develops  from that."    The initiative of the Yemeni figures came as all parties  were  trying to contain the situation by promoting a cease-fire. Some  sources, however, have emphasized that the southern leadership  is now laying down two conditions before it considers any move  on its part. The first: a cease-fire on all fronts; and the  second: the return of all the southern units now in northern  Yemen to the south and withdrawal of all northern units that are  now in the south to the north.    It is not known if Sanaa would now accept these conditions.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): How to nurture smart ideas / A look at alternative ways of ensuring that bright inventions reach their potential market The Lion King, Walt Disney's latest animated epic, opened last week in the UK with all the hype of a film that has already taken US box offices by storm. Like each new Disney release, the latest extravaganza is packed with ground-breaking techniques to captivate audiences and animators alike. While The Lion King, by most accounts, reinforces Disney's position as the world's pre-eminent animator, a small UK company, Cambridge Animation Systems, hopes it has developed new software that will dramatically change the way many cartoons are made. Apart from the cleverness of the software, now surrounded by patents, Cambridge Animation has taken one crucial step. It has recognised there is little value in developing a wonderful new product if it cannot reach its market and support it. As a result the company will today announce it has raised Pounds 500,000 of new equity from venture capitalists 3i, to add to Pounds 300,000 raised earlier this year from Jafco, Japan's largest venture capital group, and the company's original institutional investor, Korda &amp; Co. 'One of the reasons products are jeopardised is that entrepreneurs are not prepared to raise enough money to get the product to market,' says Ruth McCall, one of three founders of Cambridge Animation. The three founders set about developing the Animo suite of products in late 1990 when they saw that automation had hardly touched the production of two-dimensional cartoon animation. While some companies were using software to computerise the simplest and most repetitive part of the process - the 'in-betweening' where pen and ink are used to colour hundreds of different acetates - no one had attempted to computerise the whole process while leaving the animator room for creativity. As a result, many animators ship work to studios in the Philippines, Vietnam and China where there is a significant labour cost advantage but where control of the process and quality is greatly reduced. Animo says its product will remove the cost disadvantage and increase quality, helping to repatriate animation work to Europe. The Animo software is being assessed by Nelvana of Canada and Warner Feature Films, which are about to computerise parts of their animation studios. In the case of Warner, Cambridge Animation is up against US Animation in Los Angeles and Soft Image Co in Montreal, both of which offer software which McCall claims does less of the animation process. But a year ago they needed more cash to support the product, to introduce it at trade shows and open sales and maintenance offices in the US and Japan. Hence, the Pounds 1m of new capital. Cambridge Animation's strategy for developing and exploiting its idea was fairly traditional - a straight approach to investors. But there are also a number of government initiatives designed to increase the rate at which high-tech ideas are developed and commercialised. At a European level, the Commission's Value programme aims to disseminate the results of European Union funded research and to exploit its potential across borders and across industries. The programme, administered through 27 Value Relay Centres - four in the UK - is part of the Third Framework programme of research and technological development, which is due to be upgraded in December. One beneficiary of the programme is Oxford Computer Services, a software developer and IT consultancy set up by university academics. For the past three years, the company and nine European partners have been collaborating on a Ecu3m (Pounds 2.36m) project to develop engineering software that aids the design and increases the applications of computer co-ordinated manufacturing techniques. The so-called MCOES system is being used by Valmet in Finland, which manufactures paper-making machinery, but otherwise the consortium had no customers. 'We had the software but it was a long way from workstations and being packaged,' says JO Thomas, director of Oxford Computer Services. 'So we approached the Value programme. We asked them to look for end users - factories where it might be installed - and we asked can MCOES be used for existing Cad-cam companies?' As a result of the introduction from Technology Broker, the Cambridge-based Value Relay Centre, Oxford Computer Services is negotiating to install its been put in touch with EDS Unigraphics, part of the giant US computer services group now a subsidiary of General Motors. 'The Technology Broker has been extremely effective,' says Thomas. 'This has been a genuine attempt to try to fill the gap between the invention process and having a product people can buy.' Jean-Noel Durvy, the Commission's co-ordinator of the Value programme, expects ministers at the Research Council in early December to approve a replacement for the Value programme under the Fourth Framework. This will combine the goals of Value and the Sprint programme, which focuses on encouraging technology transfer in the community. The previous Value programmes were limited to EU funded research. But the new programme is expected to have a budget of about Ecu290m over five years and will attempt to encourage the dissemination and exploitation of any community-based research through an expanded network of Relay Centres. Government support is also available at a national level. In the UK, the Department of Trade and Industry offers support at two stages during an idea's development. Its Smart awards - the Small Firms Merit Award for Research and Technology for companies with up to 50 employees  - first helps the development of ideas with grants awarded through regionally-based competitions, and then offers a large second grant to help commercialisation. Since the Smart awards were launched in 1986, more than 1,000 companies have been helped through the regionally-based competition and the DTI has given grants of Pounds 66m. A similar Spur award - Support for Products Under Research - is available to companies with up to 250 employees and has provided Pounds 36m of assistance to more than 400 projects since it was launched in 1991. This kind of programme of support has been widely applauded. One Newcastle-based company, Novocastra Laboratories, says it could not have developed without Smart. The company was set up by Professor Wilson Horne, professor of pathology at Newcastle University. It has won seven Smart awards to develop and commercialise its process for the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies used by research establishments worldwide. After seven awards the DTI has said it will not be winning any more competitions. Brian Angus, another academic and director of Novocastra, says the support from the university, which took only 20 per cent of the equity, was crucial. But so was the Smart programme. 'There was very strong financial support through Smart for the development of new ideas to a point where it might be commercialised,' says Angus. 'Most of the things they have funded have yielded a commercial return. It has been a great help to a company that started with no commercial capital.' Novocastra is expecting sales of Pounds 1m this year from the 20 products it has developed and the 200 it sells on behalf of others. While the DTI and - increasingly - the EU are becoming more aware of the need to commercialise the fruits of Europe's intellectual capital, some of their efforts remain bureacratic. McCall recalls an approach Cambridge Animation made to the EU Cartoon Initiative, part of the Commission's effort to support the union's audio-visual industry. Cambridge Animation asked for funding for a studio to make a cartoon feature film using an early version of its software. Eighteen months later - when Cambridge Animation had already completed most of the development work - McCall says the Cartoon Initiative came back with the idea that it would 'fund a study' of the uses of new technology in the animation industry. Some officials trying to support the commercialisation of products still have to learn that 'late' is rarely better than 'never' in fast moving global markets.</p>

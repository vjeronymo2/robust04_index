			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report NICKEL fell sharply on the London Metal Exchange yesterday as support levels gave way, triggering sell stops and liquidation. Three-month metal fell through the Dollars 6,200-a-tonne level - an area where support has held solid in recent days - and slid rapidly down. The decline occurred against a background of steep losses in other metals, notably COPPER and ZINC. Also, there were no fundamental reasons for nickel to be immune from the general weakness now affecting base metals, dealers said. Three-month copper confirmed the break below the important Dollars 2,200 level, with modest Chinese buying around Dollars 2,180 brushed aside. New York arabica COFFEE prices were down sharply at midsession after the market's technical bounce to Tuesday's tumble ran out of steam. Analysts said futures garnered early firmness from a port strike at Brazil's Santos. But such support proved fleeting because of persistent perceptions of high supply and lessened demand for coffee.

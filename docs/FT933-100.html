			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Internal shake-up at US telephone group MCI, the second-biggest US long-distance telephone company, yesterday said it was shaking up its internal organisation and eliminating the position of president and chief operating officer. This was formerly held by Mr Daniel Akerson, who quit unexpectedly in August. MCI said it was realigning and consolidating its US operations, and setting up units to supervise international alliances and business with multinational firms. The company is creating MCI Communications Services, which will be responsible for US operations and MCI's core long-distance business. It will be headed by Mr Gerald Taylor, formerly president of MCI Consumer Markets. MCI International Group will be responsible for managing international alliances, selling to multinational companies, and looking for international opportunities. Mr Bert Roberts, chairman and chief executive, said: 'This reorganisation continues the trend toward greater autonomy for our business units.' MCI said it was eliminating the position of president and chief operating officer as it moved toward more autonomous operating units. Mr Akerson left MCI to head General Instrument, a manufacturer of transmission equipment for cable television.</p>

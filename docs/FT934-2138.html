			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: SEET deficit reduced to Pounds 23,000 SEET reported a reduced deficit of Pounds 23,000 for the half year to October 31, on turnover, from continuing operations, of Pounds 2.69m. In the comparable period the textile company incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 249,000 on turnover of Pounds 4.54m, including a contribution of Pounds 1.69m from Kenneth Mackenzie, the Stornoway-based Harris Tweed manufacturer sold in October 1992. The outcome was struck after interest charges reduced to Pounds 17,000 (Pounds 119,000) and an exceptional credit of Pounds 35,000 (debit of Pounds 220,000). Losses per share were reduced to 1.15p (7.68p). Mr Jock Mackenzie, chairman, said that borrowings represented some 11 per cent of net assets at end-October. 'We are confident that during 1994 SEET will start to expand,' he added.</p>

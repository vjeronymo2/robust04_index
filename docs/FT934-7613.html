			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Anti-dumping issues given priority - Canada CANADA is urging the US and Mexico to set up a high-profile mechanism to negotiate new anti-dumping and subsidy rules within a specific time frame under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, is expected to tell President Bill Clinton when the two men meet in Seattle today that Canada's implementation of Nafta on January 1 is conditional on the creation of working groups, or similar bodies, to deal expeditiously with these issues. Mr Roy MacLaren, Canada's trade minister, yesterday indicated however, that the new Liberal government, which came to office last month, was unlikely to delay Nafta's implementation. CANADA US anti-dumping and countervail actions have been at the heart of several acrimonious trade disputes with Canada over the past few years, including softwood lumber and pork. Most recently, Washington has threatened to act against alleged subsidies on Canadian durum wheat. 'At the very least, the government wants to ensure that the anti-dumping issue is front and centre,' a senior government official said yesterday. Nafta already provides for a working party on trade and competition policy, and for further examination of subsidies. Canada's concerns on subsidies would be substantially addressed by a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. But the Uruguay Round would do little to reform anti-dumping rules. Nafta's approval by the US House of Representatives had little impact on Canadian financial markets yesterday. Mr Michael Manford, chief economist at ScotiaMcLeod in Toronto, said that Nafta had been overshadowed by concerns about widening federal and provincial budget deficits. Nafta is expected to have a far smaller impact on the Canadian economy than the four-year-old US-Canada free trade agreement. Canada's trade with Mexico totals about CDollars 3bn a year, a fraction of its trade with the US. Mr Manford said that Nafta might be mildly damaging to Canadian business in the short term, as some labour-intensive sectors, such as textiles and shoe manufacturers, moved production facilities to Mexico. But these losses are expected to be offset later by rising exports to Mexico.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Border deaths probed Venezuela is investigating reports that 19 members of the Yanomami tribe died and many became seriously ill because of mercury poisoning, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas. They lived in a remote jungle area in Bolivar state, near the Brazilian border. The area is frequently the scene of conflicts between illegal gold miners from Brazil and the Yanomami, who have communities on both sides of the border. Earlier this year, miners massacred Yanomami in another border area.</p>

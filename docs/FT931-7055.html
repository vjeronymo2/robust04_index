			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Sending the baby to sleep The Japanese are now going wild over something the British have had for years - a cassette which calms crying babies and persuades them to sleep. The soundtrack, put together by Roger Wannell, of Somerset, combines three rhythms with a background of 'pink' noise. Although to adults the track sounds like a washing machine, to a baby it sounds like a combination of the mother's womb and the human voice. The British Technology Group has licensed the soundtrack to Victor Musical Industries, a subsidiary of JVC. JVC: Japan, 03 3242 8520. BTG: UK, 071 403 7586.</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Italy pressed to probe alleged beef fraud A ROW is developing within the EC over the apparent failure of Italy to pursue vigorously evidence of a Common Agricultural Policy fraud. British customs investigators are understood to have told EC officials of their growing frustration with the apparent refusal of their Italian counterparts to move against a company engaged in a suspected fraud involving EC subsidised beef intended for the CIS. The suspicions of EC investigators were aroused earlier this year when traders reported difficulty in selling beef in European markets because of competition from cut-price products. In May, UK customs officers seized a consignment of 180 tonnes of Irish beef. The beef, found in a warehouse in the port of Runcorn near Liverpool, was about to be sold within the UK at just below prevalent market prices, although it had been exported to Italy for processing and canning for delivery to the CIS at a heavily subsidised EC rate. In recent weeks, UK customs has investigated a number of UK companies in connection with the sale of the beef, but have ruled out criminal action against any of them. Instead they have passed on documentation and other evidence to EC inspectors and Italian officials which in their view should have led to early action against at least one Italian company. 'We believe there is enough to act on, and the Commission is of the same view,' one customs official said. Italian officials are believed to have visited the company concerned but have so far refused to launch a formal investigation or make any arrests. According to EC and customs officials, the suspected fraud is typical of a growing problem as farmers and exporters cheat the taxpayer under the Common Agricultural Policy. An EC report last month estimated that nearly 600 new cases, involving more than Pounds 100m, were uncovered by the 12 EC states last year. The problem is identified in a report went to British MPs and tabled for a House of Commons debate next month. According to the Commission, the UK reported the largest number of cases - 131, worth over Pounds 8m, of which Pounds 2.5m has been recovered. The largest amount appeared to be in Italy, where Pounds 70m was discovered but only Pounds 4m recovered. Ten days ago, Italy and France called for increased co-operation between EC members to fight organised crime in Europe under the banner of the Maastricht Treaty. According to UK officials however, EC states disagree over how to translate this commitment into the arrest and conviction of suspected criminals, partly because of inconsistent judicial procedures.</p>

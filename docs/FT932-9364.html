			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / New town ignites Singapore 'China fever' THE HEADLONG rush by Singapore companies to invest in China has entered a new phase with the signing of an agreement between the Singapore authorities and the Chinese to develop an industrial township in Suzhou, near Shanghai. The agreement proposes developing a 70 sq km new town  - already called 'Singapore II' by the Singapore press - using Singapore's integrated planning approach as a model. The hope is to attract USDollars 20bn (Pounds 12.9bn) of investment in the new town, which will eventually have a population of more than 600,000. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's senior minister, who was present at a signing ceremony is Suzhou, said Singapore would transfer its planning expertise and knowhow to the Chinese. In the process Singapore could make the connections vital to winning contracts. 'If we transfer this asset over seven to 10 years, it will be useful to them and in the process we will get to know them well at different levels. . . that's the trade-off,' he said. Under the terms of the preliminary agreement the Singapore Labour Foundation, a quasi-state body, and the Suzhou municipal government will put together a consortium of companies to work on the new town. 'It is a microcosm of what we've been doing in Singapore,' said Mr Lee. The Sembawang group of Singapore has meanwhile signed an deal with the Suzhou authorities to build power plants capable of producing 2,400 megawatts of electricity. Suzhou is part of Jiangsu province, China's fastest growing economic region. A Singapore-based analyst said the Suzhou town project could mean multi-million dollar contracts for Singapore companies. 'But things are never simple in China. In the past agreements have been signed but nothing has come of them  - it's going to be a time before we know just how much the deal is worth,' Mr Lee said. 'China fever' has been rampant in Singapore since Mr Lee made a highly publicised trip to China last year. He returned to chastise Singaporeans for their lack of entrepreneurial zeal and urge the island republic's companies to follow the example of their counterparts in Hong Kong and Taiwan and invest more in China. Mrs Wu Yi, China's minister for foreign trade and economic co-operation, told a trade seminar this week in Singapore that in 1992 Singapore companies became involved in more than 700 projects in China with a total investment value of Dollars 997m. This compared to total Singapore investments in China of Dollars 897m over the entire 1979-91 period. Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NBA CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES;  </P> <P> LONG ROAD ENDS;  </P> <P> FINISH DISAPPOINTS ABDUL-JABBAR, BUT HE'S NOT SAD HIS TIME RAN OUT  </P> <P> And so it ended . . .  </P> <P> After 20 seasons and 1,815 National Basketball Assn. games, counting the  regular season, playoffs and All-Star appearances, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar came out  for the last time.  </P> <P> Nineteen seconds remained in the final game of the NBA finals.  </P> <P> The fans stood and applauded.  </P> <P> The Pistons stood and applauded.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar showed little expression. He kept his goggles on. After a while,  he nodded his head and said, "Thank you.  </P> <P> "I just tried to enjoy the moment and take it all in and receive the crowd," he  said later. "I gave my teammates one last hug. That's the last time I'll be  able to do it on the hardwood."  </P> <P> Play resumed and time ran out. Game, series, season and career.  </P> <P> Thus did Abdul-Jabbar pass into basketball history, after 20 NBA seasons, four  more than anyone has ever lasted, and 37,639 regular-season points -- 44,149  altogether -- and most of the important records in the game. Love him, hate  him, don't give a damn about him, but where he walked, no one will soon follow.  </P> <P> Now, at 42, he passes over into civilian life.  </P> <P> How will he begin it?  </P> <P> "I really don't know," he said. "Probably sleep 'til 1 o'clock."  </P> <P> His passing was awkward. The Pistons, who'd played him with one man and watched  him go for 24 points and 13 rebounds Sunday, paid him the compliment of  double-teaming him, as in days of yore.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar sagged to seven points and three rebounds.  </P> <P> He tried six last skyhooks -- five actually, with one impromptu jump hook  thrown in -- and missed them all.  </P> <P> He took down only three rebounds. Late in the game, with the Lakers still  within 100-96, he couldn't react fast enough to pick up Joe Dumars' miss one  step away and John Salley got it, instead. Moments later, Dumars knocked in a  17-footer, effectively putting the game on ice.  </P> <P> Maybe, someone suggested, Kareem would have preferred to have it end after Game  3?  </P> <P> "No," said Abdul-Jabbar. "I wish it was Game 5, 6 or 7. Like I said, I just  wish we could have lasted longer. The other numbers are unimportant.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed. I'm not sad. We knew we were going uphill, without our best  team.  </P> <P> "I'm going to wonder about it (how a healthy Laker team would have fared). I  already have wondered about it. But I can't dwell on it. That's the way the  hand was dealt."  </P> <P> In the end, what did he have to complain about?  </P> <P> He had a long, distinguished professional career.  </P> <P> He got his wish, to be traded back to Los Angeles, where he'd gone to college.  </P> <P> He was already a 10-year veteran when the Lakers picked up Magic Johnson to go  with him, kicking off a run of five titles and three more trips to the finals.  </P> <P> "It couldn't have been any better," Abdul-Jabbar said. "Not when I can remember  growing up on the streets of Manhattan and hoping I got to play one pro season.  I outlasted everybody. I got to play with the greats of the game."  </P> <P> How did he think he'd done?  </P> <P> "Well, I did pretty good."  </P> <P> How did retirement feel? Perhaps with a surging crowd of people bearing pens,  tape recorders, minicams and sound booms bearing down on him, he didn't feel so  retired quite yet.  </P> <P> "It really hasn't set in, as far as deeper meanings," he said. "I'm just  thankful I've been able to last this long and walk out the door. I thank the  Almighty for that. After that . . . we'll see what it's all about."  </P> <P> A couple of days ago, Abdul-Jabbar said he wouldn't get involved in basketball  in another capacity, that he had had enough competition for a while.  </P> <P> How about working with kids?  </P> <P> "Yeah, my kids," he said, laughing.  </P> <P> "I've got some things in the fire," he said Tuesday night. "I'm going to try to  do some acting . . . I have four little people I have to find out what they're  doing, get more involved in their lives. I think it'll keep me pretty busy."  </P> <P> It was about then that Magic Johnson brought one of his sisters through the  media melee to kiss Kareem goodby.  </P> <P> "Any time you work with a guy whose whole objective is to get you the ball, you  gotta love him," Abdul-Jabbar said.  </P> <P> Did he plan to say anything to Johnson about the passing of the torch.  </P> <P> "Magic knows what to do with it," said former Laker great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NBA CHAMPIONS OF THE '80s  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.89IN:3.10IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Champion  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1988-89  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Detroit Pistons  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1987-88  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Lakers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1986-87  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Lakers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1985-86  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Boston Celtics  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1984-85  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Lakers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1983-84  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Boston Celtics  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1982-83  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Philadelphia 76ers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1981-82  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Lakers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1980-81  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Boston Celtics  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1979-80  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Lakers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> THAT UNBEATABLE 3-0 LEAD  </P> <P> A list of the outcomes for the teams that held 3-0 leads in the NBA  championship series:  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.89IN:4.53IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Season  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Teams  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1946-47  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Philadelphia d.

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: IDV sizes up 33.8% Buton stake INTERNATIONAL Distillers &amp; Vintners, the drinks arm of Grand Metropolitan, is to acquire a 33.8 per cent stake in Buton, the Italian premium spirits producer. The Pounds 21m deal, with a group of minority shareholders, follows IDV's acquisition earlier this week of a 30 per cent stake in Gonzalez Byass, the Spanish sherry and brandy company. IDV stressed yesterday the move did not signal a full bid for the Italian company, which is controlled and managed by the Sassoli de Bianchi family. 'An approach will be made proposing a commercial relationship between IDV and Buton on a worldwide basis,' it said. 'In the event that IDV is unable to develop such a long term relationship, it has made arrangements which will allow it to sell the 33.8 per cent interest back to the vendor shareholders.' A partnership agreement with Buton, on the lines of those being developed with Gonzalez Byass and Jose Cuervo in Mexico, would give IDV access to Italy's leading spirits brand, Vecchia Romagna, a premium brandy, together with a range of liqueurs and wines. Italian sales of Vecchia Romagna amount to nearly 800,000 cases a year. Another 200,000 cases are exported, according to International Drinks Bulletin. Buton has been trying to expand export sales and access to IDV's international distribution network would offer considerable opportunities. The Italian group, which is the only drinks company quoted on the Milan stock exchange, also has a speciality foods business.</p>

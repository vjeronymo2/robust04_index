Belgians have the highest consumption rate, spending an average of Dollars 8 (Pounds 6) annually per head on homeopathic remedies. But consumption is growing most quickly in the UK - by more than 15 per cent between 1987 and 1992 - with Nelson and Weleda the market leaders. The biggest single market in Europe is in Germany, where consumers bought Dollars 1.3bn worth of homeopathic and herbal remedies last year. Datamonitor: UK, 071 625 8548.</p>

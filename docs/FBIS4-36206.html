			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mas'ud Khaleqi: "And Yet, There Is Room for </F> Concern"-- punctuation as published]    [Text] On Tuesday 24 May, the esteemed Majles speaker, who  attended a news conference with foreign and domestic  correspondents, said in answer to a question put to him by a  correspondent of Japan's NHK Television on what he thinks of the  importation of American goods into the country and the  possibility that these goods may affect the culture of Islamic  Iran: "We are not concerned about the importation of some  American goods into our country and the American culture that  they can bring in. Our Islamic and national culture is too  strong to be negatively affected by such minor issues...."    We too fully agree with the remarks by the esteemed Majles  speaker, that our country has a rich and strong Islamic and  national culture. But contrary to his view, we are extremely  concerned over the importation of some American goods and the  bad effects that this may have, and we believe that this issue  should be studied from several aspects. In our opinion, we  should pose this question from another angle and ask the  esteemed Majles speaker: What vital need does our country have  for American soft drinks and cigarettes? And what dangers can  the banning of such imports have on our Islamic homeland? We  should also recall that during last year's session of the G-7,  the Americans placed the topic of banning the export of  technology to Iran on their agenda and insisted--together with  the British Government--that this decision be approved. And  today, if in some part of the industrial world there is a  country or a company that is transferring technology to Islamic  Iran, it becomes the target of strong criticisms by the American  bully.... And finally, the esteemed Majles speaker, who is a  revolutionary figure with a bright record, definitely knows that  the sale of American technology and of the diplomacy of  exploiting this technology go hand in hand, as do their arms  sales and arms policy. This point is so clear that it does not  need any further explanation.    Therefore, if "some American goods" means items like Coca  Cola, Pepsi Cola, cigarettes, chocolate, chips, and so on--that  is, items for which the country has no need--the importation and  sale of these items is an insult to the Muslim nation and to  those who have shed their blood for this nation. And if  American goods means technological products, then the Americans  sell such products only if this sale is coupled with the  acceptance--by the buyer--of the policy that they want to be  accepted. But this is only one side of the coin. The other  side of the coin should be sought in the views of our late imam,  may his soul be sanctified, when he boycotted American imports.  We believe that opening up the market of Islamic Iran to  American goods will fill the pockets of the bloodthirsty and  plundering capitalists of that country with astronomical  profits, and will greatly harm our economy, while also helping  the Americans do what they usually do in other countries--that  is, couple the export of their products with the export of their  culture and influence. But the sagacious view of our late imam,  may his soul be sanctified, on the significance of boycotting  American products is much more profound than this. A mere part  of what he meant can be seen in his remarks that: The  boycotting of American products will keep alive the deep  hostility and spite as well as the memory of the crimes  perpetrated by the Americans against our Muslim and oppressed  nation in the minds of future generations and will prevent them  from forgetting this hatred.    On the other hand, Islamic Iran has been recognized as the  standard-bearer of pure Mohammedan Islam among the Muslim  nations, and all facts show that the other Muslims consider  Islamic Iran's actions to be an acceptable pattern that they too  can follow. The boycotting of American products is tantamount  to a line that is drawn between Islam and its major  enemy--America. The answer to the question of why Islamic Iran  has boycotted American goods shows the true identity of the  great satan; and this is what our generation needs today.    Finally, we are well aware of the fact that the esteemed  Majles speaker's remarks did not mean that he was issuing a  permit for the import and sale of American goods, but that they  referred to the wealth of our Islamic and national culture and  an effort to remove any misgivings that the import of some  American goods means that we will ignore the principle of not  having relations with America. In another part of his news  conference he also explicitly referred to this issue. However,  the concern does exist that there will be some who will exploit  part of his remarks.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Dutch insurance chief resigns MR Willem Scherpenhuijsen Rom, chairman of ING, the Dutch banking and insurance group, resigned unexpectedly yesterday after Dutch press reports about the private investments of former senior executives from the group's banking arm. Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom, who took over as ING's chairman just 12 weeks ago, said he was stepping down because he had increasingly become the focus of negative publicity. His successor is Mr Aad Jacobs, who until now was vice-chairman and head of the group's insurance operations. Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom's resignation followed press allegations that he knew about the personal investments of Mr Ton Soetekow, who resigned from ING's board in the summer, as well as a report that Mr Scherpenhuijsen had made private investments in the late 1970s in a property company that had a banking relationship with NMB Bank, which he then chaired. An ING spokesman said that Mr Scherpenhuijsen Rom's property investment was legal but had been ended in 1981.</p>

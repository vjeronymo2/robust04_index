			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERATION RESCUE AND POLL ON ABORTION  </P> <P> Your story on Randy Terry of Operation Rescue contained the inevitable quote  from a civil rights leader from the 1960s, in this case Julian Bond, belittling  comparisons made between Operations Rescue and the desegregation demonstrations  of that era. The demurrers of these leaders in general, and Bond in particular,  cannot be sustained.  </P> <P> In general, the civil rights leaders who object to the comparisons with their  movement both fail to appreciate this country's long history of civil  disobedience for various causes and, at the same time, manifest a rather  condescending attitude. Their attitude implies that the rights that they sought  to uphold were superior to the rights sought by every other group engaged in  civil disobedience. Not only is this parochial, it is clearly wrong when  applied to the right to life itself.  </P> <P> Bond claimed that "civil rights tried to expand life for everyone. These people  want to restrict life for women." To assert Bond's position is to rebut it.  Even the most strident pro-choice advocate must admit that life itself is a  basic right, if not the pre-eminent right. The right is listed first in the  triad of rights guaranteed in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.  </P> <P> The goal of those who oppose abortion, whether by the means of demonstrating  with Operation Rescue or through conventional lobbying, is to expand the  natural and constitutional right to life for everyone, including unborn  children.  </P> <P> Surely, the right to live is more deserving of legal protection than the right  to eat at a Woolworth's lunch counter.  </P> <P> MICHAEL A.

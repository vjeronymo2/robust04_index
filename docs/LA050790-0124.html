			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> A YEAR AFTER CUP, FLAMES OUST CRISP;  </P> <P> NHL: DEFENDING CHAMPION CALGARY FIRES ITS COACH IN THE WAKE OF A FIRST-ROUND  PLAYOFF LOSS TO THE KINGS. NO SUCCESSOR IS NAMED.  </P> <P> Terry Crisp, whose Calgary Flames won the Stanley Cup last season but were  upset by the Los Angeles Kings in the first round of this year's NHL playoffs,  was fired today.  </P> <P> In three seasons with the Flames, Crisp led them to their first Stanley Cup,  the league's best record in 1988 and '89 and the second-best record this  season. His record was 144-63-33.  </P> <P> General Manager Cliff Fletcher said Crisp, 46, had the option of remaining with  the team in a "meaningful capacity," but the former NHL player was not at  today's news conference. Fletcher did not name Crisp's successor but said he  planned to do so within several days.  </P> <P> "It is the feeling that to maximize the potential of our hockey club it  necessitates a change of coach," Fletcher said.  </P> <P> Although the Flames won the '89 Stanley Cup, this year's early exit from the  playoffs apparently sealed Crisp's fate. In his rookie season, the Flames  finished first in the overall standings but were knocked out of the playoffs in  the second round by the Edmonton Oilers.  </P> <P> Crisp, whose red hair matches his fiery temper, took some heat in Calgary for  publicly criticizing his players. Team owners asked him to tone down his foul  language behind the bench because of complaints from fans.  </P> <P> Few criticisms were heard of Crisp last season, though, as the Flames won their  second straight President's Trophy with 117 points. After a first-round playoff  scare from Vancouver, the Flames went on to win the Stanley Cup.  </P> <P> Earlier this season, though, whispers of discontent began. There were reports  that the players didn't respect Crisp and openly questioned his coaching  methods.  </P> <P> Crisp, twice nominated for NHL coach of the year, has two years remaining on  the contract he signed last summer with the Flames. He played 11 seasons with  Boston, St. Louis, the New York Islanders and Philadelphia, where he played on  Stanley Cup champions in 1974 and '75.  </P> <P> He was an assistant coach for two seasons with the Flyers, then took over as  head coach of the Ontario Hockey League's Soo Greyhounds. He coached the  Greyhounds to three league championships.  </P> <P> Crisp then spent two seasons with the Moncton Golden Flames, Calgary's American  Hockey League farm team.  </P></p>

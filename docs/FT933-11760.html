			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown cautious on poll forecast MR PADDY Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, yesterday said victory at the Christchurch by-election was within his party's grasp but 'not in the bag by a long chalk'. Mr Ashdown, paying his last visit to the constituency before tomorrow's vote, said: 'People are rushing around taking it as self-evident. I think victory is within our grasp but it is not there. If people stay at home or vote Labour they are in effect telling the government it's OK to continue as they have done so far.' Mr Ashdown made a stinging attack on Mr John Major's leadership style when he addressed a packed meeting. Mr William Waldegrave, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the biggest Tory gun fielded yesterday, limited himself to accusations that the Liberal Democrats suffered from electioneering 'amnesia'. All parties in the campaign insist that irrespective of the political melodramas unfolding in Whitehall, it is the familiar litany of 'real-life' issues - value added tax, law and order and the economy - that are dominating the campaign questions in its final days. With memories of the general election still fresh in many canvassers mind, the mood among most local Conservative workers yesterday remained self-consciously upbeat. 'I am determined. We are all working very hard,' said Mr Robert Hayward, the Tory candidate, although he refused to make predictions about the vote. Yet as workers from the national party wandered around the quiet cul de sacs, some confessed to misgivings. 'This is a by-election and I think that people won't pay as much attention. I am sure we will win it back at the next election,' said Mr Jack Aspinwall, MP for Wansdyke. The Liberal Democrats admitted that their biggest fear remained the 'silent Tories'. One party official said: 'The problem we have had all the way along since the general election is that a lot of people won't say they are Tory voters. There are a lot of people who you have to assume are Tory voters.'</p>

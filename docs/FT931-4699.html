			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Fish row protests stepped up FISHERMEN IN Grimsby yesterday prevented French fish from being unloaded for the second day running in the latest stage of a growing European Community dispute over cheap imports. Police were investigating a separate incident on Monday night in which trawlermen at Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, poured diesel oil into the hold of a Russian factory ship. The actions in the UK coincided with further protests by French fishermen against cheap fish imports following a violent clash between fishermen and riot police outside the fish market in Nantes. The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, representing most fishermen in England and Wales, said UK fishermen were frustrated by what they perceived as their disadvantaged financial situation in the face of government restrictions, a flood of cheap imports from Russia and Norway, and an increase in fish landed by EC boats. Mr Barry Deas, federation secretary, said: 'We are operating against weak demand. What we really need are tight controls on the amount of fish coming in.' Mr David Curry, fisheries minister, accused fishermen of simplifying the problem and warned that protest action would undermine the government's attempts to argue its case in the EC.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Skachko: "Culmination of Stratification </F> of the Nomenklatura: Gromada--New Political Party of Business  Managers"]    [Text] The constituent congress of a new political party  called the All-Ukraine Gromada Association (VOG), which marked,  it may be said, the culmination of the process of stratification  of the Ukrainian nomenklatura, has been held. The reason for  this was the varying degree of recognition of new economic  interests, and the coming parliamentary and presidential  elections have been the motive for the structuring of  nomenklatura groupings. The former middle tier of the Soviet  nomenklatura which has something to lose in Ukraine and which  concentrated its capital locally, having invested it in the  industry of the regions, has, according to the delegates to the  congress, united in the VOG. They described themselves as  industrial workers who have "preserved property" and authority,  know how to work, and wish to openly avail themselves of the  results of their labor and afford the rest of their fellow  citizens an opportunity to make an honest living. The VOG's  newly elected leaders explain the desire to unite in an  independent political party for participation in the elections  by the fact that political parties that could satisfy their  interests are lacking in the republic at this time. The VOG  declared at the final news conference of the congress that it  intended to nominate its candidates for people's deputy and also  intended to support people with similar views, if there are  such. An adviser to the present Ukrainian Government, Aleksandr  Turchinov, who, confirming the opposition nature of his  organization, declared that he had resigned from the Cabinet of  Ministers of Ukraine, was elected leader of the VOG. He declared  also that the VOG "was created not on the strength of leaders  but in adaptation to a program" and that, consequently, it had  nothing in common with the recently organized bloc of Vladimir  Grinev and Leonid Kuchma.    The VOG program, which consists of two sections--Salvation  and Development--may unequivocally be characterized as liberal  in the strictest pragmatic version. The summary statement of the  VOG on the program's main task says: "To introduce in practice a  program for the salvation and development of Ukraine, which  means: the lowest taxes on the territory of the CIS, the best  investment climate and the biggest privileges for exporters in  the CIS, civilized privatization, the structural reorganization  of the economy, the surmounting of inflation, and the effective  social protection of the population." Aleksandr Turchinov added  at the news conference one further program point of considerable  importance--the legalization of all sums of capital, other than  criminal capital obtained from the sale of narcotics and  weapons, racketeering, robbery, and so forth. Only shadow  capital that is not legalized within a strictly established  timeframe would, according to the VOG program, be subject to  confiscation.    Among other measures, the VOG proposes, in particular, the  establishment of a single value-added tax at a rate of 10  percent and a profits tax of 25 percent, the establishment of  the maximum rate of a differentiated personal income tax at 30  percent, and the abolition of all restrictions and fines for  wage increments. The VOG supports the customs-free,  license-free, and quota-free exports of Ukrainian finished  products in the pursuit of a strict protectionist policy, the  creation of free economic zones, the priority privatization of  insolvent enterprises, and so forth.    The strict introduction of the rule of law and observance of  legality and the creation of efficient professional armed forces  and law enforcement authorities is one of the points of the VOG  program. But Sergey Lylyk, chief political scientist of the  organization, rejected the possibility of the imposition of a  state of emergency in Ukraine and declared that such a step  would be a national catastrophe for Ukraine since "the country  has neither a program of activity under state of emergency  conditions nor a team to realize it." At the same time Sergey  Lylyk declared that his organization would fight the imposition  of a state of emergency by any means. One of his associates  added: "By any constitutional methods." It should be mentioned  also that the possibility of the imposition of a state of  emergency in Ukraine was also rejected the same day at a news  conference by Vyacheslav Chornovil, the leader of Rukh  [Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka] and a member of  parliament, and it would seem that the rumors of a state of  emergency in Ukraine have thus far been exaggerated.</p>

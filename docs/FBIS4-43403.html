			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis will meet UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in New York today. The  meeting is considered decisive in light of the negotiations and  decisions that will be made at UN headquarters on the future  course of the Cyprus issue.    Last night, the foreign minister met in Washington with U.S.  Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and U.S. National  Security Adviser Anthony Lake. In a statement, Mikhailidhis  said the timing of his visit is most appropriate because it has  been ascertained that the U.S. State Department is considering  the next step in the Cyprus issue. He added that the United  States would definitely want an agreement on the  confidence-building measures; its firm position is to try to  achieve something practical in the Cyprus issue. Mikhailidhis  said the Cypriot Government fully agrees with the UN secretary  general's evaluation that the Turkish side lacks political will  and that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' moves are merely  for show.    U.S. State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said the  issue that is being raised now regarding the confidence-building  measures is whether the views of the two sides in Cyprus can be  incorporated within the framework of UN efforts to reach a  general settlement of the issue. He said that many sides have  dealt with this issue as an urgent and decisive issue, and that  the UN Security Council is now searching for ways to proceed.  Replying to questions on visits to Washington by Mikhailidhis  and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Richard Boucher, McCurry noted  that the Greek Cypriot side has accepted the UN proposals on the  confidence-building measures made in March, while the Turkish  Cypriot side has accepted the June variation.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HOME ISN'T SWEET FOR METS' HARRELSON, EITHER  </P> <P> Coming home with Bud Harrelson as manager didn't seem to help the New York Mets  much Monday night.  </P> <P> The crowd of 24,433 didn't respond when Harrelson popped out of the dugout the  first time, and so far the Mets have showed few signs of turning things around.  </P> <P> Nelson Santovenia, hitting only .150, delivered a two-run pinch-single with the  bases loaded in the seventh inning as the Montreal Expos rallied for a 5-3  victory over the struggling Mets at New York.  </P> <P> "I really think we're getting close to busting out," Harrelson said. "I'm still  positive."  </P> <P> The loss dropped New York to 21-26, its worst record this late in the season  since 1983.  </P> <P> Since Harrelson replaced Dave Johnson last Tuesday, the Mets have lost four of  five games.  </P> <P> The Expos, who outhit the Mets, 13-5, have won seven of eight road games and  their last six of seven overall.  </P> <P> Met starter David Cone (1-4), who matched a career high with 12 strikeouts,  also gave up five runs and 11 hits in 6 1/3 innings as the Mets lost for the  seventh time in nine games.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 6, Chicago 2 -- The Pirates went looking for a left-handed starter  when John Smiley went on the disabled list last month. They may have found one  on their own pitching staff.  </P> <P> Bob Patterson earned his second consecutive victory as a starter and Barry  Bonds hit a two-run triple, leading the Pirates to a 6-2 victory over the Cubs  at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Patterson (4-1) had a 3-7 record and 5.97 earned-run average as a starter  before this season. In his two 1990 starts, he has given up 11 hits and four  runs, and struck out nine in 13 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Against the Cubs, Patterson lowered his ERA this season to 2.91 while giving up  five hits in seven innings. He pitched six shutout innings before giving up  Hector Villaneuva's solo homer.  </P> <P> San Francisco 10, Cincinnati 1 -- John Burkett pitched the first complete game  of his career and every Giant starter got a hit by the fourth inning as the  Reds were routed at San Francisco.  </P> <P> The Giants got 16 hits and batted around twice in the first four innings to  take an 8-0 lead. They scored five runs on seven hits in the first off Ron  Robinson (2-2), who had a 6-1 lifetime record against the Giants.  </P> <P> Burkett (5-1) gave up seven hits and got 16 outs on grounders.  </P> <P> San Diego 10, Houston 2 -- Garry Templeton had four hits and the Padres enjoyed  their biggest inning of the season -- eight runs in the eighth -- and trounced  the Astros at San Diego.  </P> <P> Bip Roberts had three of San Diego's 15 hits and Tony Gwynn and Benito Santiago  had two-run singles as the Padres won for the sixth time in seven games and  handed Houston its fourth consecutive loss.  </P> <P> The Astros' Glenn Davis hit his fourth homer in six games and leads the NL with  16.  </P> <P> St. Louis 3, Philadelphia 2 -- Terry Pendleton's RBI single over a drawn-in  outfield in the 11th inning gave the Cardinals a victory over the Phillies at  Philadelphia.  </P> <P> The Cardinals won despite getting only four hits in the last 10 innings after  Pedro Guerrero's two-run double in the first.  </P></p>

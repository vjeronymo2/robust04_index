			<p>BFN     [Text] On 18 May in Santos (Sao Paulo State), Alcides  Tapias, president of the Brazilian Federation of Banks  (Febraban), said Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's presidential  candidacy "may be one of the factors that caused foreign debt  certificates to drop."    These certificates, which were issued by the Brazilian  Government, have a nominal value of $100. On 4 May, they were  negotiated for $74 and on 17 May their value dropped further to  $67.    Tapias could not forecast the position banks will adopt if  the certificates' value continues to drop. He said he has no  data on the amount of these certificates still in the hands of  the national banks.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Lloyds lags on small-business loans under LGS WIDE discrepancies emerged yesterday in high street banks' lending to companies under the government's small business loan guarantee scheme. National Westminster Bank, the biggest lender over the past two years, put Pounds 48.3m into the scheme, about double the amounts lent by Barclays and Midland, two of its main rivals, and more than 10 times the Pounds 4.6m committed by Lloyds. NatWest accounted for 39 per cent of the Pounds 122.3m loaned in the period. Under the scheme the government guarantees 70 per cent - soon to rise to 85 per cent - of a bank loan. It is intended to encourage the banks to lend to viable businesses which have exhausted their own financial resources and which cannot provide conventional security for loans. The figures were released by Mr Edward Leigh, a trade and industry minister, in response to a written question from Ms Anne Campbell, the Labour MP for Cambridge. They showed that NatWest and Midland granted far more loans than would be strictly justified by their share of the small-business market while Lloyds granted far less. NatWest accounts for 27 per cent of the small business market, according to a recent survey by the Forum of Private Business. Midland accounts for 12 per cent of the market but made 19 per cent of loans under the guarantee scheme while Lloyds accounts for 17 per cent of the market but made only 4 per cent of loans. Barclays accounts for 26 per cent of the market and made 22 per cent of the loans. The total amount loaned under the scheme fell from Pounds 70.1m in 1991-92 to Pounds 52.2m in 1992-93, most of this accounted for by a sharp drop in NatWest's lending, from Pounds 34.6m to Pounds 13.7m. This was due to a decline in the number of start-ups seeking loan finance and a tightening by NatWest of its lending criteria. Midland and Clydesdale were the only banks which lent substantially more last year than in 1991-92. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced in March that the conditions of the guarantee scheme were to be eased as part of a wide-ranging Budget package to help small businesses. Under the proposals the premium which is charged to small businesses is being cut from 2.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent for variable-rate loans and 0.5 per cent for fixed-term loans. Barclays said it expected that it would increase the amount of guarantee-scheme lending once the government guarantee was increased. In the past it has written off 40 per cent of the sums advanced under the scheme.</p>

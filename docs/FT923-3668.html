			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: TWA go-ahead for plan to sell stake to unions A US bankruptcy court judge yesterday gave Trans World Airlines, the bankrupt US carrier, a green light to go ahead with its plan to sell a 45 per cent stake to its three unions, in exchange for wage concessions. Under the proposed deal, creditors would get the remaining 55 per cent in return for forgiving much of TWA debt, writes Nikki Tait. The deal, however, still needs ratification from the unions. And TWA's emergence from bankruptcy still requires a resolution to the dispute between the carrier and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency which underpins pension benefits in the US. The PGBC claims that TWA pension plans are underfunded by Dollars 1.2bn, and wants the airline's owner, Mr Carl Icahn, to make good the deficit.</p>

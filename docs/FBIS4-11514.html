			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "special correspondents" Roque Gonzalez Vera, </F> Hilarion Acosta, and Jorge Caceres]    [Text] Formosa, Argentina -- Argentina, Paraguay, and  Bolivia have decided "at the highest level" to give the highest  priority to the handling and solution of all matters pertaining  to the Pilcomayo River, and they also decided to establish that  the carrying out of any tasks, both at the technical and  environmental levels, will be carried out in coordination with  the three countries' proper organizations.    The tripartite decision to act "as one body" in the solution  to the technical, political, and environmental problems  curiously does not contain the manner in which the financial  resources will be obtained to carry out the scheduled tasks in  the lower basin, which is shared by Argentina and Paraguay, and  the middle and upper basins, which are in Bolivian territory.    [Argentine President Carlos] Menem, [Paraguayan President  Juan Carlos] Wasmosy, and [Bolivian President Gonzalo] Sanchez  de Lozada, together with their foreign ministers and chief  technicians, met for six hours in this provincial capital to  discuss a common action policy for the Pilcomayo River.    The governors of Formosa, Salta, and Jujuy Provinces  (Vicente  Joga, Roberto Ulloa, and Oscar Perassi) also participated in the  meeting.    The Declaration of Formosa signed by the presidents  indicates  the need to ensure an equitable distribution of the river's  waters in its lower reaches in Argentina and Paraguay, and in  this respect it urges that "the immediate action that already  has been decided on has the objective of re-establishing the  equal flow of the water that enters the territories of the two  countries, mainly to attenuate the process of damage and  clogging and to prevent an abrupt change in the river's course  at the points listed as critical."    The presidents also decided to include the middle and upper  basins in the work plans that are to be carried out; therefore,  they decided to "hasten the studies regarding the third phase of  the project for the multiple development of the Pilcomayo's  basin with the intention of implementing a program for the  overall management of said basin taking into account the  intensive erosion of the upper basin, the control of the flow,  and the rational use of the waters."    The Argentine, Paraguayan, and Bolivian Governments decided  to promote the development of the Pilcomayo's basin and its area  of influence in order to optimize the exploitation of its  natural resources, create jobs with the attraction of  investment, and allow the rational use of its hydraulic  resources.    In order to help this development, the chiefs of state  agreed  to the creation of a "tripartite commission for the development  of the Pilcomayo's basin," and instructed their foreign  ministers to sign the respective agreement as soon as possible.    During the news conference they gave, Wasmosy revealed that  this commission will be made up of six members (two from each  country) and will have an executive secretary, who will be  contracted in another country, possibly a European country.    Finally, the presidents expressed the concern of their  governments regarding the protection of the environment, and  said they will support action "directed at sustained development  that will necessarily include the implementation of  environmental protection policies with an eye to preventing the  region's environmental deterioration."    During the news conference in the Turismo Hotel's Blue Room  after the signing of the joint declaration, Menem said: "If  anyone is demanding indemnification for damages, then the first  thing he has to do is demonstrate that the accused party is  responsible. This is a basic fact in law." With these words,  the Argentine president rejected Argentine responsibility for  the damage that is being suffered by our country due to the  opening of the channel [from the Pilcomayo into Argentine  territory].    Menem, who remained fairly calm until he was asked if the  Pozo Hondo-Mision La Paz bridge is to be considered  indemnification for Paraguay, added: "If they are accusing  Argentina of causing damage then they have to demonstrate that  we are responsible for the waters not entering the neighboring  country and that we are to blame. It is true that I do not know  who is to blame in this matter because the two countries agreed  to the opening of channels. We opened a channel, but it seems  that the Paraguayans did not open theirs correctly."    The Argentine president emphasized that they are willing to  cooperate. But "we will not accept a responsibility that is not  ours," he said. To prove these remarks about cooperation, Menem  confirmed that the construction of the Pozo Hondo-Mision La Paz  bridge over the Pilcomayo will begin immediately. This bridge  will allow a road connection with Salta Province and will mean  the physical linking of the Atlantic with the Pacific through  the Paraguayan Chaco.    He indicated that the Formosa Province Government headed by  Vicente Joga has received instructions to begin the work as soon  as possible. "The bridge has to be finished by the end of the  year, which is when the rains start and the river begins to  rise," he said.    When Menem finished speaking, Wasmosy took over, saying: "I  do not want to go into details and predict who is to blame and  who is not. My intention is to look at the positive and  constructive factors, and the positive aspect is that there  exists the political desire of the three countries, interpreting  the feelings of their peoples, to apply a rational and equitable  solution to this problem."    With these words the Paraguayan president is practically  rejecting the possibility of requesting that Argentina pay  indemnification for the damage that has been caused, as though  two years without receiving a drop of water and another year of  receiving it in drops are not a sufficient argument to face this  problem in a responsible way.    Regarding this point, it must be recalled that in 1991  Paraguay and Argentina did agree to the opening of experimental  channels. On schedule and on the agreed date the Argentines  opened their channel, but the Paraguayan technicians arrived 15  days later and, to top everything else, opened a channel against  the river's current as though the river could reverse its  current. Colorado Party politician Juan Roque Galeano was then  director of the National Pilcomayo Commission, and he should be  put on trial to determine his responsibility in the loss of our  sovereignty.    But this negligence does not exonerate our neighbor from his  responsibility. The agreement called for the opening of a pilot  channel, but their technicians brought in bulldozers and opened  a channel with a depth not contemplated in the agreement. And  this flatly points to bad faith. They also promised to close  the channel, and in September 1993 Menem stressed that Paraguay  would receive the same amount of water as Argentina by the end  of 1993, but that is still in his dreams so far.    And this is not all. Argentine technicians and geologists  had perfect knowledge of a subterranean geological structure  that cuts the Pilcomayo perpendicularly, thus causing a tilt  toward Argentine territory. Formosa Province waited for the  sediment to reach that point and it was there that it opened  "the tap" that is very difficult to close today. If there had  been good will, concern to prevent the closure of the river's  bed would have been expressed much sooner and not when Paraguay  is facing a de facto situation that will be very difficult to  reverse.    During the news conference and regarding the channel's  closure, Menem again promised that the work will have top  priority "as scheduled by Paraguayan technicians. I again  repeat that Argentina will not receive one drop more than  Paraguay. We are going to achieve an equitable distribution of  the Pilcomayo, as it should be between brother countries."    Referring to costs, Menem explained that constructing the  dam  on the Pilcomayo at the site of the two countries' channels will  cost $18 million and these funds already have been obtained in  Europe. The dam that has been planned in the area of Villa  Montes, Bolivia, will cost $300 million. The Argentine  president reaffirmed that the bridge's construction and the  channel's closing will be finished before the end of the year,  and only then will the other scheduled works be carried out.    Asked by ABC COLOR's special correspondents on his country's  participation in the financing of the works on the upper reaches  of the Pilcomayo, Sanchez de Lozada said: "If Bolivia does not  participate in the seeking of solutions, the Pilcomayo will die.  We have a large responsibility in this matter because the river  starts in our territory."    The Bolivian president flatly denied press agency reports  datelined La Paz that reported an alleged negative response to  committing his country to international financing for the work  to be carried out on the Pilcomayo. "It is absolutely not true  that Bolivia refuses to contract debts. We form a team together  with Paraguay and Argentina in which each party has a determined  quota of sacrifice. We have given top priority to the river,  and we look at it as a system that must be protected," he said.    It is important to point out that the Bolivian president  acknowledged that his country has always traditionally  considered the Pilcomayo to be a Paraguayan-Argentine concern  and that it has not implemented any direct action because it is  not directly affected by the silting up of the river.    "Bolivia stopped looking at the Pilcomayo as something  foreign because its fate also affects us. The river poses a  tremendous environmental challenge because the consequences can  be extraordinary. And it must be taken into account that the  environmental damage can cost much more than the investment  being projected."    The presidential news conference was delayed due to changes  made in the joint declaration. The meeting with some 100  journalists from the three countries and international agencies  was held in the Turismo Hotel's Blue Room.    During the conference, Wasmosy highlighted the political  will  of the three countries to implement measures to save the river  from its imminent disappearance. He also emphasized the  region's environmental importance and the need to preserve it.  He also confirmed the creation of a technical commission to be  made up of technicians from the three countries.    A neutral expert will be contracted for the post of  executive  secretary, preferably someone who is an expert in hydraulic and  environmental matters. "It will be someone who has nothing to  do with the interests of each country, in order to obtain the  most just solutions and alternatives," Wasmosy said.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey chief takes 32% pay increase THE PAY of Mr David Davies, executive chairman of Johnson Matthey, the advanced materials technology company, rose 32 per cent last financial year, from Pounds 184,016 to Pounds 242,980. This followed a 25.5 per cent pay rise for 1990-91. According to the annual report, Mr Davies's pay last year included a performance-related bonus for the first time - of Pounds 42,534. It said bonuses were determined by the management development and remuneration committee 'for the achievement of budgeted profit targets and personal objectives which are set at the beginning of the financial year.' Bonuses are disclosed in the year in which they are paid rather than the one in which they are earned. Mr Davies's basic pay rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 200,446 last year compared with a 9.8 per cent increase to Pounds 73.8m in the group's pre-tax revenue. Payments to shareholders were lifted by 6.7 per cent to 10.3p. Since Mr Davies became chairman in January 1991, JM has virtually completed a rationalisation programme which, among other things, has seen its workforce fall from 7,358 to 6,142. This boosted profit per employee from Pounds 5,800 in 1989-90 to Pounds 11,800. In his annual statement sent to shareholders yesterday, Mr Davies estimated that without the rationalisation JM's costs in 1992-93 would have been higher by Pounds 25m.</p>

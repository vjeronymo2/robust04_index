			<p>CSO     [TEXT][Excerpts][passage omitted]-Chairman of the State Law  and Order Restoration Council Senior General Than Shwe said the  central Myanmar gets insufficient rain and thereby becomes a dry  zone resulting in the low yield of crops. The people of the  area still lag behind in development as a result, he said.  Irrigation networks are now being built under the project for  greening the nine arid districts in central Myanmar, which will  eventually raise the standard of living of the people in the  area. He said it is necessary to make efforts in construction of  irrigation networks for the speeding of the local populace.    The project for greening of the nine arid districts is  amined  at conserving water resources, he said. Although irrigation  networks built in the area are not large, a great number of the  facilities will provide sufficient water supply for greening the  area. With an increase in the sown acreage there will be a rise  in the standard of living of the people, he said. Hence, he  said, local authorities have been instructed to strive for the  success of project for greening the nine arid districts.    He stressed the need to give priority to establishing forest  plantations as forests are essential for water supply,  preventing land erosion and for favourable weather conditions.  Irrigation networks are being implemented under special  projects for regional development and enhancing the standard of  living of the people, he said. He urged farmers of the  different regions to make efficient utilization of water to earn  their livelihood and to bring about regional development.    He urged service personnel to implement the projects, and  try  their best to serve the interests of the nation and the people.    He pointed out that Development of transportation and  communication systems are vital for economic development.  Hence, he said, attention must be paid to construction and  repair of roads and bridges which are contributory to trade and  commerce. He further noted that better transportation and  communications links will contribute towards economic  development in all regions, and growing contacts among the  various national races will lead to consolidating friendship.    He spoke of the need to give priority in stages to transport  and communications for national development. He emphasized that  the projects for the construction of the six bridges across the  respective rivers are to be implemented without fail for the  development of national economy and local people.    He pointed out that the special projects are being  undertaken  according to the needs of the State. Hence, he said work must  begin from wherever possible for the success of the projects.  He said that the State will provide what is necessary in the  process, and all those responsible are to work hard.    He also stressed the need to establish a system with  responsible personnel who will be overseeing that State funds  are put to good use. He called on the people to strive in  concert with the local authorities and do best to complete the  projects as scheduled.    The meeting ended at 3:45 pm.    Special pojects    Arrangements are being made under Special Projects  Implementation programme to build six major bridges across the  river in the various states and division and accordingly the  bridge across the Thanlwin River near Hpa-an Townships will be  built to forge national solidarity, bringing about proportionate  development to border areas and states and divisions, ensuring  secure and smooth transportation for regular and smooth flow of  goods and to bring about economic and social development in  Kayin State.    The bridge will be built with iron beams and frame and the  piers will be built of reinforced concrete. It will be 900  metre long and the motor road will be 8.5 metres and there will  footpaths on either side of the road. The bridge will be built  in such a way that it will be able to withstand 60-ton motor  vehicles passing over it.    As Ayeyarwady River flows from north to south it divides the  western bank from the eastern bank and therefore the  communication links between the eastern sector and western  sector is difficult. The Sagaing Bridge built in the upper part  of Myanmar has enabled people to travel direct between Kachin  State, Chin State, Sagaing Division, Mandalay Division and Shan  State and has helped to bring about development to the region.    Similarly, if there is a bridge across the Ayeyarwady River  near Pyay Township, then there will be a direct communication  link between Rakhine State, Bago Division, Mayway Division and  Ayeyarwady Division and this will not only ensure secure and  smooth transportation, but will also bring about economic and  social development of the people in the region and when people  mingle and travel from one place to another it will assist in  strengthening national unity.    In order to improve communication links between the states  and divisions, a bridge will be built across Ayeyarwady River  near Pyay Township. It will be a bridge made of iron frames and  reinforced concrete. It will be 1,275 metre long and will  include footpaths, each 8.5 metres wide. It will withstand  60-ton motor vehicles using it.    New roads are being built and old ones renovated in  Ayeyarwady Division in order to be able to transport goods  smoothly and expeditiously as the division produces the highest  amount of paddy, fish and meat and agriculture products.  Arrangements are being made to build brigdes across the river  so that the roads in the division are connected with one another  and could be used without any disruptions and have direct links  with Yangon. Hence Myaungmy Bridge will be built across the  river near Myaungmya Township and another bridge across Toe  River near Maubin Township.    The Myaugmya Bridge will be built near Payachaung Ward in  Myaungmya and will be of a prestressed concrete bridge. On  completion of the bridge, there will be direct links between  Myaungmya-Einme-Kyaunggon Road, Myaungmya-Einme-Karka-Pathein  Road and Myaugmya-Labutta Road.    The Toe Bridge is also a prestressed concrete type bridge.  On completion of the bridge, there will be direct links between  Twantay-Maubin Road, Maubin-Hsarmalauk Road,  Maubin-Yaylegalay-Mawlamyinegyun Road and Maubin-Kyaiklat Road.    The Chaung-U Pakokku Railroad was built to ensure secure and  smooth transportation and to bring about development to the  border areas and national races. Arrangements are being made to  build a bridge across Chindwin River on the Chaung-U-Pakokku  Railroad between Minywa village in Yesagyo Township and a place  near Tawkyaunggyi village in Chaung-U Township.    This bridge will be made of steel frames and will be  7,111.04  feet long and 60.68 feet wide. There will be a motor road, a  railroad and footpaths on the bridge.    On completion of the bridge passenger and goods  transportation will be speeded up and the development in regions  on the western bank of Ayeyarwady River and on either bank of  the Chindwin River will be greatly enhanced.    The Myanma Railways is laying the Pakokku-Gangaw-Kalay  Railroad which will link up with the Chaungy-U-Pakokku Road.  The Myittha Bridge will be built across the Myittha River at  Kanywa on eastern bank of the river on the Gangaw-Kalay Road  section.    The Myittha Bridge will be a prestressed concrete bridge and  will be 680 feet long and 14 to 17 feet wide. On completion of  the bridge people will be able to travel directly from Gangaw to  Kalay. Goods produced in the region could be transported  easily and the people in Chin state and those in the  Gangaw-Kalay basin will be able to travel about most  conveniently and this will bring about rapid development in the  region.    The Irrigation Department is making field surveys to find  good prospects for implementing dam construction projects and  building new dams in order to realize the objectives of the  State to produce more crops, to bring about regional development  and greening of nine dry zones in central parts of Myanmar.    Out of these projects, eight dam construction projects in  Mandalay Division, two projects in Mayaway Division, one project  in Ayeyarwady Division and one project in Bago Division are  being implemented.

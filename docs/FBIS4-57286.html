			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Debate between presidential candidates Ernesto Zedillo </F> Ponce de Leon of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI;  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Party of the Democratic Revolution,  PRD; and Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action  Party, PAN; with moderator Maite Noriega at the Fiesta Room of  the Technological Museum in the Federal Electricity Commission  Building in Mexico City -- live]    [Text] [Noriega] I am inviting the candidates to enter this  forum in the order established by the results of the lottery we  just conducted. Good evening, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD  candidate.    [Cardenas] Good evening.    [Noriega] Good evening, Dr. Ernesto Zedillo, PRI candidate.    [Zedillo] Good evening.    [Noriega] Good evening, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, PAN  candidate.    [Fernandez] Good evening.    [Noriega] Ladies and gentlemen, before opening the debate I  will briefly outline the rules agreed on by the parties to  conduct this debate.    It will be divided into three parts. Each candidate will  have the floor for an equal amount of time, under equal  conditions, and in the order established by the results of the  lottery.    The first phase begins with an eight-minute exposition by  the  candidates, who will discuss their political ideas in general  terms. Later, each of them will have two opportunities, one of  five minutes and the other of three minutes, to comment on the  views of his adversaries, respond to questions or observations  made to their own comments, or expand on his initial statement.    In the second phase, the candidates will have five minutes  each to outline their proposals. Then each candidate will have  two three-minute rounds to expand on their statements.    Finally, each candidate will have three additional minutes  to  deliver a final message.    It is important to remember that the candidate speaking  cannot be interrupted and cannot use any more time than that  established for each portion of the debate. Now that these rules  have been outlined, we will open the first part of this debate.    PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas has the floor.    [Cardenas] The moment for this long awaited debate has  arrived. This is a moment without precedent for the candidates  who are promoting a democratic change: A moment on television,  which had been closed to us. I hope this is not the last  meeting of the three candidates who are here. I hope that the  PAN and PRI candidates agree to meet again on other occasions  before 21 August and to meet also with the candidates of the  other parties.    This opening of the media is, without a doubt, a victory for  those who from various positions and in various organizations  have been struggling for a democratic change in our country.    I have been able to travel throughout the country. I have  been doing this for the past six years. We have found an  abandoned countryside, closed factories, and dismissed workers.    We have found poorly served dining tables. In these trips  throughout the country we have seen roads in bad condition and  situations that the majority of the Mexicans cannot appreciate.    In sum, we have found a situation most Mexicans cannot agree  with. We can say that no one, except a few, very few, are  better off today than in 1988.    What we have found in our trips throughout the country is a  nation deteriorated by corruption, arbitrariness, and the lack  of investments and opportunities.    With very few exceptions, most of the people, at least  those living in areas where the country's resources are located  -- a significant majority -- are all seeking some type of  change, and all of us would like this change to be fair and  reasonable. We should not be afraid of change.    We should all think of the changes that occur throughout our  own lifetimes. Changes begin to take place in a small child who  transforms into an adolescent, a young adult, and finally into a  full-grown adult. As time goes by, we learn and acquire new  experiences, and we learn new ways to resolve our problems.    This is the type of change we are seeking for our country --  a change that will allow all of us to progress and resolve the  source of our problems; a change that will also allow us to rise  out of the mess into which the current administration has led  us, and move to a place that will permit us to enter a stage of  development and creativity that will allow us to take advantage  of our resources. We are seeking a transformation that will  allow us to guarantee our children their right to life -- their  right to be children who are not forced to work and, in turn,  are able to study, play, and laugh. We are seeking fair and  reasonable changes for every youngster throughout the country,  enabling him or her to have access to education and employment  -- changes that will allow them to take part in sports and  encourage their creativity in the arts and culture.    We are also seeking changes that will allow Mexican workers  to improve their wages and to have tangible job opportunities.  We want changes in which women will be allowed to advance  toward genuine equality -- a term that has become dead in our  laws. We want changes that will open the door to new  opportunities for women. It is up to all of us -- women and  children included -- to pave the way to new opportunities and  for these changes to take place at work, at play, and during  cultural and political activities.    We are seeking fair and reasonable changes that will allow  our farmers to plow their fields -- changes that will not compel  them to abandon their lands to see how they can earn a living on  the other side of the border, only to find themselves facing the  uncertainties that prevail over there. We are seeking changes  that will enable us to take into account the important  contributions we have received from our retirees and senior  citizens -- people who are responsible for what we are today.    Nevertheless, we cannot accomplish any of this with the  government we now have. We cannot accomplish this if we  continue with the current policies that have only led us into a  situation of crisis -- a situation in which the only thing we  can expect is that corruption, price increases, and  environmental pollution will continue to pummel us. If we set  our sights on this task, we can attain changes. These are  changes for which we will have to work, especially if we expect  to improve the climate of freedom. Enhancing the scope of  democracy will allow us to develop economically and prevent us  from stagnating, as has happened recently, and it will permit  genuine social equality to exist in our country.    It is critical for us to progress in three important areas:  democracy, economic growth, and social equality. The current  administration has said that economic growth comes first.  Nevertheless, it has been unable to implement any changes, and  it has not been able to institute democracy. This government  has caused increased poverty, and I would like to call attention  to the fact that the PRI candidate has said the greatest shame  -- his greatest shame and his government's greatest shame -- is  none other the poverty in which these people have plunged  thousands of Mexicans. This poverty has tended to grow. I  would like to call on all Mexicans to prepare for changes. All  of us -- urban and rural workers, artists, and citizens  throughout the entire country -- should prepare for these  changes which, if we are willing, can be engendered.    [Noriega] Ernesto Zedillo, candidate for the Institutional  Revolutionary Party, PRI, has the floor for eight minutes.    [Zedillo] Good evening, fellow citizens. Thank you for your  attention. Good evening, Maite. Good evening, Messrs.  candidates. I appreciate your acceptance of my 24 April  invitation to hold this debate, which undoubtedly will  strengthen our democracy. The upcoming 21 August elections are  about the most important issues. They are about the future of  Mexico; they are about the future of our families; they are  about the future of our children. Tonight's debate is for and  about the future of Mexico. Each Mexican family will have the  well-being it deserves -- the well-being that it should have,  which Mexicans have worked for in the past and will work for  from this moment onward, and not because of what we have failed  to do in the past. That is why tonight's debate is about the  future, not the past, my fellow countrymen.    I am sure that pretty soon Mexico can become the fully  democratic country with progress and justice that all Mexicans  are yearning for. That is why I assumed -- with great sorrow,  yes, but also with steadfast determination -- the responsibility  of becoming the standard bearer to replace Luis Donaldo Colosio.  I have done so to work for the Mexico of which we all dream. I  have confidence, my fellow citizens, in Mexico's future. My  confidence resides in knowing that time and again we Mexicans  have overcome our problems. We have overcome adversities. At  times, we have defended our sovereignty, even with our own  blood. My confidence also lies in my personal experience. I  hail from a family in which limitations and poverty were a daily  experience. Thanks to the efforts of my parents, however, and  thanks to the efforts of my teachers and the opportunities  offered to me by Mexico, I stand here today aspiring to be your  president. This is Mexico -- a land of opportunity.    My confidence is also based on our country's strength -- a  strength that should make us Mexicans extremely proud. My hope  to serve my fellow countrymen is substantiated by a life of  work, study, and knowledge, and a life of getting to know the  country's problems. It is supported by a public career of many  years which I began when I was very young. My career has taken  me from the most modest positions of public administration to  accepting two state secretariats. I know that I am the youngest  of the presidential candidates, but I can assure you that I am  the one with the most experience in good government.    I want to place my knowledge, my studies, and my experience  at the service of my fatherland. Today, more than ever, I want  to do so to become part of the solution to our problems. I want  to do so in order that those problems which weigh heavily upon  you today, my fellow citizens, can be overcome, because we have  the ability to overcome them.    In matters of justice, I am convinced that the country will  progress only if all Mexicans adhere to the fulfillment of the  Constitution and laws and if those people who fail to do so are  invariably punished in the terms of the law itself. I must  recognize the fact that this is not the case today. There are  many people who are annoyed by the prevailing injustice, the  lack of security, and violence, and, often, the corruption of  the police corps and the Public Prosecutor and Attorney  General's Offices. This is why I am proposing the total  reformation of our judicial system. This must be a deep-rooted  reform, starting virtually from ground zero, because we need a  justice system that will function for the Mexican people. We  must establish a legal system that will protect citizens'  rights, that will avert violence, and that will rid us of our  security problems. I am certain, my fellow citizens, that we  can achieve this together.    In terms of economic matters, without giving way to  inflation  and without returning to the policies of the past, we must  reestablish growth. Our economy must grow faster than our  population to enable us to generate the jobs you are demanding.  This is why I propose an economic policy whose key mechanism  will be the promotion of investment in order that we can take  advantage of this great national state we have, as well as take  advantage of the world markets that have opened, thereby  generating the jobs that are being demanded. I think that with  an investment policy that will encourage new businesses, bolster  the ones extant, help the Mexican countryside, and encourage new  activities in service and export industries, I am certain, my  fellow citizens, that we are going to generate those jobs. I am  also proposing to promote technology to give, together with  training, a great boost to production. In other words, this  should enable us to do things better in order that we can become  more competitive, and, above all else, increase wages.    New economic growth, my fellow citizens, will provide us  with  resources to fight poverty. Poverty is our greatest challenge.  We must work to enable those many thousands of Mexicans who  still live in conditions of poverty to overcome this poverty.  We will do this without paternalism. We will break this  vicious circle -- this circle of poverty and ignorance in which  they are trapped today -- providing them with education, health,  dignified housing, and alternative sources of employment. I  propose that the greatest triumph of our generation be the  defeat of poverty. With jobs, better salaries, justice, and a  frontal attack on poverty, we will be satisfying your demands,  fellow Mexicans.    We will do so by strengthening our federal system, by making  the decisions not here from the center but, rather, from where  you live. We will do so, my fellow citizens, by strengthening  our democracy. I invite you to work together with us for that  future -- that future of progress, that future of justice, and  that future of democracy, which we all want for our children, my  fellow citizens. Thank you very much.    [Noriega] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, candidate for the  National Action Party, has the floor for eight minutes.    [Fernandez] My fellow Mexicans, friends: We are a young  nation, with a majority of young people. We are a peace-loving  people who want to work to live in a dignified manner and who  want to progress. We have vast moral, cultural, religious, and  historical wealth. Our country is large and beautiful,  featuring abundant minerals and oil. As a birthright, we have  the eternal embrace of the seas.    We have over 10,000 km of coastline, 10,000 km of coastline  and beaches, with everything that it implies, from the viewpoint  of tourism, trade, and nourishment. In view of everything that  we have, the question we must ask is: Why is there hunger,  neglect, unemployment, insecurity, guerrillas, and death among  us? I think it is because we have not achieved a just order,  because we have not been able to form good governments, because  policy usually is not subject to ethics, and because the economy  has not been truly human.    No, Dr. Zedillo, we have not come here to speak only of the  future. To speak of the future, we must also speak of the  present. To understand the present, we must speak of the past.  In short, the debate will soon begin. For me, far beyond the  extent of the debates, my interest is to invite you, the men and  women of Mexico, "to participate in change, to leave  selfishness, indecision, and cowardice." We need to know how to  face the challenge today and we need authentic social leaders to  turn into genuine political leaders. The task must be for all  of us. Politics are far too important to leave them in the  hands of politicians.    Undoubtedly, we have all heard fiery speeches in favor of  democracy. Generally, however, they are from the viewpoint of  rights. The PAN wants to insist today, as it did 54 years ago,  that democracy too is doing one's duty. I invite you -- friends  and colleageus -- to all go and vote freely, according to your  conscience, because in that manner, we can democratically direct  the destiny of our nation. Dr. Zedillo, if we all agree that a  change is urgent than we must agree that we do not want to  change in such a way that everything remains the same. Nor do  we want, Mr. Cardenas, to return to a past to which we should  not return.    "The National Action Party's view is that we should seek a  change that does not imply destroying everything Mexico  represents because it has cost the Mexicans a lot to have most  of what we have." We need to achieve a change that will  consolidate the good things, but at the same time be capable of  overcoming and rectifying both political and economic  diversions. I tell you, friends and colleagues, I believe that  in the presidency I will be supported by you, as well as by the  history of PAN and my work there, which has always been  democratic.    From the opposition, fellow citizens, the PAN has secured  rectifications in the government. When the government has made  rectifications, we have supported such decisions for Mexico, for  you, for the nation. We have also clearly marked the  differences we have with the government. The differences are  both political and economic and I will mention them briefly. We  continue to defend effective suffrage, which the government does  not respect. We advocate division of powers, which is not  respected in Mexico. We promote authentic federalism, the  municipal life. In one word, we advocate the state of law.  Economically, we continue to advocate a truly human economy, at  the service of humankind, in which we will all have the  opportunity to work and benefit from the distribution of wealth.  I frankly believe we have deep differences. I tell my friends  and companions that we have a country and we have the people.  What we need is a good government.    The PAN lives democracy internally and wants to share it  with  you, because it wants Mexico to live democratically. As PAN  candidate, I invite you to support us for the Congress majority,  to be able to reach the presidency of the republic, and to make  Mexico a country in which we can live harmoniously with  stability and progress. Thank you.    [Noriega] The opportunity to reply now goes to PRI  candidate Mr. Ernesto Zedillo for five minutes. Please go  ahead, sir.    [Zedillo] Thank you very much. My fellow Mexicans, during  the past five years, our country has made enormous efforts to  overcome a very pressing financial crisis. We have done it in  order to set the foundations for future economic growth.  Neverthless, we must acknowledge that this process has been  very drawn-out. It has been a very difficult process. We are  only now starting to witness the first concrete results. I have  travelled throughout the country, and after campaigning for  barely one month I have already received more than 34,000  letters. The common feature of all these letters is people's  anguish over their lack of employment or lack of better wages.  That is why I am proposing a national agenda, starting from the  foundations we have already, to establish economic growth as the  first priority during the next few years. I recommend to do  this with a program based on trust, conviction, and investment  promotion to encourage the jobs you are all demanding. A  central feature in this strategy must be proposals related to  small and medium-sized businesses since they are responsible for  60 percent of the country's employment. It is in this sector  where Mexico's greatest export capacity lies. It is also because  of this that I propose a fiscal, credit, training, and  technology program to provide new incentives for small and  medium-sized businesses to encourage the jobs you are demanding.  Another issue very important for this agenda to address is  attention to the rural sector. Fortunately, we have already  carried out reforms to Article 27 of the Constitution which has  resulted in ending an era of oppression against Mexican farmers.  This reform explicitly establishes prohibitions on large  landholdings and will enable us to fulfill the dreams of liberty  and justice for which Zapata fought. That is why, beginning  from the aforementioned legal ground rule, I propose a policy of  dynamic investments in the rural sector. This policy will  include training for farmers, new technology, access to timely  credit and at fair prices, and guidelines that will enable them  to market their products. My fellow compatriots, I propose we  take advantage of our enormous national market and those foreign  markets which are now opening up to us as a result of  negotiations carried out by the government during the last few  years. These negotiations were intended to create and elicit  more employment. In addition, I propose that with the  motivation we will elicit as a result of technology and  training, we attempt to raise productivity. In turn,  productivity will guarantee better wages for all Mexicans. With  this new economic ability and more encouragement to save and  invest, we will have a dynamic economy that will reward the  efforts and sacrifices you have made during the last years to  overcome the crisis. I am convinced that the time has come to  pass from sound national finances - as Luis Donaldo [Colosio]  would say - to sound household finances. It is time the effects  of positive macro- economics be felt in the pockets and tables  of each Mexican farmer and worker. I would like to assure you,  my fellow compatriots, that all of this is possible and that we  can all do it together. Mexico can have one of the world's most  dynamic economies. This will be one of our greatest challenges  during the years to come. I am quite sure that we can  accomplish this as long as we set our sights on the future, as  long as we decide not to revert to old policies, and as long as  we remain willing not to experiment with what proved to be a  complete failure. My fellow Mexicans, the future is in our  hands. Let us all work together to make it happen.    [Noriega] PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos now has  the opportunity to reply. Please proceed, Mr. Fernandez. You  have five minutes.    [Fernandez] Thank you, Maite. Well, since we are here for a  debate I would have liked to focus my time on Mr. Zedillo  because of what he represents. Nonetheless, these minutes are  for you, Mr. Cardenas. On several occasions you have said that  Mexico's options lie between what the government offers and the  option for democracy that you represent. Using the facts, I  will establish that you do not represent a democratic option and  that moreover, you are a man who straddles both the opposition  and government sides.    Just look and see. Today, from the opposition, with  democratic inflexibility, you contend that the government must  remain on the sidelines of the election process. Yet you  proceeded to implement an election law in Michoacan where you  controlled the elections. I have a copy of the law right here.    Second, today you describe yourself in schools and  universities as a tolerant, pluralist man, respectful of the  younger generation, freedom of expression, and freedom to teach.  However, in 1985 during your term as Michoacan governor you  imposed Marxist-Leninist teachings. The text you imposed at the  time is right here, in case you wish to review it.    And you are not just that, sir. In addition to appearing  these days as a tolerant and respectful person -- and we might  even say a person that students like -- the one thing you never  mention to them is that you approved a law in Michoacan that  really violates dignity, not only of the students but of an  entire nation. I would like to read an article of the law  which, by the way, was signed by you and which I hope you  haven't forgetten. Just look for a minute at Article 101 of the  State Education Law, which reads as follows: Any teacher who  undertakes individual or collective activities that tend to  disrupt public order will be separated from the state  educational system. According to this law, all the youth  involved in the events of 1968 would thus be out of the national  education system. This is something you never mention to the  students.    Here is another concrete fact, sir. Today you criticize the  government -- and rightly so -- for deceitfully and illegally  transfering funds to the PRI. Yet you yourself transferred  funds to the PRI when you were governor of Michoacan. You have  already acknowledged this. I have a recording of you in case  you would like to hear it.    Last, you contend that you oppose the system of handpicking  [dedazo] and presidential authoritarianism. I would like to  demonstrate here, with documents, that you have indeed opposed  handpicking, but only when it does not favor you. I would like  to go back several years -- and Mr. Zedillo, please allow me to  review some history here. In 1974 you say that when Echeverria  appointed Mr. Torres Manzo to be presidential candidate through  the usual mechanisms, you made a public statement that the  government did not find amusing. Here is the proclamation.  However, years later you were elected governor of Michoacan.  When a friend of yours asked you how you were elected governor,  you replied: I expressed my interest to the president of the  republic, and I was finally advised that I was the candidate.    Mr. Cardenas, this is evidence that you are in both the  opposition and the government. I can understand your  presidential aspirations, and even your obsession with wanting  to become president, but we have gotten to know you as part of  both the opposition and the government. In this respect we do  not believe that you are the best option for Mexico.    In conclusion, I would like to tell you that if we Mexicans  are to believe your assertions that you represent the best  democratic option for Mexico, then we would have to believe  Aburto's claims that he is a pacifist. Thank you.    [Noriega] PRI candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, you now have  the floor for five minutes. Please proceed, sir.    [Cardenas] I have never and will never conceal what I am.  I acknowledge the events in which I have participated  throughout my life, and in this respect, there is nothing for  which I can reproach myself. I have been permanently involved  in a struggle for democracy, the country's improvement, and our  nation's sovereignty.    I want to say that the proposals we heard during the first  part of this block of time might sound pretty similar to those  who are listening to or watching us. But it seems that our  words do not always mean the same thing. We have strong  differences with the PRI and the PAN.    Regarding the PRI, I can say specifically that we cannot  believe them. We have no reason to believe either the official  party's candidate or the official party itself. They say one  thing and do another. We all know that 6 July 1988 was marked  by fraud and that this served as the basis for a government that  to this day -- something about which we can do nothing -- lacks  legitimacy. All candidates present here have spoken at one time  or another about clean elections. But we say that the 6 July  elections were the most fraudulent elections in the country's  history. At this point we should ask that when each of us  speaks about the upcoming elections, the PRI may be thinking  that the 21 August elections will be exactly the same as those  of 6 July 1988.    We also have differences with the PAN. One particular  difference led us to not only adopt different positions but also  to confront each other on our views of how to move toward  democracy. When we voted in 1989 on the constitutional reforms  of electoral issues, when the PAN voted with the PRI to take a  step backwards, to close off democratic opportunities, this led  to a confrontation between us. Nevertheless, I would like to  use this occasion to invite PAN to join efforts so we can make  our country move toward democracy -- to unite so that, in a  joint effort, PAN and the Party of the Democratic Revolution can  make a decisive contribution for a democratic change in our  country.    We cannot believe the government candidate. It seems like he  is just now noticing corruption, unemployment, and the many  things lacking in the country. He seems only now to notice that  government policies are a failure. He said this himself a few  minutes, a few moments ago. He admits the failure of government  policies due to all the backwardness these have caused the  country. Thus we have no reason to believe in the system, the  regime, which has been the greatest manufacturer of unemployment  in our country, which offered us 1 million jobs a year and has  barely been able to meet one-third of this goal. The government  offered us supported, sustained, and growing education; instead,  our educational system has seriously deteriorated. We cannot  believe those who offered us economic growth. Today we are  clearly bogged down. We must remember that the development plan  was prepared by Dr. Zedillo. By now we should have achieved 6  percent growth, by the end of the six-year period, and we are  barely at 0.4 percent growth. These policies -- the ones  offered by Dr. Zedillo -- cannot lead us to anything but six  more years of the same. Six years of stagnation, corruption,  contamination -- six years that would only mean a decline, an  abyss for the Mexican people.    [Noriega] Candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the  National Action Party, you have three minutes.    [Fernandez] Thank you. Mr. Cardenas, of course I am willing  to work with all those who want to work for democracy, but in a  serious manner, not only when it is advantageous or  circumstantially favorable. You did not rebut any charges, so I  will dedicate these minutes to Dr. Zedillo.    Dr. Zedillo, I want to tell you something that perhaps many  millions of Mexicans would like to say. According to the  information we have been given recently, we know you were a good  boy who got high grades. But you don't get a passing grade in  democracy. Let me tell you why. Allow me to make a comparison.  I am here because thousands of free men and women in the PAN  voted freely for my candidacy. You, with all due respect, are  here as a result of two tragedies. On the one hand, the death  of Colosio. On the other hand, the presidential designation.  You are not responsible for the first one, but the second one  disqualifies you. At least, if we are speaking of democracy.    On another topic, in what is left of my time -- your  strength  is economics. We know you are a good economist, and your most  outstanding participation in the government, some aspects of  which you mentioned, has been precisely in economic areas.  There the government has failed on fundamental issues.    As a political party we have tried to act honestly. We  recognize and are not ashamed to admit the things the government  has done right. That is the function of the honest opposition,  not to destroy everything or to question everything arbitrarily.  I do want to tell you that when we do find differences, we make  note of them.    For us, your national development plan accounts for 40  million poor; 40 million poor is the outcome of your national  development plan. Of course, there are some macroeconomic plans  that we have recognized, but the final outcome is not justified.  We hope you can tell us what happened to the projections you  made, as secretary, of the deficit in current accounts. You  made projections and failed repeatedly and for years by  thousands of millions of dollars. We hope that you can tell us,  if time permits, what happened to your growth projections of 6  percent for 1993. We are at least 15 times below that. And  regarding your plans and promises, I want to tell you that in  any event I will have to believe you 15 times less than what you  say. Thank you.    [Noriega] Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate of the Party of the  Democratic Revolution, you have three minutes.    [Cardenas] I am surprised by the democracy that the PAN  candidate sometimes preaches. I would think that we have to be  looking at the government front in Guanajuato, not Carlos  Medina, but Vicente Fox. In short, that is just something I  will leave for you to ponder.    I insist that we cannot believe the PRI candidate. The  judicial officials who engage in extortion, the inspectors who  accept bribes, the chiefs -- those who were hired to establish  cordons in Lomas Taurinas in Tijuana on 23 March -- all belong  to the PRI. Why should we believe the government candidate now  when he offers changes? The ruling party candidate has been an  outstanding official of this regime, although I would not say a  man of experience in good government because we have seen that  his passage through the government in reality has been failure,  failure in programming, failure in education.    But the important thing is what lies ahead. Why should we  believe the PRI candidate when the government is the principal  promoter of violence, the one that caused the Chiapas uprising,  the one clearly responsible for corruption which Dr. Zedillo now  recognizes? He now realizes, now that he is candidate, that  there is corruption in the government. This was not until now.  It took him quite a while to find out that there were flaws,  things wanting, inefficiencies, and corruption in the  government. Now we wants to correct it. He did not do this  when he was an official in charge of important government  positions. You, Dr. Zedillo, are the ones who generate  violence; who are responsible for corruption both inside and  outside the government; who have prevented the country from  growing, from having better living conditions, from having more  opportunities in education and culture, from making use of our  natural resources. You have led the country -- and I insist on  this -- to this economic stagnation, which has generated the  largest unemployment figures ever recorded in our history.    [Noriega] Ernesto Zedillo, PRI presidential candidate, you  have three minutes, sir.    [Zedillo] Thank you. First, I would very respectfully like  to ask the candidates not to seek political profit from the  murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio -- particularly you, Mr.  Cardenas. Throughout Luis Donaldo Colosio's campaign, you  frequently used your well-known verbal violence. I was  especially offended when on 10 December, in Hermosillo, Sonora,  you called Luis Donaldo Colosio a bad Mexican who was acting  against the national interest. Instead of trying to profit  politically from his image, you should apologize to Luis Donaldo  Colosio's family.    Mr. Cardenas has said that the proposals all sound alike.  That is true, because day by day his proposals become more and  more like those of the government. As Mr. Cardenas realizes  that his proposals are not welcomed by the Mexican people, he  has adopted the government's proposals for himself. The  question that arises now is: What would have happened if Mr.  Cardenas had won six years ago, which he did not, and we had  followed the economic policies he offered us? These were  political policies of government deficit, that ignored  inflation, allowed uncontrolled public spending, opened more  state enterprises with subsidies to be paid by the people.    My fellow Mexicans, the answer is very clear. Today the  country would be submerged in the deepest of poverties. Our  economy would be a shambles. This is why I insist on speaking  about the good things we have achieved, and there are plenty of  them, which are not the result of the government's efforts  alone, but of the efforts of the whole Mexican community. We  must recognize our faults. I do. I will be the first to do so.  We must move on, based on our strong points and our weak  points. We have everything we need for a growing economy. We  have the foundations, thanks to our sacrifice and our efforts.  I propose we begin growing again and use the profits of that  growth to fight poverty. I insist. Fighting poverty is our  greatest challenge, and I am sure that fighting and defeating  poverty will be the greatest achievement of our generation.    [Noriega] We have concluded the first part of our debate.  Now we would like to hear general proposals from each of the  candidates. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD presidential candidate, you  have five minutes, sir.    [Cardenas] The axis of our proposal is democratic change:  moving toward democracy by ending the current government party  regime. On the other hand, we have the recovery of a productive  economy. We must make one very important change. This will be  a radical change in our country: Start abiding by the law and  the constitution that the government systematically violates  every day in this country. If we abide by the law, we will have  a radically different country. We favor the separation of  powers, true federalism, autonomy of our municipalities, the  development of a system of freedom in our country.    We want to recover our economy by centering our efforts on  establishing economic policies and generating jobs. These are  the main challenges Mexico will face to effectively reactivate  our economy, as we move toward the end of the 20th century and  into the beginning of the 21st century.    We propose establishing an economy that takes people into  account, not like that of the current government, which has  disregarded Mexicans. We will begin an emergency plan that  focuses on job creation and the reactivation of the economy,  after launching an intense public works program that may lead  economic growth in our country.    Additionally, we will begin to prepare a plan for sustained  growth that we can implement beginning in 1996, that is, after  the first year of government. This will permit us to reactivate  and promote productive investments, as well as to finance our  development without going into debt. We will only spend what we  earn.    On the other hand, this plan will enable us to implement  profound fiscal reform, creating a fairer and simpler tax  system. This will permit us to end fiscal terrorism. We are  going to eliminate the 2 percent tax on company assets as well  as the harsh tax system.    But I didn't want to end this segment without raising other  concerns. The government continues to violate our laws  systematically. It continues to create dependency  relationships, appointing officials who earn high wages and who  are above the laws promulgated by the government.    Why did we create this national security coordinating board?  With this we place officials above the secretaries of  government, national defense, and the Navy. This is an offense  against our Armed Forces.    On the other hand, we see that the government is purchasing  water cannon vehicles. Is this to prepare for elections? Why  does this government want this equipment? Why is this equipment  being delivered to the Secretariat of National Defense? I  believe this equipment should never have entered the national  territory. In any case, it should have been delivered to  municipal and metropolitan police forces. Or does the  government want to pit the Armed Forces against the people?  Does the government once again want to pit society against the  members of our Army and Navy? This is the only explanation that  can be found for these policies: to continue pitting Mexicans  against Mexicans and not trying to resolve problems through  conciliation.    Let us agree on how to advance. Let us agree on how to  resolve problems. Let us all decide to walk together, those who  may agree or disagree -- the former carry more weight -- to  create democracy, to advance, to create a productive economy,  and to achieve social equality. Every day this government is  taking us farther away from social equality.    [Noriega] PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo, you have five  minutes.    [Zedillo] Thank you very much. I would like to use this time  to address a very important issue for all Mexicans. I am  referring to education, compatriots. Do you know education is  the key to individual, family, and national advancement? Do you  know the only real thing parents can leave to their children is  a good education? Even those less privileged Mexicans know this  very well.    A few days ago, a street boy, Jesus Crisantos, a boy who  does  not own anything, a boy who lives on the streets abandoned and  exposed to vice and criminality, told me: Candidate, what we  need most is education, because you know that when we grow up,  if we don't have education, we will not accomplish anything in  our lives.    If we have education, we will show the people who think the  kids in the streets are worthless that we are very valuable.  Even Crisantos, the street boy, has a clear idea about the  value of education.    Like all of you, I am convinced that we have to embark on a  huge crusade for national education in the next few years. I  had the very high honor of being the education secretary for  almost two years. With the Mexican teachers' support, I was  able to implement an educational reform program during this  period. This reform allowed us to decentralize education, out  of the hands of the federal government and into the hands of  local governments. It was a true act of federalism because we  took power, resources, and authority from the federal government  and gave them to local governments. We were able to accomplish  the first reform of lesson plans, programs, and material in 20  years. We also established a new promotion system for Mexican  teachers. Furthermore, we worked to reform Article 3 of the  Constitution and established for the first time in our country,  the right to education, compulsory education, and the  government's obligation to provide preschool education.    Although we accomplished all this, compatriots, we know  there  is still a lot to do in education. That is why I propose a  great crusade for national education. We must set ambitious  goals for the year 2000. I propose, compatriots, that we end  illiteracy. I propose, compatriots, that we guarantee that all  children of age attend grade school because, even today, 15  percent of our children do not enter grade school, and many  leave school before the sixth grade. I propose, compatriots,  that we make high school compulsory. I propose that we multiply  opportunities for training and technological education. I  propose, compatriots, that we give a big push to further  university studies at public universities and technology  institutes. We have to make sure that no boy with talent,  ability and desire be left without university studies. Let us  establish a national scholarship system for them. I propose,  compatriots, as a special task, that we take education to the  less privileged sectors in the country. Allow me to tell you  that it will not be enough to open a school with teachers to  achieve this objective. We have to take a big step and  establish assistance programs that will provide food to those  children so they can enter school and can remain there. It is a  big task, compatriots, but it will be worth it. It is a task  that we have to undertake for the future of our children. It is  a task that will cost money. But I am sure we will be able to  achieve this goal with the resources generated by our new  economic growth. I believe it is a worthwhile cause. The  country's best investment is in its people because they are the  foundation of our future. Thank you, compatriots.    [Noriega] PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos. Please,  you have five minutes.    [Fernandez] Thank you, Maite. I must respond to two charges.  First, Mr. Cardenas, in Guanajuato the election was won by PAN.  The post belonged to PAN. If we only managed to partially  correct the transgression, don't blame us -- that is all we were  able to do. We are not to be blamed for a fraud that was only  partially corrected. However, I would like to tell you that I  hope we can talk about electoral issues in the next debates, as  you have suggested. For the time being, I have documents here  with me, which I can present to you right now, on 23 cases in  Michoacan, where your party was the one that emerged victorious  and not as clearly as PAN's and Foxx's victory in Guanajuato. I  am at your disposal for any debate on the issue.    Second, Dr. Zedillo, I have done nothing that could lead you  to recommend that I not try to profit from Colosio's death. I  have been very respectful regarding this tragedy. I was appalled  at the crime and publicly expressed consternation. I only said  that this crime was one of the reasons you were here. However,  I also said that you were not responsible for it. I have not  profited from the insidious and cowardly crime against Colosio.    I now move on to the proposals. From the PAN's perspective,  it is not a matter of well-intended and demagogic recipes.  Mexico's problem is that the country needs to be rebuilt. The  country's reconstruction demands that all Mexicans make a big  effort to develop a clear vision -- from a truly humane point of  view -- of what Mexico is, with both its history, Dr. Zedillo,  and its present in mind so that we can further its future. It  is not a matter of inventing patches, recipes, or new programs  and projects; we already know where they end up. We need a  clear philosophy to run the country, we need democracy, and we  need money.    Allow me to list a few basic measures -- briefly, because  we only have a few minutes.    1. As president of the republic I will form a plural  government. This is fundamental. It will not be a partisan  government. A pluralist government is necessary if we want to  attain peace and harmony among Mexicans.    2. As president of the republic, Mr. Zedillo and Mr.  Cardenas, I will not be the head of a political party. I  believe I would be the first Mexican president not to be the  head of a political party.    3. I will respect and abide by the 20 agreements for  democracy, which a very broad-based group of very prominent  citizens from all across the nation have presented to the  presidential candidates. I adopted it as my own because it is  concurrent with the discourse and programs of the PAN, and  therefore, I endorse the commitment.    4. I will respect the federal authority of the states and  municipalities.    5. I will immediately increase by 100 percent the budget  allotments for every municipality. This is a clear and viable  offer. The allotments for each and every municipality in the  country will be increased 100 percent. Let no one tell me that  this is an unrealistic increase, because by removing just one  expense account from the president's hands, we can increase the  municipalities allotments 100 percent.    6. As part of a heroic national crusade for public security,  I would propose the creation of a national guard. That is  already included in the Constitution.    7. Regarding the administration of justice, I would propose  the creation of a general council, tasked with recomposing and  reorganizing this branch of government.    8. A national crusade is also urgent in education. We must  reevaluate the role of our teachers. We must not change the  secretary of education three and four times during the term, as  was the case in this presidential term. We must increase  spending and charge it to related items on the budget and to  contributions from the community, especially if implementing a  policy that would make such contributions tax deductible.    During the next administration we must achieve absolute  discipline and honesty in government spending. We must pursue  the fair, simple, clear, and permanent regulation of our  administrative and judicial laws to allow farming and small and  medium-size industry to flourish. Speaking of agriculture, our  farmers demand justice and money. As time is short, I can only  say that I will not allow a single case of land tenure or  squatting. Let me say that during my next turn I will address  financial openness. This is essential to prevent banking  oligopoly and to create millions of jobs that the country needs.  Thank you.    [Noriega] Ernesto Zedillo, PRI presidential candidate, you  have the floor for three minutes.    [Zedillo] Thank you. My fellow Mexicans, this time I would  like to continue on the issue of justice. One of the most  distressing problems worrying our people, our families, is the  lack of public security. We must admit that today the people do  not feel that the law is on their side. Every day we hear about  acts of violence, aggression against the honest and decent  citizens of our cities. Quite frankly we must accept that our  justice system leaves much to be desired. There are examples of  corruption in the police force, in the Attorney General's  Office, in the district attorney's offices, and there the  deficiencies in the administration of justice which are almost  commonplace.    One of the main proposals of the government I hope to lead  is  to completely reorganize our justice system. Such reform must  begin by reviewing of our laws. Let's face it -- in our country  there are still unjust laws. One clear example are the laws  that deprive our women of their equal rights. I have presented a  package of modifications to change that. I have also said that  the the executive branch should not monopolize the work of the  Attorney General's Office. I will promote the necessary reforms  to end that monopoly.    I will modify, in coordination with state governments as  part of our federal pact, the way in which police corps prepare,  operate, and function. I will sponsor reforms of the Judicial  Branch, undoubtedly to give it a greater autonomy; to give it  total independence from the Federal Executive Branch; but it  must also be a reform which guarantees that judges will be fair  and that they will always grant citizens their legal rights.  Fellow citizens, now is the time to launch that great legal  reform. I intend to make this one of the first points in our  government. It is true we must end corruption, impunity,  arbitrariness. Hence, the legal reform.    [Noriega] PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Zevallos has  three  minutes to speak.    [Fernandez] Thank you. Undoubtedly, financial opening is  necessary in this country. The government has committed a crime  by opening up Mexican borders to the competition of the farming  sector and the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise, while  protecting a banking oligopoly. This is not fair. This is a  crime that cannot continue.    We need to use internal and external savings to capitalize  the farm sector, as well as micro, small, and medium-sized  enterprises. We also need to get society involved in creating a  modern infrastructure. Just think of the railroads. They are  still Porfirio's after 100 years.    I will promote the immediate opening and pluralism of the  media, without insults or rancor toward anyone. You know who I  am talking about. We all have the need to have media sources  that are useful to society.    I would like to make one final reflection, ladies and  gentlemen. It is necessary that the government always maintain a  frank, sincere, and constructive dialogue with the whole  population. It is necessary for the government to call on the  population to work on Mexico's behalf. The government of the  republic must guarantee that there will not be harshness or  tolerance with regard to the law; there must simply be justice  and understanding so that all Mexicans can get along well.    I am determined to undertake, with your support, a federal  government, a presidency of the republic that will radiate  nobleness, dignity, and capacity to resolve problems. I am sure  this can be done with your support. It is necessary that, once  and for all, Mexicans have a government to support, a government  to trust, a government of which to make demands. It is not fair  once more that plans come and go, that once more they become  just literature gone with the wind. Today we demand a  commitment to the truth, and today the democratic choice is  indubitably National Action. This is the peaceful offer I will  talk about later. Thank you.    [Noriega] PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas will now speak  for three minutes.    [Cardenas] The PRI candidate has realized too late that  there  are corruption and deficiencies in the police forces, the  Attorney General's Office, and in the administration of justice.  We should ask ourselves: why does he realize this now? Above  all, why does he wait until now to report this? Why didn't he  do it when he was an official in the current administration? It  is now that he realizes many promises in the education sector --  he was secretary of education -- have not been fulfilled.  Acccording to the Constitution, elementary and secondary  education are mandatory. One-fourth of the children who should  go to elementary school do not. In secondary school, only 26 of  100 who first register are able to graduate. No effort was made  in this administration to meet the constitutional obligation of  making elementary and secondary education mandatory.    This government did not care much about improving conditions  for workers. Today, teachers earn in real terms less than half  -- 48 percent -- of what they earned in 1981. Why must we then  believe the progovernment candidate when he said he will now  begin to worry about education, that there will now be training  programs, that there will now be better and more schools for  Mexicans?    His administration incurred very heavy spending -- and he  says we have to invest in people. Well, sometimes investments  are made in people -- but only in some, and in very few.  Indeed, they invested in very few people to prepare and publish  the textbooks that many of our children still lack. The very  costly textbooks are still being stored in the Education  Secretariat, and we have yet to hear a public explanation about  why a contest was held, prizes given, printing expenses paid,  and the books then shelved when our children lack basic  textbooks in schools throughout the country.    What does the PRI candidate offer us? More of the same?  More lies? More unkept promises? I do not think this is what  the majority of Mexicans want. I think we want a reasonable and  just change.    [Noriega] PAN Candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, you  have  three minutes.    [Fernandez] To end?    [Noriega] No, sir, you have three minutes in this second  segment.    [Fernandez] In this second segment, I would like to insist  that today, more than ever, it is necessary to seek the votes of  all Mexicans, the votes that Mexico needs: the vote of  conscience, the vote of reason, the vote that will seek a better  future for us all. We cannot accept the vote of fear, that  accomplice fear that will allow everything to continue the same  -- to Mexico's detriment, should it happen. To continue the  same is to deteriorate. Nor can we accept the vote of rancor  and resentment, which comes with vengeance and violence. We  need the vote of harmony, the vote of peace. The National  Action Party candidate invites you to work together for a Mexico  free of lies.    We need to take advantage of this opportunity to rebuild the  entire country. We, the men and women of Mexico, need to make  an effort. Allow me to make a special call to youngsters. I  call the young people of this country to intervene seriously and  in depth, without lies, without pranks, without cowardice. All  Mexicans have to step in, but there is a bounty, an endowment,  an incalculable treasure in the women of Mexico. I believe that  women can, if they decide to do so, change Mexico on 21 August.  They can change, on 21 August, the course of a country that  will only improve with the work of all its children. I ask  young people and women to decide for an honest, peaceful,  pluralist, civilized change.    We need to include everybody in this effort. PAN's political  offer is pluralist and democratic. Dr. Zedillo said a few days  ago that he will not form a pluralist government. This is  tragic. These days anybody who understands the signs of the  times has to present a broad range of views in the new  government to be formed. This new pluralist government will be  formed by the PAN candidate when he assumes the presidency. It  will have more participation by the people, because only thus  can we all work together to make this great effort to save  Mexico from the tragedy that is so close at hand. We need to  achieve change. We will surely achieve it because Mexico has a  great future that cannot be lost.    [Noriega] PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, you have three  minutes, please.    [Cardenas] I don't know how the PAN candidate can call on  all  Mexicans to join him and change the country when he has shown  such clear contempt for so many Mexicans. I only want to recall  that on more than one occasion, he called one group of Mexicans,  who with reason were demanding housing because they lacked it,  riffraff [descalzonados]. I don't understand a candidate who  addresses his compatriots in search of votes and then talks  about them in such terms.    This Sunday, the most recent one, the PRI candidate met with  taxi drivers. It was a good meeting, according to the media.  They offered the PRI candidate a beer, and he accepted.  However, he said they had to put it in a glass so that it would  look like cider. I ask you here: Does the PRI candidate want to  give us beer for cider and cider for beer? Is this the offer of  Dr. Zedillo, the current candidate of the official party, who  has so many university degrees and so many academic merits,  about which he boasts so much? Is this the type of government  he wants to give the Mexicans? A government, I insist, in which  he will give us cider for beer and beer for cider?    I also want to consider the people with whom the PRI  candidate will govern. Who is backing him? We have seen  pronouncements paid for by government officials, who say they  used their own money -- maybe, maybe not. But he is supported  by the people responsible for past six-year periods. Let us  recall the statement that journalists called the Dinosaurs  Manifesto. This is what the PRI candidate offers us: a return  to corruption, populist practices, and a return to those -- they  are the ones who support him -- who are mainly responsible for  the deteriorated, disastrous economic, social, and political  situation in which we now live.    I end and insist, cider for beer and beer for cider, is this  the PRI candidate's offer?    [Noriega] PRD candidate Ernesto Zedillo, you have three  minutes.    [Zedillo] Thank you. Half truths are but half lies. It is  not right to lie to the people, even if only a little bit. Lies  and verbal violence will only divide Mexicans and damage our  social peace. Just now, when Engineer Cardenas referred to  education issues, he only said a small part of the truth, and in  doing so, he told a big lie. Engineer Cardenas, the balance you  have made of the current government's education effort is not  true. Perhaps, your advisers, with very bad intentions, did not  give you the correct information.    During the current government, spending on education, in  real  terms, increased 100 percent. Most of this increase was  allotted to increase Mexican teachers' wages. It's true --  there is still a lot to be done and this is my commitment.    You also did not tell the exact truth when you talked about  the books in storage. It is true there was a contest, but in  the end the panel of judges decided that those books should not  be printed and they were not. There are no books on shelves, as  you said. So, please, tell the whole truth.    I want to use the rest of my time in this segment,  compatriots, to talk about democracy. I want to attest to you  that my personal commitment, my commitment as a Mexican, is to  further democracy in our fatherland. I want to assure you,  compatriots, that we want more than your vote on 21 August. We  want legality, credibility, and legitimacy. I am convinced that  thanks to the electoral reforms made during the past years,  Mexicans will have an electoral system that will totally  guarantee the effectiveness of their vote. I do trust the  almost 2 million Mexicans who will participate in the  preparation and implementation of those elections. Out of those  almost 2 million Mexicans, only a few belong to my party. Thus,  let us have confidence. The next elections will be clean.    [Noriega] Now each of the candidates will deliver his  final message. You will have three minutes to do this. PRD  candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, we will start with you now.    [Cardenas] I call on all of you, the Mexicans, to win the  right to build our democracy. I will form a government with the  best Mexican men and women, a government that will not just  belong to the PRD, but one that will include all those who have  actively participated in the democratic movement -- people in  private organizations; in business, banking, and commerce; and  people who are now in universities -- to have the pluralist  government our country needs to be able to move into democracy.    I am going to call for -- this is a promise, and I have to  say it in the singular -- I am going to initiate efforts so we  can call a national referendum to reform our Constitution. We  have to make ample reforms to our Constitution so we can have a  constituent assembly in 1997. This body will prepare the new  Constitution that is to include our aspirations and, based on  this constitutional framework, find solutions to the country's  needs and problems.    The next government will not be a government in which the  PRD  will replace the PRI. We do not want any more government  parties. Thus, my party, in this case, will not be the one to  replace the current government party. Let us have confidence in  the vote and in the next elections, despite the conditions in  which they are taking place. Let us remember that changes  thought to be impossible -- Mandela is president of South Africa  now and the opposition has won in Panama -- are today a reality.  Let us have confidence in ourselves. Let us go into these  elections with faith, drive, and a lot of votes. Our votes will  decide the future of our country in the latter part of the 21st  century.    I pledge to you that I will respect the electoral results  and  will make them be respected. We want independent management.  We want Carlos Salinas to promise that he will not interfere in  this election. We want Carlos Salinas to promise that the 21  August elections will not be the same as the 6 July elections.  I have confidence in the support of my compatriots. I have  confidence that, together with you, I will be forming the next  government and that this government will be the one to establish  and develop democracy in our country.    [Noriega] Thank you, sir. PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo, it  is your turn.    [Zedillo] Compatriots, I thank you sincerely for your  attention. Messrs. candidates, I thank you for accepting this  invitation. I invite you to meet and debate again. I invite  you to debate, but now to include the other candidates too. As  I have said from the beginning and throughout my campaign, we  should have the opportunity to compare our ideas with those of  all the candidates. Thus, I invite you to join me in a debate  that will include all the candidates.    For my part, compatriots, I will continue my political  campaign tomorrow. I will do so intensely and will continue to  talk to all the Mexican men and women, especially those who have  less. I will do this because I aspire to be president of the  republic. And I aspire to be president of the republic,  compatriots, to work with you in building the Mexico we all  want. I propose, compatriots, that we work together to further  an economy that will generate the jobs and wages you are  demanding.    I propose that we work together on reorganizing and  installing a system of justice capable of ending insecurity,  violence, and aggression against our citizens. I propose,  fellow Mexicans, that we launch an offensive against poverty. I  propose, fellow Mexicans, that we remember the poor peasants,  our Indian brothers, the elderly, and the handicapped when we  wage our battle on poverty. I propose, fellow Mexicans, that we  make equality for women a reality in law. I propose, fellow  Mexicans, that we work together.    [Noriega] Your time is up, sir.    [Zedillo] You only gave me two minutes.    [Noriega] Very well.    [Zedillo] I apologize, the moderator made a mistake. I will  take one minute to close. Excuse me.    I propose, fellow Mexicans, that we work together during the  coming years to build that future of progress for our children.  I ask you not to hesitate and to vote on 21 August. Go and  vote with the assurance that your vote will be respected. I ask  you to think of your children's future and your family's future  when you cast your vote. Thank you.    [Noriega] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential  candidate for the PAN.    [Fernandez] According to the rules of this debate, I cannot  respond forcefully during this last speech, because Mr. Cardenas  cannot answer. All I want to say, Mr. Cardenas, is that your  accusation is unfair. I did not call those poor people who were  demanding housing riffraff. I called the leaders who agitate  them and never show their faces riffraff. Please read PROCESO  and journalist (Galarza), a professional journalist, and you  will find the text of what I said then and am reaffirming now.  I did not call them that, and I cannot accept your accusation.    To conclude, the PAN has been struggling for democracy for  54  years. It has been struggling for 54 years so that Mexico may  live in a state of law, and we are going to make it in the next  administration. We have also been fighting for a more humane  economy, so we can all live with dignity, jobs, justice, and law  for all, thus guaranteeing that dignified, safe, and sufficient  lifestyle for all Mexican families.    In closing, I wish to say that if I have not failed you now  that I am a candidate, I will not fail you as president. I need  your support on 21 August, but I will need greater support from  you for the six years following that, because I can only be a  good president for Mexico with your help.    [Noriega] Thank you sir. We thank all the candidates for  their participation in this debate. My apologies again to Mr.  Zedillo. On behalf of the National Chamber of Radio and  Television broadcasters, we hope this event will serve to  enlighten and unify all Mexicans. Good night.</p>

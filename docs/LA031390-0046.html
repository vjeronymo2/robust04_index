			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: THIS WAS A LONG SHOT FOR MATER DEI GUARD QUINN  </P> <P> Trailing Long Beach Poly by two points late in the Southern California Regional  Division I championship game Friday, Jason Quinn of Mater Dei took a shot that  he hadn't intended to take and didn't believe he could make.  </P> <P> Dribbling around the perimeter with fewer than 10 seconds remaining, Quinn  couldn't get a pass to David Boyle or Andy Karich, so he tried to get his  defender, Rod Hannibal, to foul him as he attempted a shot near the baseline.  </P> <P> "The play never really got set up as planned, so it was really kind of  helter-skelter," said Quinn, The Times' Athlete of the Week. "When I felt  contact, I just threw it up."  </P> <P> Simply explained. But the significance of Quinn's three-point basket that gave  the Monarchs a 46-45 victory and sent them to the state championship game goes  far beyond simple. Just ask Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight.  </P> <P> "It will go down in the history of Mater Dei as 'The Shot,' " McKnight said.  "That's all we will call it. He double-pumped and side-stepped him and just  threw it up with two hands."  </P> <P> Quinn, a point guard, rarely scores much in Mater Dei's balanced offense. He  averaged about six points during the regular season and led the team with 6.7  assists.  </P> <P> "I usually get one or two shots a game," Quinn said. "It depends on what  presents itself."  </P> <P> But against Poly he scored eight points in the final 2 minutes 36 seconds,  including the Monarchs' last six of the game. With 36 seconds remaining, Quinn  hit a three-pointer that cut Poly's lead to 44-43.  </P> <P> "He's had some real clutch games," McKnight said. "He had 18 in our semifinal  win over Ocean View (in the Tournament of Champions). He's hit some big  three-pointers for us too.  </P> <P> But none as big as "The Shot," a basket that still seems improbable to Quinn  after watching a tape of the game on cable television Sunday.  </P> <P> "I've watched it three or four times times today," Quinn said. "I still can't  believe it."  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Doug Cunningham of Huntington Beach was named most valuable player of the  Orange County Volleyball Championships after recording 11 kills in the Oilers'  16-14, 15-13 victory Saturday over El Toro.  </P> <P> Kent Dowding of Orange Lutheran pitched a no-hitter and struck out 14 as the  Lancers defeated Serra, 12-0, in the first game of a doubleheader Saturday. He  had a home run and four RBIs in the second game.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jason Quinn  </P> <P> Mater Dei High School  </P> <P> * Position: Guard  </P> <P> * Height, Weight, Class: 5-11, 190, Senior  </P> <P> * Last Week: Quinn made two three-point shots in the last minute, including a  desperation shot with 1.8 seconds remaining in Mater Dei's 46-45 victory over  Long Beach Poly Friday in the Southern California Regional Division I boys'  basketball championship.  </P> <P> * Season: Quinn averaged six points and seven assists.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- A political decision to  freeze planned hikes in public service charges must be followed,  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Friday [20 May], brushing  off opposition by bureaucrats.    Fujii said he highly evaluated the "political decision by  Prime Minister (Tsutomu) Hata," and the ministry will review  requested hikes in nonlife insurance premiums in line with the  freeze, Fujii told a news conference after a morning cabinet  meeting. His comments came after Finance Ministry bureaucrats  led by Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito criticized the premier's  decision.    Saito told reporters Thursday that he was dissatisfied with  the decision to freeze all applied-for hikes in public service  charges, including highway tolls, taxi fares and telephone  rates. Saito's remarks made headlines in many newspapers, with  one daily calling it a "coup" bid by bureaucrats.    Fujii said he has not heard of such comments. "I understand  that the vice minister just said that we must follow cabinet  decisions."    The plan announced Wednesday to freeze hikes this year was  endorsed at the morning cabinet meeting. Hikes applied for in  government-controlled charges include telephone fees, public  housing rents, highway tolls, and fire and marine insurance  premiums.    As for requested increases in nonlife insurance premiums  which the finance minister controls, Saito said the minister  would review applications to see whether the freeze is possible.  But if found difficult, he suggested the ministry would seek  exemption.    Fujii said, "we must go over to promote streamlining" of  nonlife insurance firms.    Saito said the requests for premium hikes were made to  "maintain a sound insurance system." Casualty insurance firms  were in a pinch because of increased payouts on disaster and  other cases, he said.    In their separate statements, Fujii and Saito shared the  view  that the freeze is not related to the coming tax reform, in  contrast with the prime minister's comments on such a link.    After making his decision on the rate hike freeze, Hata said  it would pave the way for winning public support on tax  increases to offset income tax cuts.    Concerning the possibility of even greater hikes in public  service charges after the freeze ends, both Fujii and Saito said  that streamlining is necessary to avoid placing such a burden on  consumers. But Fujii welcomed the decision taken at a time when  the economy "is in a crucial stage" with both good and bad signs.    "We must now steadily implement the February stimulus  package  and the fiscal 1994 budget" to spread the recent improvements,  Fujii said, noting that long-delayed Diet deliberations on the  budget are set to begin.    "If the economy starts picking up and enters a stable growth  phase, later fee hikes will be absorbed eventually," he added.</p>

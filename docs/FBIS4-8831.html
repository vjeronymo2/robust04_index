			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Petya Vladimirova: "Parliament Holds Key"] </F>   [Text] In addition to being a test for our medicine, the  new illness of our prime minister will also be a test for the  Bulgarian politicians. More precisely, it will provide the last  opportunity to assess their real stature. It will highlight  their sense of responsibility toward the state in the near  future. It will clearly show their concern for our national  fate, regardless of their verbal declarations and oaths. Their  morals will become obvious and we will finally see whether they  still have a certain responsibility to "the voters," or whether  they have really sunk in the mire of their insurmountable  selfishness and corporate-party greed.    If the suspicion about Professor Berov's illness is  confirmed, it would mean that he will be absent for at least six  months. This means that our state will find itself in the  paradoxical situation in which it is led by a government without  a leader, who is the only one authorized to adopt strategic  decisions. The reshuffle planned for a long time by the  Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and the other parliamentary  groups will fail to materialize. Indeed, the differences in the  concealed goals of those parliamentary groups are so great that  even if the prime minister was healthy this reshuffle could not  have been carried out without the powerful partner from the left  making his preferences known.    The reshuffle will fail to materialize because it is immoral  to pressurize a sick prime minister to "repair" his cabinet  under the dictation of politicians who are pursuing their own or  their parties' interests. However, according to Ahmed Dogan,  the "prime minister had the willingness to rule," and it is  expected of him that he will show this willingness by accepting  the ideas of personnel changes that will be submitted to him  while he lies in his hospital bed. The BSP intends to discuss  the situation. One should not wonder if the new situation that  emerged would serve the BSP better than the situation of having  a healthy prime minister. This way his deputy, Matinchev, will  remain as acting prime minister very conveniently for a long  period of time. On 13 April he clearly stated that Professor  Berov should rest, and that he should leave the governing to him  and his colleagues. Since the Constitution does not provide a  solution, what Matinchev said could become Bulgaria's reality in  the next few months.    If our politicians have preserved in themselves at least a  small measure of responsibility and statesmanship the parliament  should pass a vote of no-confidence in the cabinet because of  the new circumstances rather than providing it with the straw of  the international agreements, used to justify its staying in  power.    If Prime Minister Berov is really concerned with the  efficient ruling of the country, he must resign and thus prove  that he is the master of his own will.    The rest is merely irresponsibility at the expense of the  people.</p>

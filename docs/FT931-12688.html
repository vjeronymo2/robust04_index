			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Fuzzy future of American TV: The Big Three television networks are facing a prolonged period of change Larry Tisch and David Letterman made for rather an odd couple - perched alongside one another recently on director's chairs in a room on the 19th floor of 'Black Rock', the Manhattan headquarters of CBS Television. Mr Tisch, the diminutive billionaire investor who controls CBS, was informing the world that he had just poached Mr Letterman, the tall, sandy-haired comedian and chat show host, from rival NBC for a salary reported to be about Dollars 14m a year. In doing so he won a high stakes battle between two of America's four national networks. The competition between CBS, which under Mr Tisch has strengthened its management and become the top-rated network in terms of audience share, and NBC, which has fallen into the ratings cellar and seen its profitability tumble, comes at a critical time for the networks. Recession and declining advertising revenues have taken a toll over the past two years. Cost-cutting has become the new religion as the industry undergoes a bout of soul-searching, strategic rethinking and management reshuffling. The growth of the cable television industry, as well as that of Mr Rupert Murdoch's profitable and expanding Fox network, have also combined to pose a new threat to the traditional Big Three networks - ABC, CBS and NBC. A decade ago the networks held 85 per cent of the market of 93m television-watching American homes. Today that share has dropped to little more than 61 per cent, largely because of inroads made by cable television and Fox. Mr David Weston, a senior vice-president and general counsel at ABC Television, says his superiors at Capital Cities, the media company that owns ABC, 'have a deep concern that we need to realign our cost structure. One cannot spend the same amount of money on a third of a market that reaches 60 per cent of US homes as one did on a market that captured nearly 90 per cent of the viewers.' The American television industry is at a crossroads, according to Mr Weston, who says that the current uncertainty stems from the fact that the networks have been slow to react to the growth of cable. That the industry is in the middle of profound change is evident from estimates of operating profits of Dollars 200m made last year by Time Warner's Home Box Office (HBO) cable programming subsidiary - more than any single network earned. HBO is in a partnership with ABC to develop new programming for the network's lacklustre Saturday evening line-up, something that might have been unthinkable a few years ago, when the networks viewed cable as the enemy. Mr Michael Fuchs, chairman of HBO, has presided over a steady average profits growth of 10 per cent a year for the past eight years. HBO is no longer just a cable programmer; it has diversified and is now among the biggest outside suppliers of shows for Fox. But Mr Fuchs says that while he foresees an increasing number of alliances between the networks and cable, even more radical change is on the horizon. 'At the end of this decade it's not going to be cable and broadcast any more - it's going to be television. It is not even inconceivable that a cable company might own a network,' he predicts. Clearly the old structure of American television is breaking down. The ownership of all three networks has changed hands since 1986 and the need to share costs has led to co-operative programming ventures involving cable, networks and Hollywood studios. The current turmoil, which was partly driven by a decline in advertising revenues in 1990-91 and partly by the view of network executives that they must change their target audiences to compete with cable, has manifest itself differently at each network. CBS experienced a slump in morale a few years ago amid harsh staff cuts on the news side and made a Dollars 405m loss in 1991 when it spent too much on sporting events. But the new management installed by Mr Tisch has received plaudits for its successful new programming, and is estimated to have turned a small profit in 1992. Ms Jessica Reif, entertainment analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co, the New York investment bank, says that hiring Mr Letterman for the late night-slot could prove a highly lucrative move, taking viewers from NBC's popular Tonight Show and thus worsening NBC's position as the network with the lowest audience share. NBC's management is the most widely criticised in recent television history. Observers fault its senior executives, who include Mr Robert Wright, the network president who came from General Electric, the company that owns NBC and is widely believed in the industry to be willing to sell it if the right buyer offers Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn. Mr Wright's background includes years in the plastics business; his most recent job was running GE's financial services business. 'The GE people are deal-makers who know about widgets, but they are not very good at managing creative talent,' according to a senior executive at a rival network who asked not to be named. Mr Wright could not be reached for comment. The picture at ABC, which is presently offering buy-outs to many executives as part of its cost-cutting programme, is somewhat better. The network, which has the second highest prime-time ratings, is generally deemed by Wall Street analysts to be the best-run of the Big Three. Ms Reif of Oppenheimer is forecasting a 1992 operating profit for ABC of Dollars 114m, the highest of any network. The financial position of the Big Three has been further complicated by Fox, which has come a long way since it was launched six years ago by Mr Barry Diller, who resigned last year as Mr Murdoch took over day-to-day operations as chief executive of both the Hollywood studio and the television network. Observers have been puzzled by a string of recent executive departures and reshuffles at Fox, but Mr Murdoch insists there was no turmoil at the network and says that some of the personnel changes had been planned before Mr Diller's departure. Mr Murdoch, who says Fox's revenues in the year to next June will rise to more than Dollars 600m from Dollars 440m last year, praises the bigger networks for 'stringent' cost reductions. He seeks, however, to distinguish his own attitude toward the cable industry from that of other networks by saying his rivals have considered cable the enemy, whereas Fox wants 'to be friendly with them'. In fairness, Fox is not the only network with links to cable. ABC owns 80 per cent of ESPN, the lucrative cable sports channel, and has other cable interests. And NBC has CNBC, a cable financial news channel. The growth of cable over the past year has slowed, however, and newly approved federal legislation could help the networks by forcing cable operators to pay local stations for the right to carry their signals. The networks could also gain when the Federal Communications Commission finally responds this spring to a recent court order requiring that it clarify the muddled financial-syndication (fin-syn) rules that ban networks from moving into the syndication market and other areas. 'The networks are likely to be less regulated, even unshackled,' predicts Ms Reif. She adds that in the near term networks should also benefit from the US economic recovery and signs of a modest improvement in advertising. Mr Weston of ABC says it is unrealistic to expect any of the Big Three to achieve double-digit growth in advertising revenues again. The exception is Fox, which has prospered as a start-up operation with new programming that includes comedies and tabloid shows which have more appeal to young viewers than more standard network fare. In broader terms, the likely future of US television could be radically different in as little as five years. Digital compression technology means that cable operators such as Tele-Communications Inc, the nation's biggest, could offer 500 channels of programming within two or three years. The implication of the continued proliferation of viewer choice is more cost-sharing, joint ventures and perhaps even mergers between cable and network television companies. The only certainty in American television, therefore, is the prospect of change.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US TELEVISION NETWORKS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dlrs m           1991                 1992 est           1993 est          Operating   Revenue   Operating   Revenue   Operating  Revenue        profit/loss                profit                profit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ABC            135     2,636         114     2,520         140    2,655 CBS           -405     2,366          17     2,739         160    2,675 NBC*           -50     2,530          50     2,698         n/a    2,300 Fox**           50       424          55       440          80      615  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  * Analysts' estimates: General Electric does not break down NBC figures ** Fox Broadcasting's fiscal year ends June 30.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Oppenheimer &amp; Company; Sanford Bernstein &amp; Company; and industrial estimates.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

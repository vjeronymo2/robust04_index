			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> GIRLS' 4-A CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> CAPISTRANO VALLEY BREAKS AWAY TO TAKE TITLE  </P> <P> With the score tied and 2 minutes remaining in overtime, Capistrano Valley High  School forward Becky Linhart did what no other player could manage Friday night  at Gahr High School.  </P> <P> She reached another peak in her already peaked performance.  </P> <P> In what may have been the greatest breakaway of the season, Linhart dribbled  past four defenders and slammed home the final goal that gave Capistrano Valley  a 4-3 victory over Simi Valley in the Southern Section 4-A girls' soccer title  match.  </P> <P> "All I knew is that we had 2 minutes left and we had to do it," said Linhart,  who also scored one goal in regulation. "It was either now or never."  </P> <P> With the match quickly coming to a close, the reality of a co-championship --  awarded to teams which tie in a championship match -- drew near.  </P> <P> To some, this might have seemed an appropriate outcome. After all, both teams  played spectacular soccer, forcing each other to a higher level after each goal  was scored. And one by one, players on both sides were dropping with injuries  and drooping with fatigue.  </P> <P> "One thing I told the girls (before) overtime is we didn't come here for a  tie," Cougar Coach Steve Bignal said. "They knew they could leave here  champions."  </P> <P> The Cougars responded with authority. Although Simi Valley had outshot  Capistrano Valley, 18-9, during regulation, it was the Cougars who got their  offense going when it got tough, outshooting Simi Valley, 8-4, in the 20-minute  overtime period.  </P> <P> Monica Larrson managed the first shot just 25 seconds into the period,  rebounding less than a minute later with a dangerous breakaway attempt that was  blocked by Simi Valley defenders. The Cougars closed in repeatedly, with  Gretchen Fleischli firing a strong attempt from 30 yards out.  </P> <P> Although Simi Valley goalkeeper Kim Duran caught Fleischli's shot, the Cougars  did not let down. Seconds later, Larrson zipped downfield toward what appeared  to be a clean breakaway goal in the making, but, just 10 yards before the goal,  Larrson was tackled by a defender and no foul was called.  </P> <P> Simi Valley began to respond, firing six consecutive shots on goal. But a  moment later, Linhart made her scoring breakaway and the Cougars had the title.  </P> <P> "We played such a good game," Simi Valley Coach Mark Johnson said. "Oh, it's  hard to lose after playing so well."  </P> <P> Simi Valley, which had upset three-time defending Mission Viejo and top-seeded  Esperanza en route to Friday's championship match, played especially well in  the first half. The Pioneers (24-3-2) kept the Cougars out of their favored  precise-passing game. But Simi Valley's most dangerous weapon proved to be the  throw-ins of senior halfback Stephanie Gainer, which led to goals -- one by  Gina Skinner and a second by Kim Taketa, who tied the score, 3-3.  </P> <P> Ginger Frank and Cindy Attaway scored the other goals for Capistrano Valley,  which finished its season 22-4-1.  </P></p>

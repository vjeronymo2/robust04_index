			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / GA losses increase by 40% to Pounds 172m RECESSION and crime-related losses pushed General Accident, the Perth-based composite (general and life) insurer, deeper into loss last year. The company, the third big insurer to report a deficit for 1991, posted pre-tax losses of Pounds 171.6m, up by more than 40 per cent on the Pounds 121.3m registered in 1990. The losses emerged in spite of the fact that GA lost market share rather than keep rates low. UK premium income fell marginally to Pounds 1.17bn for the previous year. However, GA displayed confidence about its underlying financial strength and the prospects of recovery this year by maintaining its dividend at 26.75p. Like its competitors, GA suffered increased underwriting losses in the UK of Pounds 341.9m against Pounds 230.9m for 1990. Although GA has only a 4 per cent share of the mortgage indemnity market (insuring mortgage lenders for losses on sales of repossessed properties) losses amounted to Pounds 45m. Arson and theft claims were also higher, contributing to a rise in commercial property losses to Pounds 75.6m from Pounds 65.7m in 1990. Reserves for liability claims in the UK were strengthened by about Pounds 30m. Worldwide underwriting losses of Pounds 569.1m, compared with Pounds 461.7m for the previous year, were offset by investment income of Pounds 448.8m, up from Pounds 429.9m, and life profits Pounds 27m, up from Pounds 25.2m. Estate agency losses were Pounds 17.8m compared with Pounds 23.3m. Losses at NZI Bank amounted to Pounds 0.8m, from Pounds 6.3m. Interest on loans totalled Pounds 59.7m compared with Pounds 85.1m. Reflecting on the increased loss on private and fleet motor business of Pounds 113.9m, up from Pounds 76.5m, Mr Bob Scott, general manager (UK), said: 'The turnround has been much slower than anticipated. You would have thought the increases would have shown through by now.' GA said it had plans to increase the scope of its GA 121 operation which sells insurance via a combination of mass media marketing and telephone sales. GA 121 insures 15 per cent of GA's motor policyholders and is to begin sales of home insurance later this year. Mr Scott said that staff at GA 121's offices in Glasgow and Hamilton would be increased this year by between 75 and 100 people, up from the 150 employed at the end of last year. Lex, Page 18</p>

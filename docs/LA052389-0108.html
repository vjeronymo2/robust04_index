			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST PATIENT UNDERGOES GENE INSERTION IN CANCER TREATMENT  </P> <P> Genetically engineered cells were injected into a human patient for the first  time Monday, in a federally approved experiment designed to enhance an already  novel cancer therapy.  </P> <P> This first round of gene transfer experiments, in which a gene was inserted  into a patient's white blood cells, is not expected to directly benefit an  individual patient. Instead, the inserted gene is being used to track the  movement in the body of the cancer-fighting white blood cells.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the technique of "gene insertion (could) produce therapeutic  results in a wide range of diseases," National Institutes of Health Director  James B. Wyngaarden said in a statement.  </P> <P> Monday's experiment was designed to track special, laboratory-grown white blood  cells known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The TILs in turn attack  the cancer.  </P> <P> Using gene transfer technology developed by W. French Anderson of the National  Heart Lung and Blood Institute and the National Cancer Institute's R. Michael  Blaese, the NIH team inserted into the TIL cells a bacterial gene that  inactivates the drug neomycin. This will allow them to track the cells in the  patients.  </P> <P> The bacterial gene acts as a marker for the affected cells, giving them the  ability to resist a version of neomycin, called G418, that poisons human cells.  The researchers can then routinely take blood samples and biopsies from the  patients and either treat the white blood cells with G418 to kill all but the  genetically changed TIL cells or probe the DNA of white blood cells to find the  genetic marker.  </P> <P> Inserting human genes to repair defects may one day help with a host of  inherited disorders, including cystic fibrosis or Duchenne's muscular  dystrophy. Gene insertion might also help brain disorders such as Alzheimer's  disease or other illnesses, such as growth disorders, heart disease caused by  alterations in the way cholesterol is metabolized and defects of the immune  system.  </P></p>

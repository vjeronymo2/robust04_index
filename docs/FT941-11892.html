			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Unions postpone protest over pay Union leaders representing Britain's 5.8m public-sector workers decided yesterday to hold back from calling any protest action against the government's three-year freeze on the pay bill. Instead, they are to wait for the results of the public pay review body reports, which are due shortly, and the government's response to them. Union leaders warned that support exists in principle for the calling of a day of action to highlight threats to public services and jobs. A private opinion poll commissioned by the Trades Union Congress found there was substantial support among both private-sector and public-sector workers for some form of protest. 'The form a 'public-sector day' will take and the most appropriate timing will be the subject of further discussion between unions,' the TUC said in a statement. Union leaders, however, dropped the idea of a day of action on April 11. The TUC added that it was clear that the pay policy, tax rises, market-testing and contracting-out were 'likely to lead to industrial action'.</p>

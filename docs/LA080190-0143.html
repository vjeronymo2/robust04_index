			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DISPLACED WORKERS AID SOUGHT  </P> <P> The government should give special help to workers who lose their jobs because  of policies on clean air, protecting the spotted owl and cutting defense,  lawmakers said today.  </P> <P> "As important as it is to reduce defense expenditures and to increase our drive  to protect the natural environment, it is also important that we make every  effort not to do so at the expense of American workers and their families,"  said Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland).  </P> <P> Stark, who spoke before the House Ways and Means human resources subcommittee,  is co-sponsor with Rep. Thomas J. Downey (D-N.Y.) of a proposal to provide cash  benefits to workers who lose their jobs due to new environmental or military  spending policies.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration opposes the legislation, saying that unemployment  benefits should be the same for everyone.  </P></p>

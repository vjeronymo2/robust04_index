			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: New issues return to old basics / Examining the recent falling interest in flotations The new issue market has gone off the boil over the last month and judging by the reception to some of this week's debutantes it is cooling rapidly. Healthcall and Lombard Insurance were both forced to cut their flotation price by more than 10 per cent this week as institutions showed symptoms of new issue indigestion. Private investors look equally sated. The offer of shares in the International Biotechnology Trust, backed by the heavyweight team of Rothschild Asset Management and Robert Fleming, attracted just Pounds 2.67m. In total it raised only Pounds 37.8m, compared with the target of Pounds 100m. Yet few significant issues have been pulled, though one large demerger is said to have been put on hold, and the pipeline is full of new hopefuls. 'There is a whole pack to get through before the summer and they are queueing up round the block for the autumn,' said one adviser. 'If they all come, prices are going to come under a lot of pressure.' That pressure was seen clearly with Redrow, Britain's biggest private housebuilder, whose issue size was scaled back and the price cut by more than 20 per cent. The House of Fraser price was also trimmed and the heavily-promoted issue was only twice subscribed. Mr Christopher Knight, who handled Healthcall's flotation at Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, blames the volume of new issues over the last few months. 'That inevitably leads to new issue fatigue among investors who are now being rather more sceptical.' Yet in many cases prices are holding up. Vymura, the wallcoverings group, was priced this week at exactly the level planned when the flotation was announced six weeks ago. Mr David Simpson, a director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Vymura's sponsor, said: 'There is still an appetite for quality new issues but the market is now pretty price sensitive. The key is not to over price in the first place.' He points to the disappointing performance of some recent new issues. The most spectacular flop has been Maid, the on-line business information group which was to be valued at more than 100 times its profits. Although the offer price was cut back the shares are now trading at a 40 per cent discount. In contrast another fledgling company, Unipalm, the computer network specialist, has gone to a healthy premium. But many advisers believe such companies are going to find it harder going from here. Mr Pat O'Reilly, head of corporate finance at Panmure Gordon, the broker, said: 'The wildly esoteric new issues are now out of the question unless they have a very good story.' Some observers believe the problem is that institutions, or more particularly funds specialising in smaller companies, are running out of money. 'They are just not as liquid as they were six to twelve months ago when institutions were pushing more money into their smaller company funds,' said one smaller companies analyst. 'They now don't have the resources to go for all the new issues and if they want to they will have to sell something.' If true, this might mean that a continued stream of small new issues may start to undermine the share prices of companies which have recently floated. However Mr O'Reilly discounts the weight of money argument. 'Institutions are merely getting fed up with the sheer number of small new issues. It had reached the point where fund managers were having to go to two or three new issue meetings a day.' Investors are getting more sceptical about some vendors' motives for coming to the market. 'Institutions are beginning to say to themselves 'if this guy just wants to buy a new swimming pool I don't see why we should pay for it',' commented one fund manager. One large institution is said to have stopped looking at any flotations on the grounds that there is better value to be had in shares already on the market. Whether pressure on prices reduces the flow of new issues may depend on the requirements of the large shareholders. 'Some vendors may be happy to postpone flotation in the hope that prices pick up again. But venture capital backers of some management buy-outs may want to get their money out to invest elsewhere and be prepared to take a lower price,' said one broker. There appear to be particular problems in some sectors, notably biotechnology, where many of the recent new issues are trading at a discount. The proposed flotation of Pharmakopius has been postponed indefinitely and the Cortecs issue pushed back by at least a month. The market also seems to be suffering from a surfeit of investment trust launches which may partly explain the reception to Rothschild's biotechnology trust. All is not gloom. One adviser argues that sentiment has actually improved recently. 'A couple of weeks ago two of our flotations were put on hold but are now back on track,' he said. But investors are clearly becoming more discriminating, and with good reason. Last week's profit warning from Canadian Pizza, which drove its shares 40 per cent below the November flotation price, underlined the risk of investing in new issues. Backers of International Food Machinery's flotation have fared worse still. The receivers, who were called in three months ago, have given up attempts to sell the business as a going concern and this week told creditors there was a total deficiency of Pounds 6.5m. Only 18 months after its flotation the shares are worthless.</p>

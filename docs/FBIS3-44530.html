			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China editor] </F>   [Text] China's social stability is being threatened by an  influx of migrants, potential spiralling price rises and other  social problems following the rush for sweeping reforms this  year, an official Chinese government report says.    The widening income gap between the rich and the poor,  increasing economic crimes, official corruption, labour disputes  and receding national unity among ethnic minorities are also  listed as major threats in the report.    Ordered by the State Council, China's cabinet, the report  tries to identify potential social problems that might crop up  this year when the country is set to fully embrace a  quasi-capitalistic market economy. The move underlined the  Chinese leadership's serious concerns over possible social  unrest and their caution over the on- going reforms.    Senior leaders, including Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin  and Premier Li Peng recently talked of "keeping a balance among  economic growth, reforms and social stability".    Chinese sources yesterday said the internal report, compiled  by a team made up of experts from the State Council's Research  Office, the Economic Forecasting Centre, and economists and  sociologists from research institutes, also suggested the  government should take the "necessary measures" to minimise the  "unsettling factors" from further development. The report  predicts that with a comparatively tight money supply and a  reduction in capital investment this year, the major coastal  cities' labour markets will not be able to accommodate the  increasing pressure of migrant job-seekers. It also says the  reforms are likely to force more urban employees out of work.    Inflation is expected to continue to rise, while prices of  staple foods, major consumer products and construction materials  will pick up, following the government's move to free more  prices from central control. The report adds that reforms  should be introduced only as long as consumers can bear the  inevitable inflation.    In an interview with the official Xinhua News Agency  published on Sunday, Li said too rapid strides in price reform  would cause instability.    The government reimposed controls on the price of grain and  other staple foods in many large cities in late December, after  watching prices soar 30 to 40 percent in a month. Government  officials said the sudden rise was partly due to panic buying in  anticipation of even higher prices in 1994 and partly because of  farmers hoarding their grain for the same purpose.    The report also warns that the income gap between the  richest  and the poorest in China has widened to an alarming scale. It  said the income gap in China was at a ratio of between 1:15 to  1:20, while in developed nations it was about 1:10. The gap is  likely to become wider following the massive privatisation of  state assets. The gap between the rich coastal regions and the  impoverished western hinterland will increase, although the  latter is developing and the living standards of the people  there are rising, the report says.    However, the report says China can overcome these problems  if  the government takes the "appropriate measures" and is cautious  in implementing its reforms.</p>

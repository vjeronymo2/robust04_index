			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Smoking in work areas. The employer shall ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees do not smoke in work areas where they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupationally exposed to asbestos because of activities in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Communication of hazards. NOTE: This section applies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the communication of information concerning asbestos hazards in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction activities to facilitate compliance with this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard. Most asbestos-related construction activities involve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously installed building materials. Building owners often  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are the only and/or best sources of information concerning them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, they, along with employers of potentially exposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees, are assigned specific information conveying and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retention duties under this section. Installed Asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Containing Building Material. Employers and building owners are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to treat TSI and sprayed or troweled on surfacing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials in buildings as asbestos-containing, unless they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine in compliance with paragraph (k)(4) of this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the material is not asbestos-containing. Asphalt and vinyl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flooring material installed no later than 1980 must also be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered as asbestos containing unless the employer, pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to paragraph (g) of this section determines that it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos-containing. If the employer/building owner has actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> knowledge, or should have known through the exercise of due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diligence, that other materials are asbestos-containing, they too  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be treated as such. When communicating information to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees pursuant to this standard, owners and employers shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify ``PACM'' as ACM. Additional requirements relating to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communication of asbestos work on multi-employer worksites are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set out in paragraph (d) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Duties of building and facility owners. (i) Before work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to this standard is begun, building and facility owners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall identify the presence, location and quantity of ACM, and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PACM at the work site. All thermal system insulation and sprayed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on or troweled on surfacing m2aterials in buildings or substrates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constructed no later than 1980 shall also be identified as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos-containing. In addition resilient flooring material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installed not later than 1980 shall also be identified as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos-containing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Building and/or facility owners shall notify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following persons of the presence, location and quantity of ACM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or PACM, at the work sites in their buildings and facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notification either shall be in writing, or shall consist of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personal communication between the owner and the person to whom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification must be given or their authorized representatives:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Prospective employers applying or bidding for work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose employees reasonably can be expected to work in or adjacent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to areas containing such material;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Employees of the owner who will work in or adjacent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas containing such material:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) On multi-employer worksites, all employers of employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who will be performing work within or adjacent to areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing such materials;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Tenants who will occupy areas containing such material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Duties of employers whose employees perform work subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this standard in or adjacent to areas containing ACM and PACM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Building/facility owners whose employees perform such work shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with these provisions to the extent applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Before work in areas containing ACM and PACM is begun;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employers shall identify the presence, location, and quantity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ACM, and/or PACM therein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Before work under this standard is performed employers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of employees who will perform such work shall inform the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following persons of the location and quantity of ACM and/or PACM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present in the area and the precautions to be taken to insure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that airborne asbestos is confined to the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Owners of the building/facility;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Employees who will perform such work and employers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees who work and/or will be working in adjacent areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Within 10 days of the completion of such work, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer whose employees have performed work subject to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard, shall inform the building/facility owner and employers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of employees who will be working in the area of the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location and quantity of PACM and/or ACM remaining in the area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and final monitoring results, if any.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In addition to the above requirements, all employers who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discover ACM and/or PACM on a worksite shall convey information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the presence, location and quantity of such newly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discovered ACM and/or PACM to the owner and to other employers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees working at the work site, within 24 hours of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Criteria to rebut the designation of installed material as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PACM. (i) At any time, an employer and/or building owner may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate, for purposes of this standard, that PACM does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain asbestos. Building owners and/or employers are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to communicate information about the presence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building material for which such a demonstration pursuant to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made. However, in all such cases, the information, data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis supporting the determination that PACM does not contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos, shall be retained pursuant to paragraph (n) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) An employer or owner may demonstrate that PACM does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not contain asbestos by the following: (A) Having an completed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection conducted pursuant to the requirements of AHERA (40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR Part 763, Subpart E) which demonstrates that the material is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not ACM;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Performing tests of the material containing PACM which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that no asbestos is present in the material. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests shall include analysis of 3 bulk samples of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> homogeneous area of PACM collected in a randomly distributed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner. The tests, evaluation and sample collection shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted by an accredited inspector or by a CIH. Analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> samples shall be performed by persons or laboratories with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proficiency demonstrated by current successful participation in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationally recognized testing program such as the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Round Robin for bulk samples administered by the American  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) or an equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationally-recognized round robin testing program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) At the entrance to mechanical rooms/areas in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees reasonably can be expected to enter and which contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thermal system insulation and surfacing ACM/PACM, the building  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner shall post signs which identify the material which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present, its location, and appropriate work practices which, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> followed, will ensure that ACM and/or PACM will not be disturbed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Signs. (i) Warning signs that demarcate the regulated area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be provided and displayed at each location where a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated area is required to be established by paragraph (e) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section. Signs shall be posted at such a distance from such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a location that an employee may read the signs and take necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective steps before entering the area marked by the signs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The warning signs required by (k)(6) of this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall bear the following information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 1,L0,tp0,p8,8/8,g1,t1,i1,s100 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> DANGER  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASBESTOS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CANCER AND LUNG DISEASE HAZARD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RESPIRATORS AND PROTECTION CLOTHING ARE REQUIRED IN THIS AREA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

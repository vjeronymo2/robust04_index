			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 1 Jun (DPA) -- The Colombian  Government indicated today that it will not reconsider its order  to the Armed Forces to shoot down planes that might be carrying  drugs -- an order which permits the use of force in intercepting  hostile planes -- in response to a U.S. move to stop supplying  data from radar installations that monitor Colombian and  Peruvian airspace.    Colombian Defense Minister Rafael Pardo said the Colombian  Government's order was carefully reviewed within the context of  existing international civil aviation regulations, and,  therefore, "we do not have to change anything in this matter."    The controversy in Colombia and Peru began when it was  revealed that the U.S. Department of Defense, without consulting  either the Colombian or Peruvian Governments, suspended the  operation of radars located in the Amazon jungle because it  believed it was dangerous for the Armed Forces of the two  countries to be authorized to shoot down planes.    Spokesmen for President Cesar Gaviria's government reacted  angrily to the move, calling it "unilateral, untimely, and  rude." They also argued that it could represent a U.S. violation  of agreements signed with Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru during the  so-called Antinarcotics Summits held in Cartagena de Indias and  San Antonio (Texas).    Pardo said the Colombian Government believes it is acting  properly, and he added that it is still awaiting an official  answer from the United States on the reasons behind this U.S.  move before deciding whether it will ask the United States to  remove two radar installations located in Leticia and Araracuara  in the Amazon region.    According to unofficial reports published in Colombia, the  Pentagon's decision was unilateral and prompted concern in the  White House and State Department because it might lead to an  increase in drug flights into the United States.    Colombian aviation officials who were consulted by the media  indicated that the U.S. measure might have arisen from fear that  one of the many U.S. military planes which "constantly violate"  Colombian airspace might be shot down.    Asked about the decision to suspend the release of radar  data, Army Commander Major General Hernan Guzman said  authorities will continue to comply with the order to down  hostile planes because "while fulfilling our duty, we cannot be  concerned with what the Americans have to say."    The controversy heightened criticisms from Colombian  political sectors against what they have called  "inconsistencies" in the Clinton administration's drug policy  because, several months ago, the U.S. State Department stopped  forwarding evidence against drug traffickers after a  disagreement erupted over statements made by Colombian  Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff.</p>

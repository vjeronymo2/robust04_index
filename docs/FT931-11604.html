			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Unloved expense - Mounting pressure to drop the burden of small company audit AFTER nearly 30 years with the same accountant, Ellen Lunn recently switched. SA Lunn, the family-owned plumbers' merchants she runs with her husband, now gets a better service but she still resents paying for an audit she is convinced she does not need. 'I can understand the necessity for an audit in a large concern where there is a lot going on and they are dealing with other people's money, but I don't see the need in a small business,' she says. Lunn and her husband are the only shareholders in the Farnborough-based company, which has a workforce of 12, sales of just over Pounds 1m and no bank borrowings. The audit is costly - the present accountant charges Pounds 2,500 for preparing annual accounts and carrying out the audit - and also takes up time. 'Half a day goes on the meeting with the auditor, usually at an inconvenient time, and then there are the follow-up queries. If we weren't required by law to have an audit we wouldn't need to employ a certified auditor and we could go to a bookkeeper or do the job ourselves,' she says. Lunn is not alone among small business owners in querying the value to small businesses of the audit. This issue has also vexed governments, the accountancy profession, banks and tax authorities for more than a decade. For the third time in 10 years the Department of Trade and Industry is engaged in a review of the small company audit and it expects to produce a discussion document in the next month or so. Spurred by growing concern about the burden of red tape on small firms, there appears a growing consensus that the small company audit must go. But the debate is by no means over and there is certain to be heated discussion about the level at which the audit ceases to be necessary. There is also disagreement over whether or not it needs to be replaced by a simplified report on the finances of the smaller firm. Defenders of the small company audit argue that it provides an independent review of the business for suppliers, banks and taxman. It also forces the business owner to keep his or her accounts in order. Abolitionists say the audit is an unnecessary expense; that the requirement to file accounts with Companies House ensures records are kept; and that outsiders have other ways of monitoring performance. Freed from the audit, small business owners would regard their accountant as a friend and adviser, not as an official snoop. Like so many of the regulations that control business, it is the smaller company that bears the heaviest burden of red tape. The typical company with sales below Pounds 20,000 pays the equivalent of 4 per cent of turnover by way of audit fees, compared with 0.8 per cent for the company with sales between Pounds 100,000-Pounds 200,000, say consultants Graham Bannock &amp; Partners. Opposition to abolition of the small firms audit has mainly come from the tax authorities, the banks, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants and many small accountancy firms. There are signs that the banks are coming round to the idea, while the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, though it did not oppose the plan in the past, is now more positive. The ICA suggested in a consultation document last August that companies with sales up to the VAT registration threshold of Pounds 36,600 should no longer be required to undergo an audit. Those with sales up to Pounds 300,000 should be able to dispense with the audit if shareholders were unanimously in favour. But removal of the audit would not free companies from external checks. The ICA wants in its place a 'compilation report', based on financial information in the annual report and accounts. This report would have to be signed off by a qualified accountant. Banks are prepared to back the proposal for removing the audit for companies with sales of less than Pounds 36,600, but are not keen for larger companies to jettison the audit, even if all shareholders agree. The British Bankers' Association says it wants to go 'one step at a time'. Feedback from ICA members to the consultation document has shown 70 per cent are in favour of relaxing the audit rules, although most demanded that shareholders voted unanimously in favour even in the smallest of companies. In spite of more than a decade of debate many accountants still appear confused at the likely impact of removing the small firms audit. Many argue that it would not make much difference to the smaller firm while claiming it would lead to a sharp reduction in accountancy fees. Much work involved in the audit results from the need to comply with the Companies Act, says Lance Blackstone of London accountants Blackstone Franks. 'A lot of time is taken up with checks for compliance purposes,' he says. 'Without an audit there would be fewer notes to the accounts.' Others are less sure. 'We are sceptical about the extent of the savings which the proposals can be expected to secure,' says Paul Chisnall, assistant director at the BBA. But the deep-seated fear of many of the 14,000 accountants who are registered auditors is that abolition of the statutory audit will allow companies to turn to cheaper bookkeepers to compile accounts. 'Companies would shop around for any Tom, Dick or Harry to sign their compilation report,' says Panos Mavron, a sole practitioner. There is little doubt that many small companies would opt for the cheapest solution to the chore of preparing accounts. But great care will be needed in framing any new rules. The introduction in 1981 of abbreviated accounts for small businesses had the perverse effect of increasing the amount of work involved, since they could only be compiled from the full accounts. Proponents of abolition point to the US and many countries in continental Europe which do not require small companies to have an audit or to publish accounts. This has not prevented the development of a strong small business community.</p>

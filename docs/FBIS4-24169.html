			<p>BFN     [Text] Operation Turquoise, the French military and  humanitarian mission in Rwanda, has entered its active phase.    Yesterday alone, French soldiers officially carried out four  patrols within Rwandan territory from their Zairean bases in  Goma and Bukavu. The strategy of the French forces is to  increase the number of patrols in refugee camps. General  Lafourcade, the commander of Operation Turquoise, outlined the  details to Christophe Boisbouvier:    [Begin Lafourcade recording] In the north we went to Kanama  some five km east of (Ndjihi), where we found a camp housing 400  Hutus. It seems that health conditions there are not  disastrous, but this remains to be confirmed. We also went to  (Manyumba). We are now stepping up our effort: we have some  1,000 soldiers and around 100 vehicles. There are around 40  soldiers in Rwanda -- we are sending more today on  reconnaissance missions -- some of them are returning to Zaire  for the night. They are in the south; I will not tell you  precisely where because they are on permanent reconnaissance  missions. They stop at night, usually near a refugee camp. [end  recording]    One thousand French soldiers and 40 Senegalese soldiers are  already taking part in Operation Turquoise. What are the  relations between Operation Turquoise and soldiers of the  Rwandan Army? Gen. Lafourcade gives some more details:    [Begin Lafourcade recording] We have very few contacts with  the Rwandan Armed Forces apart from normal courtesy contacts  with the authorities to prevent errors. You will understand  that it is important to avoid confusing government soldiers and  rebels or poorly organized militiamen under no one's authority.  So we are simply establishing contacts with the (?local)  authorities and moving on to refugee camps to protect the  population. [end recording]</p>

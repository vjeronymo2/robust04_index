			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOOTBALL ALL-STAR NOTEBOOK / MIKE REILLEY;  </P> <P> ORANGE'S CAMPBELL SAYS CAR CRASH WON'T GET IN THE WAY OF HIS PROMISE  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, Gregg Campbell of Orange High School wasn't sure if he could  keep his promise to his father that he would help the North team win the 31st  Orange County football all-star game.  </P> <P> The younger Campbell had injured his right knee in a car accident and was  questionable for the game.  </P> <P> But Wednesday, after 25 stitches and three weeks of rehabilitation, Campbell  pronounced himself ready to play in the game, scheduled for 7:30 p.m. July 6 at  LeBard Stadium.  </P> <P> "I've dreamed of playing in this game for 14 years and there was no way I was  going to miss it," said Campbell, a 6-foot-4, 190-pound defensive back. "I had  to play."  </P> <P> It was 14 years ago that Campbell's father, Dick, then a coach at Garden Grove,  coached the North in a losing effort. Campbell told his father he would "get  some revenge" this year.  </P> <P> "I don't remember much from that game," the younger Campbell said. "I was only  4 or 5 years old. All I remember was my dad losing."  </P> <P> He also has some painful memories about his knee.  </P> <P> "I still can't go full out on my knee," said Campbell, who wears an elastic  brace on it. "I sprained it in a game against Costa Mesa last season and I've  been wearing the brace since then."  </P> <P> Campbell also suffered several cuts on the same knee during the accident. He  was riding in a friend's car when "another car hit our car by the trunk and we  spun around."  </P> <P> His knee rammed into the emergency flasher box under the dashboard and was  sliced open.  </P> <P> "I got a nice concussion out of it too," Campbell said, "but I'm OK now."  </P> <P> That comes as a relief to North Coach Tom Meiss, who also was Campbell's coach  at Orange.  </P> <P> "He's starting to come around now," Meiss said. "We need him to direct traffic  in our secondary."  </P> <P> It's midway through the second week of practice and Meiss is still shuffling  his lineup.  </P> <P> He added three players to the North roster Wednesday -- defensive back Mark  Flatten of Pacifica, running back Jeff Besinaiz of La Habra and Esperanza  linebacker Mark Kinney.  </P> <P> They replace Anaheim linebacker Ernie Akau, Savanna running back Kenison  PoChing and Valencia lineman Jose Castillo, who have decided not to play, Meiss  said.  </P> <P> Servite offensive lineman Jose Salazar was added to the roster last week,  replacing Paul Jaramillo of Valencia.  </P> <P> "Fortunately we haven't lost a lot of offensive people," Meiss said. "Most of  our replacements have been defensive. Offense is all performance and defense is  all reaction."  </P> <P> Although temperatures have hovered in the 90s and 100s the last two days, Meiss  said the heat hasn't bothered the players and coaches.  </P> <P> "I'm not working them that hard," he said.  </P> <P> Meiss said Los Alamitos running back Erik Mitchell has been so impressive in  practice that he has earned a starting role . . . at cornerback.  </P> <P> "Erik said he was interested in trying it and he'll start there," Meiss said.  "He and (Loara's Coy) Collins will start at running back too.  </P> <P> "Mitchell looks to be a very good corner. He has always taken a lick, now he  has a chance to give one."  </P> <P> Los Alamitos quarterback Todd Gragnano also is expected to start, Meiss said.  </P> <P> "He's been throwing the ball well to (Los Alamitos' Chad) Millan," Meiss said.  "They're a good one-two combination."  </P> <P> Meiss has scheduled a variety of activities for the players in the next week,  including a trip to a children's hospital and a talent show, in which each  player will be required to perform.  </P> <P> "I told them they at least had to get up and tell a joke," Meiss said.  </P> <P> The early favorite to win the talent show? Fullerton High quarterback Rene  Arias.  </P> <P> "Rene's the comedian of the group," Orange's Campbell said. "That guy's talking  constantly."  </P> <P> The North also has planned a pizza party at Meiss' house. The coach, who wants  to toughen up his players, promised them toppings that include "bailing wire,  nails and mozzarella."  </P> <P> Meiss was an assistant coach with the winning South team in 1983.  </P> <P> "I took notes," he said. "I thought about what I would do differently if I was  the (head) coach someday. We're spending more time in front of the chalkboard  this year. We want to explain more to them so they have a good understanding of  what they're doing out there."  </P> <P> Meiss has not scheduled a scrimmage, but the South team will have one at 10  a.m. Saturday at Edison High School.  </P></p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Ex-securities chief faces fraud trial: Spotlight on illegal share dealings in Johannesburg THE extent of illegal share dealings on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) comes under the spotlight today in the Rand Supreme Court with the start of one of the most widely publicised securities cases in years. Mr Greg Blank, then a director of one of the largest firms on the JSE, Frankel Max Pollak Vinderine (Frankels), is being charged with 49 counts of fraud, allegedly involving an illegal gain of about R10m (Pounds 2m). There is no precedent in South Africa for a JSE member being charged for irregular dealings on such a large scale. Lack of convictions for securities offences in the past has led to speculation , fiercely denied by the JSE authorities, that illegal trading is widespread. They will be hoping that, should Mr Blank be found guilty, a stiff sentence will be handed down which will help dispel suspicions about the JSE, justified or not. Mr Blank's conspicuously wealthy lifestyle has also focused attention on the case, as has the fact that his alleged accomplices occupied senior positions at the Old Mutual, South Africa's largest insurance company. Mr Blank was the person responsible for Old Mutual's dealings with Frankels. The bulk of the charges relate to the practice known as 'front-running'. It is alleged that, between 1989 and 1991, Mr Blank, in collaboration with his three accomplices at the Old Mutual - two portfolio managers and the chief trader - bought numerous lines of stock for the account of a company in which they were joint beneficiaries. Once a sufficient quantity of the particular share had been accumulated, and the share had reached a particular price, it would be sold to the Old Mutual, normally within two to four weeks.</p>

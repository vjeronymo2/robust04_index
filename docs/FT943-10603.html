			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Free coal contract put out to tender The role of distributing concessionary fuel to former British Coal employees and their dependants will be put to competitive tender, the government said yesterday, Michael Smith writes. British Coal said its British Fuels Group subsidiary, which distributes concessionary fuel, would be among the bidders. When British Coal is sold the successor companies will be responsible for the entitlements of employees while the government will assume responsibility for entitlements of former employees. The cost is estimated at Pounds 1.5bn over the next few decades.</p>

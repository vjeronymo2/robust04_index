			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Placing expected to value Hydro at more than Pounds 10m Hydro International is coming to the market via a placing that will value the company, which makes control systems for storm water control and sewage separation, at between Pounds 10m and Pounds 11.5m. The company, based in Clevedon, Avon, utilises 'vortex technology', the principles of which have been known since Roman times. The vortex, or whirlpool, effect is harnessed to regulate fluid flow. The company has two main product ranges: flow control valves for flood protection and storm control and hydro-dynamic separators for separating solids from liquids, especially in the treatment of sewage and other waste water. All are patented and low-cost. Hydro expects recent environmental legislation in Europe and the US, which has specified big cuts in pollutant discharge, to increase capital works in its markets. The company is raising about Pounds 3.7m, of which Pounds 570,000 will go to existing shareholders. The balance is for research and development, international expansion and the development of new markets. The directors are retaining between 60 and 65 per cent of the equity. The board is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 480,000 for the year to December 31. In 1993 it made Pounds 156,000 on turnover of Pounds 4.1m, and in the six months to June 30, profits were Pounds 154,000 on turnover of Pounds 2.4m.</p>

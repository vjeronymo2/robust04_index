			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Some 18,000 British Broadcasting Corp. workers went on strike Monday for higher  pay, leaving viewers to watch the "Flintstones" cartoon characters, a film  about Evel Knievel and other fill-in morning programs, while radio listeners  were greeted with silence. The 24-hour walkout, which began at midnight, forced  nearly all live programs on the corporation's two television channels and four  national radio networks to be canceled or shortened. Journalists joined  technicians on picket lines in London and demonstrations were planned for  Glasgow, Belfast, Manchester, Birmingham and other major cities. Striking  workers are demanding a 16% pay increase that would bring salaries in line with  those in commercial broadcasting. The BBC, which employs about 25,000 people,  has offered an average 7% increase. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

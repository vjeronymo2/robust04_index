			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Austrian companies sign deals Austrian companies appear set to secure contracts with Chinese government agencies for up to Sch10bn (Pounds 574m) in goods and services, after several years of efforts to build contacts and trade with the People's Republic. Several contracts, including one for a Sch500m steel casting plant - by VA Technologie, for a slab casting machine at a steel works in Benxi  - and another for up to Sch1.6bn worth of crude oil - by the Austrian integrated oil group OMV - were signed yesterday during a visit by Mr Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, to Vienna. The most important agreement, worth up to Sch7bn, was in the railway equipment sector, where Austria has many strong suppliers. Under the agreement, Austrian companies will receive some Sch3bn worth of orders for locomotives, rails, switches (points), rail laying machinery, telecoms and and tunnel construction. A further Sch3bn to Sch4bn was achievable under the agreement and Mr Viktor Klima, the Austrian transport minister, held out the prospect of up to Sch30bn in railway-related contracts with China in the longer term. Mr Klima said China was suffering from severe bottlenecks in transporting its raw materials, and so had given the highest priority to railway construction.</p>

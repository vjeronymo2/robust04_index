			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Attack On Baghdad: America 'will not shake a single palm leaf' THE RESIDENTS of Baghdad seemed to have been taken by surprise. Sirens in the city wailed at about 2am and minutes later there was the sound of what seemed like explosions. Anti-aircraft fire was also heard. But Baghdad had tested its sirens the previous day as the country commemorated a victory in battle over Iran in the 1980-1988 war. Even after a hugh blaze could be seen rising from the Mansour area about 3km from the city centre, the streets remained almost empty of cars and the residents who were out and about were surprised to hear that there had been an attack on Baghdad. People initially mistook the attack for a military exercises. 'It is an exercise,' said one. 'They announced it today.' Baghdad Radio continued normal programmes for nearly two hours before switching over to national anthems. There also had been no signs the authorities were expecting an attack. Official newspapers had been empty of anti-US rhetoric and there had been no sign that air defences were being strengthened. By daylight, however, reality had sunk in. As dawn broke, the silence across the city was broken by shouts of 'Allah Akbar' (God is great), and the normal fears began to resurface. 'God, put an end to all this,' a woman wailed. 'Does this mean they are going to hit us whenever they want?' said a passer-by in the city's Bab al-Sharji district. 'I wonder whether Clinton will be satisfied with one strike,' a petrol station worker said. Then came the defiance. Soldiers on leave in a Baghdad garage were unimpressed. 'It is peanuts,' one said. 'We have seen worse than that.' Baghdad Radio said that the US 'will not be able to shake even a single Iraqi palm leaf regardless of the treacherous power with which they came this time.' President Saddam's Revolution Command Council denounced the attack as 'cowardly aggression', which 'martyred several civilian citizens in houses near the headquarters and wounded many others, including women and children'. The US had 'continued to seek to fabricate crises and lies to pursue their criminal policy against the Iraqi people'. Ms Eleanor Biles, a Reuter TV producer, said she was having a drink with some foreign aid workers in the Al Rasheed hotel, where most foreigners stay in Baghdad, when the sirens sounded. She then heard a series of huge explosions that went on for about 10 minutes. In the hotel foyer, she said, people at first seemed in doubt as to whether the attack had come from Iran or the US. She said: 'As it became clearer that the US was behind the attack on Iraq's intelligence headquarters, several Arab guests angrily stamped and jumped up and down on the floor mural of President George Bush in the foyer. 'Several other hotel employees angrily asked me why there had been no warning from the US.'</p>

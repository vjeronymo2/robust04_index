			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / King asks Belgium's premier to try again THE king of Belgium has asked his prime minister to seek a solution to the budget crisis which threatens to bring down the government. King Baudouin said yesterday he had still not decided whether to accept the resignation of the centre-left coalition, submitted a week ago. Instead, he has given Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister, a 'mission' to mediate between the four coalition parties - Flemish-speaking and French-speaking Socialists and Christian Democrats. No deadline has been set. The coalition split last week when ministers failed to agree how to raise BFr110bn (Pounds 2.3bn) needed to bring the ballooning Belgian national debt into line with Maastricht treaty criteria for European economic and monetary union. The king's decision, reached after discussions with senior political figures and advisers, shows he is reluctant to precipitate a new election, less than two years after the last one. Mr Dehaene's spokeswoman said the mission would allow the prime minister to broaden the search for a solution to include talks with leaders of the four coalition parties as well as with ministers. But she made clear that Mr Dehaene would not be discussing solutions with opposition. Belgium's Liberal opposition parties are calling for a fresh election, in spite of the fact that almost all traditional parties lost votes in the November 1991 poll. Belgian citizens registered their discontent by voting for extremists, Greens and anti-political parties.</p>

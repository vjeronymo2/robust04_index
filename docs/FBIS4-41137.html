			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaker of the upper house of Russian parliament,  the Federation Council (FC), Vladimir Shumeyko says deputies are  unhappy about parts of the federal constitution dealing with the  upper house and parliament as a whole.    In a report on the FC's role and place in overcoming  critical  situations on Tuesday, Shumeyko also pointed to a lack of  organization by the parliamentary committees, leadership and its  staff.    He said the constitutionally-enshrined power of the Council  for law making was its "most powerful weapon". To invigorate  Council activity, Shumeyko proposed amending articles 104 and  105 of the federal constitution to enable the Council to bring  bills in the Federal Assembly both the through the lower house  and independently.    This, he said, can help relieve the State Duma of the burden  of law making and distribute bills evenly between the two houses  to help on the legislative process.    Shumeyko pointed to what made the Council and Duma different  from each other. Unlike the Duma which is the arena of power  struggle and compromise between different political and party  interests, he said, the upper house represents the interests of  Russian autonomies and regions.    In his view, Russia is undergoing a cultural rather than  economic or political crisis. Shumeyko said that as the supreme  legislative body, the Federation Council was designed to exploit  the idea of statehood and patriotism to strengthen rather than  overhaul the existing establishment.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Arts: A Slip of the Tongue/Leave Taking - Theatre The programme for A Slip of the Tongue contains another of those chronologies of events in eastern Europe from the late 1980s onwards with which London theatre-goers must by now be familiar. There is a very odd entry, however, for December 1989. It reads simply: 'Romania - Vaclav Havel elected President'. Yet perhaps that is a deliberate slip of the pen. Dusty Hughes's play is based on a character from Czechoslovakia, where Vaclav Havel was indeed elected President, but the background is more Romanian and at times a socialist Ruritania seems not out of place. Dominik Tatarka, the hero (of sorts), was a Slovak writer who was repeatedly imprisoned or internally exiled by the regime. As such, he had something in common with Havel. Yet there the similarity ends. In the play, Tatarka becomes Dominic Tantra. According to the script, he was constantly visited in his enforced rural retreat by a stream of women students, all of them claiming to admire his work. All of them bring him a Buddha as a mark of respect - by the start of the second act, there are at least six buddha figures in his cupboard. The women are also informers, sent by the regime. Tantra deals with them easily enough by seducing them. It is when one of them tells him that the Berlin Wall has come down that his confidence ebbs and he claims to have become impotent. Thereafter it is the women who have to make the first move in the seduction process. He does not wish to become president of the new democracy and prefers to hop off to the Frankfurt book fair. To his credit he does not want an inquest into the past. The real Tatarka died in 1989. The chief interest in this production is that it is by the Steppenwolf Theatre Company of Chicago with John Malkovich, one of its founding members, playing Tantra. It bothers me slightly that on the evidence of this piece I cannot see why the company is so widely admired. Malkovich gives a perfectly pleasant performance and has an attractively modulated voice. The women admirers are adequate, but there is not much to distinguish between them. In short, there are no fireworks. Perhaps the weakness lies in the text. One is a little weary by now of hearing how eastern Europe admired America for its jazz and Coca Cola and even the joke of Tantra pausing while undressing one of the women to admire the Japanese zip on her skirt is not entirely new. A Slip of the Tongue hovers on farce, but it is never clear to which genre it is intended to belong. I suspect that both the play and the Steppenwolf Company would be much better on a smaller stage.                        *       *      * Winsome Pinnock's Leave Taking, which won the 1991 George Devine Award, is a play about the tension between Caribbean and black British lifestyle. This has become an established tradition in British culture, with Jean Rhys's Let Them Call it Jazz first among many. Leave Taking mines a rich dramatic vein: generations of black British at variance in one family. Enid left Jamaica as a young woman, and brought up her daughters, Del and Viv, in England. Both daughters have integrated, one by taking on the trappings of mainstream British culture, the other by succeeding at school. But when Enid visits an Obeah-woman for haruspic guidance, she realises she has repressed her roots in order to fit in. A family friend, 'uncle Brod', the unassimilated voice of Jamaica, reinforces her memories of home. The new generation has a wider choice. While Enid lists the sacrifices she made for her children, her daughter taunts: 'I'm gonna have ev'thing you wanted but were too frightened to enjoy.' The play ends with a fragile compromise as new black British reaches out to the old Jamaican. The wonderful design (Trudy Marklew) conveys urban clutter and Caribbean space, giving visual reality to the forces which shape the characters. Large window frames with billowing curtains form an angle in which a living-room set is crammed. The acting maintains a high energy, and the action should gather momentum throughout the play's run. Leave Taking presents the first all-black cast on stage at the Belgrade main house. This is surprising in a theatre with a Black Arts Events office, but understandable in a city committed to multicultural theatre, although black culture itself embraces great diversity. Leave Taking figures in a series Black culture and arts events: Martin Luther King was commemorated on April 24; Bob Marley is celebrated in an exhibition at the Polytechnic next month.

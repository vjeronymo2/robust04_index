			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Personal View: Myths about ministerial trade missions No businessman or woman invited to join a reasonably senior government minister on a UK trade mission overseas is likely to refuse, especially if it is the prime minister. Most business people believe that such a personal acquaintance with a minister will always come in useful and that, at worst, the minister will learn about their problems. They may not, though, have a great belief in the real value of the visit. It is very important that ministers are clear about the precise objectives of such missions and how they will affect the decisions of the prospective customers. The visits can provide ministers with the opportunity to find out about the way in which particular industries and their customers operate, provided ministers are not changed too often. Educating trade and industry secretaries in this way over the past 13 years or so - a period of rapid ministerial turnover - would have been a very unprofitable business. A year or so ago I provided a guide for ministers and their officials on the usefulness of overseas missions, which was given to the relevant departments. In countries with command economies much business is done on a government-to-government basis. They are becoming fewer in number, but where they exist a ministerial involvement is helpful. Because of the economic state of most of them the deal usually requires some officially subsidised credits. In tightly controlled countries, such as the Arab oil states, there can be dramatic results from a UK political intervention since most of the decisions are made by one person or very few people. (A good example is the Saudi aircraft contract Al Yamamah 2, in which the prime minister was involved, although his predecessor had already been given credit for securing it.) In developing countries, which usually have some aspects of command economies, there will be a need for assistance of one kind or another and for credit guarantees. Ministers do not always understand that they will be wasting their time if the aid and credit guarantees are not forthcoming, since it is these aid and credit guarantees that are important, not the minister's presence. In countries where a new relationship with the UK has opened a previously closed market, or where rapid political or economic change is taking place (eg, most of the former Comecon countries and others such as Iran, Vietnam, a post-Saddam Iraq when it happens), it may be necessary to make high-level political contacts in order to understand in what direction and how fast the country is moving before it is possible to assess business prospects. The presence of a minister as mission leader can be absolutely essential in gaining access to the country's senior politicians and also in demonstrating a UK political commitment to developing trade. Tangible signs of commitment will be required. In pluralistic open market economies with fully convertible currencies and individual centres of decision-making, there is almost no useful purpose to be achieved by a ministerial visit (this applies to practically all OECD countries). In many of these countries a company may be set up as a domestic operation and the UK connection may be irrelevant or a potential hindrance. We had to persuade one minister not to lead a mission to the US. There are, of course, cases which do not fit neatly into one of these categories and which need to be looked at individually. The question must be what the minister is going to do, and how he will be able to influence the placing of business with UK firms. It should be remembered that with the growing internationalisation of business there are countries where British companies will service the market from a third country (eg South America or the Caribbean from the US). Business people like to have active support from their government. But flag-waving has a limited value, and the value of ministers as salesmen can be over-rated. Ministers need to listen carefully to what business leaders tell them about the markets and the political support which those competitors may be receiving from their governments, with or without missions.

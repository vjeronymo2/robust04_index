			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Eritrea celebrates independence vote ERITREANS celebrated in the streets of Asmara last night after provisional results of the United Nations-monitored referendum gave near unanimous support for independence from Ethiopia. International recognition is now a formality. In a 98 per cent turnout of registered voters, 1.1m voted Yes and only 1,822 voted No, writes Julie Wheelwright in Asmara. 'Eritrea is a sovereign country as of today, April 27, 1993,' former Eritrean guerrilla leader Isayas Afewerki and secretary general of the provisional government told a news conference in the capital. A formal declaration of independence, achieved after a 30-year war which cost over 100,000 lives, will be made on May 24 - the second anniversary of the defeat by Eritrean guerrillas of the army of President Mengistu Haile Mariam, the former Ethiopian dictator who fled into exile.</p>

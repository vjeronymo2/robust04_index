			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Tesco cut-price label challenges discounters TESCO, the UK's second-biggest supermarket chain, yesterday took on the growing band of food discounters by launching a cut-price own label. The move came as a survey found that prices at Tesco, on a basket of 40 items, had fallen 7.5 per cent in the past three months. The launch of the Tesco Value label was seen in the City as a defence against discount stores offering a limited number of goods at low prices. But Tesco insisted it did not mark a return to the 'pile it high and sell it cheap' philosophy for which it was famous in the 1960s and 1970s. The 70 cut-price products, with distinctive blue, red and white labels, and including many popular items in the fresh food, grocery and non-food categories, will replace 'tertiary' brands - cheaper alternatives to big-name and stores' own brands. Analysts believe the recession and the growing influence of discounters have led to shoppers switching from own brands - on which supermarkets make their biggest gross profit margins because they do not have to bear the same development and marketing costs as manufacturers - to tertiary brands. They said Tesco was trying to regain some lost margin by offering cheap products on an own-brand basis. Mr Terry Leahy, Tesco's marketing director, said Tesco Value lines would 'enable us to more effectively communicate the value Tesco has always given'. Tesco's share price has come under pressure this year because the City fears its younger customer base makes its profits more vulnerable to erosion by the discounters than those of competitors J. Sainsbury and Safeway. There have been rumours of a boardroom split between those who believe Tesco should continue to compete with the other big two and those favouring a move to lower prices. A survey today by Verdict, the retail research group, suggests Tesco is ensuring it stocks products at prices that can compete with the discounters and Asda, the stores chain which is being revitalised by a new management with a renewed emphasis on price. For a basket of 40 common purchases, selecting the cheapest alternative in each category, Verdict last month found Tesco (Pounds 33.03) was cheaper than Sainsbury (Pounds 35.23), Safeway (Pounds 36.28) and Asda (Pounds 33.85). Tesco was also cheaper than four discount chains - including Asda's new discount format, Dales. Food Pricing Survey. Verdict, 112 High Holborn, London WC1. Pounds 395.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Market forces curb audit fees AUDIT FEES are falling back towards levels of two years ago, a study indicated yesterday. Bills for 42 quoted companies with year-ends on or after December 1991 have dropped 2.7 per cent to Pounds 53.7m, according to JDH Consultants, the Glasgow-based firm. That compares with a rise in audit bills for the same companies of 5 per cent to Pounds 55.2m last year, up from Pounds 52.6m in the previous 12 months. The study, which used figures from the annual reports of companies that have reported so far this year, provides evidence of the competition between accountancy firms. It comes as companies are increasingly putting their audits out to tender - or threatening to do so - in an attempt to cut costs in the face of the recession. The trend is depressing news for the accountancy firms, which traditionally rely on audit fees during a downturn, when income from other sources such as corporate finance and management consultancy declines. Mr Dennis Henry, JDH managing director, said: 'This study emphasis the fact that auditors are not escaping the pressures placed on their clients.' The largest declines include a 46 per cent fall at Alfred McAlpine from Pounds 565,000 to Pounds 305,000 - which changed auditor from Touche Ross to Price Waterhouse - and 44 per cent from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 900,000 for English China Clay, audited by KPMG Peat Marwick. The highest fee in the study is from BTR, the industrial group, audited by Ernst &amp; Young, which has remained static at Pounds 7m for the past three years.

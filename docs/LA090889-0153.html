			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STYLE: FOR SANTA ANA PERFUME CREATOR, INDIVIDUALITY IS OF THE ESSENCE  </P> <P> Anne Pliska and her perfume are a lot alike. They're both assertive, feminine  and pink.  </P> <P> On this particular day, the 30-year-old Santa Ana resident and creator of the  pink-colored Anne Pliska fragrance collection is wearing a hot-pink blazer,  hot-pink lipstick and hot-pink high heels as she scrambles madly to meet a  production deadline.  </P> <P> But five years ago, when she decided to break into the fashion industry by  launching a fragrance, she had no idea how to peddle her product or handle a  deadline scramble.  </P> <P> "I literally went through the phone book and called a perfumer," she says from  her Irvine industrial park headquarters. "I didn't know anything about the  industry. Fortunately I had called a world-renowned company and the creator of  (Calvin Klein's) Obsession, but I didn't know any of that at the time."  </P> <P> What she did know was that she wanted a classy scent that would be both  extremely feminine and distinctive. So she decided to market a fragrance in her  favorite color.  </P> <P> The company she chose to create the scent -- Roure-Bertrand-Dupont, which has  offices in France, New Jersey and Woodland Hills and has created such  fragrances as Bijan, Sophia, Obsession and Poison -- put together some samples  that filled Pliska's request for a classic, feminine fragrance different from  any other on the market.  </P> <P> After two years of smelling samples, Pliska chose the slightly Oriental  fragrance of fruit and spice essences that she sells under her name (pronounced  anay to rhyme with Renee) to Nordstrom, Harris' in San Bernardino, The Jones  Store in Kansas City, Dayton Hudson in Detroit and other outlets across the  country. (The Ritz-Carlton resort in Dana Point and Nordstrom stores are the  only places to purchase the perfume in Orange County.)  </P> <P> As a girl growing up in Newport Beach, Pliska had long dreamed of becoming a  fashion designer. But after a couple of years designing women's clothing and  accessories, she found that she was just as poor and obscure as before she  started.  </P> <P> "It didn't pay the bills," she says. "So I thought I should get a real job. I  tried the corporate world and found . . . I was not corporate-minded. I  realized I was not a political animal. After being fired from my last corporate  job, I thought maybe I'd better go back to designing," she adds, her pink lips  forming a huge smile.  </P> <P> But designing what?  </P> <P> "It was sort of like, where do you start eating the elephant? The fashion world  is huge, and I wasn't sure where to start. But I thought with fragrance, that  it would get me a name faster."  </P> <P> She was right. Once she launched the fragrance, large department stores began  requesting huge orders. (The orders are filled in Irvine, after the scent  mixture is sent from Roure-Bertrand-Dupont to other labs, where it is mixed  with alcohol and made into gels, body lotion and other products.)  </P> <P> But it took nearly two years of product development before the perfume hit the  market -- settling on the scent, devising the marketing plan and designing the  packaging. Choosing the fragrance, she says, took the most time.  </P> <P> Most perfumes and colognes are created by fragrance companies, which a designer  or cosmetics firm contacts when ready to market a new product. Once a scent is  created, the designer usually signs a contract with the fragrance company,  which agrees to supply a certain amount of scent mixture for a certain price.  The mixture, which is sold by the pound, is sent to labs where it is made into  the products you see in the stores.  </P> <P> In Pliska's case, she has an exclusive contract with the Roure-Bertrand-Dupont  company and its assurance that a similar scent will not be created for another  designer. There are no copyrights or patents on fragrances, says Annette Green  of the Fragrance Foundation in New York.  </P> <P> For any given scent, perhaps two dozen trial fragrances will be compiled by  perfumers in a fragrance company's laboratories, explains Ron Benton, regional  vice president of fragrance sales for Roure-Bertrand-Dupont, which, according  to the Fragrance Foundation is among the world's top producers of fine scents.  </P> <P> Into these samples will go between 100 and 150 ingredients, elements that will  be continuously fine-tuned until the final product is selected, he adds.  </P> <P> "It's like writing out a recipe," he says. "It might read 2% jasmine, or 3%  sandalwood, and all the ingredients that go into a single perfume are  compounded in the lab and presented to the customer."  </P> <P> The scent might take years to develop and more years to market. But despite the  investment in time and resources, Benton says that the average life span for  perfume is five years and that only a few survive to join the ranks of such  classic scents as Chanel No. 5 (created in 1924) and White Shoulders (born in  1939).  </P> <P> Pliska is determined to nurture one of the survivors.  </P> <P> "I'm really striving to become a classic," she says. "I think quietly and  surely, I'm developing a steady, loyal following. . . . I don't intend to be a  mass-market fragrance fad."  </P> <P> Her research shows that the Anne Pliska customer is a woman 25 years or older  who is not into trends. "It's someone who wants a scent that speaks of  individuality," she says. "American women are beginning to turn away from the  European and even the Madison Avenue ideals of glamour and are beginning to  celebrate their own individuality."  </P> <P> After settling on the fragrance and the color, Pliska chose luxurious white and  gold packages to promote an upscale, exclusive image for the line of eight  fragrance products, which start at $25 for bath gel and go to $80 for a  half-ounce of perfume.  </P> <P> Soon, Nordstrom came knocking.  </P> <P> "Actually, I hadn't planned to sell to Nordstrom or any other store," says  Pliska. "My plan was to sell through a catalogue, and perhaps create a demand  by being unavailable. But I went to the Nordstrom perfume buyer (at South Coast  Plaza) just to talk about strategy and pricing, and they wanted to buy it right  then. Nordstrom likes things they know you can't buy elsewhere, that have an  exclusive quality."  </P> <P> Since then (Anne Pliska fragrances first appeared at Nordstrom on Valentine's  Day, 1987), it's been a mad dash to meet demand.  </P> <P> "It's beaten me to death," says Pliska with a laugh. A newlywed whose husband  handles many of the company's finances, she says despite the travel and reputed  glamour of the fragrance industry, she is too busy to be having fun with it.  </P> <P> She and her husband ("I'm married but may not be for long if business keeps  up") just moved from Newport Beach to a 1926 house in northern Santa Ana, but  she hasn't had much time to settle in.  </P> <P> "I know, it seems everybody else is moving in the other direction, from Santa  Ana to Newport Beach, but I went the other way."  </P> <P> The same could be said of her professional life.  </P> <P> "It does seem I've always run against the crowd," she says.  </P></p>

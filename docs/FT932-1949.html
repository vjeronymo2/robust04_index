			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Izetbegovic plea for end to arms ban PRESIDENT Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia last night made an urgent appeal to the European Community to lift the arms embargo against his country. However, he received no encouragement from the EC's 'troika' of foreign ministers from Britain, Denmark and Belgium representing the former, present and next presidency of the Community. Mr Niels Petersen, Danish foreign minister, said: 'In my view it is not a sound idea to lift the weapons embargo; it would require a Security Council resolution, which is not forthcoming, it would lead to more fighting, and there would be great danger that United Nations forces would have to be withdrawn.' But it was learned last night that Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany may be preparing to argue in favour of lifting the embargo. Mr Izetbegovic said: 'We request that the arms embargo be lifted to import a limited quantity of defensive weapons. The arms embargo deprives Bosnia of the right to legitimate defence, it has made the aggressor reluctant to negotiate. Those who argue for the arms embargo want the capitulation of Bosnia-Hercegovina.' The president was ambivalent about whether he would take part in future Geneva negotiations. 'We cannot decide this here,' he said. 'We must go back to Sarajevo to consult the government and the parliament. 'But we shall never participate in negotiations which are a cover for further territorial aims of the Serbs. If the Serbs continue to take over territory we will not take part in negotiations.' Mr Petersen said that the final Community response to the deteriorating situation in Bosnia would have to be taken later by the 12 heads of government. 'It is premature to say what the European Community will decide tonight or tomorrow,' he said. But he added: 'We are fully committed to the principles of the London conference. But the Community will not pressure the Bosnian government into any agreement it does not want. We just say it is important to negotiate.'</p>

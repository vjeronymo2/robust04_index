			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Sharp turnround to Pounds 1.6m at Dencora A general improvement in the value of commercial property helped Dencora, the property and housebuilding group, to its first yearly increase in profits since 1988. Pre-tax profit in 1993 was Pounds 1.58m, compared with a loss of Pounds 984,000 in the previous year. Total turnover - including rental income of Pounds 9.23m (Pounds 8.73m) - was up by 44 per cent to Pounds 29.6m (Pounds 20.6m). The group's investment property portfolio increased in value by 5 per cent, allowing for additions and disposals. Selling prices in the housing market stabilised after severe reductions in previous years, but the improvement was not as high as anticipated. The housebuilding subsidiaries sold 192 houses in the year, compared with 149 in 1992, an increase of 29 per cent. Basic earnings per share were 3.7p, against losses of 7.4p. Fully diluted earnings were 5p (losses of 3.3p). A single distribution of 3.3p (3p) is proposed. Mr John Bushell, chairman, said that for the year ahead the development market for commercial property was becoming more active and the group was 'well placed to take advantage of improved market conditions'. The group also expected an improvement in the housing market, in terms of demand and selling prices. Most activity for Dencora is anticipated in the second half of the year, because of the timing of its construction programme on new sites.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / European Elections: Ex-PMs and Greek soccer coach vie for Euro-seats Elections for the European parliament can be an arduous business - at least for those keeping track of the candidates. Officials in Brussels yesterday counted 10,210 hopefuls in the race, spread across 304 lists in the 12 countries. Across Europe 269m eligible voters will send deputies to a 567-strong parliament. However, the absence of a common electoral system, and the concentration on national rather than European issues, makes it difficult to regard the poll as a genuine transnational contest. The contestants range from the 'Shooting, Fishing and Nature' ticket in France to the Popular Monarchist Party in Portugal, campaigning - among other things - against Brussels-imposed uniformity on the length of condoms. Among the candidates are a bevy of former prime ministers (and one sitting one, Italy's Mr Silvio Berlusconi), German Green party activist Mr Daniel ('Dany the Red') Cohn-Bendit, and Mrs Helene Carrere d'Encausse, well-known French author and specialist on Russia. More down-to-earth, they include the former secretary of Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, and the Greek football team coach. Two businessmen candidates, Mr Jose Maria Ruiz-Mateos, former head of Spain's collapsed Rumasa business empire, and France's Mr Bernard Tapie, are hoping a good score from the voters will give them immunity from creditors and prosecutors. Eleven of the states use some form of proportional representation. The exception is Britain with its first-past-the-post constituency system. Most countries on the Continent deploy national party lists to determine seat allocations - a form of voting that makes it difficult for voters to establish a direct link with the people they are sending to parliament. Party lists are usually headed by familiar faces backed up by a cast of unknown names, most of whom hardly feature in the campaign. 'The top names are often drawn purely for public relations purposes,' a European parliament official concedes. Mr Michel Rocard, former French prime minister, is heading his party's list in France and is almost certain of election. But he is almost equally certain to step down again when he starts campaigning for French presidential elections next year. Among other well-known politicians campaigning are Mr Poul Schluter, the former Danish prime minister, who heads his country's conservative list, and Mr Leo Tindemans and Mr Wilfried Martens, two Belgian ex-prime ministers. One sign of cross-party ties in Denmark is the presence on the list for the Radical Liberal party of Ms Lone Dybkjaer, who lives with the Social Democratic prime minister, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. In Italy, Mr Berlusconi, the victor of the March general election, is heading the list of his Forza Italia party in all five Italian regional constituencies, even though as a member of a national government he is prohibited from taking up a seat. Mr Francesco Bove, a candidate in central Italy, defends Mr Berlusconi's 'symbolic' candidature as an indication of the importance which the new government gives to Europe. A more down-to-earth line is being taken by Mr Berlusconi's main coalition partner, the federalist Northern League. Mr Marco Formentini, mayor of Milan, and one of the League's prospective MEPs, says the presence of several local mayors on the party's list shows how the League wants to put 'a strong popular feeling into the construction of Europe'. The practice of packing lists with prestige figures, tame party bureaucrats or political has-beens is particularly prevalent in southern European countries and the list system can sometimes push valuable candidates out into the cold. Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, the French leader of the Socialist group at Strasbourg, and an influential figure in the outgoing assembly, has merited only 11th place on the French Socialist party list, displaced by a clutch of former Socialist ministers. Another Socialist party casualty, this time in Portugal, was Mr Joao Cravinho, an experienced MEP, who was passed over as number two in the list in favour of Mr Joao Soares, son of Portuguese President Mario Soares. 'Portuguese candidates for the European elections are chosen, with a few exceptions, because they are no longer required for national politics or because they have earned a sabbatical,' says Mr Antonio Barreto, a political analyst and member of the Portuguese Socialist party. In the Netherlands, a conflict of interest between national and European parliamentary obligations disturbed preparation of the Labour party's list. Party managers wanted its leading candidate, Ms Hedy D'Ancona, the current minister of culture, to stand both for Strasbourg and for the national parliament in the general elections on May 3. However, the Labour party congress turned down the idea, forcing Ms D'Ancona to drop her national ambitions. 'The party's members considered each of the jobs to be full-time posts,' a Labour party spokesman says. The German Social Democratic party (SPD) offers an instructive example of how a strict quota system influences the choice of prospective members of the European Parliament. The SPD's national executive draws up lists reflecting the requirement that every second name among the top 10 candidates must be a woman. In the top 40 - the number realistically expected to be elected - at least 40 per cent must be female. Additionally, there has to be at least one east German in the top 10 names, while in the top 40, at least one MEP from each of the five east German Lander is designed to be elected. At a European party conference called to endorse the lists, one sitting German SPD MEP objected that he had been allocated too lowly a place. Decisions on lists are sometimes made for contradictory reasons. In Spain, Mr Fernando Moran, the 68-year-old former foreign minister, is heading the Socialist list for the third time. The party hopes Mr Moran's popularity will help stave off humiliating defeat, even though it is widely recognised that he does not get on with Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, who sacked him from the cabinet eight years ago. In Portugal, the main candidate chosen by the governing Social Democratic party (PSD) reflects its new stance of putting Portuguese interests before visions of Europe. Mr Eurico de Melo is a crusty elder statesman on the right of the party better known for his influence in northern Portuguese business lobbying than for interest in European affairs. Mr de Melo's lack of detailed knowledge of European issues was so clearly exposed during the early stages of the campaign that he refused to participate in television debates - until TV stations threatened to fill his place with an empty chair.  -------------------------------------------------------------------              EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE

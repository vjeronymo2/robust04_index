			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Fears grow for charities as cash crisis worsens CHARITIES are stretched to their financial limits and face a growing funding crisis, says a survey published today. The Top 1,000 charities guide published by Hemmington Scott is the first attempt to compare financial information across so many voluntary organisations. It shows that most are struggling to match expenditure by income. Expenditure was found to be growing faster than income, with 97 per cent of income spent in the most recent financial year compared with 95 per cent in the previous year. Net asset cover dropped sharply. Total assets of the charities are more than Pounds 20bn. But most charities cannot rely on assets for future income - most assets are concentrated in a few charities. The study includes 1,365 charities that are ranked in the top 1,000 by one or more of the categories of income, expenditure or assets. It is based on the most recent annual reports. The wealthiest charity, the Wellcome Trust, has Pounds 5.1bn in funds, while the top five alone account for nearly half of all the assets held by the leading 1,000. 'There are tremendous demands on charities which are not going to be met by increased income,' said Mr Peter Scott, the guide's compiler. 'They have stretched things as far as they can. There is going to be a real problem.' Auditors to eight of the charities expressed doubts in the accounts about their continued survival, including the London Zoological Society, the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, and the Aldeburgh Foundation music charity. The highest contribution of money or resources to charities among quoted companies came from BP, with Pounds 28.1m, followed by British Telecommunications, British Gas and National Westminster Bank. More than 670 quoted companies gave no money in their most recent financial year. The survey revalued assets shown in charities' accounts by Pounds 7.7bn to bring them into line with market prices. That is still a substantial under-estimate because many values cannot be readily determined. A quarter of the top 1,000 charities derived some income from trading operations, but 21 made a loss on these activities, including the British Red Cross Society and the Marie Curie Foundation. Oxfam spent more than any other charity on publicity and fundraising - Pounds 12m in 1992 - followed by Barnado's, Save the Children Fund and Help the Aged. Average spending on fundraising was 10 per cent of voluntary income generated. Mr Scott stressed that most charities were efficiently run. The analysis highlighted a tremendous diversity of accounting practices. For example, many charities put figures in their reserves rather than showing them in the profit and loss account. That is an issue which will be addressed on Thursday when the Charity Commission publishes a new draft statement on accounting practice. The Henderson Top 1,000 charities.

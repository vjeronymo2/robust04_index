			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> VOLCANO SUNS RENEW DINFUL BURMA'S LEGACY  </P> <P> All that noise about all that noise emanating from Seattle's hot Sub Pop  records seems a tad silly, historically speaking, given the sophisticatedly  sculpted din made in the early '80s by Boston's late Mission of Burma -- not to  mention progenitor Iggy Pop.  </P> <P> Both the history and the silliness were acknowledged by bassist Bob Weston of  the Volcano Suns, a trio led by ex-Burma drummer Peter Prescott, when a fan at  the Suns' show at Bogart's in Long Beach on Thursday shouted for something by  Iggy's old Stooges.  </P> <P> "Nah," retorted Weston drolly. "Just listen to anything on Sub Pop."  </P> <P> That comment would boil down to mere pique if the Suns weren't a band that can  walk it like it talks it. The clean-cut, nice-guy look of the trio is reflected  in the tuneful yet urgent musical style. Prescott's clever melodies and rhythm  and tempo shifts and David Kleiler's distinctive, accomplished guitar playing  make complimentary analogies to Husker Du credible. But on Thursday the Suns  never quite achieved the critical mass promised both in name and legacy. STEVE  HOCHMAN  </P></p>

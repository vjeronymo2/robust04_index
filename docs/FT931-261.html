			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Call for Libyan oil sanctions The US is seeking international support for an oil embargo against Libya to force it to extradite two men accused of blowing up a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, writes George Graham in Washington. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, told Congress yesterday he was frustrated with Libya's refusal to send the men for trial in the US or the UK. 'I think the time has come to stiffen the embargo against Libya.' Existing sanctions, imposed by the UN Security Council a year ago, are largely limited to restrictions on the number and movements of Libyan diplomats and a ban on international flights to and from the country.</p>

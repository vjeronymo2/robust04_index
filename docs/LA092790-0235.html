			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> N. HOLLYWOOD YOUTH HELD IN CRIME SPREE; MURDER CHARGE SOUGHT  </P> <P> A 17-year-old North Hollywood boy was arrested this morning as a suspect in a  one-day crime spree that included the killing of a rival gang member, the  attempted murder of another, the robbery of three women and the theft and arson  of a car, Los Angeles police said.  </P> <P> At least three other gang members are being sought as the suspect's  accomplices, police said.  </P> <P> The youth was arrested at his home during a 7 a.m. raid by detectives  investigating the shooting Sunday of Daniel Solis and Sayeed Fayad, both 19 and  of North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Solis was killed and Fayad was critically injured when they were gunned down in  an alley behind the 13100 block of Victory Boulevard in Van Nuys. Police termed  the shooting a "setup" because the two victims were shot as they approached a  car they thought contained members of a friendly gang. The youths in the car  had exchanged "passwords" with the victims before the shooting started.  </P> <P> The youth arrested this morning is believed to be the person who fired the gun.  Detective James Vojtecky said police were led to him by identifications from  witnesses and undisclosed evidence relating to the car used in the shooting.  </P> <P> Authorities found the car in the 14000 block of Sherman Way on Tuesday. It had  been stripped and set on fire. Detectives learned it had been reported stolen  about three hours before Solis and Sayeed were shot at 3:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Vojtecky said three women were in the car on a North Hollywood street when they  were approached by four youths who robbed them of their purses and took the  car. He said the suspect arrested in the shooting was also identified as one of  the robbers.  </P> <P> The suspect was being held without bail on suspicion of murder at the Sylmar  Juvenile Hall. Vojtecky said detectives will ask the Los Angeles County  district attorney's office to file charges of murder, attempted murder,  robbery, car theft and arson against him Friday.  </P></p>

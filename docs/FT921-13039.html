			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Rules on developing farm land relaxed PLANNING guidelines that will allow greater opportunity for the development of new businesses on two thirds of Britain's agricultural land - about 15m acres - were announced by the government yesterday. The guidelines will make it much easier to establish businesses such as high-technology companies, electronics and printing on agricultural land of moderate or poor quality. Those categories form the bulk of Britain's farm land, much of it given over to grass in areas such as Kent, Sussex, Norfolk and the Cotswolds. The proposal brought an angry reaction from conservationists. Mr Andrew Wilson, senior policy officer at the Council for the Protection of Rural England, said: 'We are very concerned about it. The policy puts a big question mark over the government's green credentials.' The new guidance on the countryside and the rural economy, which goes out to local planning authorities, says 'little weight need normally be given' to the loss of farm land of moderate or poor quality when drawing up development plans. It does add that the best and most versatile agricultural land, which makes up the remaining third, is a national resource for the future. 'Considerable weight should be given to protecting such land against development because of its special importance,' the guidance says. Mr Tim Yeo, junior planning minister, said the government had a balanced approach to the question of developing agricultural land. He saw no justification for believing the rural environment was improved by freezing development and making it harder for businesses to flourish. It was still open for local authorities to attach conditions to planning permissions on farm land development. The guidance also says there should be no reason to prevent the adaptation of rural buildings to business use provided the development is in keeping with its surroundings.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We are indignant. The time has come to apportion  blame, Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos said  this morning as he arrived at the entrance of the building where  the European Union [EU] Council of Foreign Ministers will meet  today.    Our correspondent in Brussels Nikolaos Bellos reports that  discussion of the tragedy in Sarajevo will take place late this  afternoon chaired by Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias.  The meeting will seek to form a unified stance by the 12 EU  members to deal with the problem. The development of the  discussion cannot be determined right now because most member  countries have not made their positions public. Our  correspondent reports that the only thing certain is that at  least three countries, Germany, France, and Belgium, will ask  the others to agree to harden the EU position.</p>

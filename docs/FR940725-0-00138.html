			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Dangerous atmosphere'' means an atmosphere that may expose employees to the risk of death, incapacitation, impairment of ability to self-rescue (i.e., escape unaided from a confined or enclosed space), injury, or acute illness. Although no definition of this term was proposed, the Agency believes that it is essential for employers and employees to know what a dangerous atmosphere is in the application of revised Subpart B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule includes a definition of the term ``Director'', which means the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health or his or her designated representative. This term is used in revised Subpart B, so OSHA has adopted a definition based on Section 3 of the OSH Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``entry'' refers to the act by which a person passes through an opening into a space and to the work performed in that space. Entry is considered to have occurred as soon as any part of the entrant's body breaks the plane of an opening into the space. This term was not included in the proposed revision of Subpart B, but OSHA believes that its inclusion is necessary for clarity. The definition has been taken from &sect;1910.146(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``Enter with Restrictions'' denotes a space where entry is only permitted under specified conditions of engineering controls, personal protective equipment, clothing, and time. Although this term was not defined in the proposal, the definition of this term has been included in the final rule to help clarify when entry is permitted and when it is prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, the term ``Not Safe for Workers'' was used to describe compartments or spaces that do not meet the minimum safety criteria necessary to permit unrestricted entry. The term was used to describe either of two situations that occur. In the first, the space was not safe for workers to enter unless personal protective equipment was worn or unless the length of time of employee exposure was limited. In the second, the space was not safe for entry under any circumstances, regardless of whether personal protective equipment was worn. To address this seeming contradiction, OSHA requested comments on the issue of whether or not a separate category of ``Safe with Restrictions'' should be included in proposed Subpart B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three commenters opposed the adoption of an additional category of spaces (Ex. 6&hyph;4, 6&hyph;5, 6&hyph;8). They argued that the term ``Safe with Restrictions'' might not be understood by all workers and that the term ``Not Safe for Workers'' was not only more appropriate, but safer as well. For example, Sound Testing, Inc. (Ex. 6&hyph;8), stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If everyone, or even if most people, in the shipyards wore respirators, I would see ``safe with restrictions'' as a primary designation. But, that's not the case. Moreover, some one third of shipyard workers are reputed to be functionally illiterate. Thus, ``Safe with Restrictions'' needlessly complicates certificate language. In the most simple terms, a tank is either safe or not safe, and the workman deserves to be told straightforwardly which is the case. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other commenters supported the additional designation (Ex. 6&hyph;10, 6&hyph;13, 6&hyph;15, 6&hyph;18, 6&hyph;21, 6&hyph;22, 6&hyph;23, 6&hyph;24, 6&hyph;27, 6&hyph;28, 6&hyph;33, 6&hyph;34, 6&hyph;37, 6&hyph;38). They believed that the extra designation would recognize existing safe work practices under the OSHA standard. For example, the U.S. Department of Transportation (Ex. 6&hyph;13) stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Engineering controls are not always capable of reducing confined space hazards to ``safe'' levels. By recognizing and addressing the existing use of certificates with restrictions, additional protection may be realized. Particular restrictions will be placed on a space after consideration by the Marine Chemist and an employer's representative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such certificates should not be issued for convenience or for the purpose of avoiding the use of preferred control measures. In addressing this practice under Part 1915, OSHA should specify that entering such spaces is only allowed when preferred engineering controls are used to the greatest extent feasible and found to be inadequate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some of these rulemaking participants believed that the term ``Enter with Restrictions'' was a more appropriate description of the type of location involved (Ex. 6&hyph;10, 6&hyph;21, 6&hyph;22, 6&hyph;23, 6&hyph;24, 6&hyph;27, 6&hyph;28, 6&hyph;33, 6&hyph;34, 6&hyph;37, 6&hyph;38). NFPA (Ex. 6&hyph;10) stated their reasoning behind this suggested term, as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> NFPA supports the addition of some provision for ``restricted entry''. NFPA does not support the use of the word ``safe'' in this case since it may be misconstrued and it would be inconsistent with the ``Enter With Restrictions'' designation in NFPA 306. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA agrees with the commenters who supported the use of the term ``Enter with Restrictions''. The Agency believes that this term better describes the intent of requirements that are intended to limit rather than strictly prohibit employee entry under all conditions. For example, &sect;1915.12(c)(3) recognizes that a Marine Chemist or a Certified industrial hygienist may designate a space as ``Enter with Restrictions'' and may provide a list of protective measures to be taken before entry is allowed. Additionally, this term is consistent with the terminology used in NFPA 306, with which most shipyard employers are familiar and with which they are complying. For these reasons, OSHA is incorporating this term in revised Subpart B wherever entry is permitted under certain conditions and is using the term ``Not Safe for Workers'' wherever entry is strictly forbidden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

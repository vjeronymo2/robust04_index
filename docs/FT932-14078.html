			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / UN races against time to disarm Moslems: UK to appeal for caution in any new military initiatives to end Bosnian conflict UNITED NATIONS forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday formally asked for more time to disarm Bosnian Moslem troops in the besieged town of Srebrenica, but the request was rejected in advance by the Bosnian Serb army. Failure to disarm the Moslem troops by today's noon deadline could wreck the ceasefire negotiated by Bosnian Serb and Moslem military commanders last weekend. The UN Protection Force (Unprofor), which has asked for a 72-hour extension of the limit, has admitted that only a few of the town's Moslem defenders have so far surrendered their weapons. However, General Milan Gvero, deputy commander of Bosnian Serb forces, has insisted the disarmament pact be carried out to the letter. An Unprofor official said the peacekeepers, who were due to meet representatives of the warring parties at Sarajevo airport yesterday, would also renew efforts to persuade the Serbs to withdraw from the perimeter of Srebrenica to beyond gunfire range. The UN said it had not yet determined the parameters of the 'safe zone' to be established around the town. It has also proposed the creation of similar safe havens around Gorazde and Zepa, the last two remaining Moslem strongholds in eastern Bosnia. The Bosnian Serb army protested yesterday to UN peacekeepers against the flights of two Nato F-16 jets, which 'buzzed' the Bosnian town of Banja Luka for the second consecutive day, the Tanjug news agency reported. Meanwhile, Britain is expected to press the case for caution over any new military initiatives in Bosnia during two days of talks in the US between Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, and his US counterpart, Mr Les Aspin. Mounting pressure for more forceful western action is expected to dominate the talks. The talks follow a brief meeting in London on Monday night between Mr Rifkind and Mr Francois Leotard, French defence minister, who agreed that military action to try to stop the fighting in Bosnia would jeopardise UN humanitarian efforts and endanger the lives of British and French troops protecting aid convoys. In Washington, President Bill Clinton yesterday summoned his top foreign and military policy advisers for briefings on what the White House called the 'very serious' situation in Bosnia. The US Senate armed services committee was told by General John Shalikashvili, supreme allied commander of Nato, that air strikes against Serb forces in Bosnia would be difficult and probably would not force a peace agreement. Serb guns were often hidden in populated areas so they could not be hit without civilians being hurt, he said. The intensified talks between western allies coincided with preparations by Lord Owen, the European Community's peace mediator, to fly to Belgrade. He is expected to have a frosty reception today when he meets Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic. With only five days to go to a UN deadline imposing new sanctions on the rump Yugoslavia unless Bosnian Serbs agree to sign the Vance-Owen peace plan, Lord Owen will warn the Serbian people they face extended isolation unless they help end the conflict.

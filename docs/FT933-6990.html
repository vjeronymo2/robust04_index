			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Consumer confidence at low ebb in the EC CONSUMER confidence dropped to record lows in the European Community in June, after slight signs of recovery the previous month, the European Commission said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. The drop took the EC's measure of consumer confidence back to the level recorded in March and April. 'The loss of confidence is particularly discernible in Spain, Italy and Portugal,' the Commission said, adding that Spain and Portugal recording new lows. 'Taking the average for the Community, consumers view their current and future financial situations more pessimistically in June than in previous months. 'They are even more sceptical about the general economic situation: well over half were of the opinion that the situation had deteriorated further in June compared with the same month last year.' The Commission said there was also a distinct absence of cheer from consumers looking at the next 12 months. As a result of recession, industry, too, saw the future as gloomier, the Commission said. The leading economic indicator for the European Community also dipped to a record low in June after a slight rise in May, losing 0.5 of an index point to 95.6, the Commission said. The previous record low of 95.7 was set in March.</p>

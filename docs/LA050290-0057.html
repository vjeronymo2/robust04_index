			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DARMAN URGES OPTIMISM ON U.S. FUTURE  </P> <P> In one of his rare public speeches, Richard G. Darman, director of the White  House Office of Management and Budget, Tuesday attacked the  "America-is-in-decline" mood that he said he worries has captured the popular  imagination in recent years.  </P> <P> "As history seems to be moving America's way, America is less than fully  conscious of its own continuing primacy," Darman said in a speech delivered at  Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. "U.S. opinion leaders seem  less than fully confident of America's vital destiny, its unique capacity to  move the world toward new frontiers in the 21st Century."  </P> <P> The speech marks an ironic turnabout for Darman, who himself attracted  widespread attention in the past for his attacks on the self-indulgence of  American society in the 1980s and implied criticism of certain policies of the  Ronald Reagan Administration that he helped to carry out. A text of the speech  was made available by Darman's office here.  </P> <P> This time, while repeating some of his familiar themes, Darman's emphasis was  much more upbeat, encouraging Americans to be more optimistic about their  future by overcoming what he called the nation's "fear of flying."  </P> <P> Characteristically indulging his own taste for mixing metaphors from pop  culture with historical imagery, Darman challenged those he claimed are  threatening to undermine the American romantic spirit, with its love of  freedom, distrust of authority and pioneering taste for heroics.  </P> <P> To Darman, one enemy of the American romantic spirit is the "alluring romantic  image" of the "simple, bucolic, blue-green planet, untainted by competitive  industrial advance, unmarked by 'artificial' boundaries of competing  nation-states." The image, he argued, holds a strong appeal to many  environmental activists.  </P> <P> Darman has emerged as one of the Bush Administration's strongest internal  skeptics of environmental activism and a harsh critic of Environmental  Protection Agency head William K. Reilly. While saying that "in the main,  environmentalism is benign and well-intended," and half-jokingly acknowledging  that "my wife and children are environmentalists. The President is an  environmentalist," Darman also argued that it is "a green mask under which  different faces of politico-economic ideology can hide."  </P> <P> He argued that some environmentalists see the movement as a way to promote an  anti-growth global management regime that is at odds with the free market,  progress-oriented approach so popular in the United States.  </P> <P> "Americans did not fight and win the wars of the 20th Century to make the world  safe for green vegetables," he said.  </P> <P> In a relatively brief discussion of the challenges facing him directly as  President Bush's budget director, Darman set out his goals for budget  negotiations with congressional leaders -- talks widely expected to begin soon.  </P> <P> He ticked off several goals, including a reform of the budget process, a  slowdown in the growth of benefit programs like Medicare, Social Security and  farm subsidies, an effort to cap the government's hidden liabilities and reform  of federal accounting controls.  </P> <P> Darman also repeated recent statements that the Bush Administration might go  along with certain increases in revenues, but stated more clearly that he means  by that a cut in the capital gains tax and higher user fees rather than any  rise in income taxes.  </P></p>

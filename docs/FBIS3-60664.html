			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Perception of N-Policy"] </F>   [Text] The question as to whether there is any meeting  point in the US administration's position on the Pressler  Amendment and that of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's, can be  answered in different ways. The US position as of today is that  the Pressler Amendment is not going to be removed, only its  debilitating effect on the US President's inherent executive  powers, may be neutralised through another law. Ms Bhutto, on  the other hand, has been saying that her government would keep  pressing the US to dismantle the Amendment because being  country-specific, it is a bad law. The law, in fact, is not  only bad, it is also the only law of its kind in the US  legislative history which seeks to penalise a friendly country  (also its ally for a long time) and exempt from its application  those who have been in the opposite camp and worked against US  interests. There being a major moral anomaly involved in the  application of this law, Ms Bhutto's plea makes sense.  Therefore, on the face of it, there is no meeting point between  the US position and that of Pakistan. Yet for all its apparent  distance, the question may in its actual thrust may either be of  semantics or of political tact. The US Congress, having been  fed for a long time by the joint Israel-Indian lobby on the  evils of nuclear technology in the hands of an Islamic country,  may not be willing to countenance any move which would in effect  amount to condoning Pakistan's `misstep'. Paradoxical as it may  seem, the pro-Pressler lobby in the US congress believes that  while Pakistan's alliance is of value to US strategic interests  in that region, as was proved during the war in Afghanistan, it  is less reliable than India where nuclear technology is  concerned. To disabuse that lobby of this notion and persuade  it to treat Pakistan and India at par, may take some time and  effort. It could be that the US administration is unwilling to  make that effort. It may have thus chosen the less prickly  option of seeking for the President the same discretionary  powers of waiver in the case of the Pressler Amendment, which he  has in the case of most other US laws.    On principle, the PM's stance of `no rollback' on the one  hand and of protest against a bad US law on the other, is  morally right. Whether that would place the US administration in  a difficult position vis-a-vis its Congress, is however, another  matter. Yet it is obvious that both positions have been forced  on the two governments by internal considerations. With the  Opposition in Pakistan shouting betrayal, Benazir is obliged to  talk openly on a subject which had best been kept confidential  and the US administration may have found it necessary to keep  the hardliners in the Congress mollified for a similar reason.  Looked at from this angle the demand in Pakistan for an open  debate on our nuclear policy, may not be in the best interest of  the country. An in-camera debate would be far better, if at all  it is unavoidable.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Odinets report: "More Spies"] </F>   [Text] Kiev -- Ukraine has recently become an attractive  spot for the most diverse people from the furthest corners of  the globe. It has been receiving tourists, businessmen,  missionaries, merchants, intelligence agents....    The special services are particularly interested in the  Dnepropetrovsk region, where Ukraine's considerable scientific  and industrial defense potential is concentrated. In a  published statement Lieutenant General V. Slobodyanyuka [name as  transliterated], chief of the Dnepropetrovsk Oblast Security  Service, states that last year staffers from the Ukrainian  Security Service administration monitored the unofficial  presence in the region of more than 30 career foreign  intelligence agents under different covers, as well as a large  number of people suspected of involvement with foreign special  services.    Attempts to set up two [intelligence-gathering] stations in  the oblast were blocked by the counterintelligence department.  Hostile operations on the part of a number of European  countries, as well as the United States, China, and Near East  countries have been uncovered. Foreign professionals, as the  general put it, are making active use on the region's territory  of the entire known arsenal of subversive intelligence work --  from recruiting local citizens and gathering information through  legal sources (the press) to the most sophisticated means of  electronic espionage.</p>

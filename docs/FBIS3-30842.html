He will attend the  meeting of the eight countries bordering on former Yugoslavia  called on the initiative of Yugomediators Owen and Stoltenberg,  within the framework of the international peace conference on  former Yugoslavia.    According to the Bulgarian diplomat, this would be an  informal discussion, intended to take into account the views of  neighbouring states and the influence they could have on the  three warring parties, with a view to containing and a peaceful  settlement to the conflict.    We think the problem should be resolved in a peaceful way,  said Daskalov. On the other hand, the siege of Sarajevo has to  be lifted, and if military strikes should be resorted to, this  should be done under UN auspices, he also said.    Asked to comment on the message by Turkish President Demirel  to Bulgarian President Zhelev, Minister Daskalov said it did not  make clear what was meant by military intervention. Bulgaria  has not changed its position, it is against the lifting of the  arms embargo on Bosnia, the minister stressed.    Yesterday the Bulgarian president's Press Office announced  that president Zhelyu Zhelev had received a letter from Turkish  President Suleyman Demirel. In connection with the tragic  events in Sarajevo the Turkish president had called on the  Bulgarian president to support the latest initiatives of the  international community for military intervention to put an end  to the bloodshed, according to the president's Press Office.</p>

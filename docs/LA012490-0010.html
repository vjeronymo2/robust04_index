			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TORRES OPTS FOR 'INSECTS OVER POISON,' UNVEILS 2 ANTI-MALATHION BILLS  </P> <P> The first major political attack against the state's policy of aerial pesticide  spraying to control the Medfly was launched in Los Angeles Tuesday by state  Sen. Art Torres, who introduced two bills that would bring an immediate halt to  the use of malathion in urban areas.  </P> <P> Torres' bills, which will almost certainly face stiff opposition from the  influential agriculture lobby, were presented at a rally at Huntington Drive  Elementary School, where 100 supporters cheered as the Los Angeles Democrat  lambasted Republican Gov. George Deukmejian and other state officials for their  "incompetence" and "senseless" backing of aerial spraying.  </P> <P> "Their attitude has been spray today and ask questions later," Torres said.  "This repeated spraying is simply unacceptable. . . . Toxic chemicals should  not be part of our lives."  </P> <P> The bills would ban repeated aerial pesticide spraying and require proof from  state agencies, in the form of detailed studies and assessments, that any  pesticide used will be effective in eradicating the Medfly and not endanger the  public or the environment.  </P> <P> Together, the measures would effectively stop the state's current aerial  spraying program, Torres said.  </P> <P> The bills also call for a full environmental review of any future state  eradication efforts, public notice before any pesticide application and an  ongoing health monitoring program.  </P> <P> State health and agriculture officials have maintained that malathion spraying  is one of the safest and most effective ways to wipe out the pesky  Mediterranean fruit fly, which has infested 372 square miles of Los Angeles and  Orange counties.  </P> <P> But Torres said continuing questions about the pesticide's safety from the  public demand an end to spraying, even if it means living with the Medfly  forever.  </P> <P> "I can live with insects over poison," he said.  </P> <P> Opponents of the spraying cheered the measures as a sign of the building  political momentum to stop the aerial assault against the Medfly.  </P> <P> "I think it's great; he's taken a stand where so far no one else has," said  Michael Bell, a coordinator of the citizens group, Safe Alternatives to Fruit  Fly Eradication (SAFE). "It better pass."  </P> <P> But Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the state Department of Food and  Agriculture, said the bills are simply "political rhetoric" aimed at placating  voters and not dealing rationally or scientifically with the current  infestation.  </P> <P> Siddiqui, who is in charge of the eradication effort, said malathion is safe in  the minute doses used and is by far the most effective means of destroying the  Medfly.  </P> <P> If the state were prohibited from using the pesticide, the current infestation  could blossom into a statewide disaster that could cost billions of dollars in  crop damage and lost jobs, officials say.  </P> <P> "It will present an extreme danger to the fruit industry and the California  environment," Siddiqui said.  </P> <P> He added that, if urban spraying is stopped, more pesticides, not less, will  have to be used on crops in rural areas to stop the fly.  </P> <P> The bills also face a formidable challenge in the Legislature that may make the  measures nothing more than wishful thinking.  </P> <P> Mike Durando, president of the Fresno-based California Grape and Tree Fruit  League, promised an aggressive campaign by growers to stop the legislation.  </P> <P> "There is no way it is going to get through," he said.  </P> <P> An example of agriculture's might is a bill rural legislators pushed through in  1985 that scrapped environmental impact reports on all pesticide spraying and  limited legal challenges to aerial spraying programs.  </P> <P> Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino), chairman of the state Senate Agriculture Committee,  also predicted tough going for Torres' bills.  </P> <P> Legislation "as extreme as this isn't going to make it through," he said.  "Let's face it. Even if they cleared both houses, the governor would just  veto."  </P> <P> Torres agreed the bills face an uphill battle, but he said he believed the  political tide is beginning to turn against the spraying.  </P> <P> Demonstrations have been held for the last two weeks in Los Angeles County, and  a growing number of cities -- such as Norwalk, Monterey Park, Huntington Beach  and Garden Grove -- have passed resolutions denouncing the aerial spraying.  </P> <P> Torres said it will probably take about two months for the bills' fate to be  decided. The bills are being submitted as emergency measures that would allow  them to be implemented immediately if approved.  </P> <P> TONIGHT'S SPRAYING MAP: B2  </P></p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Italian banks increase prime rate to 14% SEVERAL Italian commercial banks yesterday raised their prime rate from 13.5 per cent to 14 per cent in reaction to a series of increases in short-term money rates by the Bank of Italy last week. The central bank's moves were aimed at shoring up the lira. Pressure on the lira eased slightly yesterday as the markets had time to take a more measured judgment of the impact of the Irish referendum vote on Friday in favour of the Maastricht Treaty. Ever since the Danes rejected the treaty in a referendum at the beginning of the month, businessmen and bankers have been concerned that the process of closer European integration would be slowed and the resolve of the Italian authorities to tackle the country's deteriorating public finances would be weakened. As a result the lira has come under heavy pressure and the bank has been forced to intervene both in the foreign exchange markets by selling D-Marks and by raising domestic interest rates. Yesterday the lira was being traded at 755.9 against the D-Mark. This compares with the 765 floor against the D-Mark permitted under Italy's commitment to the narrow band of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Early on Friday when the outcome of the Irish referendum was still uncertain, the lira was being quoted at 757.8 against the D-Mark. Then as the result clarified the lira strengthened slightly to 756.5. The cost of the central bank's support operations in the foreign exchange markets over the past two weeks is not known. However, in supporting in the domestic market, the bank has been obliged to raise short-term interest rates in the past two weeks by more than 2.5 points. By last weekend the rates paid on short-term repurchase agreements with the commercial banks had reached almost 15 per cent. The delicate state of the lira and such high interest rates have added urgency to the consultations of Prof Giuliano Amato, the deputy leader of the Socialist party, to form a new government. Prof Amato was given the job of forming a government last Thursday and hopes to have a programme outlined to present to parliament by the end of this week. Prof Amato will be obliged to come up with a quick mini-budget to cope with the public sector deficit which has on current projections overshot the 1992 budget estimates. Instead of a public sector deficit held down to L128,000bn (Pounds 58bn) latest projections suggest this will reach L175,000bn by the end of the year. The new government is thus faced with devising means to find an extra L47,000bn, either through raising revenues or by cutting spending.</p>

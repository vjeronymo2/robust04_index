			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Supreme court refuses Citibank appeal THE US supreme court yesterday refused to overturn a ruling that US banks can be held responsible for deposits in their foreign branches, even when those deposits are frozen by a foreign government, writes George Graham. The court refused to hear an appeal by Citibank, the New York banking group, against an appeal court ruling that it must repay with interest a Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.08m) deposit made in Manila in 1983 by the Singapore branch of Wells Fargo Bank, even though the Philippine government had frozen the deposits of all foreign banks. Citibank's appeal had been backed by the Bush administration, which argued in a submission to the supreme court that the appeal court decision would create 'new and unforeseeable liabilities' for US banks 'arising from the unpredictable actions of foreign governments'. Mr Kenneth Starr, the solicitor general, argued that US banks should be held liable in such cases only if the two parties had specifically agreed in advance that the home office should bear responsibility. Citibank said yesterday it would be discussing with bank regulatory agencies whether legislative or regulatory changes might be needed to deal with the consequences of the decision. It would also be discussing with other international banks the possibility of expanding deposit documentation to cover the issue of head office liability.</p>

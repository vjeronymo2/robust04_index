			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Kunick moves to aid share price Kunick, the amusement machine and nursing homes group, yesterday attempted to prop up its ailing share price with a statement that its three UK bankers remained supportive. The shares, which started the week at 3 1/2 p, fell to 2 1/4 p before recovering slightly to 2 1/2 p. Mr Christopher Burnett, who took over as chairman from Mr Russell Smith in May, said the banks were backing Kunick's recovery plans and were continuing to provide facilities on normal terms. Several directors have been buying in the market. Mr Smith lifted his stake by 200,000 shares at 3p a share. He now owns 8.29 per cent of the company.</p>

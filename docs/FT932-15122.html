			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / The Finance Bill: Relief for moving expenses - Job Transfers EMPLOYEES who buy another house because their job requires them to move will be able to claim tax relief on moving expenses, even if they do not plan to sell their former home, the Finance Bill made clear yesterday . The new home must be the employee's main residence. If the former home is rented out, or is just visited at weekends, the new house will qualify as the principal residence, the Inland Revenue said. The main change on tax relief and relocation expenses, announced in the Budget and set out in the bill, introduced a ceiling of Pounds 8,000 on relief from April 6. Before that relief was, in effect, uncapped. The move has been condemned by the Confederation of British Industry which says relocation costs average Pounds 25,000 and can rise to more than Pounds 50,000. The Budget also scrapped concessions on payments to employees if they had to move to more expensive areas. The government said yesterday it intended to introduce two amendments to the Finance Bill at the committee stage. One will provide some relief for employees whose bridging arrangements include a loan from their companies; the other will make it clear that tax relief for international travel will be in addition to relief for removals. It also emerged yesterday that further regulations, beyond the Finance Bill, will be needed to implement all aspects of the new relocation rules. The regulations will be needed so employers do not have to deduct tax under PAYE if total payments and benefits exceed Pounds 8,000.</p>

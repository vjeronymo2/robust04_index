			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> SEAN WATERS;  </P> <P> TOP RUNNER MORRISON LOST TO NORDHOFF AFTER INJURY  </P> <P> It's bad enough Nordhoff High became the fourth team to be beaten up by the  Moorpark Musketeers. But the Rangers suffered their biggest loss when their  leading ground gainer left Friday's game early with an elbow injury.  </P> <P> Senior Jayden Morrison, who leads the team with 286 yards in 51 carries,  dislocated his right elbow in the first quarter of the 34-7 loss. He will be  out four to six weeks.  </P> <P> Morrison, a senior, is the single setback in the Rangers' run-and-shoot  offense.  </P> <P> "We can't afford to lose Jayden," Nordhoff Coach Cliff Farrar said. "We had the  ball inside the five-yard line three times and scored once."  </P> <P> Junior Brett Jackson, who has two carries for one yard, will most likely  replace Morrison. Nordhoff (1-3) has fewer yards rushing (415) than any of the  five leading ground gainers in Ventura County.  </P> <P> Farrar said he isn't afraid to pass on every down if the Rangers continue to  have an ineffective running attack.  </P> <P> "We can throw the ball 60 times if we have to," he said.  </P> <P> Not convinced: Rio Mesa High could very well be undefeated entering its second  Channel League game, but Coach John Reardon is skeptical that the Spartans are  a better than average team.  </P> <P> Rio Mesa has a 3-1 record after convincing victories over Camarillo, Santa  Clara and Hueneme last Friday. The Spartans would be undefeated if they had  successfully made a two-point conversion in the final minute against Channel  Islands.  </P> <P> "We're still untested," Reardon said. "I don't think we've beaten an  outstanding team yet. Santa Clara has an outstanding team for a Division VIII  school. But we compete in a Division II league and there's a big difference."  </P> <P> That test, Reardon believes, will come Friday at Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Showing support: Mike Olgy, who was replaced by Rick Scott as Buena head coach  in 1988, has been a valuable assistant and played an instrumental role  preparing the Bulldogs for Friday's 35-29 win against Oxnard. After hearing  that his father Jack Scott had suffered a stroke in San Gabriel Thursday  morning, Rick Scott left the team in the care of Olgy.  </P> <P> "When I was at the hospital, he ran the team," said Scott, who has become close  friends with Olgy. "He was there to help when I needed him the most. I consider  Mike a co-head coach, not just an assistant. I trust him to run the defense. He  makes his decisions and I make mine."  </P> <P> Roster changes: Fillmore also lost a key player when starting guard/linebacker  Mike Palmateer sustained a broken bone in his left hand. Palmateer, who will be  out four weeks, is the fastest linemen and is the third on the team with 28  tackles. . . . Buena will have two of its top lineman back in uniform. Tackle  Phil Kurta returns after missing four weeks with a broken bone in his left  hand. Guard Terry Hall, who broke a bone in his right foot, will also be back  in the lineup. . . . Joe Elliott, a two-way starter at St. Bonaventure, has  moved with his family to Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Raiders rolling: Moorpark College (3-0) recorded its second consecutive shutout  with a 55-0 pasting of Compton College on Saturday in a Western State  Conference football game.  </P> <P> While the defense has been hitting on all cylinders, Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner  has been looking for a more balanced offense.  </P> <P> Moorpark achieved that balance against Compton in piling up 555 yards of total  offense. Marc Monestime of Thousand Oaks rushed for 137 yards, and Freddie  Bradley of Hueneme ran for 83 yards. Quarterback Jayson Merrill of Newbury Park  completed 12 of 17 passes for 238 yards.  </P> <P> "We're starting to get where we want to be," Bittner said. "We're starting to  get where we're proficient at both running and passing. That's what we're  after."  </P> <P> The Raiders are gearing up for a 1 p.m. home date against defending national  champion Bakersfield on Oct. 14 and should have little trouble this week at  Pierce.  </P> <P> Quick start: Ventura College (3-0, 2-0) has averaged more than 33 points a game  and allowed only eight.  </P> <P> So Saturday's WSC game at West Los Angeles (0-3), which has lost 13 consecutive  games since resuming its program last season and has been outscored 106-9 this  season, should be a sure win, right?  </P> <P> "You compare scores and think we should win," Ventura Coach Phil Passno said.  "But we still have to prove it."  </P> <P> Making special teams special: In a WSC win over Santa Monica on Saturday,  Ventura's special teams blocked a punt that set up a touchdown, blocked a field  goal that would have given Santa Monica a lead, and also blocked a point-after  kick.  </P> <P> "Our special teams made the difference," Passno said. "Our kicking situation  was better than theirs, and it paid off."  </P> <P> Jeff Riley and staff writer Brendan Healey contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: CGT: how to keep those bills within bounds - In this, the last of four articles on capital gains tax, Richard Chant and Alan Sugden deal with the rules on gifts and describe various ways in which you can minimise what you have to pay When gifts of securities are made, other than between husband and wife, any unrealised gain is treated as a chargeable gain of the donor and is included in the donor's assessment for CGT. In some circumstances, all or part of the gain may be held over until the eventual sale by the recipient. The unrealised gain is calculated using the market value at the time of the gift instead of the net proceeds of disposal. Market value This is the price which the security might reasonably be expected to fetch on a sale in the open market. The market value of a security listed on the London Stock Exchange, including the USM, is the lower of: The bid price of the security plus one-quarter of the spread (the difference between the bid price and the offer price) which is known colloquially as 'quarter up.' The figure halfway between the highest and the lowest prices of bargains recorded that day in the stock exchange's Daily Official List. For foreign securities listed on a recognised stock exchange, the basis for calculating the market value is very similar to that for a UK-listed security; the value is converted into sterling at the exchange rate on the date of the gift. Connected persons These include: Your relatives and your husband's or wife's relatives. Your business partners and their relatives, including husbands and wives (except in relation to acquisitions or disposals of partnership assets pursuant to bona fide commercial arrangements). Any company you control. The CGT rules on gifts and other transfers between connected persons deem disposals and acquisitions between them to have taken place at market value whenever they are made, other than by a bargain at arm's length. Subject to certain exceptions, losses on assets transferred between connected persons can be set against gains on another disposal to the same person only while they are still connected. Holding over a capital gain When certain assets are given away, or transferred at lower than market value, the gain may be held over until the eventual sale of the asset. The assets concerned are gifts of business and heritage property, gifts to discretionary trusts, and gifts to most political parties. The amount of the held-over gain depends on several factors: Where a gift is made, or where the consideration does not exceed the cost, the held-over gain is (with certain exceptions) the gain calculated under normal CGT rules. Where the consideration exceeds the cost, the held-over gain will be reduced by the amount of the excess. An election for a gain to be held over must be made within six years of the year in which the gift or transfer was made. It has to be made by the donor and recipient jointly - unless the recipient is a trustee, who can make it alone. MINIMISING YOUR TAX LIABILITY Bed and breakfast This is what happens when you sell all or part of a holding in your portfolio to realise a chargeable gain or to establish an allowable loss, and then buy it back again (because you do not actually want to reduce or dispose of the holding). Neither the Inland Revenue nor the stock exchange publish any rules or guidelines on B&amp;B, so it has been something of a grey area. But here are some guidelines: A B&amp;B should be two real transactions, exposed to risk. The bargain dates on the contract notes should not be the same. The price of the re-purchase should not be agreed in advance. The deals should be done within normal market hours (that is, you should sell before 4.30 pm and re-purchase after 8.30 am the following day). Stamp duty of 0.5 per cent must be paid on the re-purchase. We would expect the broker to charge you, say, 0.5 to 1 per cent on the sale (if you are a good client) but none on the re-purchase. When would a B&amp;B be worth considering? To make a chargeable gain when you have not used up all your annual exemption (Pounds 5,800 in 1993/94). Remember that any unused portion of that exemption cannot be carried forward. To make an allowable loss when your chargeable gains have exceeded your annual exemption. While bed and breakfasting is a grey area, it can sometimes help to reduce or eliminate your CGT liability. But remember that indexation is not going to be allowed to turn a chargeable gain into an allowable loss, or to increase an allowable loss, on disposals on or after November 30 1993. Married couples Since separate taxation for husband and wife was introduced from the 1990/91 tax year, married couples are taxed independently on their capital gains, and each gets a separate annual exemption. Transfers between husband and wife Such transfers do not lead to an immediate CGT charge - providing they are living together at any time in the tax year. They are treated as living together unless they are: Separated under a court order or separation deed. Living apart in circumstances which make permanent separation likely. Normally, the partner receiving the asset is treated as having acquired it at the giving partner's original cost plus indexation to the date of the transfer, rather than at market value at the time of transfer. Taking advantage of separate annual exemptions Transferred holdings being assessed at original cost (plus indexation) to the date of transfer can be particularly valuable when, in any tax year, a husband or wife expects to exceed his or her annual CGT exemption and the other partner does not. Take a husband whose marginal rate of income tax is 40 per cent and wishes to sell 12,000 shares in, say, ICI. He calculates that the capital gain on selling will, after indexation and selling costs, be Pounds 11,600. So, if he sells all of them himself, he will have to pay CGT on Pounds 11,600 minus the annual exemption of Pounds 5,800 - a bill of Pounds 2,320. But suppose that, instead of selling all 12,000 shares himself, he gives half his holding to his wife. Each then sells 6,000 shares, making a chargeable gain of Pounds 5,800. This uses up each one's annual exemption. Thus, the transfer of the shares to his wife saves the husband paying that Pounds 2,320. An alternative way to take maximum advantage of separate exemptions is for husband and wife to own a joint portfolio, although this is not as flexible as separate portfolios. Where a married couple own shares jointly, they are assumed to own them 50/50. Taking advantage of a partner's lower marginal rate of tax Where a spouse has little or no income, it can also be of considerable advantage to arrange for that partner to make the bulk of the capital gains. Say a husband's marginal rate of tax is 40 per cent and his wife has no income. They decide they would like to buy a country cottage for their retirement before property prices start recovering. To raise the money, the husband will have to sell his portfolio of shares in the present tax year, 1993/94. Doing so will produce capital gains of about Pounds 40,000. He decides he can either sell all the shares himself (table 1, case A) or sell enough shares to make Pounds 5,800 of capital gains and give the rest of his portfolio to his wife to sell (case B). The tax payable in each case is shown in table 1. In case B, there is Pounds 6,000 less tax to pay than in case A - enough, perhaps, to pay for most of the repairs and redecoration the cottage needs. How to transfer assets between husband and wife Write to the companies registrar, explaining that you wish to give your shareholding to your husband or wife. The registrar will send you a stock transfer form (STF), which you complete and return together with your share certificate. He will then issue a new share certificate in your partner's name. There is no transfer stamp payable if the shares are transferred as a gift. Any sum paid by the transferee is ignored, and the cost to the transferee for CGT purposes is the transferor's original cost plus indexation to the month of the transfer. Gifts to children All UK residents, including children, are entitled to the CGT annual exemption. Capital gains on assets held by a child are assessed on the child. So if, in any tax year, its capital gains are no more than the annual exemption, there will be no tax to pay. If, for example, the capital gains on a child's assets are Pounds 5,800 in the present year and the donor of the assets is a 40 per cent taxpayer who has already used up his or her annual exemption, the CGT saved would be Pounds 5,800 x 0.4 = Pounds 2,320. (See table 2 for an example of a husband and wife with two children). While assets may be held outright by the child, normally they are held in the name of the parents (or other donor), as nominee, for the child's benefit. Any income is assessable on the parents until the child reaches 18 unless (a) the income from assets given by the parents is less than Pounds 100 a year or (b) the donor of the asset was not one of the parents. Accumulation and maintenance trusts may also be used to invest assets on a child's behalf. Once settled, the assets are treated as assets of the trusts, and income and gains may be liable to tax at a rate higher than that of the donors. The tax advantages of gifts to children can be very useful but there are possible drawbacks. One is that frequent gifts by parents may be regarded by the Revenue as an avoidance of tax by them: the distinction between tax avoidance and tax planning is very fine. Another is that the Revenue could assess a child's tax liability on the person who has control or management of its assets if it is under 18. A third is that the assets held by, or on behalf of, children may become rather more substantial than the donor(s) had expected.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 1: Married couple raising the money to buy a cottage  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Case A                 Case B                                            Husband            Wife Capital gain          Pounds 40,000   Pounds 5,800   Pounds 34,200 Less Annual exemption         5,800          5,800           5,800 Taxable gain                 34,200            Nil          28,400 Capital Gains Tax payable: Husband 34,200 @ 40%         13,680 Wife (Personal allowance of Pounds 3,445 can't be used to offset against capital gains tax)          2,500 @ 20%                                 500         21,200 @ 25%                               5,300          4,700 @ 40%                               1,880         28,400                    Wife's total CGT 7,680 Tax saved in Case B = Pounds 13,680 - Pounds 7,680 = Pounds 6,000  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 2: Gifts to children  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A married couple, both paying a marginal rate of income tax of 40%, have a son and a daughter, both under 18. In 1990 the parents had Pounds 50,000 available, which they might have invested in one of three ways: 1. Pounds 25,000 in each of their own names, or 2. in their joint names, or 3. in their names as nominee for the children.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- In 1993/94 the Pounds 50,000 investment was sold for Pounds 70,000 net of expenses. By the month of disposal the cost of the investment had risen with indexation to an indexed cost of Pounds 56,400. So the capital gain = Pounds 70,000 - Pounds 56,400 = Pounds 13,600. The parents had each used up their annual CGT exemption and had no losses carried forward. Let us look at the CGT payable, firstly if they had invested the Pounds 50,000 in their own names or in their joint names, and secondly if they had invested it in their children's names.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Own or joint names                               Husband             Wife Capital gain             Pounds 6,800     Pounds 6,800 CGT at 40%                      2,720            2,720 Total tax payable Pounds 5,440  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Children's names Assuming each child's own income was less than the annual personal allowance, and remembering that CGT cannot be offset against any unused personal allowance:                                   Son         Daughter Capital gain             Pounds 6,800    Pounds 6,800 Annual exemption               (5,800)         (5,800)                                 1,000           1,000 CGT paid at 20% rate              200             200 Total tax paid = Pounds 400. Tax saving compared with parents investing in their own or in joint names = Pounds 5,040.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- There is also a potential advantage on inheritance tax, providing the donor survives for sufficient years after making the gift to avoid it being aggregated with the donor's estate.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 3: More shares of negligible value  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ordinary shares of the following companies have been added to the list in table 1 of the first CGT article:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abaca (alternative name Zurich group) Alan Paul Alan International Hairdressing (Alternative name Alan of Piccadilly (Holdings) Ltd) Burns Anderson Group Chancery (alternative name Chancery Securities) Clarke Foods Colorgraphic Harland Simon Group Lilley Norton Group (alternative name Minty) Poliform Concrete Swanyard Studios  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

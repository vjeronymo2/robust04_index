			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques or Israel's </F> Deputy?"]    [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful:  The al-Khalil [Hebron] debacle, its repercussions and fallout,  have turned into a revealing incident on the Palestinian scene.  In a defensive reaction in the face of the fury and indignation  of the Islamic world, the Zionist regime has announced that it  is ready to pay reparations to the victims of the al-Khalil  catastrophe.    However, the custodian of the two holy mosques has, in an  unexpected move, accepted the responsibility of paying  reparations on behalf of Israel and has even sanctioned the  amount.    It is not clear what Saudi Arabia's role has been in the  massacre of the fasting worshipers in the shrine of the Prophet  Abraham -- peace be upon him -- that it has even surpassed  Israel in payment of reparations and has even gone a step  further and said that it is ready to do so on behalf of Israel.    Amid all this, one must not ignore the role of Washington.  Right from the outset, Clinton and his associates tried their  best to cover up the catastrophe and to call on the Arab side  participating in the negotiations with Israel to be indifferent  to it and to continue their talks, even in the current  circumstances.    Even though 'Arafat stooped to immense degradation and  lowliness and gave a positive response to this request from  Washington, the other Arab countries suspended the peace process.    Thus, the question arises: What is the motive behind Saudi  Arabia's nauseating attitude in intervening in the al-Khalil  incident? Has this been the Saudi stance right from the outset?  Is Riyadh under pressure from the United States and Israel to  display such generosity? Do the Saudis consider themselves  accomplices to Israel's crime that they are seeking to absolve  themselves by proposing to pay reparations?    These and scores of other questions arise from this  nauseating Saudi attitude and each indicates ambiguities in this  major catastrophe. Thus, facts and figures indicate that the  al-Khalil tragedy is far deeper than can be imagined and, in  fact, is the "common weak spot" of the United States, Israel,  and the al-Sa'uds.    Is this a new test for gauging how despicable the Arab  reactionaries are? What were and are the objectives of  Washington and the Zionists in continuing such actions? These  are questions that, once answered, will yield other information  and strong clues that will reveal that the objective was to  degrade the Arabs and that this was not an accidental or  unexpected incident.    Why is Saudi Arabia's concern greater than that of Israel  and  the United States? Why is it making pledges instead of Israel?  The fact is that Israel is seeking to put the revolutionary  front of Palestinian forces in a defensive position in every  possible way. The al-Khalil massacre on Friday was an action  with many motives that was carried out to intimidate the Muslims  who do not leave the mosques empty even in the early hours of  Ramadan. These actions by Israel were carried out with the  al-Sa'uds paying the expenses.    Saudi Arabia's offer to pay reparations to the victims of  Israeli atrocities will encourage the Zionists to embark on  greater carnage of the oppressed Palestinians, and the stance of  the custodian of the two holy mosques will make him appear to be  the defender of Israel before the Muslims. This indicates that  instead of taking the side of the Palestinians and the victims  of the disaster, the custodian of the two holy mosques has taken  the side of the criminals and the Zionist usurpers.    'Arafat has adopted the same stance and does not even have  anything to say. He acquiesces to everything proposed by the  United States and Israel with his eyes and ears closed. Prior  to this incident, he did not have any respect in the eyes of the  Palestinian nation and the revolutionary forces, but the  al-Khalil catastrophe has dealt such an irrevocable blow to his  prestige that it is unlikely that he will ever recover.    The contemptible reaction by 'Arafat on the al-Khalil  tragedy  proved that not only is he not the spokesman of the  Palestinians, he is not even a Palestinian. This is because he  has tried to declare the case of this crime closed and to ignore  it.    The subtle point that needs to be noted with regard to this  incident is that all the criminals and those who compromised  have been disgraced and have lost all their credibility before  the honorable Palestinian nation and the Islamic world.    Experience has once again proved that there is no solution  but the annihilation of the usurpist Israel and the complete  removal of this cancerous tumor from the center of the oil-rich  region of the Islamic world. Those should be condemned even  more than Israel who claim to be friends of the Palestinian  nation but are, in fact, accomplices in Israel's atrocities.  This is the issue that needs to be understood and that  increases the responsibility of all of us.</p>

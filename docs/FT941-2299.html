			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / MPs to be lobbied on mine pollution A cross-party delegation of Durham county councillors will today lobby MPs and the House of Lords in an attempt to win amendments to the Coal Industry bill, Chris Tighe writes. The delegation wants the bill to spell out who will be legally and financially responsible for minewater pollution, subsidence and methane gas build-up arising from abandoned and working mines after the industry is privatised. The sudden closure of all Durham's remaining pits, removing British Coal's operational need for minewater pumping, has sparked particular concern in the county but the issue has implications for other British coalfields. Bodies including the Country Landowners Association, the National Farmers Union and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have urged the government to make explicit provision in the bill for the transfer of environmental liabilities. The government has said it considers the bill as now drafted to be adequate. Today's delegation will also press for a commitment from the government that British Coal and its successor, the Coal Authority, will continue to pump minewater until a satisfactory solution is achieved, and will be given adequate government resources to meet environmental responsibilities.</p>

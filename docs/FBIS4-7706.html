			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Belgrade, April 5 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces  confirmed Tuesday [5 April] they had broken through government  defence lines in the eastern enclave of Gorazde in response to a  government "offensive" and landed on the western bank of the  Drina River.    In Geneva, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said 50  people had been killed and 250 injured since last week in the  fighting in Goradze.    Chief of staff Manojlo Milovanovic told the Bosnian Serb  agency SRNA he had ordered his troops to launch a  "counter-attack" towards Cajnica, southeast of Gorazde, close to  the Serbian border, late Monday since "Moslem formations were  trying to join up with forces from Sarajevo and the other  enclaves."    SRNA said that Moslem units had fallen back to the villages  of Vitkovici and Mrvavici. [passage omitted]    Milovanovic said the Gorazde defenders were attempting "to  join up with Sandzak and beyond that with Kosovo." [passage  omitted]</p>

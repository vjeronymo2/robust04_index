			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prince Karl Schwarzenberg, chief of Czech </F> President Havel's Cabinet, by Xavier Gautier; place and date not  given: "The `Good Intentions' of the Balladur Plan"]    [Text] Karl Schwarzenberg, chief of President Vaclav  Havel's personal Cabinet since 1989 and heir to a long line of  Austro-Hungarian prince-diplomats, remains, one year after the  partitioning of Czechoslovakia, the closest adviser to the  father of the "Velvet Revolution." Now living in Prague, this  Vienna-educated prince is one of the most committed spokesmen  voicing the hopes and frustrations of Central Europe with regard  to Brussels' partial opening up to the new democracies.    [Gautier] What are your views on the Conference on Stability  that opens today in Paris and that will attempt to solve the  problems of good-neighborliness between the countries of Central  Europe?    [Schwarzenberg] Can you imagine a roundtable organized in  Biscay, in the French Basque country, organized so that France,  Spain, Ireland, and Britain could discuss the Basque and Irish  problems under the benevolent supervision of the Czechs and the  Americans? No? Neither can I.    [Gautier] But doesn't the "Balladur plan" provide the new  democracies with a forum to talk about their problems?    [Schwarzenberg] All this reminds me of the story concerning  my great grandfather, a very wise man who lived in the last  century. One day he was introduced to some very pretty girls  with the aim of getting him to marry one of them. "She is  superb," he said, "she will be perfect for my best friend."  Well, Mr. Balladur's plan is doubtless superb, but it is solely  suited to his best friend.    [Gautier] Seen from Prague, does this conference appear  destined to fail?    [Schwarzenberg] Let me return to my hypothetical "Biscay"  roundtable. If it were a roundtable, we would have had to  prepare for the Conference on Stability in Europe to get down to  some long-term work, especially because by exposing our intimate  problems for all the world to see we risk opening a new  Pandora's box. The founding fathers of the "Stability Pact" do  not have solid experience of the problems in our part of Europe.    [Gautier] France and its European neighbors have not,  however, spared any efforts to understand the situation in  Central Europe.    [Schwarzenberg] Karl Kraus, the Austrian author of Last  Days of Humanity, once wrote: "Good intentions are the  opposite of good politics."[.sup]1[/]    I think that this conference was put together by bureaucrats  who had plenty of good intentions but whose spirit was too  Cartesian. The Europeans will soon run up against prejudices  that are deeply rooted in the spirits of their interlocutors.  In our part of the world, resentment goes way back in history.    [Gautier] In this connection, the Czech Republic, the United  States, and even Moscow have been asked to play a mediating role  at this conference. Is that not the beginning of a good idea?    [Schwarzenberg] In a pinch, the Baltic problem could be  compared to the Basque problem. However, if the Russian  Federation sits down at the negotiating table as a mediator--and  what other role could it play?--it will run into opposition from  the Baltic countries, which is understandable.    [Gautier] Is not your pessimism out of place when one  observes the way in which Europe successfully offered a status  to South Tyrol, which is disputed by Austria and Italy?    [Schwarzenberg] Of course, but the issue of South Tyrol was  limited. It demanded the commitment of two neighbors, both  members of the European Community [as published].    [Gautier] What do you think the chances are of saving the  Paris Conference?    [Schwarzenberg] The kind of problem the conference is  studying cannot be resolved with great pomp. France cites the  example of the Madrid conference on the Middle East, but Madrid  did not yield anything. Only the Oslo negotiations, which were  held in secret and spread out over two years, resulted in the  agreements on Jericho and Gaza.    [Gautier] Speaking of your Slovak neighbor, the problem of  the Hungarian minority seemed like a riddle a month ago. Yet,  Jozef Moravcik, the new prime minister, has just submitted a  bill protecting minority rights, without the help of the  Europeans. What does Prague think about that?    [Schwarzenberg] The new government in Bratislava has, thank  God, taken the exact opposite course of its predecessor's  policies. It has decided to tackle the problems of minorities in  a pragmatic way. The Slovak Government now needs support not  just from its neighbors, but also from Europe as a whole.  Footnote    1. Karl Kraus was one of the journalists most feared by the  Austro-Hungarian government early in this century.</p>

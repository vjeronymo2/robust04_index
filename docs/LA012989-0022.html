			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASTIMES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> ORIGAMI  </P> <P> ANYONE WHO HAS ever folded a piece of paper into an airplane knows the pleasure  of origami: transforming a flat, thin piece of paper into a three-dimensional  form.  </P> <P> Scholars believe that origami may have originated in China, where paper was  invented, but the best-known practitioners today are in Japan; using special  origami papers (white on one side, colored on the other), origami experts can  make whales (complete with water spouting out the top), dinosaurs, flowers,  mother duck and ducklings, rabbits, boxes -- anything. The shapes are used to  decorate gifts for birthdays, weddings, anniversaries and New Year's Day.  </P> <P> In America, origami's popularity is often limited to elementary school projects  for children and elaborate napkin folding for adults. These napery contortions  have been popular since the 16th and 17th centuries, when Europeans who could  afford it gave huge banquets distinguished by endless, elaborate food and not  quite endless, but no less complicated, napkins. Pope Gregory XIII held one  such bash that had a folded-napkin centerpiece in the shape of a castle.  </P> <P> One of origami's most appealing aspects is its simplicity: no tools, no glue,  no time-consuming finishing. It's just paper and person; a diligent beginner  with a stack of paper can easily work from books. "The Art of Origami," by  Samuel Randlett, and "Origami," by Hideaki Sakata are recommended.  </P> <P>  Classes are occasionally offered at Joslyn Center of the Arts in Torrance,  Point Vicente Interpretive Center in Rancho Palos Verdes and Cabrillo Marine  Museum in San Pedro. Quick &amp; Easy Origami, a kit with paper and  instructions, is available at Waldenbooks, B. Dalton and at the gift shop of  the Japanese Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Supplies and  books are sold also at Kinokuniya Book Store, Bunka-Do Store and Amerasia  Bookstore, all in Little Tokyo, downtown Los Angeles.  </P></p>

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The air quality planning and SIP requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport areas are set out in subparts 1 and 2 of title I of the (CAA). The USEPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing USEPA's review procedures for SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for ozone nonattainment areas (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). USEPA has also issued a draft guidance document describing the requirements for the emissions statement programs, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emissions Statement Program'' (July, 1992). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It should be noted that this guideline has not been finalized, but does provide the best available guidance on the expected contents of the emissions statements and on the States' use of emissions statements. Further revisions to this draft guidance were not available prior to final rulemaking on the Ohio SIP revisions request. Therefore, it is appropriate to use the July 1992 draft guidance in considering current emissions statement SIP revision submittals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Refer also to a memorandum from J.

Summary of the Federal Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 182(a)(3)(B) of title I of the CAA requires States with areas designated nonattainment for the ozone NAAQS to establish regulations for annual reporting of actual emissions by sources that emit VOC or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the nonattainment areas. These annual emissions reports are called ``emissions statements.'' Section 182(a)(3)(B) also requires the States to submit a revision to their SIP to incorporate the emissions statement requirement into its SIP no later than 2 years after enactment of the CAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A State, with USEPA approval, may waive the requirement for an emissions statement for classes or categories of sources with less than 25 tons per year of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the State includes the classes or categories in the base year and periodic inventories and calculates emissions using emission factors established by USEPA (such as those found in USEPA publication AP&hyph;42) or other methods acceptable to USEPA. Whatever minimum reporting level the State establishes in its emissions statement program, if a source emits either VOC or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at or above the designated reporting level, the other pollutant must be included in the emissions statement, even if it is emitted at levels below the specified cutoffs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CAA requires a facility to submit the first emissions statement to the State within three years after the date of enactment of the CAA, and annually thereafter. USEPA has requested the States to submit the emissions data to USEPA through the Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS). The minimum emissions statement data must include: certification of data accuracy, source identification information, operating schedule, emissions information (to include annual and typical ozone season day emissions), control equipment information, and process rate data. The emissions reported in a source's statement should include upset emissions, the effect of downtime on emissions, and fugitive emissions. Finally, the State's rule should clearly place the burden for reporting on the source. The Technical Support Document, dated June 28, 1994, provides a more detailed description of the requirements of the August 4, 1993, memorandum. USEPA developed emissions statement data elements to be consistent with other State reporting requirements. This consistency is essential to assist States with quality assurance for emissions estimates and to facilitate consolidation of all USEPA reporting requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the submission of the emissions statement data to AIRS, States should provide USEPA with a status report that outlines the degree of <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the emissions statement program. Beginning July 1, 1993, States should report quarterly to USEPA the total number of sources affected by the emissions statement provisions, the number of sources that have complied with the provisions and the number that have not. The status report should also include the total annual and typical ozone season day emissions from all reporting sources, both corrected and non-corrected for rule effectiveness. States should include in their status report a list of sources that: (1) Are delinquent in submitting their emissions statement; (2) emit 500 tons per year (tpy) or more of VOC; or (3) emit 2500 tpy or more of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The State should submit this status report quarterly until all the regulated sources have complied for the reporting year. Suggested submittal dates for the quarterly status reports are July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Summary of State Submittal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CAA required States subject to the requirements of section 182(a)(3)(B) to submit the emissions statement program to USEPA by November 15, 1992. On January 15, 1993, the USEPA made a finding that Ohio failed to submit the required SIP revision. The USEPA's finding triggered the sanctions period of section 179 of the CAA. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) submitted a SIP revision request to USEPA on March 22, 1994. In a letter dated May 16, 1994, the USEPA informed OEPA that the SIP submittal was complete. The May 16, 1994, letter stopped the sanctions period that was begun with the finding of failure to submit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information provided by the State included: Adopted rules (3745&hyph;24&hyph;01, &hyph;02, &hyph;03, and &hyph;04) effective on April 1, 1994; emissions statement form and synopsis of rules; summary of comments and responses; public notice of the hearing and comment period; Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review (JCARR) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agenda and approval; technical support for the research and development (R&amp;D) exemption; statutory authority for the State's rules; and copies of actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments submitted. OEPA submitted four adopted rules. The first, Rule 3745&hyph;24&hyph;01, is entitled  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Unless otherwise provided in this rule the definitions in rule 3745&hyph;24&hyph;01 apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second rule, Rule 3745&hyph;24&hyph;02, which is entitled  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applicability <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , states that the requirements of this chapter apply to facilities located in Ashtabula, Butler, Clark, Clermont, Cuyahoga, Delaware, Franklin, Geauga, Greene, Hamilton, Lake, Licking, Lorain, Lucas, Mahoning, Medina, Miami, Montgomery, Portage, Stark, Summit, Trumbull, Warren, or Wood County. Facilities emitting 25 tons or more of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or 25 tons or more of VOC during any calendar year are required to submit an emissions statement. This requirement starts with calendar year 1992. Sources in counties redesignated to attainment for ozone are exempt from reporting. The rule also provides an exemption under paragraph (G) of Rule 3745&hyph;24&hyph;04 for certain sources at the facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 3745&hyph;24&hyph;03, which is entitled  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Deadlines for the Submission of the Emissions Statements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , requires that the 1992 emissions statements be submitted by July 1, 1994. For 1993 and beyond, emissions statements are due by November 15th of the following calendar year (e.g. November 15, 1994, for the 1993 emissions statement). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ohio Rule 3745&hyph;24&hyph;04 is entitled  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emissions Statement Requirements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and involves paragraphs (A) through (G). Paragraphs (A) and (B) require effected owners to submit emissions statements in the OEPA format by the required deadline. Paragraph (C) contains general information about the facility, calendar year covered, and certification of accuracy of the statement. The certification of accuracy must be submitted by an appropriate facility official. Paragraph (D) lists required information for non-R&amp;D sources. Paragraph (E) lists required information for R&amp;D sources. Paragraph (F) allows emissions reporting on a group basis if it cannot be determined on an individual basis. Paragraph (G) provides exemptions for small sources and some R&amp;D sources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The emissions statement exemption provision, at Ohio Rule 3745&hyph;24&hyph;04(G), exempts emissions units that emit less than 10 pounds per day VOC or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  from being included in an emissions estimate for a facility. This exemption effects the applicability of the emissions statement requirement and the reported emissions for affected facilities. The exemption uses exemption 3704.011(A) from the State's title V Operating Permits program, but not 3704.011(A)(1) to (A)(5). Title V exemption 3704.011(A) exempts emissions units less than 10 pounds per day. Title V exemption 3704.011(A)(1) provides that section 3704.011(A) does not apply if the CAA or regulations issued pursuant to it limit an emission unit to less than 10 pounds per day. Title V exemption 3704.011(A)(2) provides that section 3704.011(A) does not apply if OEPA regulations needed for attainment limit the unit to less than 10 pounds per day. Title V exemption 3704.011(A)(3) provides that section 3704.011(A) does not apply if radionuclides are emitted. Title V exemption 3704.011(A)(4) provides that section 3704.011(A) does not apply if a unit in combination with other units would result in potential emissions greater than 25 tpy. Title V exemption 3704.011(A)(5) provides that section 3704.011(A) does not apply if a unit emits more than one ton per year of hazardous pollutants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ohio Rule 3745&hyph;24&hyph;04(G) also provides that Rule 3745&hyph;24&hyph;04(E) exempts from being included in an emissions statement any laboratory or bench scale R&amp;D sources; and does not apply to R&amp;D sources at a facility where the combined potential to emit is less than five tons VOC and five tons NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and where the owner or operator maintains records to demonstrate this. Since Rule 3745&hyph;24&hyph;04(G) only adopts the exemption outlined in 3704.011(A) of the title V program, the emissions from sources that total less than or equal to 10 pounds per day are not required to be reported in an emissions statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Analysis of State Submittal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The August 4, 1993, Mobley memorandum requires that sources submit their first statements for 1992 by July 1, 1993 and that subsequent statements be issued by April 15 of each year. However, the CAA allows statements to be submitted by November of each year. Ohio did not promulgate administrative rules for the emissions statement program until March 17, 1994. The rules became effective on April 1, 1994. Sources subject to the program are required to submit their initial emissions statement, summarizing 1992 emissions, by July 1, 1994. The 1993 emissions statement should be submitted by November 1994, and each subsequent statement should be submitted by November of each year. The States emissions statement reporting frequency satisfies USEPA's requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA requires the following operating information to be included in the State's rules: percent annual throughput by season; days per week on the normal operating schedule; hours per day during the operating schedule; and hours per year during the normal operating schedule. Ohio's rule requires sources to provide the weeks per year it operates as opposed to the hours per year. In addition, Ohio requires sources to report the hours per day, days per week, and weeks per year of operation. This is acceptable since USEPA can determine the hours per year a source operates from this information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ohio's rules do not require sources to report peak ozone season, annual throughput, and percent annual throughput by season. USEPA can determine the peak ozone season process rate from the information required by Ohio's rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in the Technical Support Document, Ohio's rules satisfy USEPA's guidance to require appropriate information on source location, operating rules, and process rates. Emissions statements submitted by sources must be certified by an appropriate official as accurate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ohio's rules do not require that the Airs Facility Subsystem (AFS) control equipment codes and the AFS estimated emissions method codes be provided. The rules do, however, require that a description of the existing control equipment, its efficiency, and the emissions estimation method be provided. The AFS codes can be determined from this information. Therefore, Federal requirements for control equipment information are satisfied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ohio Rules 3745&hyph;24&hyph;04(G) exempt sources that emit less than 10 pounds per day of VOC or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Initially, USEPA objected to this provision since it is not specifically provided for under the CAA. USEPA has recently reviewed the Columbus ozone emissions inventory provided by Ohio and concluded that the inventory demonstrates that the exemption would not exclude a significant portion of the area's emissions. The point source VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions total 4030 tpy and 4543 tpy, respectively. Exempted emissions amount to only 4.6 tpy (0.11%) and 0 tpy for VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , respectively. Exempted emissions for the other nonattainment areas are expected to be of a similar magnitude. Since exempted emissions do not represent a significant amount of the State's nonattainment area emissions, the USEPA believes that the provisions of 3745&hyph;24&hyph;04(G) are approvable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Final Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USEPA is approving Ohio's emissions statement program SIP submittal through the Agency's direct final rulemaking provisions. This rule will be effective December 12, 1994 unless notice is received that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Ohio Emissions Statement Program (Ohio Administrative Rules 3745&hyph;21&hyph;01, 3745&hyph;21&hyph;02, 3745&hyph;21&hyph;03, and 3745&hyph;21&hyph;04) are being incorporated by reference into the Ohio SIP for ozone. The rules are available for inspection at: Air Docket 6102, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Procedural Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are believed to be noncontroversial and USEPA anticipates no significant comments on them. The public is advised that this action will be effective December 12, 1994, unless notice is received by November 14, 1994, that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing, or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators). A future document will inform the general public of these tables. Under the revised tables, this action remains classified as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request for permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request remains in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , USEPA should prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review must be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such a rule. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. Section 307(b)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements the State is already imposing.

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Fading hopes in UK HOPES of another base rate cut in the UK faded even more yesterday after the governor-designate of the Bank of England said inflationary pressures in Britain were far from dead, writes James Blitz. Mr Eddie George said in a speech on Wednesday evening that another base rate reduction would not stimulate the UK economy, but might lead to higher prices. At any time, this might have prompted some unwinding of bullishness about a rate cut. But the market was partic-ularly depressed by these comments at the end of a day in which Mr Norman Lamont, the former UK chancellor, had warned Mr John Major's government not to indulge in any politically inspired interest rate cuts. As one dealer said yesterday: 'It is now very hard to believe that the government could get away with another rate cut this year.' Underlining the depressed mood was a poor performance from sterling on the currency markets, following Wednesday's strong rise. The June short sterling contract fell to 94.00 at one stage but closed unchanged at 94.03, a level in line with the unchanged three-month cash rate at 5 15/16 per cent. The September contract finished 4 basis points down at 94.15. A daily shortage of Pounds 900m was easily removed, with two-thirds of the funds provided in the early round. European markets were very quiet with Germany away on holiday. French franc futures fell back slightly yesterday in a move that appeared to follow the weakness in Euromarks the day before, when the Bundesbank left its repo rate unchanged. The September Pibor contract ended 5 basis points off at 93.32. The near-term outlook for German rate cuts still looks bleak because of the weakness of the D-Mark inside the European exchange rate mechanism. However, Mr Norbert Walter, Deutsche Bank's chief economist, yesterday predicted that official German interest rates would be reduced on July 1 when the Bundesbank Council hold its last fortnightly meeting before its summer vacation. Mr Walter also said that there would be a new European interest rate pattern in place by the beginning of next month in which France and the Netherlands would lead interest rates lower, rather than Germany.</p>

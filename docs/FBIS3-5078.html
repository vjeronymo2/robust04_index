			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by industrial reporter Jun Ando: "Industrial World </F> Coolly Views Government's Movement; Impact of Debt of `20  Percent Share' Over Semiconductors Felt"; second in a series  entitled "Review of the Four Areas of Japan-U.S. Friction"]    [Text] "That was not an `emergency' meeting." This is  what the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]  repeatedly explains to interested parties whenever it has a  chance regarding an emergency meeting on the semiconductor issue  held in January. MITI is saying this because admittance of the  meeting as an emergency meeting is tantamount to accepting U.S.  claims that "no progress has been made regarding the issue of  improving Japanese semiconductor market access."  <H5>  Drop of Market Share According to U.S. Calculation </H5>   The share of semiconductors in the Japanese market by  foreign  countries, including the United States, exceeded 20 percent in  the fourth quarter of 1992, which was the goal of the United  States. But the market share is shrinking, according to a  calculation by the United States. However, MITI is not ready to  alter its stand, saying "the amount we spent for purchasing  foreign semiconductors is steadily growing."    The United States is proud that the "20 percent" figure,  which was incorporated in a Japan-U.S. semiconductor accord,  expanded Japan's semiconductor imports. Many interested people  in Japan admit this was one of the U.S. motives in demanding  Japan accept numerical targets in other fields as well. It is  likely the United States will stress the effectiveness of  numerical targets should Japanese semiconductor users introduce  "emergency measures" by accepting the U.S. demand. Because of  this, it is said MITI unofficially instructed the industrial  world to "keep quiet for a while."    Immediately prior to the Japan-U.S. summit talks, A.  Prokashini [name as published], managing director of the U.S.  Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), warned that the  "Japanese and American semiconductor industrial worlds are  moving toward an era of confrontation and criticism." He  explained his understanding that the "honeymoon period," which  interested people in Japan began to talk about a year ago, was  about to end due to the Japanese Government's clumsy handling of  the situation.  <H5>  American Companies in Japan Show Good Business Performances </H5>   However, there is no sign that Japanese users are taking  this  remark seriously, which can be understood as a threat. They are  not paying serious attention to the remark because major  American semiconductor manufacturers in Japan achieved good  business results in 1993, and because supply is not catching up  with demand.    Sales figures for Intel Japan (located in Tsukuba in Ibaraki  Prefecture) increased to 87.7 billion yen, a 36 percent increase  from the previous year. Its net profit was 9.4 billion yen,  which was a 74 percent increase from the previous year. Both  figures were the highest in the company's history. Japan Texas  Instruments' (Japan TI located in Minatoku) semiconductor sales  also increased by 20 percent from the previous year, totaling  100 billion yen.    Not only major semiconductors but U.S. semiconductor  manufacturers in general have no intention to use the U.S.  Government to open up semiconductor markets in Japan. R.  Dickinson, president of Cirrus Logic [name as published], says:  "We do not see any problems regarding market access." T.  Rogers, president of Cyprus Semiconductors, also points out that  "the Japanese electronics market is open." He coolly adds:  "The job of the USTR is to make a racket, so they merely say  various things."    Regarding the semiconductor issue, Motorola, which is  complaining about the closed nature of the mobile telephone  market in Japan, is also remaining quiet. Integrated circuits  (IC's) for cars and telecommunications are selling well. Japan  Motorola says that "we do not have enough memory chips or  microcontrollers (MCU's) to sell to our Japanese customers."    Some Japanese semiconductor users are saying that "since the  U.S. semiconductor makers are not capable of supplying enough  semiconductors, they will be at a loss if we ask them to sell us  more semiconductors," (according to a major electric machine  maker). Because of this, a growing number of people are of the  view that the SIA will not ask Japan to introduce special  measures linked to the expansion of semiconductor purchases.  <H5>  Pressure May Be Applied as a Result of Excessive Supply </H5>   However, with the help of their good business results, major  American manufacturers are making huge investments in plants and  equipment. South Korean makers are also rapidly expanding their  production capabilities. Some people predict that since new  factories will start to operate, "some of the goods will be in  excessive supply around the second half of this year,"  (according to a major domestic user). If that is the case,  there is a possibility that the United States may strengthen its  pressure again on Japan for an expansion of market share.    However, major Japanese users are already using a  considerable quantity of foreign semiconductors. More than 30  percent of semiconductors Toshiba Corporation and Hitachi Ltd.  use are foreign made. It is more than 20 percent for Matsushita  Electric Industrial Corporation. The reality is that "Japanese  users' efforts are reaching the limit because they are forcing  themselves to realize the 20 percent share." Some people think  that foreign semiconductor makers's market share in Japan is  unable to move upward "because of the unreasonable efforts" made  during the second half of 1992 to expand market share.    Japan should listen to the United States regarding such  matters as clarifying standards for selecting semiconductor  suppliers. However, Japan has already suffered the boomerang  effect of temporary measures for expansion of market share.  Some people feel a sense of security, saying that "nobody will  benefit from recurrence of the Japan-U.S. friction over the  semiconductor issue," (according to MITI). The general trend is  that Japan should not introduce rough-and-ready measures to deal  with the situation.</p>

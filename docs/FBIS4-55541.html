			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "so": "Government Approved Bill on Bilingual </F> Signs"]    [Excerpt] Bratislava--[passage omitted] At its meeting  yesterday, the government agreed with the proposal submitted by  a group of deputies to amend the law on elections to the Slovak  National Council. The draft amendment does not change the basic  principles of the existing legislation governing elections to  the National Council of the Slovak Republic--the electoral  system and the size and number of constituencies remain  unchanged. The proposed amendment mainly clarifies provisions  pertaining to the organization of elections. According to the  draft, voters will receive the ballots at the polling  stations--that is, the ballots will not be delivered to their  homes. A citizen of the Slovak Republic who is not a permanent  resident of the Slovak Republic will be entered in the voters'  register on entering the polling station by the district  electoral commission, and the commission will record this entry  in the voter's travel document. When casting the ballot, the  voter must have his citizenship recorded in his identity papers.  [passage omitted]</p>

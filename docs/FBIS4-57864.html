			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 24 May (EFE) -- Chilean Foreign Minister  Carlos Figueroa will travel to Buenos Aires on 8 June to start  negotiating a commercial partnership between Chile and the  Common Market of the South, Mercosur.    During a news conference, Figueroa said that "during this  phase, we are going to propose establishing a partnership with  Mercosur that will allow us to make gradual progress, first  within the framework of a broad agreement that will entail not  only commercial variables, but also investments and services."    Figueroa explained that this does not mean joining Mercosur,  and reiterated that Chile cannot become a member of the  mentioned bloc because, among other reasons, Chilean customs  tariffs are much lower than those of Mercosur, which is composed  of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay.    Figueroa added that Chile's interest in establishing some  sort of partnership with Mercosur is partly due to the  importance Chile grants Brazil and Argentina, its third and  fourth largest commercial partners respectively, after the  United States and Japan.    The minister asserted that within this context, it is  necessary to perfect an agreement that will preserve the tariff  advantages Chile currently enjoys with those two countries.    Figueroa explained that in Buenos Aires, he hopes to start  negotiations with his Argentine counterpart Guido Di Tella and  also with the rest of the Mercosur member countries. The idea  is to explore a form of partnership that will be advantageous  for all. He added that President Eduardo Frei's government has  made a political decision "and we have all received precise  instructions to start working on it."    Figueroa said Chile took this path after Brazil proposed  creating a hemispheric free trade organization and receiving a  similar invitation from Argentine Economy Minister Domingo  Cavallo during his recent visit to Santiago. These proposals  have opened a space for us to start working on a sort of  partnership with Mercosur, said Minister Figueroa. He  reiterated that Chile is all for bilateral and multilateral  agreements as long as they contribute to opening trade and new  markets and "not locking us into exchange inefficiency."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 25 Mar (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng today  chaired the 16th executive meeting of the State Council at which  "China's Agenda 21," or the "White Paper on China's Population,  Environment, and Development in the 21st Century," was discussed  and approved.    The problems of population, environment, and development  have  drawn attention from various countries in the world in recent  years. To counter the global economic, social, resources, and  environmental problems, the Chinese Government took the lead in  initiating and convening a ministerial conference on environment  and development of developing countries in Beijing in June 1991.  In June 1992, the UN held an environment and development summit  in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and adopted the "Rio Declaration on  Environment and Development," the "Agenda 21," and other  documents. Premier Li Peng attended the summit and, on behalf  of the Chinese Government, promised to fulfill the "Agenda 21"  and other documents. According to this commitment, 52  departments under the State Council, including the State  Planning Commission and the State Science and Technology  Commission, jointly worked out "China's Agenda 21," or the  "White Paper on China's Population, Environment, and Development  in the 21st Century." In line with China's basic conditions and  development strategy, the document sets the general strategy,  policy, and measures for the coordinated and sustainable  development of economy, society, resources, environment,  population, and education. It will become a guiding document  for China in making its long and mid-term plans for national  economic and social development and will form important goals  and contents of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the 2010 program.  Meanwhile, the document has also demonstrated the Chinese  Government's actual action and principled position in earnestly  implementing the "Agenda 21."    The meeting also discussed and adopted, in principle, the  "(Draft) Outline Program of the State Industrial Policies for  the 1990s."</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> BALANCHINE, DE RIBERE AND TOMASSON WORKS BY S.F. BALLET  </P> <P> When George Balanchine choreographed "Serenade" in 1935, he was as far away in  time from the era of Imperial Russian classicism (one of his reference points)  as Lisa de Ribere is from the World War II home front depicted in her new  ballet "Harvest Moon."  </P> <P> Of course, Balanchine had more on his mind than nostalgia, but San Francisco  Ballet certainly heightened this element in his work by programming "Serenade"  with De Ribere's ballet -- and with two new Helgi Tomasson evocations of the  past.  </P> <P> The War Memorial Opera House was nearly full on Friday for this evening of  neo-classicism, neo-Romanticism and neo-jitterbug. No ballet company ever went  broke by insulating its audience from the present.  </P> <P> For all its inconclusive dithering with pointe-work, "Harvest Moon" proved  essentially a Hubbard-style pop showpiece in which young dancers played  characters out of old movies. A mirrored ballroom set by Robin Wagner and witty  costumes by Theoni V. Aldredge created the proper wartime ambience. However,  just as she stylized '40s social dances, De Ribere (formerly a soloist with  American Ballet Theatre) idealized her milieu with such dream-anachronisms as  inter-racial couples.  </P> <P> Classic Glenn Miller Orchestra arrangements of such '40s standards as  "Moonlight Serenade" and "In the Mood" sounded perfectly idiomatic under  conductor Denis de Coteau, but De Ribere's dances looked locked-down, finicky,  desiccated -- very long ago and far away, despite the remarkable skill, energy  and charm of Joanna Berman, Anthony Randazzo, Christopher Boatwright and  Antonio Castilla, among others.  </P> <P> Berman and Randazzo also dominated the new Tomasson pieces -- she as the serene  prima ballerina of "Con Brio" (a quintet inspired by 19th-Century dance  lithographs) and he as the charismatic partner of Evelyn Cisneros in "Valses  Poeticos" (an intimate, mercurial duet choreographed to early piano music by  Granados).  </P> <P> Both works offered exactly what Tomasson does best: glorify his dancers through  refined and often inventive classicism. How could you not love Berman, Cynthia  Drayer and Elizabeth Loscavio after their sweet, elegant, quicksilver  performances in "Con Brio"? How could you resist Cisneros at her most sensuous  and emotionally vulnerable in "Valses Poeticos"? Or Randazzo, so passionately  absorbed in his partner that the audience didn't seem to exist?  </P> <P> Michael McGraw played the Granados suite sensitively, De Coteau gave the  undistinguished Drigo music for "Con Brio" as much care as the Tchaikovsky  score for "Serenade," and lighting by Nicholas Cernovitch enforced the sharpest  possible distinction between the brio and the poetico.  </P> <P> The revival of "Serenade" represented one of the major achievements of the  Tomasson directorate: a staging that renewed the work's masterpiece status with  faultless taste and devotion while showing the San Francisco Ballet women's  corps at its most radiant.  </P> <P> Yes, perhaps, you could find more soulful performances of the "fallen angel"  role than Sabina Allemann's pure if remote interpretation on Friday, but  Pascale Leroy (the possessive "dark angel") and, especially, Yuri Zhukov (the  man caught between these women) danced at the highest possible level of  artistry.  </P> <P> Forget nostalgia: Balanchine is alive and well in San Francisco. . . .  </P></p>

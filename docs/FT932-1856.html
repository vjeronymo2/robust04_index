			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Rhone-Poulenc Rhone-Poulenc's plan to offer its 35 per cent stake in Roussel-Uclaf to the market appears to contain something for everyone. The vendor sheds an unwanted minority inherited from the French government and can use the proceeds to reduce debt ahead of its own privatisation. Hoechst, which holds a majority in Roussel, is liberated from the uncomfortable position of having a fierce competitor as a sleeping partner. If the share sale improves liquidity by increasing Roussel's free float, investors also stand to gain - supposing, of course, that shares are offered at an attractive price. If Rhone-Poulenc hopes to raise FFr4.5bn from the sale, an offer price close to Roussel's current share price is likely. Since the shares have risen by 30 per cent this year, the timing looks a shade opportunistic. Although Roussel is not extravagantly valued against the French market, a price-earnings ratio of 17 times this year's forecast earnings is not cheap by international standards. Valuation is not made easier by Hoechst's decision to sell its French drugs business to Roussel in exchange for shares. While the French drugs market is growing, this exchange of assets works in Roussel's favour. The promise of cost savings from closer co-operation with the German giant is equally tempting. The arrangement underlines, though, that Hoechst will hold the whip hand from here on. Without Rhone-Poulenc contributing to a balance of power, investors will have to take Hoechst on trust. Even allowing that its intentions are honourable, that fact alone demands something of a discount.</p>

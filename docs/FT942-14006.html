			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Reynolds sees delay for peace forum The setting-up of an Irish peace forum, involving political parties from the Republic and Northern Ireland, has been temporarily ruled out by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. The idea was floated in the Downing Street declaration as a way to bring Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, into the peace process following an IRA ceasefire. Opposition parties in the Republic, however, have been pressing the government to establish the forum regardless of the Sinn Fein response to the declaration. During a meeting yesterday between Mr Reynolds and the leaders of the three main opposition parties, Mr Reynolds avoided making any commitment to the creation of the forum without participation from Sinn Fein. However, opposition leaders were satisfied that Mr Reynolds had agreed to more regular consultations with the opposition on the government's Ulster policy. Mr John Bruton, leader of Fine Gael, the main opposition party, said he hoped the government was seeking an 'early agreement on concrete issues'.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> CITY'S PLAN TO BOOST CAR-POOLING PASSED  </P> <P> Discount bus tickets, flexible schedules and preferential parking are some of  the perquisites for city employees who car-pool under a plan passed unanimously  by the City Council on Monday night.  </P> <P> The city was required by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to  come up with a plan by Oct. 4 after its previous plan was rejected.  </P> <P> All organizations with 100 or more employees must submit plans that encourage  people to car-pool between 6 and 10 a.m.  </P> <P> Tustin has 712 employees who arrive at work between those hours.  </P> <P> Incentives offered by the city include commuter matchups with other car-poolers  and guaranteed rides home for employees who are required to work unscheduled  overtime or have personal or family emergencies. In addition, employees who  car-pool, walk or bike to work at least half of the time will get two extra  days off each year, and those who do so 70% of the time will get four extra  days off.  </P> <P> In addition, the city is studying the possibility of implementing a four-day,  40-hour workweek.  </P></p>

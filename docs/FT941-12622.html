			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Diesel cars bad for health, says report The growing popularity of diesel cars is 'extremely bad for human health', according to the authors of a government report on air pollution. The report, published yesterday, vigorously attacks the 'green' image of diesel and says the engines produce high levels of gases and soot, causing breathing difficulties and cancer. 'If you want to buy a car that's good for the environment, buy a petrol-engined car with a catalytic converter,' said Professor Roy Harrison, a scientist based at Birmingham University and chairman of the group that produced the report. He believed a new tax on diesel to make it more expensive than petrol would be 'a good idea'. The motor industry, which as a producer of both petrol and diesel cars maintains it has 'no axe to grind', immediately launched a scathing attack on the report. It said that in reaching its conclusions the report had failed to take account of continuing 'enormous progress' in diesel engine technology which rendered most of the criticisms invalid. 'It is erroneous, misplaced, misguided and fundamentally unsound,' said Mr Roger King, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders' public affairs director. The industry fears that uncertainties created by the report may slow recovery in the new car market. Diesel cars make up only 6 per cent of the national total, but last year accounted for a fifth of new car sales. Marketing has portrayed them as cheaper to run and environmentally 'friendly'. The report, commissioned by the Department of the Environment from the Quality of Urban Air Review Group, agrees diesel engines are cleaner than petrol cars. But it says that they produce more nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, carbon particles and black smoke than petrol cars fitted with catalytic converters. Diesel cars emit less 'greenhouse' gases than petrol cars, but scientists say diesel particles may play a role in global warming. Car industry fears, Page 5</p>

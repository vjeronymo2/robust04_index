			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Channel tunnel duty-free row grows Ferries, airlines, goods suppliers and Dover Harbour Board yesterday asked the High Court to block the attempt by Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, to put an end to duty-free shopping. Eurotunnel, which is not allowed to sell duty-free goods on its trains although it has duty-free shops at Folkestone and Calais, claims its competitors are enjoying an unfair and discriminatory advantage under European free trade laws because they can subsidise fares from on-board sales profits. Eurotunnel's competitors argued that its application for a judicial review of a 1991 Customs and Excise decision allowing the duty-free trade to continue should be struck out because it was brought outside legal time limits. The Customs decision was based on a ruling by the European Council of Ministers that, despite the advent of the European single market, the trade should be allowed to continue until 1999 because of the failure to harmonise rates of duty between member states. At the start of a five-day hearing, the ferry companies' counsel, Mr Kenneth Rokison QC, told Lord Justice Balcombe and Mr Justice Tucker Eurotunnel was seeking to argue that its competitors had no sufficient legal interest in the case enabling them to seek a strike-out order. He said this was clearly a 'blatant' attempt to stop the court ever deciding the question of delay. The ferries and the other operators obviously had an interest because they relied on revenue from duty-free sales and would be seriously affected if Eurotunnel won its case. Eurotunnel, which points out that the duty-free trade represents a total loss to the Exchequer of Pounds 600m a year in excise duty and value added tax, is asking the judges to refer questions of European law to the European Court of Justice as a preliminary to the full hearing of its judicial review application.</p>

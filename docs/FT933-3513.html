			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / World Trade News in Brief: Keypad dumping case rejected The International Trade Commission yesterday ruled that an Italian maker of pads that cushion the movement of keys on woodwind instruments did not injure his US competitor, Lisa Bransten writes from Washington. Mr Giuseppe Prestini of Arizona said an Italian rival was selling keypads in the US for less than fair market value. The ITC ruled against Mr Prestini 5-1 in what is considered to be the smallest dumping case ever to come before the trade panel.</p>

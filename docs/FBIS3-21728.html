The drug seized on 28 February was concealed in boxes  inside a container from Curacao. Businessman Jean St. Fort  Pierre was arrested. Jean-Max Blanc filed a report:    [Begin recording in Creole] On 28 February in the  Port-au-Prince harbor, the capital's anti-drug brigade seized 31  kg of cocaine, shipped from Curacao. Within two weeks, 43 kg of  cocaine was seized by the anti-drug brigade following the  seizure of the 12 kg that a voodoo priestess was last week  carrying to the United States. Since the beginning of the year,  brigade authorities report they have seized 71 kg of cocaine and  arrested 17 people involved in drug trafficking.    Major Casimir Louis states that the greatest problem the  service now faces is the problem of justice. [passage omitted].    About two weeks ago, the office broke up a drug network  outside Port-au-Prince. At that time, the authorities seized two  kg of cocaine, which is still in their office, and $100,000 U.S.  In a statement by Maj. Casimir Louis on 1 March, the officer  denied the accusation regarding the involvement of the Haitian  military in drug trafficking. He recognizes, however, that just  as in all other institutions, the military could be involved in  drugs, a military Casimir Louis calls dissident. [passage  omitted]    According to authorities, a kg of cocaine costs between $20  and $25 [as heard] on the U.S. market. The amount of the drug  that the authorities seized on 1 March is evaluated at  $2,800,000. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> CATALYST FOR LABOR  </P> <P> The trends in the country (then) were not good for labor. If it wasn't for (the  strike by Patco), labor wouldn't have the solidarity it does now.  </P> <P> It was the catalyst for a lot of what is happening today. I don't think anyone  in labor expected Patco to do it. I don't think anyone thought (President)  Reagan would (fire the controllers).  </P> <P> The labor movement is much stronger (now). Patco pretty much opened the door  for management to say, "We're not going to negotiate with you." But over the  years since the Patco strike, people have learned from that. Union people have  become stronger. They're willing to take a stand. A strike is a last-ditch  effort. They know that. (But) the goal is worth going after.  </P> <P> I'd like to think that a part of the reason (labor is better off today) is  because of Patco. The (outcome) was an embarrassment for some labor leaders.  </P></p>

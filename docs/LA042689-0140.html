			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> AN EXQUISITE EVENING OF FOLK-ROCK  </P> <P> Among the inescapable conclusions drawn from Fairport Convention's show Monday  at the Roxy: You can't keep a good band down.  </P> <P> Over its 20-year career, the seminal English folk-rock group has experienced a  potentially crippling number of lineup changes (it would take a ream of paper  to chart the Fairport family tree) and uneven -- though mostly limited --  commercial success, especially in this country.  </P> <P> As if to underscore the generally low-profile and long, labyrinthine history of  the band (which plays the Coach House in San Capistrano tonight and Bogart's in  Long Beach on Thursday), singer-guitarist Simon Nicol introduced Monday's  opening number, "Reynard the Fox," by saying "We're about to do a Fairport  Convention number, whoever they used to be."  </P> <P> Indeed, let's just say Michael Jackson has never been looking over his shoulder  to see if a Fairport LP might pass him on the charts. In its 2-hour Roxy show,  though, the quintet did take every opportunity to plug its current release,  "Red and Gold," executing a very thorough job of record promotion that in the  hands of a less charming or humorous outfit would have been shameless  hucksterism.  </P> <P> Of course, it helped a lot that the selections from that oft-mentioned album  were uniformly strong, whether they were soaring instrumentals written by the  band or songs penned by such stalwarts as Ralph McTell . . . or band  arrangements of traditional instrumentals or songs composed by Fairport members  -- well, you get the idea.  </P> <P> Similarly, the group covered considerable -- and considerably wonderful --  ground when not performing (or plugging) the new material, from Nicol's gentle  and gorgeous "The Deserter" to the fiery, foot-stomping, set-closing medley of,  as guitarist Martin Allcock put it, "Celtic dance tune-type things."  </P> <P> Because Richard Thompson joined Crowded House on stage both nights of its  recent Los Angeles stand, one certainly expected the ex-Fairport fret-maestro  to turn up at this show. Sure enough, Thompson -- and another former Fairport  guitarist, Jerry Donahue -- jumped into the fray for a rip-roaring  double-encore to cap an exquisite, exhilarating evening.  </P> <P> This would have been a nearly impossible act to follow, but it apparently also  was a difficult act to precede, judging by Danny Phillips opening segment.  Accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, Phillips performed a handful of songs  notable -- if that's the right word -- for their uninteresting melodies and  uninteresting lyrics ("Why can't you see something's gonna change," "Waves are  crashing," etc.) Strictly Dullsville.  </P></p>

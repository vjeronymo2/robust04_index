			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GRANADA HILLS RUNS DOWN KENNEDY  </P> <P> How undermanned did Kennedy High appear to be as it headed into its intracity  showdown with Granada Hills on Friday night? Consider the one-liner dispensed  by Kennedy assistant coach Tom Sams, who looked down the sideline moments  before the North Valley League game and noticed a particularly beefy Kennedy  graduate:  </P> <P> "Tell him to get a uniform on," cracked Sams as he nodded toward Jeff Bregel,  who now plays for the San Francisco 49ers and who had dropped by to watch his  younger brother, Troy, against the undefeated Highlanders.  </P> <P> As it turned out, even the elder Bregel couldn't have helped much, since he was  booted off the sidelines along with a mob of other former Kennedy players who  saw Granada Hills defeat the Golden Cougars, 17-0, at Granada Hills.  </P> <P> Friday's win gave the Highlanders their best start of the decade. Granada Hills  was also unbeaten after eight games in 1986, when the team started 7-0-1. The  Highlanders (8-0, 5-0 in league play) will play host to San Fernando, also  unbeaten in league play, next Thursday night.  </P> <P> Granada Hills moved the ball most effectively on the ground.  </P> <P> The Highlanders rolled up 338 yards in offense, all but 71 on rushing plays on  a blustery evening. The running game was especially effective in the first  half.  </P> <P> Fullback Brett Washington gave Granada Hills a 7-0 lead with 5:49 left in the  first quarter when he ran in untouched from 11 yards. Washington, who gained a  game-high 176 yards in 23 carries, set up the score with a 12-yard burst.  </P> <P> Backfield mate Leon Glasgow, who finished with 77 rushing yards, was next in  the point parade, scoring from eight yards with 10:22 left in the half to give  Granada Hills a 14-0 lead.  </P> <P> Granada Hills quarterback Bryan Martin completed only one of seven passes in  the half, although he was victimized three times by dropped balls. He didn't  fare much better in the second half, completing just six of 21 for 71 yards --  with eight drops.  </P> <P> Kennedy's offense was unable to establish itself, netting just 70 yards. The  Golden Cougars (3-5, 2-3) fumbled the ball six times, losing it twice.  </P> <P> Kennedy's Ontiwaun Carter, who entered the game as the Northwest Valley  Conference's leading rusher, was held to 55 yards in 12 carries. Granada Hills  has yet to allow 100 yards to any ballcarrier.  </P></p>

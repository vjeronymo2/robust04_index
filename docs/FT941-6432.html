			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Brazilian engine deal for R-R Rolls-Royce yesterday was selected to supply its heavy thrust Trent 800 engines to power three Boeing 777 wide-body twin engine airliners for Transbrasil, Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent, writes from London. The UK company was competing for the Brazilian order against its two larger US rivals, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney. The new Rolls-Royce-powered 777s, which are still subject to Brazilian government approval, are due to enter airline service in 1996-97 on routes between Brazil and the US. Transbrasil's 777 order, worth about Dollars 400m (Pounds 274m) for the aircraft and engines, is the first from a Latin American carrier. It is also the first Latin American order for the Trent 800 engine. Sir Ralph Robins, Rolls-Royce chairman, said the deal would renew the UK aero-enginemaker's links with Transbrasil after about 20 years. The Brazilian carrier flew an all Rolls-Royce engined fleet in the early 1970s, operating Dart-powered Handley Page Heralds and Spey-powered BAC One-Elevens.</p>

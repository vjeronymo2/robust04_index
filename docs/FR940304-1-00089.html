			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fuel switching.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several of the comments in this area dealt with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards selection criteria for specific products. For example, Peoples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Natural Gas Company stated a concern that standards could unintentionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase energy consumption by forcing a switch from gas water heaters to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric. Peoples Natural Gas Company recommended limiting standards-induced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price increases to consumers for gas water heaters to 120 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards-induced price increases for electric resistance water heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Peoples Natural Gas Company contended that this would avoid switching from gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to electric by price-sensitive consumers, such as home builders and low-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> homeowners. (Peoples Natural Gas Company, No. 28 at 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, the Department analyzed standard levels by the methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in the September 1990 advance notice, wherein fuel switching was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounted for as part of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model's forecasting of economic impacts. While some fuel switching did occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (electric water heaters are projected to increase their share of the market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 45.5 percent to 50.3 percent, as shown by Table 3.4 of Volume F of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Support Document), the Department does not believe it occurred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of the relative equipment price increases since the price of electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters are projected to increase much faster than that of gas, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented in Section IV below. The Department ascribes the fuel switching  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is projected to occur to the relative increase in the price of gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compared to electricity as shown in Table 5.5 of Volume A of the Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Support Document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Impacts on Manufacturers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers contracted with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Arthur D. Little, Inc. to prepare a report on the Department's analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> top-loading, horizontal-axis clothes washers. In that report, entitled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Financial Impact of DOE Top-Loading Horizontal Axis Standards on U.S. Washing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Machine Manufacturers,'' Arthur D. Little listed a number of criticisms of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model and suggested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department use a ``Cash Flow Model,'' instead. (Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers, Nos. 61D and 61E). Although clothes washers have been dropped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from this rulemaking, as discussed below, many of Arthur D. Little's comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have general applicability to the other appliances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of Arthur D. Little's criticisms of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturer Impact Model involved that model's consumer preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumptions. Arthur D. Little stated, ``The combination of price and energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings account for under two-thirds of the basis of selection. Thus, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturer Impact Model at best is taking into account a little less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two-thirds of the consumer's decision to purchase.'' Arthur D. Little  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded, ``neglected features seriously distort the prediction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer's *&blank;*&blank;* well being.'' (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 61E at 25.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department intends to set standards that do not reduce consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility, a gauge of well being, by establishing product classes that protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility. While utility is sometimes a matter of degree, instead of an open  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and shut case, the basic concept is the establishment of classes that protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a less efficient, but desirable, feature such as the through-the-door ice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service for refrigerators. Since the establishment of classes is performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the manufacturer impact analysis, it is appropriate for the Lawrence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model to assume there is no difference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in consumer utility between an appliance meeting the different trial standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels. Furthermore, since standards are intended to affect only an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appliance's energy efficiency (which usually is positively related to price),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modeling consumer response only to changes in those variables is reasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Arthur D. Little report was also critical of the Lawrence Berkeley  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model's treatment of market power issues. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report stated that the manufacturer analysis concludes that manufacturers can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set their own prices because the manufacture of the product is concentrated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hands of a small number of producers. (Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers, No. 61E at 27.) Furthermore, the report asserted that within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model, mark-up is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> countered only by a very weak consumer reaction, as measured by the elasticity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of demand relative to the purchase price of the appliance and its operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expense. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A major difference that exists in the manufacturer impact analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed for today's notice and typical manufacturer experience to increasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices is that the analysis assumes that all manufacturers in the industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will have to increase prices to meet the standard. This is a very different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario from an individual firm raising its prices independently from its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitors. To accomplish the analysis, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturer Impact Model uses two elasticities; an individual firm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elasticity, which is used to establish price, and an industry elasticity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is used to establish sales. The individual firm elasticity used by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model is greater than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry elasticity, and is such that if a firm raises prices it loses sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is this price elasticity faced by the individual firm that determines how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> much the firm can mark up price. However, the initial effect of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elasticity is tempered in the model by the fact that the firm's competitors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are also raising prices until equilibrium is reached between increased costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet the standard and increased prices. The consumer reaction to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher price is then calculated by the industry elasticity, which is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers' responsiveness to having the appliance or not, as opposed to buying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it from a competing seller for less. Since the Department considers the whole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry to be affected by standards, a resulting rise in the general level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices for an appliance would likely have a relatively weak aggregate consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Diplomats take pragmatic view of Kenyan poll ELECTION day was peaceful and there was a large turnout. And while the incumbent president's victory over his three challengers was marred by electoral 'irregularities', on balance it was a step forward, the senior US official concluded, writes Michael Holman in Nairobi. That seemingly pragmatic response to Mr Samuel Doe's victory in Liberia's rigged elections of October 1985 is finding an echo in Kenya as western governments take stock after President Daniel arap Moi's success last Tuesday. Liberia 1985 is not Kenya 1993. But as the US, Britain and other governments endorse - with reservations - Mr Moi's disputed election success and contemplate resuming aid, the rationale underlying western policy seems similar. Then, as now, the US had to deal with a determined leader, a long-standing ally who was embarking on the path of reform, albeit slowly or imperfectly. Then, as now, the analysis of the election outcome was open to question. Accommodation rather than confrontation seems again to be the chosen tactic. At the weekend one of Mr Moi's most forthright critics urged Kenya's opposition leaders to accept the results of the poll. 'Democracy is not always won in a day,' said Mr Smith Hempstone, US ambassador. 'A parliament in which the opposition will hold a minimum of 75 seats out of 200 is one in which the will of the people can at least be articulated.' The British High Commission in Nairobi believed the results 'were largely in line with what the people wanted', a view shared by the Commonwealth observer group. Mr Justice Telford Georges, the group's chairman, said: 'However imperfectly, the results in many instances reflect. . . the will of the people. It constitutes a giant step down the road to multiparty democracy.' Yet the conclusion that Mr Moi's victory indicates, albeit imperfectly, 'what the people wanted' is not self-evident. The presidential tallies of 1.8m for Mr Moi, 1.3m for Mr Kenneth Matiba, 1m for Mr Mwai Kibaki and 892,000 for Mr Jaramogi Oginga Odinga suggest most voters wanted change. The constituency count - 96 for Kanu, 31 for Ford-Kenya, 26 for Ford-Asili, 20 for DP and three for independents - gives Mr Moi a narrow majority in the 188-seat assembly, which will increase when he exercises his right to appoint 12 MPs. Yet limited and selective rigging could have radically influenced the outcome. In the presidential race, the winner must not only achieve a simple majority but also secure 25 per cent of the votes cast in five of Kenya's eight provinces. Failure to do so means a run-off. Mr Moi fulfilled the second condition in the necessary five provinces; but the key factor was the controversial North-Eastern province on the Somali border, which has 10 constituencies and a registered electorate of 141,000. Only 62,000 voted, 75 per cent of them for Mr Moi, while Kanu took eight seats. Yet this key province was all but inaccessible to opposition parties, ostensibly on security grounds, a fact criticised by all observer groups. Some Kenyan analysts argue that the level of support for Mr Moi and Kanu is surprising given the government's record of heavy-handed administration of the area. Had Mr Moi not won 25 per cent of the vote, he would be facing a run-off against Mr Matiba. And had Kanu faced competition for the seats it is conceivable the opposition would have done better. And had the results been different in only a handful of seats in other provinces where the government is accused of rigging, Kanu would not have won a parliamentary majority. Even if Mr Moi won the presidential run-off, the opposition parties would have been able to dominate the parliamentary arena. As it is, they are having to debate the merits of participation as the minority bloc. Consultations over the weekend will help decide the boycott-or-participate debate. Either outcome will prove controversial; what the people want is not quite as clear as diplomats maintain.</p>

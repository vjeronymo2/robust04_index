			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Birse deficit hits Pounds 18.5m as recession bites BIRSE GROUP, the building and civil engineering company in which Bilfinger &amp; Berger, the German contractor, has a 15 per cent stake, incurred a Pounds 18.5m pre-tax loss during the 12 months to end-April. The deficit compared with a Pounds 12.3m loss the previous year. Turnover fell by 7.9 per cent from Pounds 356.1m to Pounds 328.4m. Losses per share widened from 15.3p to 22.3p. The loss was struck after provisions of Pounds 3.48m against the group's commercial property operations. That was only slightly lower than the Pounds 3.67m provisions made against commercial property in 1991-92. Mr Peter Birse, chairman, said the company had suffered from a severe recession in all its markets. The company has net debt of Pounds 27m, more than twice shareholders' funds of Pounds 12.5m. It recently renegotiated its loan agreements, rescheduling its short term borrowings 'on a committed three year basis to May 1996.' Mr Birse said the agreement with the banks had given the group a firm foundation from which to reduce its borrowings through an orderly sale of its commercial property interests valued at Pounds 35m. Its contracting operations last year incurred a loss of about Pounds 9m compared with a deficit of Pounds 5m the previous year. Commercial property ran up a loss of Pounds 4m after provisions (Pounds 3.1m); plant hire profit fell from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 1m while house building made a similar loss to the previous year of Pounds 1.5m. Mr Birse said that the construction division had suffered from low margins on contracts and delays in receiving payments on long term projects. He expected this position to improve in the current year. House sales by the company had risen by 25 per cent last year but the division had suffered from weaker house prices. COMMENT The preparedness of banks, led by Midland, to support Birse is good news for its British and German shareholders. The company's survival looks assured provided there are no nasty surprises to upset its recuperation. Birse, however, is unlikely to make a quick return to robust health. Contracting is likely to remain a difficult market while housebuilding - expected to lead the construction recovery - is only a very small part of the company's business. The group also appears under-capitalised for a turnover of more than Pounds 300m. Property sales still have to be concluded to reduce debt. Interest charges, however, should be lower this time next year. The group has left itself sufficient leeway, over the timing of when it takes construction profits, to enable it to return to the black this year. Profits, however, should be not much more than Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m and there are better recovery stocks elsewhere.</p>

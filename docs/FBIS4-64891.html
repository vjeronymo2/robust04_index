			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jackie Burdon] </F>   [Text] More than 200 people, including 180 Britons, were  flown out of war-ravaged Yemen on a British Airways jet today.    The DC10 took off from the capital Sanaa with 225 evacuees  on  board at about 2 pm BST [British Summer Time]. "It all went very  smoothly with no problems," a Foreign Office [FO] spokesman  said. The aircraft is due to refuel at Larnaca, Cyprus, and  arrive at Gatwick airport late tonight.    More than the expected 150 Britons turned up at the Sheraton  Hotel, Sanaa, for the flight, and the remaining seats were taken  by other nationalities.    As civil war raged in Yemen, Britons who have already  returned said they had witnessed heavy fighting. One Briton who  had already got out told BBC News: "I went out on to the balcony  and saw flashes of light and explosions coming up from the  airport and it was at that point that I thought, `This is it.'"  Another said: "We were in a compound not 100 yards from the  airport and there were bullets flying all over the place."  Forty Britons who have already left were administration workers  from the Canadian Occidental Petroleum company. They arrived at  Stansted airport on Sunday [8 May].    The airport in Sanaa has been effectively closed, but  attacks  seem to quieten during daylight hours, and banks, businesses,  schools and restaraunts in the city are open.    The FO has urged Britons in Aden to leave with other foreign  nationals aboard the French ship Jules Verne, which was due to  set sail this morning for Djibouti. About 200 British nationals  are thought to be left in the country after today's airlift and  sailing.</p>

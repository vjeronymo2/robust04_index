			<p>BFN     [Text] According to sources at the National Assembly  office, the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia will  resume its first legislature's second session on 25 April  following the cheerless conclusion of the session on 5 April.    The 5 April session was closed at noon on the same day  following the conflict of views among some Assembly members  concerning the use of some words in the agenda. These members  argued that it was inappropriate to use those words. Finally,  the session withdrew some of the items from its agenda, and the  meeting was closed. Some public opinions have criticized the 5  April session as futile.    At the upcoming 25 April session, it is expected that there  will be five items on the agenda. The first item is the  election of new people's representatives; the second, the  discussion and adoption of bills and proposed laws concerning  the Supreme Council of Judges; the third, the discussion and  adoption of the 1994-95 socio-economic plan; the fourth, the  setting up of a special commission to provide advice and to  improve the National Assembly's internal regulations; and the  fifth, the discussion and adoption of a draft on the structure  of the National Assembly's secretariat. However, the same  sources have affirmed that the agenda could be altered by the  time the session is convened because some other important issues  are being considered for inclusion in the agenda by the National  Assembly. A high-ranking official in the National Assembly has  disclosed that the Khmer Rouge issue may be also be put on the  agenda of this session so that the entire National Assembly can  discuss and decide whether to outlaw the Khmer Rouge or not.    It is expected that apart from the election of new people's  representatives, the Khmer Rouge issue could be an important  item for this session. However, sources at the National  Assembly office have not been absolutely clear about the  inclusion of the Khmer Rouge issue into the agenda.    This session will elect 19 new people's representatives,  including 13 from FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an  Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and  six from the Cambodian People's Party. These new people's  representatives will replace the 19 who are carrying out public  functions that are incompatible with the role of people's  representatives. This issue was deadlocked at the 5 April  session over a question of wording.    It was remembered at that session that the National  Assembly's Standing Committee used the words "invalidity of  people's representative status." These words were criticized by  some Assembly members as inappropriate for outgoing Assembly  members.    At this coming session, the wording is "election of new  people's representatives." A National Assembly official  expresses his optimism that the election of new people's  representatives at this session could be done and not deadlocked  as in the previous meeting; the only thing that is not yet known  for certain is how the Assembly will do this and through which  method, whether to do this individually or collectively.</p>

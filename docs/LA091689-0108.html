			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SET SAIL FOR THE SEAFEST;  </P> <P> NEWPORT HARBOR COMBINES TRADITIONAL SUMMER EVENTS FOR A BIG 10-DAY CELEBRATION  OF THE COMMUNITY'S NAUTICAL CHARACTER  </P> <P> If it looks as if the water level in Newport Harbor is a little high for the  next few days, don't be too quick to blame it on the tide. It could be the  effects of SeaFest.  </P> <P> Hundreds of antique and classic wooden boats, tall ships, electric boats, wind  surfers, sailboats, runabouts, yachts and one 522-foot Navy vessel do, after  all, displace a lot of water.  </P> <P> They also are expected to attract more than 50,000 boat buffs and other salty  types to the harbor and its environs for the first 10-day celebration of its  kind in Newport Beach history.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Juggling the Schedule  </P> <P> Newport SeaFest, which began Friday and ends Sept. 24,, is the first  consolidation of several traditional Newport Beach summertime nautical events  with a handful of new festivities designed to highlight the waterborne nature  of the community.  </P> <P> "It all started with suggestions from a couple of (Newport Harbor Area Chamber  of Commerce) members who were sitting around talking about how we could pull  together a big community-wide event with the cooperation of service groups and  agencies as well as the chamber," said Richard Luehrs, president of the Chamber  of Commerce, the sponsor of SeaFest.  </P> <P> "This was coupled with questions about why we couldn't do some of the things  later in the year that we normally do in the middle of summer, like the  Character Boat Parade and the Wooden Boat Festival. In mid-summer, there's so  much traffic and congestion down here. We thought if these things were  scheduled later, it'd be a little less hectic on people."  </P> <P> So they did, and in the bargain added new events such as the Taste of Newport  (which features live music and samples of food from 40 area restaurants), a  fishing tournament and kite contest -- and the SeaFest Marine Art Festival.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seamanship and Silliness  </P> <P> The centerpieces of the festival are the traditional boating events, which show  off seamanship, precise marine architecture, creativity and, in one case, plain  silliness.  </P> <P> The first of these is today's third annual Great Electric Boat Race, in which  more than 40 electrically powered boats will compete in a rally around the  harbor and in a "Rhine Channel Drag Race." The rally will begin at the Cannery  restaurant (3010 Lafayette Ave.) at 11:30 a.m., where each skipper will be  given a set of clues to solve which will lead to points around the bay, where  the skippers will collect tokens. The final "drag race" will be held at the  Cannery following the rally.  </P> <P> The first visit to the Newport Harbor area of a Navy vessel in more than 25  years will take place today and Sunday. The 522-foot-long U.S. amphibious dock  landing ship Fort McHenry will be anchored off the Newport Harbor jetty for the  weekend and will offer free tours. The Chamber of Commerce will offer  transportation to the ship both days for $5. Transport tickets, good for a bus  trip from Newport Center to the Harbor Master's dock and a launch from there to  the ship, are available in advance only from the Chamber of Commerce offices  (1470 Jamboree Road, Newport Beach), the Balboa Pavilion (400 Main St., Balboa)  and the Meridien Hotel (4500 MacArthur Blvd., Newport Beach).  </P> <P> Next weekend will see the arrival of several old-timers and a few very  old-timers as part of the Tall Ships Festival and the Wooden Boat Festival,  both of which will take place at the Boy Scouts Seabase at 1931 W. Pacific  Coast Highway.  </P> <P> Next Saturday, the tall ships "Pilgrim," "Resolution," "Argus" and others will  be tied up at the Boy Scouts Seabase and will be open to boarding and tours for  $3 (children 12 and under free). They are scheduled to sail into the harbor  about 5 p.m. the day before, along with other classic and antique boats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wooden Boats on Display  </P> <P> The same day, the third annual Wooden Boat Festival begins with a display at  the Boy Scouts Seabase of more than 60 classic wooden craft, from sailboats to  motorized runabouts. All boats are available for inspection for $3 (children 12  and under free).  </P> <P> Events during the day will include a wooden-boat sailing regatta (noon), a  boat-building contest for children and adults (11 a.m.), and wooden-boat  cruises (ongoing).  </P> <P> Several of the wooden boats scheduled to be on display are owned by members of  the Antique and Classic Boat Society, an international organization of wooden-  boat fanciers. Roger Huebner of Newport Beach, the president of the Southern  California chapter of the society, said that he would be sailing his own 1939  Chris Craft runabout.  </P> <P> "Many of these old boats have their history right here in Newport Beach,"  Huebner said. "There's real enjoyment in seeing something that's old but looks  new and is fully functional. People look at these boats and say, 'Where did you  get that?' "  </P> <P> Marshall Steele, chairman of the Wooden Boat Festival, said: "Some of these  runabouts are worth about $150,000, and they're only 20 feet long. We're  probably going to have about $7 million or $8 million worth of boats out there.  Everybody's been spending the last few months sprucing their boats up. The  owners have really gotten into this. There's so much pride in these boats, and  love for them, that the owners won't put them in the show unless they're in  great shape."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boat Owners Play Dress-Up  </P> <P> On Sept. 24, the final day of the festival, the zaniest of the events, the  Character Boat Parade, sets sail. "Newport Harbor in the Roaring '20s" is the  theme of the 29th annual bay cruise in which local boat owners decorate their  boats in often outlandish ways.  </P> <P> The parade will follow a new route, beginning at the Lido Marina turning basin  at 1 p.m., continuing through the harbor and ending at the starting point (tall  ships will sail with the parade for part of the route). The boats will be  judged on best decorations, best sound, best animation, best costumes and best  interpretation of the parade theme. There also is a "Dirty Old Manifold" award  for the oldest boat.  </P> <P> The idea for the parade was hatched by local cartoonists Virgil Partch and Dick  Shaw, who inaugurated it by sailing their 24-foot tug "Michigan" around the  harbor with a few friends.  </P> <P> "Partch and Shaw were Disney cartoonists at the time, and they painted the boat  to look like Little Toot," said Jim Dale, a local restaurateur whose family now  owns the "Michigan" and sails it each year in the Character Boat Parade. "They  said, 'Let's do something for fun and get all the people with boats out there  who want to get a little crazy and have a good time and all end up at a bar  after the parade's over.' Now that the Commodore's Club of the Chamber of  Commerce has taken it over, it's become real organized, but it's still a lot of  fun. Our family likes to take the boat out and kind of wave the flag a little  bit."  </P> <P> In all, there are more than 35 events scheduled during the 10-day SeaFest.

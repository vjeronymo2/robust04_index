			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Spate of European auctions gives rise to groundswell of concern A SPATE of European bond auctions this week was starting to give rise to a groundswell of concern yesterday as investment houses began to wonder if the climate was still ripe for issues. With no prospect of lower rates to drive prices higher, most bond markets backed off in the face of profit-taking with the higher yielding markets, Spain and Italy, experiencing the greatest falls. France was also weak, as 10-year French bond yields moved above German yields for the first time since the European exchange rate mechanism bands were widened a month ago. The Bank of France is to issue FFr18bn to FFr20bn of 10-year and 30-year bonds today. Previous French auctions have sold like hot croissants, especially the Balladur privatisation bond, which was aimed at the private investor and raised FFr110bn in July, three times its target. However, recent issues have come within the context of rapidly falling rates. Now that the intervention rate is stuck at 6.75 per cent, with no immediate prospects that Germany will signal a further easing by cutting its discount rate, there is a feeling that the pace of easing might be slowing. Dealers yesterday were hedging their positions against the possibility that France will today cut its five to 10-day ceiling rate from its present 10 per cent. French 8.5 per cent bonds due 2003 fell  1/4 point to 116.47, due to worries about the impending auction. HIGH-yielding Mediterranean countries also saw their bond markets held back by auction worries. Spain is to auction a range of three, five and 10-year paper today and some estimates put the supply at around Pta1,000bn. Spanish 10-year bonds, which have risen sharply on hopes that a wage agreement with the unions would be announced today, fell and the September futures contract closed 66 basis points lower 100.15. Italy also slipped in early trading after disappointing short and medium-dated auctions led to nervousness over the most recent auction of 10-year paper. There was a feeling that overseas investors had had enough but domestic buyers took up the slack and shortly before the close of trading, it was announced that the L3,000bn auction was covered 1.98 times at a price of 105.90. The September BTP future closed slightly higher. THE UK gilts market was strong in early trading after some encouraging purchasing data. However, the rally tailed off and the futures market hit a low of 113.17. Then buyers returned tolift the December contract - now the most actively traded futures contract, to above 114. GERMAN debt prices were marginally firmer although the weekly repurchase agreement gave no signals of impending shifts in monetary policy. The 6.8 per cent repo added some liquidity to the system, sometimes a hint that policy on rates might be easing. However, yesterday's boost to bank liquidity was merely technical, reflecting the recent use of other methods of injecting cash into the system. LONGER-DATED US Treasuries edged higher on hopes that tomorrow's August employment report will reveal continued weakness in domestic labour markets. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up  1/8 at 102 7/32 yielding 6.086 per cent. The two-year was unchanged at 100, to yield 3.858 per cent. Traders and investors have their eyes fixed on tomorrow's employment figures, and news from the National Association of Purchasing Management that employment declined last month raised expectations that the jobs data will be bullish for bonds. Analysts expect August non-farm payrolls to have risen by around 150,000. The long end was also aided by overseas demand. News that July personal income fell 0.2 per cent and personal spending rose 0.4 per cent had little impact on sentiment.</p>

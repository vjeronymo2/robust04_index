			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Arts: Castaways' choice - Radio TOMORROW'S Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 will be the Anniversary Edition, though the 50th anniversary is not until January 29. Every paper in the country must have had a piece about this feature. On Tuesday I went to a good party given by David Hatch, Managing Director of BBC Radio; yet even after that I have no private knowledge, no secret scandal, to add (everyone knows by now that tomorrow's castaway is the Prime Minister.) The fact is that there is no significant private knowledge to know. Almost childishly simple as it is, Desert Island Discs, invented by Roy Plomley, remains compulsive listening. To my mind, this is largely because of the talent of its current presenter, Sue Lawley, and its succession of directors that choose the castaways. Miss Lawley deals with the famous or the modest, the intellectual or the downbeat, with never a hint of flattery or condescension, and many a BBC interviewer could learn from her. With respect to Roy Plomley, whose estate still takes its weekly share, and whom I counted as a friend, he was not in her class. Michael Parkinson was not in their class either, and knew it. Sue Lawley spoke at the DID party on Tuesday, with wit and intelligence that must have impressed the many witty and intelligent ex-castaways who heard her - politicians, princesses, retired archbishops, retired ordinary seamen, retired editors of Punch, the lot. The Sunday Play on Radio 3 was a Marivaux comedy, Successful Strategies. Fluently translated by Timberlake Wertenbaker, given lively direction (originally for the World Service) by Hilary Norrish, it fluttered through the speakers like a butterfly, making only transient impressions and leaving nothing behind. It concerns the affairs of two pairs of French aristocrats, Dorante and the Comtesse and the Chevalier and the Marquise. Love is not seriously involved, just appearances - the Comtesse only 'notices' me, Dorante complains, but is unfaithful with the Chevalier, that adjective being socially important. The servants speak, and act, much like their employers. The Comtesse and the Chevalier are set to marry at the end - as if it mattered - and Dorante and the Marquise lament that they 'lacked faithfulness'. Penelope Wilton and Gillian Barge were the Comtesse and the Marquise, but the director had not ensured enough difference between them, so one never really cared who was speaking, even if one knew. The World Service in another aspect is in the middle of six half-hours about the history of Japan, presented by Michael Diamond. The history, that is, since Commander Perry anchored his little fleet off their coast in 1853 with a friendly message from the American President: until then, their relations with the West were only with the Dutch. In the first three programmes we have observed the increase in Japanese industrial and military power through their contacts with France and Britain, and their growingly hostile attitude to the Russians, culminating in the Russo-Japanes war in 1904. The Japanese victory led the West to greater friendship. There was actual talk of Japanese troops on the North-West Frontier, and in 1914 the Japanese joined the Allied side in the Great War - even, after 1917, escorting American shipping in the Pacific. Japan already had to be treated as an equal: in 1921 a treaty rated the world's three major naval fleets in the proportion of 5:5:3 for US, Great Britain and Japan. In 1931 the Japanese invaded Manchuria and founded the state of Manchukuo. That takes us to the end of the third half-hour, though I have barely touched more than the headlines of the programmes. They go out on Sundays (the third one tomorrow) at two o'clock and 11.30 pm, and on Mondays at 6.30 and 10 am.</p>

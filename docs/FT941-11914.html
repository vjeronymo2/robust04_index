			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Bangkok railway project approved The Thai cabinet yesterday approved a plan by Bangkok Land, the country's biggest property company, to build an elevated passenger railway system designed to easetraffic congestion in the capital. Bangkok Land's project, costing more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) is the successor to the ill-fated Skytrain contract won by SNC-Lavalin of Canada. That deal was cancelled in 1992 by a previous Thai government after 17 years of deliberations. Yesterday's announcement gives Bangkok Land a boost in its effort to implement the project, but the citizens of Bangkok have been disappointed so often in the past that few will believe in any mass transit system until they see it under construction. In approving the project yesterday, the government expressed reservations about the environmental impact of the elevated railway and suggested an action plan to reduce environmental damage. Some politicians, backed by environmentalists, say an underground railway would be better than an elevated system, and Bangkok Land may be obliged to run at least part of the 20km line underground if the project goes ahead. Among the contractors chosen by Bangkok Land are Thai Leighton and Bouygues Thai, affiliates of the Australian and French groups. Bangkok Land says it intends to issue Dollars 600m in convertible eurobonds to help fund the project. Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Thai prime minister, has been sharply criticised by his political opponents for failing to tackle Bangkok's traffic jams decisively. Muchof the blame lies with his predecessors, who ignored the need for investment in infrastructure.</p>

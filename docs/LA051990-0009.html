			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH, CONGRESS GRAPPLE WITH FEDERAL DEFICIT  </P> <P> Our politicians are saddling the future generations with a tremendous burden of  national debts.  </P> <P> Yet, the word "tax" frightens many including President Bush. I am sick of  reading his twisted lips.  </P> <P> Now, for a change, Mr. President, read my lips "we need new taxes." Forget the  voodoo economics and balance the budget. I hate paying more taxes, but am  willing to do my share. Got the message, Mr. President?  </P> <P> DON C. OKA  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lower copper prices behind Fags decline The lower copper price was the main cause of a sharp profits fall in the mining division of Antofagasta Holdings, the UK-quoted group with mining, railway, industrial and banking interests in Chile. This fall lay behind a 35 per cent decline in group pre-tax profits from Pounds 29.3m to Pounds 19.2m in 1991. The company said that it would be introducing two new copper mines in 1992 which were expected to increase copper production, attributable to the group, from 31,000 tonnes in 1991 to 53,000 tonnes in 1992. This time mining made profits of Pounds 5.59m (Pounds 14.5m) on turnover of Pounds 43.4m (Pounds 45.2m). Group turnover was static at Pounds 57.1m. Group operating profits shrank 48 per cent to Pounds 9.82m (Pounds 18.9m) and income from associated companies  -in banking, manufacturing, telecommunications and mining - slipped 10 per cent to Pounds 9.34m. Earnings fell to 50.2p (76p) per share, but an unchanged final dividend of 13p is recommended for a maintained total of 19p.</p>

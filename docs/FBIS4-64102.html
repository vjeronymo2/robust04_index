			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Today's session of the Armenian Supreme Council  chaired by Ara Sahakyan, first deputy chairman of the Supreme  Council, examined the forestry code. Baykar Ashotyan, a  professor at the Botanical Institute of the Armenian Academy of  Sciences, delivered a report on the scientific principles of the  code. He noted that the forestry code aims at regulating the  legal and economic relations arising during the exploitation of  the forests and at actively contributing to the scientifically  grounded exploitation, rehabilitation, and protection of the  forests by taking into consideration their ecological and  economic importance.    In fulfillment of the decisions of the Armenian Supreme  Council and Government on measures to organize and implement the  spring agricultural work in 1994, the parliament heard a report  from Armenian Agriculture Minister Ashot Voskanyan on the  progress of spring sowing. [passage omitted]    Next, the Supreme Council took up the discussion of the  issues under debate during its three-day session. On second  reading, the parliament adopted bills on the protection of the  atmosphere, on the protection and dissemination of cultural  wealth, and on refugees.    The parliament also adopted a number of important economic  bills. Particularly important were the bills on income tax and  tax exemptions for (?certain) enterprises. [passage omitted]    The Supreme Council adopted at first reading a bill on the  legal status of the foreign citizens in Armenia and the code on  forestry.    Next it ratified the agreement on the movement of the  citizens of Armenia and Georgia through their territories  without a visa, and then the international convention on banning  the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical  weapons, and on the destruction of chemical weapons.

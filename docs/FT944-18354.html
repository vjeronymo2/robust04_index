			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / US move over Sinn Fein puts pressure on Britain Pressure mounted on Britain yesterday to clear the way for preliminary talks with Sinn Fein early next year as the US began the process of normalising relations with the IRA's political wing. Mr Al Gore, the vice-president, informed Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, in a telephone call that the US was lifting its ban on official contacts with Sinn Fein representatives. A senior administration official said this was 'the beginning of a relationship with Sinn Fein, a party with whom we've had no official contacts for 25 years'. Mr Gore's telephone call appeared designed to raise contacts with Mr Adams to the highest level possible without offending the British government by a meeting at the White House. Although Mr Adams has been pressing for a more conspicuous meeting with President Bill Clinton or Mr Gore, officials said he had not made any formal request for such a meeting. Downing Street's response to the telephone call was low key, with officials emphasising that 'the Americans have got to decide for themselves' how they receive Mr Adams. But moderate unionists complained that the move was improper and premature. 'They would have been wiser to wait until Sinn Fein became a normal political party,' said Rev Martin Smyth, the Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast. Yesterday's move came as Mr Adams prepared for a high-profile television debate with Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman. The British government is analysing with great care remarks made by the Sinn Fein president during his second visit to the US this year. London has promised to begin dialogue on how to admit Sinn Fein to political talks on Northern Ireland's future within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence It is still not convinced that the month-old ceasefire is for good. But senior officials said yesterday that every day which passed 'without violence, without killing' gave grounds for optimism. A first meeting will take place today at the State Department between Mr Adams and Mr John Kornblum, deputy assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Mr Kornblum will be joined by Mr Leon Fuerth, national security adviser to Mr Gore. In a letter to Mr Adams confirming today's meeting, Mr Anthony Lake, Mr Clinton's principal national security adviser, said the Sinn Fein leader's 'role in bringing about the IRA ceasefire was a courageous step forward for peace'.</p>

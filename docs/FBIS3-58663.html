			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kostas Venizelos] </F>   [Text] The United States and Britain have permanent  relations and contacts with the so-called Turkish "embassy" in  the occupied areas, and have maintained consular offices there  for many years. The U.S. and British diplomatic missions  appointed to Cyprus have developed relations with the illegal  regime and Ankara's spokesman in a form that directly recognizes  the pseudostate and legalizes the invasion.    After Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate  special representative on Cyprus, British High Commissioner  David Dain, and U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher had separate  meetings with Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy  under secretary, at the Turkish "embassy" building, government  spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis yesterday revealed: On 29 October  (Turkish National Day) every year, U.S. and British diplomats  participate in a reception hosted by the Turkish "ambassador."    Kasoulidhis confirmed that these two countries maintain  consular offices in the occupied areas. (Britain's office is on  Shakespeare Street in occupied Nicosia and the U.S. office is in  Kyrenia). According to reliable information, Turkish Cypriots  work in these offices under U.S. and British diplomats. The  same reports say that the U.S. and British diplomats often  violate the Cypriot Government's rule and stay in the occupied  areas for over 24 hours. (One diplomat recently stayed in the  occupied areas for three days)    The Cypriot Government knows the identities of the diplomats  visiting the occupied areas. Asked, the spokesman said the  government would not control the movements of diplomats who  cross to the occupied areas at the Ledra Palace Hotel. He added  that no action has been taken or demarches made with regard to  these incidents. The spokesman said the foreign minister will  talk to the U.S. and British ambassadors about their meeting  with Ulucevik and refer to their relations with the Turkish  "ambassador." He will also ask Feissel to explain.    Asked about the meetings, Kasoulidhis said that despite  these  countries repeatedly stressing that they do not afford the  occupation any status, we cannot consider meetings in the  occupied areas with representatives of the occupation force as  an acceptable policy.    Kasoulidhis was quick to explain the reasons persuading  Dain,  Boucher, and Feissel to meet Ulucevik. He stressed: "These  meetings obviously aimed to exert influence with Ankara at a  time when Ulucevik would be communicating with the Turkish  Cypriot leadership to formulate the Turkish position on the  confidence-building measures. These and other actions highlight  Turkey's responsibility for the ongoing deadlock and for future  developments."    Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis yesterday had a working  luncheon with Feissel. He is expected to meet the U.S. and  British ambassadors in the next few days.    DIKO [Democratic Party] issued a statement saying that the  foreign diplomats and UN representatives' meetings with  Ulucevik, at the very least, show contempt and a lack of respect  for the legal Cypriot Government.</p>

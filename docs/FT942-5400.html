			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Worry over dividends - Personal investors face threat to income Personal investors might see another attack on their dividend income if recent government policy hints are translated into action in the next Budget. Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, is reviewing savings and investment. And, in a recent speech to the Confederation of British Industry council, he suggested high dividend pay-outs in recent years may have restricted companies' ability to invest for the future. Dorrell ruled out a return to the dividend controls imposed in the 1970s and said tax changes would not be made until the government could 'first identify the improvement we seek and, secondly, establish that tax changes are the best means of achieving it.' Nevertheless, City opinion is concerned about the potential for a tax change. The National Association of Pension Funds is sending a report to Dorrell arguing that there is no evidence to suggest high dividend payouts restrict investment. The government has already made one attack on the tax position of dividends. Norman Lamont, then chancellor of the exchequer, cut advance corporation tax (ACT) to 20 per cent in his March 1993 Budget. But the peculiar UK system of dividend taxation meant that this 'cut' actually reduced the income of many investors. The British system is designed to stop investors from facing 'double taxation'; this would occur if they paid tax on dividend income on which companies had paid corporation tax already. Instead, UK companies pay ACT when they make their dividend payments to shareholders. This ACT is then offset against the company's corporation tax bill on its annual profits. For basic-rate tax investors, the ACT payment is regarded as meeting their income tax liability. But the growth of pension funds, which are non-taxpaying, has had a peculiar effect on the system. A pension fund can reclaim the ACT paid by a company. Every time it receives a net dividend, it also gets a tax credit to cover the ACT paid. It uses this credit to reclaim the tax from the Inland Revenue, a process known as 'grossing up' the dividend. Thus, by reducing the tax credit, Lamont's cut in ACT cut funds' income. What about private investors? If a Dorrell-inspired reform followed the Lamont example, the two largest groups to be hit would be higher-rate taxpayers and investors in personal equity plans. Take a company which pays a net dividend of 7.5p. Under the pre-Lamont system, that would have generated a tax credit of 2.5p. A Pep investor could claim this credit, in the same way as a pension fund, and earn 10p in total. A higher-rate taxpayer would have been forced to pay the difference between the basic rate of tax, 25 per cent, and the top rate of 40 per cent. This 15 per cent rate, charged on the gross dividend of 10p, would reduce the higher-rate investor's dividend to 6p. Lamont reduced the ACT rate to 20 per cent. This meant that, in the above example, the tax credit fell to 1.875p, and the total return to the Pep investor to 9.375p. The higher-rate taxpayer was hit, too. He now had to pay the difference between 20 per cent and 40 per cent tax (that is, his 'extra' tax bill increased from 15 to 20 per cent). This meant that his net dividend fell from 6p to 5.625p. Overall, the income of both higher-rate and Pep investors was reduced by 6.25 per cent. Say the next Budget reduced the ACT rate further, to 15 per cent. On a net dividend of 7.5p, the tax credit would be 1.32p, making a gross dividend of 8.82p. For higher-rate taxpayers, their after-tax dividend would fall to 5.29p. Both sets of investors would see a fall in income of 5.9 per cent. Basic-rate taxpayers are unlikely to be affected, in income terms at least. The Lamont Budget also cut the basic tax rate on dividends to 20 per cent, which ensured that 25 per cent taxpayers came out even from the change. A similar measure would be likely if ACT was reduced to 15 per cent. But basic-rate taxpayers might still get a capital hit. One key valuation measure for the stock market is the gross dividend yield. That would fall automatically if the ACT tax change was implemented. At the moment, the FT-A All-Share index is yielding around 3.9 per cent, at an index level of 1,500. A change to 15 per cent ACT would reduce that yield to 3.66 per cent. But if investors were willing to hold shares at only a 3.9 per cent yield, the All-Share index would have to fall to 1,411.5, a drop of 5.9 per cent, to restore the status quo. An ACT change might not happen. Governments often have 'flown a kite' about some major policy move in order to gauge public reaction. If that was hostile, the initiative could be withdrawn without loss of face. Alternatively, a less stringent measure could be introduced in the belief that interest groups would be less forthright in their opposition because they were relieved the worst horrors had been avoided. Nevertheless, unless the government explicitly rules out a change, expect the issue to gain greater prominence as the November Budget approaches. In the meantime, speculation about the change may further undermine sentiment in an already weak equity market.</p>

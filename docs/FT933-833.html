			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Amstrad looks for chief executive A CHIEF executive is being sought for Amstrad, the consumer electronics group which led the UK personal computer boom in the 1980s but since slipped into loss. The move is designed to strengthen the company's day-to-day management and give Mr Alan Sugar, the Amstrad founder and chairman, greater freedom to concentrate on company strategy. Mr Sugar, the dominant figure in the organisation, currently combines the role of chairman and chief executive. The new appointment will result in his taking a less direct role in the running of the company, which will be in the hands of the new appointee and Mr Malcolm Miller, one of Mr Sugar's most trusted lieutenants. Critics of the company's corporate governance argue too much power rests in Mr Sugar's hands. They were angry last year when he failed to take the company private through a 30p a share offer. He has since gone some way to mollifying them by appointing two non-executive directors and seeking a third. Amstrad shares closed at 42p on Friday. The decision to appoint a chief executive is part of a broad package of measures to revitalise the company which Mr Sugar will announce with Amstrad's 1992-1993 results, due next month. He had already hinted he was planning a shake-up when he announced the Pounds 6.4m acquisition earlier this month of Dancall Radio, a loss-making Danish cordless telephone company. Among changes likely as a result are: A stronger emphasis on telecommunications, including mobile telephony, to complement the company's successful drive into satellite communications. The satellite business now accounts for 30 per cent of revenues, while video systems accounts for 20 per cent. Mr Miller is expected to manage the consumer electronics company and will work with the new chief executive on new ventures and acquisitions. A move away from personal computers (PCs) as the heart of the company's business. PCs were at one time Amstrad's most profitable line, accounting for more than 70 per cent of revenues, but intense price competition and heavy research and development costs have cut profit margins to the point where it is hard for groups like Amstrad to compete with US market leaders like Compaq or Dell. Now PCs account for less than 40 per cent of turnover. The company lost Pounds 71m last year and is likely to report a further loss this year.</p>

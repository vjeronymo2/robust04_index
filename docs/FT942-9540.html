			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Travel: Kashmir prays for paradise restored - Victoria Schofield visits a valley 'too beautiful for war' Mine was to be the first entry for 1994 in Gulam Butt's visitors' book. As I wrote my name, he predicted that my stay on his houseboat was a good omen. My last visit to Kashmir, in 1981, was long before the recent troubles started. As the owner of a fleet of eight de luxe houseboats, moored on Upper Pal lake, Butt's story was not unfamiliar. Since 1990, when activists began an armed struggle against the Indian government, the beautiful valley of Kashmir, with its 1,500 splendid wooden houseboats, has lacked a flow of tourists. Mostly, the houseboats lie empty. Enjoying breakfast and looking out over the lake towards the snow-capped mountains and the Shalimar gardens, laid out by the Moguls in the 17th century, it was hard to believe that Srinagar was still the focal point of a guerrilla war which had put the entire valley under military occupation. The Indian army is determined to crush the insurgency. Equally, the militants are as committed to continuing their struggle against what they view as the tyranny of the Indian government. 'Asadi' (freedom) is on the lips of shop owners, taxi drivers and houseboat owners. For people such as Butt and the 1,000 other houseboat owners, the loss in livelihood has been tremendous. Shikara owners have also suffered: a paddle-boat ride on Pal lake was once a feature of a Kashmiri holiday. Today the shikaras lie dormant; the lake is thick with weeds. Hamid, a taxi driver and houseboat owner, is more stoic than some about the deprivations. 'We don't care about our economic problems, but we do want independence,' he said. Another houseboat owner dared not complain about the loss to his business. 'If militants hear me say my business is suffering, they will come to me and say: 'You are worrying about money and we are losing our lives.'' Yet contrary to what I had heard before my visit, the valley is not closed, either to journalists or tourists. And Robert Shadworth, the tour manager of Top Deck bus tours, has regularly accompanied tourists, mainly from Australia and New Zealand, to Kashmir as part of a three-month bus trip from Nepal to London. 'Except for one year, when the trouble started, we have continued to run tours twice a year,' he said, 'and we've never had any difficulty. One time, we were sitting on our houseboat and we were told later that 150 people had been killed in the centre of town, but we never heard a thing.' Have prices for accommodation gone down? 'Well, they haven't put them up in five years,' he said. Commercial flights run regularly to Srinagar. The airport is full of army personnel. Intelligence officers require all foreigners to report to them, and bags are searched. But visitors do get through: Stephen Humphrey, an accountant from Birmingham, was relaxing on a houseboat on Pal lake as a way of escaping from the heat and bustle of Delhi. 'I didn't know about the place nor its beauty, but a travel agent in Delhi made the suggestion,' he said. Travellers also visit Kashmir to go trekking in the foothills of the Himalayas. A French travel enthusiast, Patrique Hubert, has been in Srinagar for three years, organising accommodation on houseboats and trekking expeditions. 'It is not what we call classical tourism, not your average holidaymaker; the Americans have mainly stayed away, but still people come from Australia, Japan, Germany, France, Italy,' he said. 'Sometimes they fall in love with the place, which proves that Kashmir still has the ability to attract.' Nor have skiers forgotten the magnificence of the Himalayan mountains. Transport is mostly by helicopter, and an outfit called Himalayan Heli Ski, run by the Swiss skier Sylvain Soudan, has continued to offer a week's holiday in Gulmarg from January to April. The town of Srinagar has little attraction for the tourist, and the consequences of the insurgency are all too evident. The military is everywhere. There are bunkers at each crossroads and straddling every bridge. The streets are filled with gun-toting border security forces and local police. Without warning, streets can be cordoned off because of a 'crackdown' - common parlance for a search by the military for weapons. The curfew in Kashmir has now been lifted, but no one wants to venture out after dark. Hamid, the taxi driver, told me how frequently he had been stopped by the army and beaten up on his way home after work. There are countless stories of young men being apprehended by the military, tortured and killed. One of the former maharajah's guest houses, which has a magnificent view over the lake, has been taken over by the border security forces and is known to be one of the interrogation centres. Suspected militants are taken there for what an intelligence officer called a 'few slaps' to make them reveal where they have hidden their weapons. People kept saying Kashmir was too beautiful to be torn apart by war. And despite their political troubles, the Kashmiris appear as eager as ever to welcome tourists. 'We don't have any other industry. Our main income is from tourist traffic,' says Abdul Kotroo, former president of the houseboat owners' association. 'And we pray to Almighty God to restore the peace in our valley.' Contrary to rumours that the houseboats are being sold plank by plank, owners are keeping them ready. Gulam Butt's boats were immaculate and he insisted I see his 'honeymoon houseboat', ever hopeful that Kashmir would again become, in the words of Emperor Jehangir, 'paradise on earth'.</p>

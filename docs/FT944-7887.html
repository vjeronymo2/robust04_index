			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Tangentopoli touches the highest level: The judicial shadow hanging over Silvio Berlusconi will prolong Italy's damaging political uncertainty For a polished performer like Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, the task of hosting this week's UN conference on cross-border crime in Naples looked simple: photo opportunities with the UN secretary-general, a tough line on money laundering and the Mafia, and a chance to improve a dented international image. But the job seems to have turned into a cruel joke against a man already visibly wearied by his short experience of politics. On Monday, the prime minister was obliged to defend his 10-month-old political movement, Forza Italia, following a poor showing in Sunday's regional and local elections. Then, just before lunch yesterday, Mr Berlusconi received a formal warning from Milan magistrates that they wanted to question him soon about allegations of bribery and corruption at the top of Fininvest, his private media, financial services and retailing group. Putting a brave face on the news, he was expected to return to Naples last night or this morning for the closing sessions of the UN conference. Mr Berlusconi has been sent the formal warning, or avviso di garanzia, in his capacity as controlling shareholder of Fininvest, and it does not imply that he has committed a crime. What is certain, however, is that Milan's crack anti-corruption magistrates would not have risked undermining the government, and upsetting the financial markets, without first ensuring that they could justify the sending of a formal warning. They learned that lesson in October, when Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, who heads the Milan team investigating Italy's bribes scandal or Tangentopoli (bribesville), told the press that the inquiry was reaching 'high political levels'. Even some of his supporters thought the comments ill-judged and they triggered the resignation, later retracted, of Mr Alfredo Biondi, the justice minister. Mr Borrelli was obliged to clarify that no avviso di garanzia was pending for the prime minister. Technically, that may have been true. Apparently, Mr Berlusconi's name was only added to the list of people in line for investigation on Monday. The formal warning is believed to relate to the Milan magistrates' investigation into bribes of L130m (Pounds 52,000) and L100m paid to tax police by Mondadori, Fininvest's publishing subsidiary, and Mediolanum Vita, its life assurance subsidiary, in 1991 and 1992, in return for a favourable tax audit. These are not new allegations. Mr Berlusconi's brother Paolo was arrested in connection with the same inquiry during the summer and later released. Both brothers have admitted publicly that bribes were paid, and Paolo has assumed responsibility for giving the orders. The prime minister's line, repeated again yesterday before the formal notice of investigation was published, is that he has committed no crime, and therefore need not resign. If Fininvest's top managers erred, it was because, 'like thousands of other managers and entrepreneurs', they were victims of extortion rather than actively involved in corruption. But critics argue that this is not just a matter for Mr Berlusconi's conscience. The magistrates' decision, coming so soon after Forza Italia's disappointing performance in Sunday's elections, is bound to bolster the morale of the opposition parties and trade unions. That could make it more difficult for Mr Berlusconi to push through the controversial 1995 budget in the senate. The budget measures, which include cuts in welfare and pension benefits, were approved by the lower chamber of deputies on Monday, but the main government parties do not have a majority in the senate. The next test for Mr Berlusconi's strength will be tomorrow's talks with Italy's trade unions federations, aimed at averting a general strike on December 2, the second in as many months. It seems unlikely, however, that this will lead to new elections, so soon after the March poll, which was welcomed as a new start for a country undermined by widespread corruption. Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the Italian president, indicated on Monday that in any case he would call for a 'presidential government' if the coalition collapsed, rather than dissolve parliament. Of Forza Italia's coalition partners, Mr Gianfranco Fini, leader of the rightwing National Alliance, has used Sunday's election results to call for unity between the government parties, while Mr Umberto Bossi, the volatile leader of the populist Northern League, indicated yesterday that the government should hold on at least until full parliamentary approval of the budget, due by December 31. What is more worrying, particularly for the international image of the government, is that the prime minister should still be working under the shadow of a judicial investigation. Defending Mr Berlusconi yesterday, Mr Biondi pointed out that the alleged crime 'was supposed to have taken place when he (Mr Berlusconi) was a private citizen, just a businessman'. But political opponents question whether this particular businessman should have taken the risk of running for high office without resolving a conflict of interest which is helping to prolong a period of damaging political uncertainty.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat and Foreign  Minister Carlos Figueroa have announced the creation of a team  of advisers and foreign consultants to coordinate the  internationalization of Chile, either through NAFTA or through  the signing a free trade bilateral agreement with the United  States (TLC).    A delegation of five specialists, headed by Ricardo Vicuna,  will go to Washington tomorrow to begin the first technical  analysis with experts from the U.S. Department of Commerce. For  four or five days, they will discuss Chapter 11 of the NAFTA  agreement regarding investments, the content of the agreements  proposed by the United States, and the Chilean foreign  investments system -- particularly Decree Law 600. [passage  omitted]    During yesterday's news conference, the ministers announced  the names of the 21 permanent advisers and foreign consultants  who will head the NAFTA negotiations. The following are the  close advisers of Aninat who belong to the team: Andrea  Butelmann, Jorge Kaufmann, Joaquin Vial, Maria E. Wagner, and  Ricardo Vicuna, who heads the mission to Washington for  technical consultations. Liselott Kana of the Foreign  Investments Committee, Oscar Landerretche of the Economy  Ministry, and Gloria Pena of the Central Bank are also members  of the team.    The foreign advisers are: Vittorio Corbo, Andres Velasco,  Ricardo Katz, Felipe Larrain, Antonia Silva, Blas Tomic, Esteban  Tomic, Jaime Undurraga, Augusto Aninat, Juan Gabriel Valdes, Lia  Venezian, Josefina Vial, and Maximiliano Cox.    As the various stages in the negotiations are reached,  experts of the Foreign, Agriculture, and Labor Ministries and  the secretary general of the Presidency will join the team.  [passage omitted]    Minister Aninat admitted having made a mistake when he  estimated that a draft agreement regarding NAFTA or a bilateral  agreement would be ready by late March 1995: "I would say it was  an erroneous estimate, a bit tight, but you must admit one  thing: All sectors started discussing the meaning of NAFTA and  we believe, in our capacity as government, that it was necessary  for all sectors to open their eyes and start to learn about such  an important issue."    Aninat refused to predict a date for a final agreement  although he said he thought it would take less than the two and  a half years it took Mexico, Canada, and the United States.

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bang &amp; Olufsen sees profit of DKr100m Bang &amp; Olufsen, the television and audio equipment manufacturer, said it expects to return to profit for the first time after three years of losses. It forecasts a pre-tax profit of DKr100m (Dollars 15m) for the year ending on May 31 compared with a loss of DKr42.3m in the previous year. The group has adjusted the forecast made in its half-year interim statement in January, when it predicted profits for the full year of about DKr70m. The performance has improved after a rationalisation programme was implemented in the autumn of 1992 aiming at reducing costs, reorganising the European sales and marketing operations, and introducing a cheaper range of television sets. First-half group sales were ahead by 18 per cent to DKr1.21bn from DKr1.03bn and profits after net financial costs were DKr50m against a loss in the same period of the previous year of DKr45m. Sales in the second half of the fiscal year have exceeded expectations in several of its European markets, including Denmark, Norway, Germany and the Netherlands.</p>

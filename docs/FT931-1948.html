			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Vibroplant shares dive on warning Shares of Vibroplant, the plant hire group, yesterday fell 23 1/2 p to 42 1/2 p following a warning from directors that the results for the year to end-March would be materially below market expectations. As anticipated in the interim results announced last November, the group experienced a decline in profitability in the second half with pressure on both volumes and margins in the UK. Furthermore, it suffered a 'significant' increase in bad debts during the period. In the US, there had been a sharp decline in activities in the fourth quarter. The preliminary results for the past year are due to be released in June. No decision has yet been made concerning the final dividend. For the 1991-92 year pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 4.5m. A final dividend of 2.38p made an unchanged total of 3.6p.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] While Political Spring leader Andonis  Samaras states he is mainly interested in attracting "the  thousands of his anonymous supporters" since adherence to his  party by well-known political figures is "natural," it would not  be surprising if his longtime presence in the New Democracy (ND)  resulted in a number of former and present ND deputies switching  to his party, writes Dhimitris Kapranos in the 30 April-1 May  Athens daily I KATHIMERINI. Nevertheless, a cautious Political  Spring official cited by Kapranos warns that "switches" should  not be expcted before the European Parliamentary elections, the  results of which may "determine the fate of the big parties." At  any rate, Political Spring aspires to doubling the 5-percent  share of the vote it obtained in the last legislative elections.  At the same time, Samaras' decision to vote in the Chamber of  Deputies against the enlargement of the European Union has been  much discussed, Kapranos continues. Samaras fears that  enlargement without previous deepening will contribute to the  creation of a weak European Union (EU) in which Germany will  become a "European superpower" with ties to the Baltics, Poland,  the Czech Republic, and other European countries, and which will  be defined by German interests. Kapranos notes also that the  Political Spring view of a "determined Greece possessing strong  national characteristics" apparently has a deep resonance in  public opinion.</p>

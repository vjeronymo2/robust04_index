			<p>BFN     [Text] The Azerbaijani Army shelled Armenia's borders on  the evening of 20 April and tonight. The Armenian Defense  Ministry press service reports that the defensive positions  around Berkavan and [place name indistinct] in Noyemberyanskiy  Rayon, and Chinari and Movses villages in Tavushskiy Rayon came  under shelling until midnight from various types of weapons.  Our border guards were forced to retaliate.    Disregarding the agreement on a cease-fire, the armed  formations in Nakhichevan shelled the border positions near  Brnakot and Shaghat in Sisianskiy Rayon with an armored vehicle,  grenade launchers, and howitzers between 2000 and 2100 on the  same day. The Armenian border guards did not retaliate. These  same villages were again shelled from Nakhichevan at noon on 21  April. The enemy used grenade launchers. There are no  casualties. We have not received any more information on the  border situation today.</p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 21 PICKED AS JUDGE BEGINS TO FILL JURY POOL FOR POINDEXTER TRIAL  </P> <P> Twenty-one people, including a lawyer who worked for the Bush presidential  campaign, were chosen as prospective jurors Monday for the Iran-Contra trial of  former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter.  </P> <P> Poindexter is charged with five felony counts -- one of conspiracy, two of  obstructing Congress and two of making false statements to congressional  committees -- in connection with accusations that he covered up Oliver L.  North's secret Contra resupply network and lied about a 1985 shipment of Hawk  missiles to Iran.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene disqualified 76 people from a pool of 206  because they said they had heard or read some of Poindexter's 1987  congressional testimony.  </P> <P> Seventeen of the first 21 in the pool were women. Jury selection is to continue  today.  </P> <P> The judge approved for the jury pool a real-estate lawyer who worked in  President Bush's campaign as part of a group doing background reviews of  potential vice presidential candidates. Bush was President Ronald Reagan's vice  president at the time.  </P> <P> Poindexter's lawyers are expected to replay Reagan's videotaped testimony in  court.  </P> <P> Most of those questioned said they knew little about the Iran-Contra affair.  </P> <P> Each of the charges against Poindexter could carry a maximum five-year prison  term and $250,000 fine on conviction.  </P></p>

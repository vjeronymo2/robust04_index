			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Observer: Open arms The prime minister's bid for more open government clearly has some way to go when it comes to arms sales. Last year John Major strongly backed plans for a UN register on which all significant exports of weapons would be declared. But the Ministry of Defence was not keen to advertise last Friday's arrival of its big-spending guest Mohammed Najib Tun Abdul Razak, Malaysia's defence minister. His country has bought more than Pounds 1bn of British arms in the past three years and hasn't finished spending. Having been spirited off to a helicopter show in Middle Wallop, the visitor and his plans to meet ministers and industry had to be acknowledged - albeit 12 hours later. Memo to Britain's top brass: to keep such visits secret, urge the customer not to arrive on the same flight from Jakarta as the Duchess of York.</p>

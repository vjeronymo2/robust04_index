			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Japan would back sanctions on North Korea: Tokyo prime minister reassures Clinton about taking 'responsible action' Japan yesterday reassured the US that it would support possible United Nations sanctions against North Korea over Pyongyang's refusal to allow international inspection of its nuclear facilities. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata told President Bill Clinton Japan would 'take responsible action within the bounds of our constitution' if the UN adopted a sanctions resolution. In a 20-minute phone conversation with Mr Clinton, he denied the minority Japanese government was reluctant to take UN-backed sanctions. The Social Democratic party, the second largest opposition group, opposes sanctions, a reflection of its left wing's ideological support for Pyongyang and the cash it gets from North Korean groups in Japan. Japan's gesture of solidarity came after Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the UN, said it would submit a draft sanctions resolution to the Security Council in the next few days, in response to North Korea's announcement on Monday that it would withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Official notice of the withdrawal was made yesterday by North Korea's ambassador to the UN. Ms Kathleen deLaski , US Defence Department spokeswoman, said the planned withdrawal 'really does make a serious situation even more so'. The heightened tensions unsettled share prices in Tokyo and Seoul. The Nikkei average of 225 leading Japanese stocks fell 198.84 points, or 0.9 per cent, to close at 21,353.97 although in early trading today the average was up by over 100 points. The South Korean composite index shed 19.52, or 2.1 per cent, to 903.72 yesterday. It was the sharpest one-day fall on the Seoul bourse since the nuclear dispute entered a critical phase at the end of May with Pyongyang's unsupervised removal of spent fuel rods from its nuclear reactor. Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korea's foreign minister, yesterday expressed confidence that no conflict would erupt soon on the Korean peninsula. 'Despite war talk, there is no reason to worry about the outbreak of hostilities,' he said. The door to negotiations with North Korea remained open, although 'the possibility seems much less than several weeks ago'. South Korea's President Kim Young-sam said North Korea's announced withdrawal from the IAEA was not surprising and was 'taken to avoid the disgrace of (Pyongyang) being kicked out of' the IAEA. Some government officials in Seoul believe Pyongyang may be using the threatened pull-out as a new negotiating tactic to force the US to hold a fresh round of direct talks on possible diplomatic normalisation and economic aid. North Korea has insisted direct negotiations with the US would solve the nuclear dispute. Pyongyang used a similar threat of withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in March 1993 to gain two rounds of inconclusive talks with the US last summer. Former US President Jimmy Carter will travel from Seoul to Pyongyang today, in an unofficial attempt to maintain diplomatic dialogue. Mr Han indicated it would take several weeks to pass a UN sanctions resolution against North Korea as the western powers try to persuade China to support punitive actions. 'Obviously, we do not know what the Chinese attitude will be in the next few weeks and their response will depend on what North Korea does,' said Mr Han, suggesting China would support sanctions if Pyongyang remains intransigent. Beijing made no official comment yesterday. North Korea has warned it would regard UN sanctions as a declaration of war, but Mr Han dismissed the threat. 'That's just scare tactics. We can't base our response on the irresponsible threats an irresponsible country is making.' The Japanese government has been making practical preparations for sanctions over the past few months and running simulations of the likely outcomes, ranging from a trade war to a real war. Initially, the Japanese media responded calmly, but this has developed into alarm over the past week in response to the growing momentum by the US, Japan and South Korea for phased sanctions. Japan's military presumes North Korea has the 'basic capacity' to make nuclear weapons, Mr Atsushi Kanda, director-general of the Defence Agency - Tokyo's equivalent of a defence minister - told a parliamentary committee yesterday. Existing defences would deal with a North Korean air strike, but find it 'difficult' to stop a missile such as the Rodong, an upgraded 1,000km-range Scud under development by Pyongyang.</p>

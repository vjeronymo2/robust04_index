			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THEY SEIZE TEENS WHO TAKE DRUGS;  </P> <P> TREATMENT: A CANOGA PARK TRANSPORT FIRM TRACKS DOWN MISSING YOUTHS, ALTHOUGH IT  LACKS A LICENSE. CLIENTS PRAISE IT. THE STATE HAS BEGUN A PROBE.  </P> <P> When their 15-year-old daughter ran away from their Simi Valley home in 1988  after a history of cocaine use, Donald and Alice Soeder were frustrated and  scared.  </P> <P> They knew that Jane should be off the streets and in a drug-abuse program, but  they had only a vague idea of where to find her, and no clue as to how to get  her into treatment.  </P> <P> On the advice of officials at Anacapa Adventist Hospital, a Port Hueneme drug  treatment facility, the Soeders called S&amp;L Teen Hospital Shuttle, a Canoga  Park firm that transports youths with drug problems, sometimes forcibly, to  treatment programs.  </P> <P> Within days, using photographs of the girl and telephone records, the firm  found Jane and drove her, bound by the hands and feet, to treatment, Alice  Soeder said.  </P> <P> Two years after she completed her treatment at Anacapa, Jane and her parents  have nothing but praise for S&amp;L. "There was no way that they by themselves  could have gotten me," Jane Soeder said of her parents.  </P> <P> But the firm has also drawn criticism from some drug treatment officials and  attention from regulatory officials.  </P> <P> S&amp;L operates as both a transport and an investigative service, those who  have used the firm said. Sometimes the company simply drives stubborn youths  with drug problems from their homes to treatment centers.  </P> <P> In other cases, those familiar with the firm say, it uses investigative  techniques to locate addicted teens who have run away from home, then restrains  the youths during the drive to rehabilitation facilities.  </P> <P> Last month, in response to inquiries by The Times, the California Department of  Consumer Affairs' bureau of collection and investigative services began to  investigate S&amp;L, said Gretchen Werry, the bureau's program coordinator.  </P> <P> There is no law prohibiting private citizens from helping parents to find and  retrieve a runaway child, even if the effort requires them to use "reasonable  force," said Dallas Binger, a consultant to the Los Angeles Police Department's  juvenile narcotics unit. But anyone who does so as a business must be licensed  for the task, Binger said.  </P> <P> S&amp;L is authorized by the state to operate only as a transport service. It  is registered with the California Public Utilities Commission, the agency that  licenses businesses such as limousines, buses and airport shuttles.  </P> <P> The firm is listed in the telephone book as a conventional ambulance service  but is not licensed as such by the city, county or state, officials said.  </P> <P> Neither is S&amp;L licensed to conduct private investigative work.  </P> <P> Leslie Miller, who with Steven Sawhill owns and operates S&amp;L out of the  couple's Canoga Park house, referred questions about the firm and the state  investigation to their lawyer, Laurence H. Mandell.  </P> <P> "They just transport kids that have drug problems because the parents can't do  it for themselves," Mandell said. "They have their referrals, and things are  working out good, and they'd just like to keep it at that."  </P> <P> Mandell declined to discuss S&amp;L or the state's investigation in more  detail.  </P> <P> The Department of Consumer Affairs last Tuesday sent S&amp;L a "cease and  desist" letter, ordering the firm either to shut down permanently or to stop  the investigative part of its work until it applies for and receives the proper  state license, said Denise Grayson, the department investigator assigned to the  S&amp;L case.  </P> <P> Drug treatment officials had varying estimates of the proportion of S&amp;L  cases that involve investigative work, ranging from 20% to 90%.  </P> <P> In their application for a state transport permit, Sawhill and Miller  identified themselves as an equal partnership under the name "SLTHS." They  claimed five years of experience in the transport field, and described their  business as "shuttling teen-agers and adults to requested destination."  </P> <P> Lin Raistrick, Santa Clarita Valley representative for Toughlove, a nationwide  counseling group for teen-age drug abusers and their parents, said Sawhill told  her he began S&amp;L simply to help troubled teens receive help.  </P> <P> Raistrick said Sawhill told her he once knew a teen-age girl with a drug  problem who died after running away from home, and that as a result of the  experience he decided, "I'm going to dedicate my life to this. I'm going to  help these kids. I don't want any more to die."  </P> <P> Drug treatment workers who have referred parents to S&amp;L said the firm's  fees are based on the driving distance and time involved in locating and  transporting each teen-ager.  </P> <P> One treatment worker said the fee averages $600 per case.  </P> <P> Brent Lamb, administrator of Anacapa Adventist, a 48-bed juvenile psychiatric  hospital in Port Hueneme that uses S&amp;L "a couple times a month," said  S&amp;L's fee is not covered by patients' medical insurance. He said Anacapa,  the facility to which S&amp;L brought Jane Soeder, pays the transport fees for  the teen-agers it receives from S&amp;L, and does not pass those fees on to the  youths' parents.  </P> <P> S&amp;L is called in "only . . . upon the concurrence of the parents and the  intake people and the admitting doctor," said Anacapa controller Mike Ogden.  "So it's not, 'Go out and grab them.' It's a pretty reasoned process.  </P> <P> "But it's like anything else -- unscrupulous things occur out there."  </P> <P> Past S&amp;L customers said the firm's workers do not carry weapons, and that  when they suspect they may confront violence in retrieving a teen-ager they  contact the police for backup help.  </P> <P> Customers and treatment centers that have used the firm said they knew of no  instance in which S&amp;L injured a teen-ager who was under its care. Many  praised the company as acting professionally and compassionately in an obscure  and poorly regulated field where the potential for abuse is great.  </P> <P> Some drug treatment experts took issue with the concept of forcing teen-agers  to enter drug treatment centers.  </P> <P> Others who work with adolescent drug abusers, however, argued that forced entry  into a treatment program sometimes is necessary.  </P> <P> "It's not as simple as, 'They have to want the help to get it,' " said Jay  Cavanaugh, president of the board of directors of Interagency Alcohol and Drug  Rehabilitation Programs, a nonprofit group that runs four non-residential  adolescent drug treatment centers throughout the Los Angeles area and that has  used S&amp;L in the past. "There are a lot of times when the kids are very  ill."  </P></p>

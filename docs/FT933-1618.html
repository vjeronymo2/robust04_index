			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Treasury lobbied in battle over YT budget A BID to transfer the Pounds 1.7bn annual Youth Training budget to the Department for Education is being fought by the Department of Employment. The employment department is lobbying the Treasury to keep control of YT - which is administered by the employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils - after receiving strong representations from employers and their representative bodies. The education department wants to divert the bulk of the YT budget to help fund its plans to expand college-based training. A move to college-based YT would mean that the scheme was no longer rooted in the workplace. About 300,000 young people a year are on the current YT scheme. Mr Christopher Stewart - Smith, president of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, said in a letter to Mr David Hunt, employment secretary: 'A switch to colleges would not be helpful for those considerable numbers of young people for whom a basic competence and work-based qualification is the key to worthwhile employment.' He said that locating YT in colleges would make it driven by supply rather than demand and cause it to lose contact with the employers expected to provide work placements and jobs.</p>

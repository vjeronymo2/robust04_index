			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Six Palestinians were killed this evening in the  Jabalyah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Our correspondent  Shlomi Eldar was told that the six were Fatah members who this  afternoon attended a march in the al-Shaykh Radwan neighborhood  of Gaza commemorating a Fatah Hawks fugitive who was killed last  year. The six were apparently driving back from the march  wearing uniforms. Army sources told our correspondent that the  six were riding in two cars, and they appeared suspicious to the  troops.    Our military correspondent Alon Ben-David reports that an  IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] undercover unit ordered them to stop,  and they refused. The soldiers opened fire, killed six, and  wounded a passerby. Severe riots broke out in the Jabalyah  refugee camp, and the IDF considered imposing a curfew there.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 28 March  reports: "Curfew was clamped on Nabulus this afternoon after  two locals were injured by soldiers who fired at rioters. The  IDF intend to lift the curfew later this evening. A driver of  military truck was injured this afternoon by stones thrown at  his car in Janin."    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 28 March  adds that in the clash in Jabalyah, "two locals were injured."  The report goes on to say that "the restrictions imposed on  Nabulus this evening have been lifted."]</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Accountancy Column: Dressing the auditor in an umpire's coat  -Changes needed to ensure greater corporate accountability at the turn of the century AUDITING is in need of reform. For once, the profession has been overtaken by events. The world has changed faster than we would like, while the profession has tried too long to defend an indefensible status quo. There is now consensus that the profession needs a new sense of direction. What is less clear is where it will go: to concentrate on being good score keepers, the role assigned by the Companies Act, or to take a more active part in the play? After the event, it is often said that the auditor is 'not doing enough'. The public feels more could be done to blow the whistle on bad conduct, while management wants auditors to focus more sharply on the business risks in an increasingly complex world. But that only deals with the present. If the profession is not to be caught on the hop again, it should look forward to the changed needs for audit at, say, the turn of the century. I believe a number of demands will change the shape of audit. Stakeholders in the audit. Society will have greater demands for accountability from the corporate community. Employees, financiers, those with long-term trading relationships, the community in which companies operate and environmental interests - all will want to be better informed. They will want confidence in that information. The law is unclear on the duties of companies and the auditor to the wider community. This needs to be resolved. Scope of the audit. The sophistication of financial management techniques will challenge further the abilities of company directors to keep up with developments in areas such as treasury management and information technology. The company director will be more the strategist, without the expertise in state-of-the-art techniques held by lower levels of management. And sadly, the fraudster, too, will have acquired new skills. Company boards will no longer talk about internal controls so much as strategic risk management. The auditor will realise that he could be the catalyst for best practice. The traditional management letter, the familiar by-product of the audit - which too often resembles the scraps from the production process - will decline in usefulness. At Coopers &amp; Lybrand, we have in hand a project to provide directors with a methodical assessment of their management of risk, with a view to its being summarised in annual reports. Audit methods themselves will be recognised as something closer to the 'due diligence' process for an acquisition, both in the way the audit is approached and in the management report which results. But let us also look at how the more traditional role of the audit will change. The auditor will be more concerned with the future. An audit report solely related to past accounts will not be enough. Company reports will be expected to give better warning of future risks: of potential cash flow problems; and of the more vulnerable assumptions made in preparing the accounts. The annual report itself will form a smaller part of corporate communication. Half-year or quarterly information, presentations to analysts (not to mention City lunches) will increasingly influence share price. Technology will provide sophisticated global networks of company information. The auditor should be able to act as a catalyst for best practice in presenting company data. The audit will need to be more of a continuous process than an annual check on accounts. Skills of the auditor. It follows that the skills of the auditor will need to adapt, probably quite radically. The technical accounting and auditing rules of recent years have tended to narrow the outlook. The audit partner of the future will need to be more of a strategist in assessing business and financial risks and then in assembling the necessary audit teams. Audit will increasingly require multi-disciplinary teams, including manufacturing experts to evaluate inventory, specialists in fraud prevention, experts in IT strategy, lawyers, and so on. Accounting skills alone will no longer be sufficient to provide the most cost-effective audit. But the accounting qualification will remain as relevant, because it represents the core disciplines of objective enquiry and presentation of data. General audit experience from storeroom to boardroom will remain unrivalled as a business primer. The profession will be wise to continue to recruit high calibre graduates at least in the numbers to which it has recently adjusted. The reduction in less skilled work will present new challenges in training, for example through work shadowing of senior people. Graduate training must remain the most important investment for accountants. This thinking is being reflected at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, for example in our 'audit re-engineering project', which is changing the process to achieve greater cost-effectiveness. But there is little scope for further reduction in the price of audit without gnawing at its fabric. And we are investing heavily in information technology to achieve 'first time right' quality. Standards. One thing will not change. The traditional values of professionalism, independence and objectivity will remain at the fore. Any firm which lets these standards lapse will lose business - and deservedly so. The good auditor will be fearless in the opinions he provides. I also hope that the sterile debate on non-audit services provided by audit firms will have been forgotten. It is not relevant to high standards in practice. The audit will need to be a multi-disciplinary activity provided by multi-disciplinary firms. Sanctions. Little of what I have advocated will happen if the ratio of auditor's risk to reward stays as it is. Any extension of role could mean an exponential increase in potential liability. The profession must be unique in its risk/reward ratio. A few claims can represent the entire annual revenue of the auditing industry. We need a sensible deal on sanctions for deficient work: a reasonable limitation on liability (to all stakeholders in the audit), supplemented by fair disciplinary sanctions by the regulators. Otherwise, the auditor will have to adopt a similar attitude to the US medical practitioner, who is disinclined to give a forthright view because of the risks of being sued for getting it wrong. This is a substantial agenda for change. Score keeper or player? Maybe umpire is the best analogy - to see fair play between a company and its stakeholders. It would be a serious strategic error for the UK profession not to foresee that auditing will become more of an international activity. Capital markets will become more genuinely global and so will regulatory regimes. Different auditing and accounting standards will be an unacceptable barrier. The UK profession has a long tradition of providing advice, which naturally flows from the audit, and has set a lead to much of the world. It is surely in everyone's interests that we should continue in this tradition and strengthen the value of audit. Roger Davis is head of audit at Coopers &amp; Lybrand</p>

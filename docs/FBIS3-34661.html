Attempting to answer this question, the Palestinian side  sees  the agreement as a direct conduit for turning the Declaration of  Principles [DOP] from written words on paper into facts on the  ground -- facts that will gradually evolve into the realization  of long-term Palestinian aspirations, namely, the establishment  of an independent state and the restoration of the name of  Palestine to the map of the Middle East.    Israeli sources, however, are not so optimistic. They regard  the Cairo agreement as the first in a series of agreements and  understandings that must be reached before actual implementation  of the DOP. These sources do not expect those agreements to be  signed within a month.    In the aftermath of the signing of the DOP and the interim  agreement, events in the occupied territories have been  characterized by an escalation of Israeli practices, a  considerable increase in the suffering of Palestinians, the  perpetuation of the closure on Jerusalem, and the continued  detention of Palestinian prisoners and detainees. All these and  other developments have cast a dark shadow over any positive  expectations during the past weeks. Nonetheless, the signing of  the Cairo agreement has somewhat restored momentum to the  negotiating process, even though this momentum has not yet been  translated into reality.    Perhaps the most visible proof of the theoretical nature of  the Cairo agreement is the statement by high-ranking Israeli  sources that the situation in the occupied territories will  remain as it is until a detailed agreement in various spheres is  reached. Therefore, according to these sources, no withdrawal  from Gaza and Jericho will be carried out nor will any  Palestinian prisoners be released before those agreements are  signed.    Again, any optimism regarding the future would be premature.  Their long experience -- whose most recent lesson was the  disappointment and frustration of those who had pinned their  hopes on the interim agreement -- has taught the Palestinian  people realism. Therefore, after the Cairo agreement, it is  better for one to wait, be patient, and expect surprises of a  different nature.</p>

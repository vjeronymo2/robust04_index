			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Output price rise upsets markets A SHARP reminder for the government that underlying inflation remains a problem came yesterday with a further big increase in the price index for UK manufactured goods last month. The Central Statistical Office said the price index of goods at the factory gate rose 0.7 per cent between February and March and was 6.3 per cent higher than in March last year. Output prices have now risen at an annual rate of 6.3 per cent in the first three months of this year. Treasury officials said the figures justified the government's caution in cutting bank base rates by half a point at a time in spite of sterling's strength in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. News of the March producer price rise contributed to a fall in London share prices, which early yesterday had reached a new trading high. Investors reckoned that this would reduce the likelihood of an early cut in bank base rates from the 12 per cent level set last Friday. However, there were some grounds for optimism in the output price figures. Much of the monthly increase reflected higher prices for food, drink and tobacco following the March Budget increases in excise duties. After excluding these elements from the index, the annual rate of output price inflation dropped to 6.4 per cent last month from 6.6 per cent in February. The CSO also revised downwards the February rate of factory gate inflation from the provisional 6.7 per cent reported last month. The Treasury described this development as 'mildly encouraging'. According to Mr Peter Spencer, chief UK economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers in London, yesterday's figures could be 'a first little sign' that output price inflation is easing. Such a change of trend has been expected because recent industrial trends surveys from the Confederation of British Industry have suggested that fewer UK manufacturers are planning price increases because of the recession. Mr Christopher Johnson, group economic adviser of Lloyds Bank, suggested that the UK's comparatively high level of producer price inflation could be recession-linked. It reflected high unit labour costs caused by earnings rising quite sharply at a time of falling production. 'Some companies are putting up prices to remain solvent,' he said. Other government figures released yesterday show continuing depressed fuel and raw materials prices. The input price index rose by 0.2 per cent between February and March as higher prices for metals and home-produced food manufacturing materials were nearly offset by a seasonal fall in electricity costs. Input prices last month were 2.5 per cent lower than in March last year, compared with an annual drop of 2.2 per cent in February. However, on a seasonally adjusted basis, input prices rose by 0.6 per cent last month against a fall of 0.7 per cent in February. UK pay bargaining, Page 14 Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls as US weighs on the region Further strength in the yen and Thursday's fall on Wall Street depressed investor confidence, and the Nikkei index fell marginally on arbitrage selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 average fell 100.52 to 20,543.41 while the Topix index of all first section stocks closed 11.16 lower at 1,662.16. The Nikkei started at a high of 20,618.22 but fell to a low of 20,274.95 in the morning session as the dollar fell below Y98 to a record low against the yen. Volume totaled 380m shares against 454m. Most selling came from unwinding of arbitrage positions against the futures market while investment trusts and public fund managers led the day's buying. The Nikkei 300 fell 2.32 to 302.30. Declines led advances by 661 to 354 with 172 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.11 to 1,347.46. Reports that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the semi-privatised telecommunications company, is to list its shares in New York and London bolstered the stock. NTT, the largest company in the world in terms of market capitalisation, said that it wanted to offer overseas investors more corporate information. The stock gained Y6,000 to Y881,000, while other telecom shares were also traded actively. Nitsuko rose Y40 to Y1,570 and DDI, the long-distance telecom operator listed on the second section, rose Y30,000 to Y9.45m. High-technology shares were mixed in spite of the yen's strength. Hitachi rose Y10 to Y1,040 and NEC gained Y20 to Y1,240. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 134.77 to 22,957.49 in volume of 18.2m shares. Roundup US weakness, in the dollar and in equities, weighed on the region. Bangkok and Taipei were closed. HONG KONG was helped up from its lows by some late bargain hunting after a day of thin trade. The Hang Seng index fell 124.04 or 1.4 per cent to 8,634.37, after a low of 8,508.93, to finish 2.8 per cent lower on the week. Among property issues, Cheung Kong fell 85 cents to HKDollars 32.90, Hongkong Land eased 30 cents to HKDollars 19.20 and Henderson Land dropped HKDollars 1.55 to HKDollars 34.70. SEOUL finished slightly higher as construction shares and those with low price/earnings ratios gained ground. The composite index added 1.22 to 934.58 for a 0.6 per cent rise on the week. SINGAPORE trimmed early losses as interest developed in some index stocks and the Straits Times Industrials index ended 14.26 lower at 2,210.65, 1.6 per cent lower on the week. Shares of Kim Eng Holdings, the stockbroker, bucked the trend by rising 15 cents to SDollars 2.98 on results: it proposed a1-for-1 share bonus and 9.5 cents dividend. KUALA LUMPUR was easier in very quiet trade that saw the composite index 7.82 lower at 1,003.76, down 1.2 per cent over the week. BOMBAY began the first day of the new account with some renewed buying interest that took the BSE 30-share index 32.26 higher to 4,118.98. The index fell by 2.23 per cent on the week. Cadbury India, an affiliate of Cadbury Schweppes of the UK, fluctuated sharply in response to the announcement of a 534 per cent rise in net profits. The share rose to Rs320, before finishing Rs2.50 ahead at Rs307.50. MANILA dropped after PLDT's fall on Wall Street, and on news that the Supreme Court had deferred implementation of a new value added tax law. PLDT slid by Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 59 on Wall Street, and followed it with a fall of 40 pesos to 1,630 at home. The composite index fell 51.85 to 2,694.51, down 3.4 per cent on the week, as turnover fell from 936m to 579m pesos. SYDNEY blamed the Dow as the All Ordinaries index closed 23.3 weaker at 1965.8, down 2.6 per cent on the week. BHP produced results around expectations but the shares fell 24 cents to ADollars 17.74. WELLINGTON's NZSE 40 index fell only 13.54 at 1983.34, in spite of Wall Street and a rise in domestic bond yields on the domestic market. Thursday's budget made little impact on the market.</p>

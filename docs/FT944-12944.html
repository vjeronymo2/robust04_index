			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Barbie - the virgin queen of a plastic paradise - The world's most famous doll is 35 but never ages / A look back It has been quite a year for Barbie, the most popular doll in history. Born on March 9 1959, her 35th birthday has been celebrated all over the world; Columbia Studios is bidding for the rights to make her a film star; and Sheik Khaled Al Madkour, president of a committee in Kuwait City which advises the government on religious issues, has declared that to buy her is forbidden by Islam. There is no such veto in Monte Carlo where the National Museum is hosting an exhibition in her honour. It is drawn from the collection of one person: Jean-Pierre Icardo, an office worker from Nice who has 'between 700 and 800' Barbie dolls. Now 40, he first saw Barbie in 1964, the year she was introduced to France. He has been her faithful admirer ever since. As a child, Icardo was enchanted by all forms of decoration and wanted to work in the theatre or cinema. As he grew up, he made his own theatrical tableaux at home and put on entertainments for his friends, using dolls as actors. But traditional dolls were stiff and it was not possible to dress or pose them satisfactorily. Barbie, with her long legs, slim body and beautiful outfits, was the perfect solution. 'I fell in love,' he says, simply. After attending Nice University, he took an office job and continued to weave his theatrical dreams at home, always with Barbie as his star. His collection grew slowly: the dolls were expensive and his mother saved up to buy them for him as birthday and Christmas gifts. 'I believed I was unique,' he says. 'I had no idea there were other grown-ups who were collecting.' In March 1984, though, a convention of doll and automata collectors was held in Monaco. Icardo and his mother went along and were astonished to find all the paraphernalia of an established Barbie collectors' market, including books with descriptions of the dolls and how to recognise their ages and dates. In fact, adult collecting of Barbie began in the US in the 1970s and the first Barbie encyclopaedia was written in 1975. Now, there are Barbie conventions every year. Collectors often specialise, some buying only Barbie and shunning her family and friends, some buying only Barbies from the 1960s, now the most expensive period. Icardo tries to collect everything from 1964 onwards, conceding that his collection grows 'only very slowly - the world of Barbie is so huge'. Mattel, the company that created Barbie, makes limited editions especially for the collectors' market. Unique examples of older or special dolls, such as the very early versions made in ivory white plastic, now change hands for up to Dollars 4,000. Icardo's devotion extends to Barbie's friends and relations. This year, he told me, is also the 30th anniversary of her sister Skipper. Her best friend, Midge, will have her 30th anniversary next year. Ken, Barbie's faithful consort, was born in 1961. 'But she will never marry Ken,' Icardo insists. 'She must stay the young teenager for ever.' When first launched, Barbie was not popular with parents who, rather like Sheikh Khaled, thought her 'too sexy'. Her popularity with young girls was instant, however, and there are thought to be 700m of her worldwide. Today, Barbie and Ken lead a hectic life as their clothes, make-up and hair styles change constantly with the times: last year alone, Barbie had 100 outfits from which to choose. While Barbie's unique proportions have never changed, Ken has been altered several times. His earliest skinny body has been made bigger and his fragile flock velvet hair (now much prized if found in pristine condition) replaced with more practical paint or, for special occasions, wigs. Their world, too, has expanded from homely junior proms and fraternity meetings to a frantic round of globe-trotting and activities that include every kind of sport, making television programmes and even ballet dancing. Barbie's circle of friends reflects a changing America. Her first black friend, a girl doll dating from the mid-1960s, was followed by the grown-up Brad in 1970 and Cara and Curtis in 1975. The first Hispanic and Asiatic friends appeared in the 1980s and an American Indian was added to the circle recently. The all-American girl has only recently been made at home, though. Originally manufactured in Japan from 1959, Barbie's production cycle has followed the global trail of multi-national investment and new sources of cheap labour. She is now made at 15 locations in seven countries: Mexico, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, UK and Italy, as well as the US. Some Barbies were produced briefly under licence in various countries, so allowing regional differences to creep in; this resulted in her being more sun-tanned in Spain and smaller, with huge cartoon-style eyes, in Japan. But this has been stopped and uniformity reigns. Icardo considers this 'very sad'. Barbie, of course, is not just a pretty face. When I expressed a certain envy of her lifestyle, and pointed out that she never had to work for a living, Icardo was quick to disagree. 'She always works,' he said. 'She has been a model and a singer. This year, she was a doctor. She and Ken have been in the army, taking part in Desert Storm; and in the 1960s, the great days of Nasa, she was an astronaut.' This year's Christmas model will talk and answer questions; one released earlier swims and dives. Truly, she is a superwoman 'at the centre of her world', as Icardo puts it. Perhaps, though, it takes another woman to spot a few snags. To me, it seems obvious that, as she approaches 40, Barbie faces the same problems as the women who have tried to emulate her - success, fame, and glamour do not necessarily bring fulfilment. And few of them have made her supreme sacrifice. For Barbie - astronaut, soldier, fashion icon - has never had sex. Forever dreaming of romantic weddings - dresses for which feature among her sister's outfits, if not her own - her relationship remains unconsummated. Despite the sexual message of her appearance - huge breasts, heavy make-up, ever more sophisticated clothes - Barbie must remain untouched. She is an Eve who cannot fall, in a paradise filled not with flowers and fruit but with products. The message she brings is to look, to dream - and then, to buy. La Poupee Barbie, Anniversaire a Monaco, continues at the Musee National de Monaco, 17, Avenue Princesse Grace, Monte Carlo, until September 30. Barbie can also be seen with 33 outfits specially made for her by top French couturiers at the Musee Grevin, Paris, until December 31.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "A Production Drop at All </F> Enterprises"]    [Text] The work of the majority of the Vladimir Oblast's  enterprises has been paralyzed, including at such large ones as  the tractor plant, Tochmash [precision machinery], Elektropribor  [electrical instrument], Tekhnika [equipment], the Kovrov Plant  imeni Degtyarev, and the Murom Radio Plant.    A drop in production volume in 1993 was noted at enterprises  with all forms of ownership and in all sectors. The most  complicated situation over the course of the year persisted in  the light, chemical and fuel sectors, where the decline amounted  to 31-37 percent. The production of cotton cloth was curtailed  by half, of footwear by 51 percent, of linen cloth by 29 percent  and of knitted wear by 34 percent.    Of the sectors of the machine-building complex, the greatest  lag behind the 1992 level was noted in the machine-tool and  instrument industy --by 32.9 percent.    There is a complicated situation in the military-industrial  complex, in which every fifth oblast enterprise is engaged. The  state indebtedness for goods produced here exceeds 35 billion  rubles [R]. The average wage at these types of enterprises is  15-20 percent lower than that for the machine-building industry  on the whole.    There was a sharp increase in lost work time in connection  with the protracted production stoppages. Their percentage  increased from 8 percent in the first quarter to 17 percent in  the fourth quarter. The overall losses of work time for the  oblast last year amounted to 5.5 million man-days.    The payment indebtedness for the oblast's enterprises on 1  December amounted to R249.8 billion.</p>

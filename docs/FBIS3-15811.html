			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Good evening, dear viewers. Within  his one-day visit to Moscow Mate Granic, the Croatian deputy  prime minister and foreign affairs minister, had a meeting with  his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev. Their talks related to  all the important elements of the crisis on the territory of  former Yugoslavia, particularly the Washington Agreement between  the Croats and Muslims, and its results. Elizabeta Gojan  reporting from Moscow. [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Granic] We had talks on all important  problems relating to the crisis on the territory of former  Yugoslavia. We had talks on the Washington agreement, its  results, the current phase of negotiations in Vienna, and the  necessity to include the third party [Serbs] in the  negotiations, because without the inclusion of the third party  it is not possible to find a final solution for restoring peace  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and likewise to achieve a global solution  to the crisis. We also had talks on UN Protected Areas in the  Republic of Croatia and the need for their peaceful  reintegration. [passage omitted]    [Granic] We particularly welcome the standpoint assumed by  the Russian Federation regarding the territorial integrity of  the Republic of Croatia and the need for the UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] mandate to secure in practice all that is laid  down in the UN Security Council resolutions and to start serious  negotiations with the local Serbs.    The Washington agreement is the first important one in the  restoration of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, whose results can  already be seen on the ground. However, it does not resolve  everything. There is no final solution without the inclusion of  the third side. An agreement which is to be reached between the  federation and the third side will determine the content of the  confederation. Therefore, all negotiations on the federation  should be completed, which will then be followed by negotiations  with the third party and the final definition of the content of  the confederation.    As the United States played a very positive role in the  convergence of views and in the final signing of the preliminary  agreement, both in the present phase of the negotiations and...  [pauses] As they have backed this agreement, the Russian  Federation can likewise play an extremely positive role in  influencing Serbia itself, and the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  but also in exercising influence on the Serbs in the UN  Protected Areas [in Croatia].    [Gojan] Have you been given some guarantees?    [Granic] Talks will in every case be continued. The exchange  of views will also be continued. We have also agreed some  further steps. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

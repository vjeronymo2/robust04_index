			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Clinton ready to order air strikes PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday the US was ready to order air strikes in Bosnia if humanitarian aid efforts were hampered following the breakdown of peace talks. The warning came amid signs that US officials were stepping up pressure on the Serbs and Croats, who rejected Moslem demands in Geneva for further territorial concessions. Washington officials said the US supported the three principal demands made by the Bosnian Moslem government of President Alia Izetbegovic for changes to the division of territory proposed in Geneva: a sea outlet for the Moslem territory at Neum, an enlargement of the Moslem enclave around Bihac in north-western Bosnia, and a land corridor linking the enclaves in eastern Bosnia to the main Moslem territory. Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, said the Serbs and Croats should show greater flexibility to achieve the adjustments the Bosnian government had asked for. Mr Clinton said he believed the peace talks had stalled rather than collapsed and the US would 'do everything it can in the next few days to get the parties to resume the talks in good faith'. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, said air strikes remained a possibility if the Bosnian Serbs or Croats attacked UN forces or resumed the bombardment of Sarajevo.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Asprey alters structure following acquisitions ASPREY, the jewellery group, is restructuring its activities following a recent spree of acquisitions by turning the parent company into a holding company and devolving most operational responsibilities to five separate business units. The move is designed to enhance the operation of the individual companies and allow group management to focus more on supervisory and strategic issues. The Asprey group board will be slimmed down to six members, with four executive directors resigning to concentrate on running a new subsidiary, Asprey (Bond Street), which has been created to run the core group business operating the Bond Street jewellery showrooms. The Garrard, Mappin &amp; Webb, and Watches of Switzerland chains will also be run as separate businesses with the rest of Asprey's companies, including international businesses and the Hamilton &amp; Inches store in Edinburgh being operated as part of another division. From September 1, Mr Naim Attallah will become group chief executive and deputy chairman, having previously filled the role of joint managing director.</p>

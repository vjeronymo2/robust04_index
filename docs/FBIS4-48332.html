			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 15 SAPA -- Three Tokoza hostels  were cordoned off on Sunday afternoon after violence flared  again in the volatile East Rand township. Witwatersrand army  command spokesman Maj Christo Visser told SAPA the South African  National Defence Force [SAVDF] cordoned off the area around  Hostels One, Two and Three after claims that minibus taxi  commuters had been abducted and were being held in the hostels.  A taxi passing the hostels was shot at at about 3.30PM on  Sunday, he said. Its occupants tried to flee but were allegedly  abducted by hostel inmates. African National Congress  supporters marched to the hostel and demanded to accompany a  search of the hostels but this was rejected by hostel dwellers.  Maj Visser said SANDF reinforcements had been sent to the area  and on Sunday night members were trying to stabilise the  situation which was described as "tense but under control".</p>

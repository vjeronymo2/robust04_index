Speaking after the conclusion of their conference in Warsaw,  the ministers of defence from the four states declared they  expected the U.S. Partnership for Peace proposal to open the way  to permanent working contacts with NATO and lead to a full  membership of the alliance.    The Polish Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said that  the  Visegrad states expected the NATO summit in Brussels to be held  in a few days' time to put this proposal to detail as well as  fixing the dates for including the four countries in the  transatlantic security system.    Kolodziejczyk was very critical of Thursday's statement by  the Russian presidential spokesman who said that granting NATO  membership to central European states would enrage the Russian  military. "Either Russia has taken the road of democracy, or she  still regards herself an empire and is feverishly looking for  enemies," the minister commented.    He also made it clear that Poland was not at all interested  in any security guarantees from the West. What Poland wanted  was a full NATO membership, he explained.    Jiri Pospisil, the first deputy defence minister of the  Czech  Republic, told reporters here Friday that his country could join  NATO on its own, if that method proved faster. If not, then the  Czech Republic would join NATO together with the remaining  Visegrad states, he added.    Lajos Fuer, the Hungarian defence minister, said that it  would be NATO which would decide on whether new members will be  accepted individually or as a group. He also warned against  using the Partnership for Peace initiative for delaying a full  NATO membership.    In the official communique issued after the conference, the  ministers favourably assessed mutual relations between their  countries and to-date results of cooperation. They pledged to  continue this cooperation in future.</p>

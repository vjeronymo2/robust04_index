			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): Alarm starts a strategic withdrawal from the US - The professionals / The four also remain gloomy about the grip of recession on Europe's economies ALARM BELLS are ringing over US bond and equity markets, as far as our professionals are concerned. As they edge money cautiously back into Europe's equity markets, it is only in the markets of south-east Asia that confidence rings through. The gloomiest view came from Newton's Howard Beaufort  - perhaps not surprisingly, since he has often confessed to a pessimistic tendency: 'We retain a higher than normal bond weighting, favour the Far East, and consider many of the other equity markets of the world to be approaching boiling point.' Even more pungently, he warns: 'When financial analysts, brokers and investors begin to justify equity investment on the basis of 'where else do I put my money?' the alarm bells are beginning to ring. It may not be 1987, but I have checked under my seat for the life jacket.' Already, a price has been paid for maintaining high levels of exposure to the US market: it was the poorest performer of all the equity markets over the past quarter, offering sterling gains of just 0.1 per cent. This compared with 15.8 per cent in Germany and 9 per cent in France. No wonder Paul Myners, at Gartmore, commented that the size of US holdings in the portfolio was 'the one decision that mattered' in the past quarter: despite a 5 percentage point cut in June, his investor had 17.5 per cent of the portfolio in the US markets  - the largest share of any of the portfolios. Mercifully, US equity holdings were in small companies, which he says outperformed the market by 4 per cent. Each of our professionals plans further dilution in the US, with Baillie Gifford and Gartmore disposing of their entire US bond holdings, Newton trimming bond holdings, and Singer &amp; Friedlander paring its equity stake. They also remain gloomy about the grip of recession on Europe's economies. But, with the exception of Newton, they are more sanguine about prospects for equity markets. The conviction remains strong that interest rates must fall  - even in France: 'We are surprised by the slow rate of interest rate reductions in Europe, and believe that the pain is now such that significant future falls are likely,' comments Tim Howe, at Singer &amp; Friedlander. Our professionals are also beginning to concentrate their bond holdings in the UK, where yields match those in Europe, without the currency risk. With US interest rates now as low as they can go, and long bond yields lower than they have been for 30 years, the consensus is to get out of the market. At Baillie Gifford, Douglas McDougall continued to benefit from holding no US equities, and from concentrating holdings in south-east Asia and Europe. His only change ahead of the year's final quarter is to unload his 7.5 per cent holding in US bonds, and build his UK long-bond holding to 17.5 per cent. 'The interest rate cycle is at its most advanced stage in the US and long yields, below 6 per cent, are the lowest for 30 years,' he notes: 'With the continuing favourable outlook for inflation in the UK, and the prospect of further cuts in short interest rates, long gilt yields should have scope to fall.' In equities, he sees the US market as 'very fully valued', sees no reason to re-enter a Japanese market where companies face 'a serious loss of international competitiveness' as the yen has strengthened, and points to the dynamic markets of south-east Asia as offering 'superior' performance to those in the old industrial world. At Gartmore, Paul Myners has restored his usually bearish view of gilts by disposing of his US and UK bond holdings. He believes US bond yields 'have overshot', and prefers to hold US dollar cash in expectation of a rally in the currency in the quarter ahead. In the UK, his decision is coloured by a conviction, not shared by his fellow professionals, that interest rates have bottomed: 'There seems little left to go for in the gilt market,' he says. A boost in European equity holdings to 10 per cent is to be funded by the UK gilt sale. He feels the recent relaxation of the constraints on the European Exchange Rate Mechanism should enable much more relaxed monetary policies to be adopted: 'This should lead to considerable appreciation,' he says. Rather than confine European equity stakes to specific markets, he will in future merge the holding, now up to 10 per cent of the portfolio. This will allow him to pursue a policy of stock selection, since he feels growth will come from individual equities, rather than from broad markets. At Newton, Howard Beaufort proposes 'no major changes in a defensive portfolio'. He has switched his 5 per cent holding in French bonds into UK gilts, in view of better yields and no currency risk. He has trimmed his US bond holding by one percentage point to 4 per cent, and pared cash back to 1 per cent. Bonds account for 21 per cent of the portfolio, and are likely to continue to do so while prospects for low inflation remain good and equity markets so fully valued. He has added 1 per cent to his 8 per cent Swiss equity holding, in spite of a conviction that the European economies are 'in a mess', with the expected recovery 'a long time coming'. He has added 2 per cent to his equities in Hong Kong and south-east Asia, lifting this stake to 8 per cent: 'There will inevitably be periods of consolidation, but we remain convinced that this area will produce attractive equity returns.' Singer &amp; Friedlander's Tim Howe rues the fact that his bond holdings were concentrated on the continent of Europe  - where earlier interest-rate cuts had been anticipated  - rather than UK gilts, where performance has been stronger. But he felt that his overweight exposure to equities should have resulted in outperformance: 'A scenario of improving growth and loose monetary policy suggests equities as the most rewarding investment.' He continues to favour Asia's smaller equity markets, but suggests taking profits in Hong Kong, and concentrating on Singapore and Malaysia.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: CARE AND FEEDING OF BANKERS IS KEY  </P> <P> Jim Morris, chief executive of Envirotech International in Houston, had a  problem. He needed a way to establish credit for customers who wanted to  finance his company's water treatment systems.  </P> <P> His first discussions with local bankers were discouraging. Envirotech had only  been in business two years, and bankers traditionally require three years of  financial statements before considering a business-loan application.  </P> <P> In his ultimately successful quest for financing, Morris learned a big lesson:  You can never tell a banker too much about your business.  </P> <P> Many small-business owners think that bankers know everything about all kinds  of businesses, but that isn't true. The small-business owner needs to make sure  the banker understands what the business is all about and why the money about  to be borrowed is so critical to the venture's success.  </P> <P> As Morris persisted, he finally met Joel Pearson, an assistant vice president  at First Interstate Bank of Texas, who agreed to review Morris' customer list  and equipment brochures.  </P> <P> "With that information, I was able to show Pearson how we differed from other  water companies by not using chemicals," said Morris.  </P> <P> "They went through their sales pitch," said Pearson, who later agreed to  consider loan applications from Envirotech clients. "They were certainly  enthusiastic and excited about their products."  </P> <P> Morris, who recently moved his 14 employees into larger quarters, attributes  much of his company's success to support from Pearson.  </P> <P> Small-business bankers say they wish more entrepreneurs would find out what a  banker needs to feel comfortable. And, they say, the very best time to set up a  banking relationship is before you need the money.  </P> <P> "Invest time talking with prospective bankers," said Douglas Freeman, executive  vice president of Wells Fargo Bank's business loan division in San Francisco.  "Explain your business, its cycles and its cash needs."  </P> <P> "Bankers don't like surprises," said Williams Arant Jr., president and chief  executive officer of First National Bank of Knoxville, Tenn. "The worst thing  in the world is to hear something is wrong with a client's business through the  grapevine or to read it in the newspaper."  </P> <P> Besides open communication, Arant said the thing that makes a banker most  comfortable is the "feeling that the customer really knows his business."  </P> <P> Frank Mynard, chairman of the American Bankers Assn.'s small-business banking  unit, said if problems develop, don't wait until the last minute to call your  banker.  </P> <P> "The worst thing a small business owner can do is beg his banker for help on a  Thursday because he can't meet a Friday payroll," Mynard said.  </P> <P> He said dealing with entrepreneurs is interesting and dynamic, but frequently a  challenge.  </P> <P> If you want to gain a banker's confidence, ask for something specific. Do you  need a long-term loan to refinance existing debt, expand your business or  introduce new products? Do you need a credit line to provide short-term working  capital? How about a business credit card for keeping track of travel and  entertainment expenses?  </P> <P> Once you've figured out what you need the money for, be prepared to present  three years' worth of financial statements, business and personal tax returns,  a historical summary of the business and a secondary source of repayment.  </P> <P> You will also need a clearly written current balance sheet, profit-and-loss  statement, cash-flow projections and information on accounts receivable and  accounts payable.  </P> <P> If your business is incorporated, your banker needs to know if the stockholders  will cover the losses. If you are in a partnership, the bank usually requires  all principals to sign a personal guarantee for the loan. Sole proprietors will  be asked to back up the loan with personal assets such as a home.  </P> <P> Bankers are not magicians, and there is little mystery surrounding how they  decide whether to lend you the money. In addition to historical and industry  factors, lenders rely on ratios to determine short-term liquidity.  </P> <P> A quick way to figure your liquidity is to add up the cash on hand, accounts  receivable and marketable securities, then divide that sum by your current  liabilities including accounts payable, loans outstanding and salaries.  </P> <P> But remember, every industry has its own ratios. If your ratio is 3 to 1 and  the industry average is 7 to 1, you won't look like a very good risk to a loan  officer.  </P> <P> If you want to please a banker, read "Steps to Small Business Financing" before  applying for your next loan. The fact-filled booklet is published jointly by  the American Bankers Assn. and the National Federation of Independent Business.  Single copies are available for $2.50 by sending a check to Small Business  Financing, NFIB Foundation, Box 7575, San Mateo, Calif. 94403.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW TO MAKE YOUR BANKER LOVE YOU  </P> <P> Think of your banker as a business partner.  </P> <P> Invite your banker to visit your business to see exactly what you are doing and  how you do it.  </P> <P> Communicate regularly -- the good news as well as the bad.  </P> <P> Remember, bankers hate surprises.  </P> <P> Find out exactly what kind of documents a banker needs to process a loan --  because inadequate documentation creates unnecessary delays.  </P> <P> To generate enthusiasm for a proposed product or service, ask your banker what  he or she thinks of it. An involved banker is more likely to make a good  presentation to the loan committee.  </P></p>

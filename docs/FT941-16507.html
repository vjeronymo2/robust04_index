			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Management: Lament of the big spenders - Purchasing and supply are still not getting the attention they deserve. Michael Cassell investigates Clive Mason spends more than Pounds 6m a day every day of the year. Stuart Humby signs off a similar amount. Peter Garnett daily waves goodbye to the best part of Pounds 1m. Drawn from the highest ranks of the UK's 120,000-strong army of purchasing and supply managers who annually write Pounds 750bn worth of cheques between them, they are among the biggest of big spenders. If people like them spend wisely, they can help boost both their companies' short-term profitability and their long-term competitiveness. Mason, director of purchasing and supply for British Airways, heads a worldwide team which buys everything from jet fuel to champagne. Humby, director of group purchasing for National Westminster Bank, buys cars by the dozen for the bank's 11,500-strong fleet. Garnett is managing director of Greenalls Services, the company formed specifically to buy in everything from beer mats to beds for the shops, pubs and hotels within the Greenalls group. The benefits of professional procurement can be enjoyed by companies of all sizes. The recently-formed purchasing team at Bankers Trust, the international investment bank, reckons it has saved the business Pounds 12m in three years; Airoil-Flaregas, a Middlesex-based combustion equipment maker with annual turnover of Pounds 20m, says that improved buying procedures are saving it a useful Pounds 15,000 a month. Companies spend an average 55 per cent of total production costs on buying in goods and, increasingly, on a range of support services. But despite a growing awareness of the value of a strategic approach to the purchasing and supply function - now invariably dubbed 'logistics' - the impression remains that most British companies still fail to take the issue seriously enough. The result, according to the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, means unenlightened businesses could be spending up to one-third more than necessary and ultimately risking their own future. It also means that those charged with the purchasing role have been widely regarded as bit-players in the corporate management game, badly paid when compared to finance or marketing personnel and rarely promoted into general management. A recent survey carried out among more than 400 UK companies by the CIPS offers an 'alarming snapshot' of current attitudes. Nearly one quarter of companies do not believe they can make any savings by improving purchasing and supply practice, while 17 per cent cannot even identify the percentage of their total costs spent on buying goods and services. 'Despite high levels of external expenditure, most companies are still in the stone age as far as managing the purchase and supply chain is concerned,' says Peter Thomson, CIPS director general. The CIPS, naturally enough, wants the issue driven much higher up the management agenda until the supply chain is widely acknowledged as an important influence in the overall performance of a business. Mason, Humby and Garnett all agree that part of the answer lies in ending the compartmentalised nature of a job in which barriers are too often placed between those who sign the bills and those with purchasing expertise. Instead, they advocate a broader, strategic approach which embraces the entire company. The three agree that the process of elevating the supply chain process should ideally start with its endorsement among the highest tiers of management, with overall responsibility for the issue held by someone at or near board level. 'It is about establishing a new mind-set,' says Mason. 'You can begin by asking very senior people if they know how much their company spends, how many suppliers they have, the average length of contracts. You are often met with a glazed look but you might provoke them to go and find out.' Garnett says that by setting up a separate company to handle procurement for Greenalls, the group has made transparent the entire supply chain process, enabling it to analyse its efficiency and financial performance. 'At the end of the process, you can choose whether or not to contract out all or part of the entire supply chain, from warehousing and distribution to finance and technical services,' he says. Mason comments that one of the biggest challenges is 'getting people to shift thinking from price to cost. When you start considering whole-life costs instead of concentrating on knocking a few pounds off the initial deal, you are making progress. When we buy an aircraft, one of the elements built in is what we can sell it for 15 years later.' He adds: 'In the mid-1980s, we had 10,000 significant suppliers in the world  -now the figure is down to 3,500 and still falling. There is a different focus. People used to chase new suppliers to extract better prices but now the focus is on who can deliver what we really need.' Humby refers to partnership sourcing - the building of a long-term relationship between supplier and customer - and suggests: 'A more strategic approach to purchasing means it can be involved right at the start of the specification process so that suppliers can respond differently to meet a company's specific needs. That way you can make important step-changes to productivity. 'All too often, companies take a look at the purchasing operation and then forget it. There is a black hole in understanding. But it needs to be examined systematically, comprehensively and relentlessly,' he says. The CIPS is doing its bit to raise the profile of purchasing in the business education world, by sponsoring three university chairs and planning as many as 12 over the next five years. It is also building links with business schools in the US and the UK. Mason says that, despite the disappointing attitude towards purchasing and supply, business is at least starting to catch on. British Airways this year had more than 1,000 applications for six graduate places in its purchasing group. Greenall says: 'The function has not been seen as a route to the top - but that is going to change. To be effective in this area you need a breadth of business understanding which crosses all areas of the company. It will become a new breeding ground for successful executives.' Meanwhile, the CIPS prefers to keep its feet on the ground. 'Our survey findings are truly astonishing because of the sheer ineptitude, the sheer lack of business acumen they reveal,' says Peter Thomson. 'Not to know how much is spent and how much can be saved says very little for the businessmen concerned.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASING POWER Annual amounts spent by some large organisations  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Private sector                        Public sector  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- British Telecom    Pounds 4.5bn       British Rail        Pounds 1.5bn British Airways    Pounds 2bn         General government                                        expenditure        Pounds 150bn Ford UK            Pounds 3bn          Inc: NHS England                                        and Wales          Pounds 4bn NatWest            Pounds 2bn          NHS Scotland       Pounds 350m Rover              Pounds 2bn          Central government Pounds 3.3bn                                        (exc defence and                                        construction)                                        Universities       Pounds 2bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CIPS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Pension for a student - Briefcase Is it possible to take out a personal pension scheme on the basis of unearned (interest) income, and/or temporary work, which exceeds the tax allowance? I am a full-time student, single, aged 29. This tax year, I will receive approximately Pounds 3,500 (gross) in interest, which will be taxed at source, and Pounds 2,400 (gross) through temporary employment over the summer, which also was taxed at source. I realise I can claim back tax on the first Pounds 3,445 (personal allowance), but this still means I am paying tax on about Pounds 2,400. Does this qualify as taxable income from which I can make tax-free contributions to a personal plan? Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR78 (Personal pensions: a guide for tax). Although you could make a small payment into a personal pension scheme, it does not look as though that would make economic sense. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

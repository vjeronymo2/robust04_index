Modes of Transmission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RSV is present in large numbers in the respiratory secretions of symptomatic persons infected with the virus and can be transmitted directly via large droplets during close contact with such persons, or indirectly via RSV-contaminated hands or fomites. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 503,524,525 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The portal of entry is usually the conjunctiva or the nasal mucosa. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 526 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Inoculation by RSV-contaminated hands is the usual way of depositing the virus onto the eyes or nose. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 503,524&hyph;526 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Hands can become contaminated through handling of infected persons' respiratory secretions or contaminated fomites. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 524,525 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In nosocomial RSV outbreaks in which the viral isolates were typed, more than one strain of RSV has often been identified, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 504,513,539 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  suggesting multiple sources of the virus. Potential sources include patients, hospital staff, and visitors. Because infected infants shed large amounts of virus in their respiratory secretions and easily contaminate their immediate surroundings, they are a major reservoir for RSV. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 540 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Hospital staff may become infected after exposure in the community <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 541 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or in the hospital, and in turn, infect patients, other health-care workers, or hospital visitors. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 516,542 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Control Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Various combinations of control measures ranging from the simple to the complex have been effective, to some degree or other, in preventing and controlling nosocomial RSV infection. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 215,542&hyph;549 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Successful programs have had two elements in common: implementation of contact-isolation precautions, and compliance with these precautions by healthcare personnel. In theory, strict handwashing should prevent most nosocomial RSV infections. However, health-care workers' handwashing practices have always been poor, even in institutions with good educational programs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 210,211 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Thus, other preventive measures are usually relied upon to prevent RSV infection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The basic precautions that have been associated with decreased incidence of nosocomial RSV infections are gloving and gowning. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 215 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Gloving has helped decrease transmission probably because gloves remind patient-care personnel to comply with handwashing and other precautions, and deter persons from touching their eyes or noses. The benefits from gloving, however, are offset if gloves are not changed between patients or after contact with contaminated fomites, and if hands are not adequately washed after glove removal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 218 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Gowning, in combination with gloving, during contact with RSV-infected infants or their immediate environment has been used successfully to prevent infection. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 215 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition, the use of eye-nose goggles rather than masks has protected healthcare workers from infection; however, eye-nose goggles are not widely available and are inconvenient to wear. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 546,550 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional measures may be indicated to control ongoing nosocomial transmission of RSV or to prevent transmission to patients at high risk for serious complications of infections, such as those with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems. The following additional control measures have been used in various combinations: (1) Use of private rooms for infected patients OR cohorting of infected patients, with or without pre-admission screening by rapid laboratory diagnostic tests, (2) cohorting of personnel, (3) exclusion of healthcare workers who have symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection from the care of uninfected patients at high risk of severe or fatal RSV infection, e.g., infants, (4) limiting visitors, and (5) postponing admission of patients at high risk of complications from RSV infection. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 213,543,545,547,549 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although the exact role of each of these measures has not been fully elucidated, their use for control of outbreaks seems prudent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> INFLUENZA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Epidemiology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pneumonia in patients with influenza may be due to the influenza virus itself, secondary bacterial infection, or a combination of both. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 551&hyph;553 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Influenza-associated pneumonia can occur in any person, but is more common in the very young or old and in persons in any age group with immunosuppression or certain chronic medical conditions such as severe underlying heart or lung disease. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 531,554&hyph;556 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Influenza typically occurs annually in the winter between December and April; peak activity in a community usually lasts from 6 to 8 weeks during this period. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 557,558 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  During influenza epidemics in the community, nosocomial outbreaks may occur and are characterized by abrupt onset and rapid transmission. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 559&hyph;561 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Most reported institutional outbreaks of influenza have occurred in nursing homes; however, hospital outbreaks have been reported on pediatric and chronic-care wards, as well as on medical and neonatal intensive care units. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 506,562&hyph;565 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Influenza is believed to be spread from person to person by direct deposition of virus-laden large droplets onto the mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract of an individual during close contact with an infected person, as well as by droplet nuclei or small-particle aerosols. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 566&hyph;569 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The extent to which transmission may occur by virus-contaminated hands or fomites is unknown; however, it is not the primary mode of spread. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 570 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The most important reservoirs of influenza virus are infected persons, and the period of greatest communicability is during the first 3 days of illness; however, the virus can be shed before onset of symptoms, and up to 7 or more days after illness onset. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 506,557,571 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Diagnosis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Influenza is clinically indistinguishable from other febrile respiratory illnesses, but during outbreaks with laboratory-confirmed cases, a presumptive diagnosis of the infection can be made in cases with similar manifestations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 572 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the past, diagnosis of influenza was made by virus isolation from nasopharyngeal secretions or by serologic conversion, but recently developed rapid diagnostic tests that are similar to culture in sensitivity and specificity allow early diagnosis and treatment of cases and provide a basis for prompt initiation of antiviral prophylaxis as part of outbreak control. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 573&hyph;578 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

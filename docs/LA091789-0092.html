			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> PROP. 73 LOSES COURT RULING  </P> <P> In a blow to Proposition 73, a federal judge in Sacramento has ruled that  candidates for elective office can spend money they raised before Jan. 1, 1989,  despite the prohibitions of the campaign finance initiative. U.S. District  Judge Lawrence K. Karlton, issued a permanent injunction overturning a  provision of the law that had prohibited candidates from spending money in  their campaigns if it was raised before the law took effect. In a suit brought  by Democrats, Karlton ruled that such a prohibition violated the First  Amendment right to free speech. As a result of his decision, Democratic  candidates will be able to spend more than $12 million on future campaigns that  they had banked before the first of the year.  </P></p>

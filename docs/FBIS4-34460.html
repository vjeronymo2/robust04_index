			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 19 Jun (EFE) -- Jose Horta, director of  the Havana Film Festival, informed EFE today of his decision not  to return to Cuba after being mistreated by the police of his  country. Horta, who is also international relations director of  the Cuban Institute of Arts and Motion Picture Industry (ICAIC),  told EFE that the police arrested him on 18 June as he was  leaving the Havana airport on his way to Mexico. He said he was  taken off the plane twice while the police thoroughly searched  his luggage. He said the Cuban authorities later refused to  return his passport.    The reason for his trip to Mexico was to promote the New  Latin American Film Festival, which is held in Havana every  December. "This situation has been humiliating. I never  thought I would ever abandon Cuba, but this abuse is  intolerable. I do not know if this is part of the prevailing  wave of repression in the country, but I will not tolerate it  any longer," he said.    Horta, who has been director of the film festival for four  years and has participated in its organization for the past 16  years, said he has not yet decided whether he will request  political asylum in Mexico or if he will travel to the United  States.    Roberto Casin, former PRENSA LATINA director in Mexico,  defected in May 1991 while in Mexico and later traveled to  Miami, the United States.</p>

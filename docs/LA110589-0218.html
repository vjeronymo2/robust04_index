			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THATCHER, LOOKING WEST, IS LOSING FACE AT HOME;  </P> <P> BRITAIN: TWO TOP ADVISERS WALK OUT ON THE PRIME MINISTER. HER SUSPICIONS OF  EUROPEANS AS WOOLY, DEVIOUS -- OR BOTH -- IS NOT THE PREVAILING ENGLISH VIEW.  </P> <P> Like political reporters everywhere, those who live in the press gallery of  Britain's House of Commons are a cynical lot -- and cynical, above all, about  the Commons itself. It may proudly call itself the mother of parliaments, but  usually the place is as ill-informed and predictable as you would expect when  650 politicians are gathered together. Only occasionally does the House live up  to its billing -- and it did so the afternoon of Halloween.  </P> <P> At 5:26, Nigel Lawson who, until five days before, had been Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher's chancellor of the Exchequer (or chief finance minister),  rose to tell his colleagues why he had resigned. Lawson is a proud, some would  say, arrogant man -- and not usually a good orator. But his 10-minute speech  (heard, unusually for the Commons, in total silence) was delivered with none of  the pompous attitudes he often adopts, and it was electrifying. For he did  nothing less than explain why Thatcher's government may be falling apart at the  seams.  </P> <P> Lawson had been chancellor since Thatcher's second election victory in 1983 but  he was much more than that. Almost alone among the entourage, he had the  ability to make the intellectual case for Thatcherism with a politician's  instinct for what would play in the British equivalent of Peoria. He had cut  taxes, privatized industries and deregulated the economy. From 1986 to 1988,  when Britain grew faster than any other Western economy, he presided over the  closest thing to a boom the country had seen for 30 years. If anyone deserved  Thatcher's unstinting support, he did. But he did not get it. To understand  why, you have to understand both Margaret Thatcher and Britain's current  economic difficulties.  </P> <P> Ten years of power have not diminished one of Thatcher's central traits. She  thinks of herself as an outsider, enjoying the advice and company of other  outsiders. In large measure, her perception of her own position is cracked. No  woman before Thatcher had quite managed to snake her way into the charmed world  of Britain's Conservative Party; and on her way to the top, she was patronized  and dismissed by many of the smooth men who run it -- and who run Britain's  Civil Service. She is not smooth. She is a provincial, suspicious of  metropolitan charms. Her whole political life has been dedicated to bucking the  conventional wisdom, and she revels in it. She is one of those infuriating  people who, when they find themselves in a minority of one, are convinced they  are right.  </P> <P> Most of the British economic Establishment -- and Nigel Lawson -- think  exchange-rate stability is a desirable goal in itself, and an invaluable weapon  in the battle against inflation. They believe, moreover, that the best way for  Britain to secure such stability would be for the pound to become a member of  the European exchange-rate mechanism (or ERM) which, within narrow limits, sets  rates for the currencies of members within the European community.  </P> <P> Since most Establishment economists think the ERM is beneficial, it is not  surprising that Thatcher does not -- even though she is nationally committed to  joining it "when the time is right." She has long believed that attempts to  manage the currency markets are futile; yet that was Lawson's policy. When  currency dealers were selling the pound (which makes Britain's imports more  expensive, and hence raises domestic inflation) he would raise interest rates  to maintain the value of the currency. British rates are now at 15%. This, be  it noted, is in a country where almost all home loans are floating rate, which  means that interest-rate hikes hurt -- and since most home owners vote  Conservative, it is Thatcher's people who feel the pinch.  </P> <P> Hence the prime minister had some political grounds for feeling annoyed with  Lawson, and she was much supported by the views of one of her unsmooth,  provincial chums -- Sir Alan Walters, a British economist who has long spent  most of his time in America (at the World Bank or Johns Hopkins University).  Walters has offered Thatcher economic advice for most of the 1980s, and this  year was scheduled to spend half his time in her employ. His views on  exchange-rate management are robust; he thinks it stinks. The ERM, he said in  an article published only last week, is "half-baked." In Lawson's view, "No  case can be made for seeming confusion or vacillation between the two  positions"; Walters' article was "the tip of a singularly ill-concealed  iceberg, with all the destructive potential that icebergs possess." When it  became clear to Lawson that the prime minister would not settle the confusion  by sacking Walters, he resigned. Walters himself followed suit.  </P> <P> In one interpretation, Lawson's going does no more than confirm that Thatcher  is autocratic, intensely loyal to supporters and incapable of admitting that  she is wrong -- characteristics we have all recognized for years. But there is  far more to it than that.  </P> <P> Though she is still only 64, Thatcher is the last of her generation of British  politicians. Her political outlook was shaped by World War II and its  aftermath. She came of age at a time when the countries of Western Europe were  either in ruins or the enemies of Britain, but when American troops were its  savior. She grew up, not so incidentally, in the part of Britain where most  Americans were stationed; I like to think that as an impressionable  Lincolnshire school girl, she bicycled down the lanes with some firm-jawed GI  from Iowa.  </P> <P> For Margaret Thatcher, commitment to the Atlantic Alliance is a deeply  emotional thing, one that long predates her relationship with Ronald Reagan.  America is steadfast, or at least, it always has been for her. Europeans, she  thinks, are not to be trusted; they are devious when not woolly, but usually  both.  </P> <P> No other prominent British politician thinks like this any more. They are fond  of America, or most of them are, but they regard themselves as Europeans.  Thatcher's ministers find that more and more of their business -- whether  fighting terrorism, stopping drugs, cleaning up the environment or managing the  economy -- is easier done if done with their colleagues in European  governments.  </P> <P> Nigel Lawson was, and is, firmly of this view. He is not a romantic dreaming  about the United States of Europe, but he believes that Britain's destiny lies  in a "Europe of nation states." If it did not join the ERM, he said, Britain  would find its influence in Europe sorely diminished.  </P> <P> Here lies the true significance of Lawson's departure. Even those calling  themselves Thatcherites no longer follow her line on Europe. One young minister  to whom she is quite close told me this week, "There simply are no votes to be  won in being anti-European now." Yet given the chance to set her face against  Europe -- and ERM is the most potent symbol of European cooperation -- she took  it.  </P> <P> If Thatcher took it in the knowledge that Britain had somewhere to go other  than Europe, her action would at least have been understandable. But that is  not the case. For all of this year, the State Department has been signaling  that the Reagan years are over, that relations with West Germany are more  important for America than relations with Britain and that Britain must start  playing an ungrudging part in the building of a stronger, more integrated  European Community. Like Adm. Nelson, the British hero who clapped a telescope  to his blind eye when he saw the flags ordering retreat, the prime minister has  ignored everything that has come out of Washington. Sometimes -- more often  than her enemies admit -- her gut instincts have been those of most of the  British people. But on Europe, she has lost touch with those who -- like Nigel  Lawson -- have supported her for so long, and as they withdraw their support,  so the final departure of this remarkable 20th-Century leader slides quietly  into view.  </P></p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Sport: Seles tightens grip on women's ranks - Tennis THE 22-year-old American, Jim Courier, narrowly, and the remarkable 18-year-old Monica Seles outstandingly, were the best players of 1992. They head my annual rankings which have been unusually difficult to compile, particularly for the men. A year ago Stefan Edberg was the best male performer and his tussle with Courier for the No. 1 ranking on the ATP tour computer has been one of the features of the year. The computer, though, does not tell the whole story. Only a player's best 14 results are taken into account. Furthermore, there is too small a differential between the four Grand Slam Championships and the other events. Nor does it include the Olympic Games - a serious omission. Judgement must be brought to bear on the worth of each particular performance, depending on the stature of the tournament and strength of the field. Courier's two Grand Slam successes in Australia and France were not matched by anyone else, and his dominance during the early part of the year - when he won three other titles - kept him ahead of Edberg. But the Swede had a fine year. He retained his US Open crown with an amazing performance of physical and mental resilience, was a finalist at the Australian Open and won two other titles. Andre Agassi's dramatic victory at Wimbledon, his first Grand Slam success, was the season's outstanding performance. Taken with his wins in Atlanta and Toronto, plus his contribution to the winning Davis Cup effort by the US, put him in third place. It was difficult to separate Goran Ivanisevic, a left-handed Croatian who served 1,066 aces during the year, and the powerful American Pete Sampras, another 20-year old. Ivanisevic was a finalist at Wimbledon, Sampras at the US Open - both reached the semi-finals at the two season-ending extravaganzas, the ATP Tour Championships and the Compaq Grand Slam Cup. Sampras reached the last four at Wimbledon but Ivanisevic did the same at the Olympics where Sampras only reached the third round. Boris Becker won five tournaments and although he failed at the Olympic Games, his late-season charge at the ATP Tour Championship in Frankfurt was of such quality that I place the 25-year-old German ahead of the Olympic champion Marc Rosset. He crushed Ferreira; he annihilated Courier, supposedly the world's best clay court player, he beat Emilio Sanchez in his home town before ending the brave run of an exhausted Ivanisevic. In the final Rosset fought back to beat the local hero Jordi Arrese in five sets. Michael Chang won three early tournaments and, after failing to impress in three Grand Slams and the Olympics, produced some remarkable tennis to surge to the semi-finals of the US Open. There he pushed Edberg to the limits in one of the year's best matches. In the women's game it was Monica Seles first, the rest nowhere. She won 10 tournaments and in the year's great events was defeated only at Wimbledon. There it was as much the grunting issue as Steffi Graf's superb play that led to her defeat. It is hard to believe that this remarkably mature double-hander is still 18. Graf, also the finalist in Paris, was a clear second. Her defeat in the Olympic final at the hands of Jennifer Capriati was a terrible blow to her confidence and may have contributed to a dismal end to the year. She fell to Sanchez-Vicario in the quarters at the US Open and to Lori McNeil in the first round of the Virginia Slims. Sanchez was a worthy third by virtue of her insatiable appetite for work (she played a record 167 matches in 1992) and her consistency. Arantxa won two tournaments and was the finalist at the US Open. She reached the last four at the Australian and French Opens. She beat Graf at the US Open. Her victory over Seles was at the minor Canadian Open. The Olympic win by Jennifer Capriati over Graf, plus her defeat of Seles in the quarter-finals of the Lipton in March, lifted the 16-year-old to fourth. It was the manner of those wins that was so impressive - a fearless search for the lines with raking drives, plus the odd excursion to the net behind some intelligent serving. Gabriela Sabatini had a disappointing year with three semi- finals the sum of her Grand Prix efforts. The prospect of her building on her 1990 US Open win seems more and more unlikely as the pack of younger players closes in.

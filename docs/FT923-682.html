			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / International Company News: Telekom hopes for DM20bn from partial flotation DEUTSCHE Bundespost Telekom, Germany's state-owned telecommunications utility, hopes to raise DM20bn (Dollars 13.4bn) from a privatisation sale on international markets, Mr Helmut Ricke, chief executive, said yesterday. However, the flotation would not be possible before 1996 at the earliest and less than 50 per cent of the company would be sold. Unveiling a plunge into a DM124m loss for last year compared with a net profit of DM1.25bn in 1991, Mr Ricke gave the first tentative details of a privatisation plan which has been hanging fire for several years. However, leaders of the opposition Social Democrat party have recently abandoned their objections to the sale of state assets, and fallen broadly into line with government plans for a wide-ranging privatisation programme. This is also expected to include the state's majority holding in the Lufthansa airline. The results released yesterday were distorted by the inclusion in the accounts for the first time of operations in eastern Germany and a tax charge of DM317m, compared with DM70m last time, and increased transfers to the federal reserves and 'equalisation' payments to cover losses in the state postal and banking authorities. While sales rose to DM47.2bn from DM40.6bn, operating profits edged down to DM7.13bn from DM7.31bn. Mr Ricke said the burden of investment in the east had brought Telekom to the limits of its capacity. Last year it installed 550,000 new connections in the former East Germany and invested DM5.5bn. Total investment in the current year, when sales are expected to top DM50bn, is expected to reach DM30bn, with around DM11bn being spent in the east. Longer term, Telekom is aiming for sales of DM80bn in 2000 and a reduced workforce which will help it achieve international productivity standards. German carmakers expect production to decline in 1993 and export markets to shrink, according to the German Automobile Association (VDA), Reuter reports. However, the VDA said the industry's performance this year could match or slightly exceed last year's record output.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING HAS INVIGORATING REWARDS FOR ELDERLY  </P> <P> Just because you are no longer in your salad days is no reason to give up  gardening.  </P> <P> In fact, insists 65-year-old Florence Everts, a Washington landscape designer  who has designed gardens around the world, gardening is "probably the most  therapeutic, rejuvenating and invigorating" activity senior citizens can engage  in.  </P> <P> Everts, a transplanted Australian and the wife of a retired U.S. foreign  service officer, has designed gardens at American embassies in Pakistan and  China. She now landscapes in Washington, where she is a partner in the firm  Donnelly, Everts &amp; Associates.  </P> <P> She is quick to offer gardening tips, especially for seniors. For example, she  notes that although bending over can be good exercise, some senior backs  stiffen quite quickly. One suggestion: Use raised flower beds. You won't have  to bend over quite so far.  </P> <P> And there is no rule in gardening that prevents you from bringing along a stool  to sit on.  </P> <P> In fact, Smith &amp; Hawken, a Mill Valley company, offers a variety of tools  for seniors. They include two-foot-long forks or trowels, which weigh only a  pound each and cost $12.50 apiece, or a $39 gardening stool to either sit or  kneel on. (A canvas cover is an extra $14. For a catalogue, write: 25 Corte  Madera Ave., Mill Valley, Calif. 94941.)  </P> <P> Although gardening is a solitary endeavor, it's a great way to meet people and  close the generation gap, Everts contends.  </P> <P> She recommends that avid gardeners consider joining plant societies. Almost  every large city has clubs devoted especially to one type of flower, such as  the camellia, for example.  </P> <P> "You can meet experts, but it is also an opportunity to meet others," Everts  says. "There is a great mix of generations. You get horticulture students and  people who are just interested in gardens."  </P> <P> Everts says that the societies and garden clubs often run tours to private or  public gardens; that is not only a good way to socialize, but it's also  "healthy because there is a lot of walking."  </P> <P> Another endeavor for the senior gardener is volunteer service for cities that  need assistance in keeping their parks in good condition. Everts suggested  contacting local officials to find out how you can help.  </P> <P> One of Everts' own "local" tasks was to design the gardens of the ambassador's  residence in Islamabad, Pakistan. She directed a crowd of gardeners, laborers  and children in hauling in 80,000 cubic feet of soil. Her army of helpers  planted 1,000 flowering shrubs, 150 shade trees and 70 flowering trees.  </P> <P> So, if you are complaining about planting a pear tree, think of Everts and dig  in.  </P> <P> Horticultural experts offer these tips for older gardeners:  </P> <P> Plant perennial flowers. Since they come up annually, you cut down on the need  to dig and plant each year.  </P> <P> Vegetables aren't so easy because there aren't that many perennials. Asparagus  is one of the few. Putting in vegetable plants, rather than sowing seed and  having to thin out the tiny shoots, can save some bending. A number of  vegetables can be purchased as plants, including lettuce, tomatoes, cabbage and  peppers.  </P> <P> Use a thick mulch to keep the weeds down and the moisture in. This means less  weeding.  </P> <P> For expansive lawns, use ground cover such as ivy, which takes much less  maintenance than grass. Before you rip up your lawn, you should ask an expert  just what kind of ground cover will grow well at your place, given the amount  of moisture and sunlight your lawn gets.  </P> <P> Joe Volz writes for Maturity News Service.  </P> <P> </P></p>

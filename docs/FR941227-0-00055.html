In determining whether an item would have been properly allowed as a deduction against gross income by an accrual method taxpayer for purposes of this paragraph, section 461(h)(2)(C) and &sect;1.461&hyph;4(g) (relating to liabilities for tort, worker's compensation, breach of contract, violation of law, rebates, refunds, awards, prizes, jackpots, insurance contracts, warranty contracts, service contracts, taxes, and other liabilities) do not apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. Accounts receivable.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> X is a C corporation using the cash method that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On January 1, 1996, X has $50,000 of accounts receivable for services rendered before that date. On that date, the accounts receivable have a fair market value of $40,000 and an adjusted basis of $0. In 1996, X collects $50,000 on the accounts receivable and includes that amount in gross income. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $50,000 included in gross income in 1996 is recognized built-in gain because it would have been included in gross income before the beginning of the recognition period if X had been an accrual method taxpayer. However, if X instead disposes of the accounts receivable for $45,000 on July 1, 1996, in a transaction treated as a sale or exchange for federal income tax purposes, X would have recognized built-in gain of $40,000 on the disposition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. Contingent liability.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Y is a C corporation using the cash method that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. In 1995, a lawsuit was filed against Y claiming $1,000,000 in damages. In 1996, Y loses the lawsuit, pays a $500,000 judgment, and properly claims a deduction for that amount. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $500,000 deduction allowed in 1996 is not recognized built-in loss because it would not have been allowed as a deduction against gross income before the beginning of the recognition period if Y had been an accrual method taxpayer (even disregarding section 461(h)(2)(C) and &sect;1.461&hyph;4(g)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3. Deferred payment liabilities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> X is a C corporation using the cash method that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. In 1995, X lost a lawsuit and became obligated to pay $150,000 in damages. Under section 461(h)(2)(C), this amount is not allowed as a deduction until X makes payment. In 1996, X makes payment and properly claims a deduction for the amount of the payment. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $150,000 deduction allowed in 1996 is recognized built-in loss because it would have been allowed as a deduction against gross income before the beginning of the recognition period if X had been an accrual method taxpayer (disregarding section 461(h)(2)(C) and &sect;1.461&hyph;4(g)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4. Deferred prepayment income.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Y is a C corporation using an accrual method that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. In 1995, Y received $2,500 for services to be rendered in 1996, and properly elected to include the $2,500 in gross income in 1996 under Rev. Proc. 71&hyph;21, 1971&hyph;2 C.B. 549 (see &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) of this chapter). Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $2,500 included in gross income in 1996 is not recognized built-in gain because it would not have been included in gross income before the beginning of the recognition period by an accrual method taxpayer using the method that Y actually used before the beginning of the recognition period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 5. Change in method.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> X is a C corporation using an accrual method that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. In 1995, X received $5,000 for services to be rendered in 1996, and properly included the $5,000 in gross income. In 1996, X properly elects to include the $5,000 in gross income in 1996 under Rev. Proc. 71&hyph;21, 1971&hyph;2 C.B. 549 (see &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) of this chapter). As a result of the change in method of accounting, X has a $5,000 negative section 481(a) adjustment. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $5,000 included in gross income in 1996 is recognized built-in gain because it would have been included in gross income before the beginning of the recognition period by an accrual method taxpayer using the method that X actually used before the beginning of the recognition period. In addition, the $5,000 negative section 481(a) adjustment is recognized built-in loss because it relates to an item (the $5,000 X received for services in 1995) attributable to periods before the beginning of the recognition period under the principles for determining recognized built-in gain or loss in this section. See paragraph (d) of this section for rules regarding section 481(a) adjustments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 267(a)(2) and 404(a)(5) deductions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 267(a)(2).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any amount properly deducted in the recognition period under section 267(a)(2), relating to payments to related parties, is recognized built-in loss to the extent_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

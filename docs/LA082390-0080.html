			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE: CHOOSE COOKING FRUITS CAREFULLY  </P> <P> With the exception of berries, summer and fall fruits microwave superbly. Most  brim with just-picked flavor and look garden-fresh: bright and plump with rich  fruity bouquet. Still, you must time and tend fruits carefully in the microwave  oven if you're to be successful.  </P> <P> You must also choose varieties that are "naturals" -- apricots, peaches, pears,  plums or other firm fruits that can withstand several minutes' worth of  microwave bombardment without collapsing.  </P> <P> The problem with berries, cherries and other soft-pulp fruits is that they're  so fragile and full of juice they're reduced to mush in seconds. (But this does  make them dandy candidates for dessert sauces.)  </P> <P> The best pears to poach are Bartlett, Bosc, Anjou or Seckel. Leftover poaching  syrup can be used to macerate any fresh fruits.  </P> <P> POACHED PEARS CARDINAL  </P> <P> 4 large firm-ripe pears (about 1 3/4 pounds)  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons lemon juice  </P> <P> 1 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 cup dry white or red wine  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> Cardinal Sauce  </P> <P> Carefully core pears from bottom, leaving stems intact. Peel and roll in 2  tablespoons lemon juice to prevent darkening.  </P> <P> Combine remaining tablespoon lemon juice, sugar, wine and vanilla in  microwave-safe, lidded (8 or 9-inch round, 2-inch deep) casserole. Cover with  wax paper and microwave on HIGH 2 to 3 minutes, until mixture boils and sugar  dissolves, stirring at half time.  </P> <P> Stir again and arrange pears on their sides in casserole, spoke-fashion and not  touching, with stems toward center. Cover with casserole lid and microwave on  HIGH 6 to 8 minutes until tender-crisp. At half time, turn pears over and  rotate casserole 180 degrees. Don't overcook as pears will continue cooking as  they cool.  </P> <P> Cool pears to room temperature in poaching syrup in covered casserole, turning  occasionally. Chill well. To serve, stand pears in individual goblets. Drizzle  each with small amount Cardinal Sauce. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Cardinal Sauce  </P> <P> 2 cups sieved, pureed fresh raspberries  </P> <P> 1/3 cup sugar, about  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon cornstarch blended with 2 tablespoons cold water  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon lemon juice  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons kirsch  </P> <P> Mix raspberry puree and sugar in microwave-safe 6-cup measure. Cover with wax  paper and microwave on HIGH 3 minutes. Whisk in cornstarch mixture and lemon  juice. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until  sauce boils and thickens slightly. Stir in kirsch. Cool to room temperature.  Add more sugar if needed or thin if too thick with little water. Makes 2 cups.  </P> <P> STEWED APRICOTS OR PLUMS  </P> <P> 1 1/2 pounds firm-ripe apricots or plums (do not peel or pit)  </P> <P> 2/3 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1 cup hot water  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon finely grated orange or lemon zest  </P> <P> Pierce each apricot or plum in 2 to 3 places and arrange in microwave-safe, 1  1/2-quart (9-inch round) lidded casserole. Mix in sugar and hot water. Cover  and microwave on HIGH 4 to 5 minutes, rearranging fruit and turning over at  half time.  </P> <P> When fruits are barely tender, let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Remove from  microwave. Stir in orange zest and cool fruit completely in syrup. Makes 4  servings.  </P> <P> POACHED PEACHES  </P> <P> 4 firm-ripe peaches  </P> <P> Lemon juice  </P> <P> 1/2 cup sugar  </P> <P> 3/4 cup hot water  </P> <P> 1/4 cup fruit liqueur, brandy, rum, Port or Madeira  </P> <P> Peel, pit and halve peaches. Dip in lemon juice and arrange in single layer in  microwave-safe, lidded, 2-quart casserole. Mix in sugar, hot water and fruit  liqueur. Cover and microwave on HIGH 3 to 3 1/2 minutes, rearranging fruit and  turning over after 2 minutes.  </P> <P> When peaches are barely tender, let stand, covered, 1 minute. Remove from  microwave and cool peaches completely in syrup. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Note: In ovens of less than 600 Watts, increase cooking times about 15%.  </P></p>

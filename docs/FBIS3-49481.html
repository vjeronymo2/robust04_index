			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 8 -- The political committee of the  Christian National Union (ZChN) criticised the governments  budget proposals and called for the intensification of moves  towards the integration of Polands right wing political  groupings, in a statement released after its meeting in Warsaw  on Saturday.    The ZChN leaders think that the right wing unity is  necessary  because of an offensive from the left aiming at "far reaching  political and ideological transformations" in Poland and because  the local government elections are due soon.    ZChN President Wieslaw Chrzanowski said at the press  conference following the meeting that the Movement for the  Republic of Poland (RDR) would decide next Saturday whether to  join the "triple agreement" of right wing parties made up of the  ZChN, the Centre Alliance (PC) and the Polish Peasant  Party-Peasant Agreement (PSL-PL).    Chrzanowski said that RDR leader Romuald Szeremietiew was  already participating in the three parties meetings as an  "associated person".    Ryszard Czarnecki said that the government coalitions budget  proposals ignored the wishes of the electorate. The coalition  was not honouring its electoral promises, he maintained.  Czarnecki added that the failure to increase spending on the  nations defence was cause for concern given the uncertain  situation in the East.</p>

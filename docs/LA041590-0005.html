			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STORYTELLERS: NEW IN MAY  </P> <P> I don't mean to harp.  </P> <P> That's not true. I do mean to, at least a little bit. Doesn't the elite  triple-play author -- the one whose advance, print run and paperback sale are  all in the six-or-more figures -- have a social responsibility? Isn't there a  literary equivalent of noblesse oblige?  </P> <P> Surely I jest; Coca-Cola and Hershey's Kisses aren't nutritious, just wildly  popular. Stories of love gone awry can't be expected to devote a single  psychospiritual calorie to the health and welfare of the collective soul.  They're just fun to nibble at.  </P> <P> Sometimes, though, I can't help but wish for a big, popular book that tastes  good and is good for me, too.  </P> <P> Rona Jaffe's An American Love Story (Delacorte Press: $19.95; 432 pp.)  certainly has the pizazz. Four women are in love with the same callow fellow,  television producer (ne talent agent) Clay Bowen. There's his wife Laura, a  ballerina of the Gelsey Kirkland pharmaceutical school; his daughter Nina, who  does everything she can to gain Dad's attention; Bambi, the ambitious agent,  and Susan, the writer whose career gets launched when she befriends a Lenny  Bruce sound-alike and gets an exclusive interview.  </P> <P> The comic asks Susan, "Do you take notes, or what?" and her response is, "I  used to, but it made people nervous. . . . Now I just remember, I have a very  good memory." That noise you hear is all the libel lawyers who read this  column, laughing their heads off -- and Susan is supposed to be the smartest of  the quartet.  </P> <P> Which is the point: How many different ways can you doll up the leftovers? What  Jaffe's dishing up is the same old story about good women gone wrong, or at  least temporarily daft. It's the literary equivalent of comfort food. Jaffe's a  seasoned cook, so this is very classy macaroni and cheese, but hey -- let's see  somebody write a story about four guys who are mad as hatters over an elusive  dame.  </P> <P> At least Julia Fenton believes in equality of the sexes -- in Black Tie Only  (Contemporary Books: $19.95; 447 pp.), both villainy and charm ooze their way  across gender lines. Fenton is one of those name-brand authors, the ones who  believe that proper nouns will ground an otherwise featherweight tale. She also  seems to have a database of every best-seller story line ever spun: Fenton's  tale of the beauteous Alexandra, a Chicago socialite, is really several stories  at once. There's the deep, dark secret, involving a drug-hazed accidental  death, that threatens to rear its ugly head just as Alexandra puts the  finishing touches on a gala for Princess Di, who happens to be an old  private-school pal from the era when the deep, dark secret occurred; there's  Alexandra's strained marriage, where, for the sake of titillation, the sex is  still great; and, last but bloodily not least, there's the hotel/union/Mafia  problems that threaten Alexandra's husband's empire, as well as his wife and  kids.  </P> <P> It's familiar stuff. But whatever energy the author conserved in imagination  she spends on the execution. Fenton won't settle for the standard  snatch-and-grab of a kid from his school-yard playground; Alexandra is probably  the first heroine to be confronted in an elevator by a union wacko disguised as  a delivery man, who pops a videotape into a VCR and shows her a computerized  simulation of the planned kidnaping of her eldest child (I've spent too much  time wondering where he plugged the VCR in, in a moving elevator, but I've  always had trouble with the willing suspension of disbelief). And our heroine  doesn't stand by, quaking, while some tough guy saves the day. She's right in  there dodging bullets.  </P> <P> Ladies have less of a role in Sidney Zion's Markers (Donald I. Fine: $19.95;  426 pp.) but maybe that's because Zion writes about power, and women still  don't have enough of it. This is, essentially, a buddy book: Mike O'Rourke is  the hard-working journalist and Jesse Frank is his childhood pal, a criminal  attorney who has made the collecting of favors -- markers -- into a lucrative  art form. Jesse calls Mike Scoop; Mike dreams of winning the Pulitzer some day  and, you guessed it, before too long, they're on a collision course. Zion, a  lawyer and journalist himself (is this the world's first split-personality  novel?), serves up an insider's look at courtroom and press room shenanigans --  and if his women tend to do things such as cook breakfast and marvel adoringly  over a man's sexual prowess, maybe they do more interesting stuff offstage that  we never read about.  </P> <P> Andrew Greeley has written another kind of buddy novel in The Cardinal Virtues  (Warner Books: $19.95; 464 pp.). The buddies here are old Father Lar and  younger Father Jamie, together facing a corrupt church hierarchy that tries to  intrude on Father Lar's management of his rather lively flock. Greeley has  wandered down this lucrative path before with the best-selling "The Cardinal  Sins," and with more than 12 million copies of 10 novels in print, he's proven  that we're as willing to read about PG-rated philosophical indiscretions as we  are the seamier -- and/or steamier -- sort.  </P></p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Missing Exxon man may be dead FEARS are growing among US police and FBI agents that Mr Sidney Reso, the senior Exxon executive who went missing on April 29, may be dead. Law enforcement officials have said that Mr and Mrs Arthur Seale, the former Exxon security guard and his wife who were arrested last week and charged with kidnapping Mr Reso, have been questioned by police but are refusing to co-operate. The FBI, while seeking other suspects, is less and less certain whether the Seales - who are alleged to have demanded Dollars 18.5m in ransom before they were captured last week - had an accomplice. 'If Mr and Mrs Seale are the only parties involved, we would not be optimistic about Mr Reso still being alive,' one law enforcement official said. 'We continue to hope there are additional co-conspirators still holding Mr Reso,' the FBI said yesterday. 'We continue to work on the premise that he is still alive, absent information to the contrary. But, as time goes on, one becomes less optimistic.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After consideration, these suggestions have not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted. Instead, the proposed regulations require an activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is engaged in for both lobbying and non-lobbying purposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be treated as engaged in partially for a lobbying purpose and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partially for a non-lobbying purpose. This division of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity must result in a reasonable allocation of costs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influencing legislation under &sect;1.162&hyph;28. This allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach was adopted rather than a principal or primary purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test because a principal/primary purpose test does not avoid the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessity of determining the various purposes for engaging in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity and weighing the relative importance of those purposes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and because it has a substantial ``cliff'' effect that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation approach does not. In those situations where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer has substantial lobbying and non-lobbying purposes, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results under a principal/primary purpose test would differ  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dramatically depending on one's views as to which of the purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is dominant. As a result, Treasury and the IRS have serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns whether that test could be administered responsibly and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fairly. Finally, nothing in section 162(e) or its legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> history indicates that Congress intended to treat activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engaged in for a substantial lobbying purpose as outside the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scope of 162(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consideration was also given to treating an activity as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influencing legislation if any substantial purpose for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity is lobbying. Treasury and the IRS believe it generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be easier to establish a substantial purpose for engaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in an activity, rather than examining all of the purposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish a principal/primary purpose. As a result, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach would be easier to administer than a principal/primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose test. Moreover, a substantial purpose test would appear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be more consistent with Congressional intent to treat as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influencing legislation those activities that in fact support a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lobbying communication than would a principal/primary purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test. However, Treasury and the IRS are concerned that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach could be considerably over-inclusive, in that some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities engaged in predominantly for non-lobbying purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be treated entirely as non-deductible lobbying activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IRS invites comments, however, whether this approach would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more appropriate than the rule in the proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, to provide taxpayers greater certainty and relief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from burdensome recordkeeping regarding certain relatively minor,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recurring activities, the proposed regulations treat certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities as engaged in solely for non-lobbying purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Explanation of Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposed regulations, as under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 162(e)(4)(A), ``influencing legislation'' means any attempt to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influence any legislation through a lobbying communication with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any member or employee of a legislative body or any government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> official or employee (other than a member or employee of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislative body) who may participate in the formulation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation that the taxpayer desires to influence. A lobbying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communication is a communication that either (i) refers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific legislation and reflects a view on that legislation, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) clarifies, amplifies, modifies, or provides support for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> views reflected in a prior lobbying communication. Specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation includes both legislation that has already been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduced in a legislative body and a specific legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal that the taxpayer either supports or opposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An attempt to ``influence legislation'' means the lobbying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communication and all activities, such as research, preparation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other background activities, engaged in for a purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making or supporting the lobbying communication. Whether an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity is engaged in for this purpose is determined based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all the facts and circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a taxpayer engages in an activity both for a lobbying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose and for some non-lobbying purpose, the taxpayer must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treat the activity as engaged in partially for a lobbying purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and partially for a non-lobbying purpose. This division of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity must result in a reasonable allocation of costs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influencing legislation under &sect;1.162&hyph;28. A taxpayer's allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to influencing legislation of only the incremental amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs that would not have been incurred but for the lobbying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose generally is not reasonable. Similarly, an allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the number of purposes for engaging in an activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without regard to their relative importance also generally is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

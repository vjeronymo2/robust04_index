			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / TUC sets up new governing structure The biggest internal shake-up of the Trades Union Congress for 73 years was agreed yesterday by senior union leaders in spite of reservations about the speed of the proposed changes from the TGWU general union. The reforms, being carried through by Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, involve making the organisation more of a campaigning body. All of its 17 committees are to be abolished and replaced by a governing executive board. A new department is to be established for campaign and lobbying activities. The general council is to meet about five times a year instead of monthly. The TUC is planning the 'relaunch' for March 1. A number of events and conferences are to be held in the next few months on issues such as unemployment and inner-city deprivation.</p>

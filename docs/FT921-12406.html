			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Cresson, Mitterrand see poll ratings rise THE STEADY fall in popularity of France's President Francois Mitterrand has apparently halted as both he and Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister, experienced a rise in their opinion poll ratings. The latest Ifop poll, published in yesterday's Journal du Dimanche, shows that 26 per cent of voters are satisfied with Mr Mitterrand's performance, compared with just 22 per cent in December, when he registered the lowest rating of any president in the history of the Fifth Republic. This increase is the first rise in his ratings after nine successive months of decline. Mrs Cresson, a controversial figure since she became prime minister last spring, has also benefited from a slight improvement in popularity. The proportion of voters who said they were satisfied with her rose to 23 per cent from 20 per cent a month ago. Both Mr Mitterrand and Mrs Cresson seem to have arrested their sliding popularity by winning the approval of previously ambivalent voters, rather than by converting their critics. Most voters still claim to be dissatisfied with them. The president's dissatisfaction rating has fallen by just two points to 63 per cent over the past month and that of the prime minister by one point to 56 per cent. This swing in the opinion polls is not strong enough to affect the political prospects of France's Socialist party as it prepares to fight the regional elections this year and next year's national elections. However, it does reflect the lowering of the political temperature in France, where the Socialists have tried to highlight wider issues such as immigration. On Saturday some senior government figures - including former prime ministers Mr Michel Rocard and Mr Laurent Fabius, recently appointed head of the Socialist party - joined more than 50,000 demonstrators in an anti-racist march through Paris.</p>

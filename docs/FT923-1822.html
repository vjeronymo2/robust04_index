			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / International Company News: DAF confirms it is in talks with Japanese truck maker DAF, the loss-making Dutch commercial vehicle maker which is already holding negotiations on a strategic alliance with Mercedes-Benz of Germany, said last night it was also holding co-operation talks with a Japanese truck producer. It is believed to be discussing collaboration, most probably for the development and supply of components, with Hino Motors, one of the leading Japanese heavy truck makers and part of the Toyota group of companies. DAF confirmed last night that Mr Cor Baan, chairman of the DAF management board, had held talks recently in Tokyo with a Japanese truck producer, but it refused to disclose the identity of its partner in the talks. Toyota, the biggest Japanese car maker, holds a direct stake of 11 per cent in Hino with which it has been linked since 1966. DAF, in which British Aerospace holds a 16 per cent stake, said that it had decided 'not to reveal how substantive these talks are' with the Japanese producer. Confirmation of the discussions in Japan follows the disclosure last month that DAF had begun talks on forming a 'strategic alliance' with Mercedes-Benz, the world's leading truck maker. It is understood that the collaboration discussions now under way with Hino are not as far-reaching in scope as the negotiations with Mercedes-Benz. While DAF refused publicly to name Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial corporation, as its potential partner, Dutch trade union officials confirmed the talks between the two companies. DAF, which is suffering its third year of heavy losses, said last month that discussions were 'taking place on a strategic alliance', which could lead to a 'structural strengthening' of the group. An equity stake was under consideration and the negotiations included talks on exchanging products, co-operation in product development and sharing of production. Mercedes-Benz admitted that discussions were under way, but it insisted that the talks only concerned the creation of a 'customer/supplier relationship' between the two. Hino's presence in Europe has been limited to small-volume assembly of its trucks in Ireland.</p>

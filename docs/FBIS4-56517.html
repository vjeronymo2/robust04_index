			<p>BFN     [Text] After returning from the United States, Finance  Minister Eduardo Aninat said today that Chile hopes to sign a  free trade agreement with the United States by March 1995.    This comment was made by Aninat after meeting with President  Eduardo Frei at La Moneda at noon today. Aninat, who arrived  back in Chile early this morning, met with President Frei to  brief him on the results of his trip. In Washington Aninat met  with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor, and the two  agreed to start preliminary negotiations on 25 May, prior to  beginning formal negotiations on a free trade agreement.    [Begin Aninat recording] We will not sign just any pact. We  will sign a pact that is very rational, very coherent, in line  with our economic policy, and suitable for Chile. In addition,  before signing a pact we would discuss it with the political  parties and, of course, with Congress. [end recording]    Aninat said that Chile has not yet decided whether to  negotiate a bilateral agreement with the United States or to  join NAFTA, which is also made up of Mexico and Canada. The  importance of a free trade agreement with the United States lies  in the fact that one-third of Chile's international trade is  currently with the United States.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (3): Legal framework vital to progress - Prospects for capital markets Vietnam's urgent need for funds to rebuild the economy - combined with a widespread lack of faith in domestic banks that has kept savings rates low by east Asian standards - has convinced the government it needs to establish local capital markets fast. Whether it will be able to do so as planned during the coming year remains an open question. The first step is expected to be the formation of a National Securities Commission, but the finance ministry and the central bank have been arguing over which of them should be in control. The new body would then set up a secondary market for the handful of bonds issued by the government and state enterprises, followed by a stock exchange for the shares of joint stock companies such as banks and partially privatised state companies. 'We anticipate a small-scale bourse being established some time in 1995,' said Nick Freeman, Vietnam analyst for Baring Securities. 'The arguments for a stock market are widely accepted. It's now a case of putting together the legislative framework to make this a possibility.' But sceptics believe that the shortcomings of the legal system and other problems will delay the establishment of a market beyond the end of 1995. The underdeveloped banking system, for example, may make capital markets seem attractive by comparison as a way of mobilising savings, but it also hinders the operation of such markets. Among recent improvements to the banking sector, the authorities permitted the use of personal cheques for the first time since 1975, but bankers say most cheques have to be individually certified by the issuing bank, making the transaction very cumbersome. Another problem is the shortage of companies that could be listed on the future stock exchange. Large, domestic private companies are few in number and privatisation of state firms has stalled. Of more than 6,000 state-owned enterprises that survive in Vietnam, only three (a transport company, a shoe factory and a refrigeration firm) have so far been successfully prepared for privatisation. The government is reluctant to privatise prime companies such as Vietnam Airlines. 'It's still very difficult,' said Do Duc Dinh, a government economist. 'The accounting system is still not good and we can't calculate the value of an enterprise and divide it into shares.' It will also take time to overcome basic legal obstacles, let alone formulate complex regulations for capital markets. Vietnamese bankruptcy rules and a commercial code have yet to be finalised. Lastly, some Vietnamese worry that a hurriedly established stock market in Ho Chi Minh City would be so speculative and poorly regulated that it would quickly discredit itself without doing much for business in Vietnam. 'We need a legal framework first and the government must educate people on the functions of such a market,' says Huynh Buu Son of the Saigon Bank for Industry and Trade, a bank owned by a mix of private and public shareholders that would probably be among the first companies to be listed. 'We must be sure before we start.'</p>

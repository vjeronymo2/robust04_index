			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. CONCERNS GROWING THAT A UNITED GERMANY MAY BOLT FROM NATO;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: WASHINGTON COURTS AN EAST GERMAN POLITICIAN. HE FAVORS A NEW  SECURITY SYSTEM.  </P> <P> A little more than four months ago, the Rev. Markus Meckel was summoning  dissidents to meetings in dank church basements in East Germany, planning  nonviolent marches in hope of spurring his country's Communist regime toward  reform.  </P> <P> This week, the soft-spoken Lutheran minister got Washington's version of the  red carpet treatment as he was bustled from plush offices at the State  Department to elegant reception rooms in the Capitol to tell an attentive Bush  Administration and Congress what he plans for his country now.  </P> <P> "We are not used to this kind of thing," mused the bearded Meckel, now vice  chairman of East Germany's fledgling Social Democratic Party, as he blinked  into the lights of a television camera crew.  </P> <P> Meckel's sudden prestige in Washington stems only partly from the fact that he  may turn out to be East Germany's new foreign minister if his party comes out  on top, as forecast, in the country's first free elections March 18.  </P> <P> More important, it reflects a new surge in concern among U.S. officials over  whether a reunified Germany will want to remain a member of the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization, the military alliance that has been the cornerstone of  U.S. strategy in Europe for 40 years.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration and the West German government of Chancellor Helmut  Kohl have publicly agreed that the new Germany will stay solidly in NATO --  even though some Soviet troops may still be stationed on East German soil.  </P> <P> But not all Germans agree. Last week, Oskar Lafontaine, the probable candidate  of the West German Social Democrats to run against Kohl in elections scheduled  for December, said that the idea of a united Germany in NATO is "a mistake."  </P> <P> And Meckel, the East German Social Democrat, told U.S. officials this week that  his party wants to see "a new kind of European security system."  </P> <P> "The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) cannot be a part of NATO the way  NATO is today," he said.  </P> <P> "We come from the peace movement," he added, in a message that did not bring  much reassurance to the Administration.  </P> <P> Both West German and East German leaders have assured U.S. officials that they  will not push for an immediate withdrawal from NATO as reunification nears.  </P> <P> "We do not want to leave NATO, nor do we propose its dissolution," said Horst  Ehmke, a West German Social Democrat who also came to Washington this week to  reassure the Administration.  </P> <P> But at the same time, he warned, the German public's support for NATO  membership -- and for the presence of U.S. troops in Germany -- is bound to  shrink as the Soviet threat to Western security appears ever smaller.  </P> <P> "NATO is the structure we have," a senior State Department official said. "We  think it's the best guarantee of continued stability in Europe."  </P> <P> NATO's military strategy has long rested on large deployments of U.S. and other  allied forces in West Germany, the pact's front line with the countries that  used to be called the Soviet Bloc.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, U.S. military planners, recognizing the political realities, are  quietly drawing up plans to defend the alliance with much smaller numbers of  U.S. troops -- and even with a Germany outside of NATO, a senior military  official said this week.  </P> <P> The United States now has nearly 275,000 troops in West Germany. Last month,  President Bush agreed to reduce that number to no more than 195,000 if the  Soviet Union does the same on its side.  </P> <P> But senior U.S. officials acknowledged that if Soviet troop strength in Central  Europe drops much below 195,000, the United States will be forced to follow.  </P> <P> Army Gen. John Galvin, NATO's military commander, told a Senate committee this  week that the proposed level of 195,000 U.S. troops is an absolute minimum if  the alliance is to continue using its present strategy.  </P> <P> Some members of Congress have questioned whether Bush and Secretary of State  James A. Baker III made a bad deal with the Soviet Union last month when they  agreed to the 195,000 level, plus another 30,000 U.S. troops in other European  countries such as Britain and Italy.  </P> <P> "What would happen if the price of (German) reunification demanded by the  Soviets was the removal of all foreign forces, American and Soviet?" Sen. Wyche  Fowler Jr. (D-Ga.) asked Baker in a Senate hearing. "Where would our troops  go?"  </P> <P> Baker conceded that, under the U.S.-Soviet deal, all American troops in Germany  would probably have to come home if a new German state asked them to leave. But  Baker and other Administration officials dismissed that as unlikely.  </P> <P> "Our worry, frankly, is not that the Germans are going to ask us to leave, but  that some folks up here (in Congress) are going to ask us to leave," Baker  said.  </P> <P> Former Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger disagreed.  </P> <P> "The invitation extended by West Germany to U.S. forces is going to be reviewed  by the German government and the opposition," he said. "Sixty percent of the  (German) public believes that neutrality is desirable. A majority believes all  foreign forces should leave Germany."  </P> <P> He said many Europeans quietly want American troops to stay in Europe to "watch  the Germans. . . But what incentive is there for the Germans to provide us the  real estate with which to watch them?"  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Requirements for Class I work involving less than 25 linear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or 10 square feet of TSI or surfacing and PACM, and for Class II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Class III asbestos work operations where exposures exceed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PEL or where there is no negative exposure assessment produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The employer shall establish an equipment room or area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is adjacent to the regulated area for the decontamination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees and their equipment which is contaminated with asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which shall consist of an area covered by a impermeable drop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cloth on the floor/deck or horizontal working surface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The area must be of sufficient size as to accommodate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning of equipment and removing personal protective equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without spreading contamination beyond the area (as determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visible accumulations).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Workclothing must be cleaned with a HEPA vacuum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before it is removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) All equipment and surfaces of containers filled with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ACM must be cleaned prior to removing them from the equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> room or area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The employer shall ensure that employees enter and exit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulated area through the equipment room or area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Requirements for Class IV work. Employers shall ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that employees performing Class IV work within a regulated area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with the hygiene practice required of employees performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work which has a higher classification within that regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area. Otherwise employers of employees cleaning up debris and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material which is TSI or surfacing ACM or identified as PACM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall provide decontamination facilities for such employees which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are required by paragraph (j)(2) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Smoking in work areas. The employer shall ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees do not smoke in work areas where they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupationally exposed to asbestos because of activities in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Communication of hazards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This section applies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the communication of information concerning asbestos hazards in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipyard employment activities to facilitate compliance with this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard. Most asbestos-related shipyard activities involve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously installed building materials. Building/vessel owners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> often are the only and/or best sources of information concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them. Therefore, they, along with employers of potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposed employees, are assigned specific information conveying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and retention duties under this section. Installed Asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Containing Building/Vessel Material: Employers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building/vessel owners are required to treat TSI and sprayed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> troweled on surfacing materials as asbestos-containing unless the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer, by complying with paragraph (k)(4) of this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that the material is not asbestos-containing. Asphalt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or vinyl flooring/decking material installed in buildings or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels no later than 1980 must also be considered as asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing unless the employer/owner, pursuant to paragraph (g),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section determines it is not asbestos containing. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer or building/vessel owner has actual knowledge or should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have known, through the exercise of due diligence, that materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than TSI and sprayed-on or troweled-on surfacing materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are asbestos-containing, they must be treated as such. When  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communicating information to employees pursuant to this standard,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owners and employers shall identify ``PACM'' as ACM. Additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements relating to communication of asbestos work on multi-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer worksites are set out in paragraph (d) of this standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Duties of building/vessel and facility owners. (i) Before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work subject to this standard is begun, building/vessel and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility owners shall identify the presence, location and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity of ACM, and/or PACM at the work site. All thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system insulation and sprayed on or troweled on surfacing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials in buildings/vessels or substrates constructed no later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 1980 shall be identified as PACM. In addition, resilient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flooring/decking material installed no later than 1980 shall also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be identified as asbestos-containing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Building/vessel and/or facility owners shall notify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following persons of the presence, location and quantity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ACM or PACM, at work sites in their buildings/facilities/vessels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notification either shall be in writing or shall consist of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personal communication between the owner and the person to whom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification must be given or their authorized representatives:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Prospective employers applying or bidding for work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose employees reasonably can be expected to work in or adjacent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to areas containing such material;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

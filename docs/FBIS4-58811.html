			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Itamar Rabinovich, </F> Israel's ambassador to the United States and the head of the  delegation to the negotiations with Syria, by Mikha Friedman and  Ya'el Dan, on 8 May; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Friedman] Earlier this morning we spoke with  Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the United  States and the head of the Israeli delegation to the bilateral  talks with Syria. Our first question was whether Rabinovich  shared the assessment of American officials that some dramatic  or rapid progress had been made in the Syrian-Israeli dialogue?    [Rabinovich] No, I do not think that we should create an  impression of dramatic progress. I think that several important  things happened during the secretary of state's last visit.  There were also some slight disappointments. A window of  opportunity has been opened -- the secretary of state is  arriving in Europe in the middle of the month and he can easily  fly to the Middle East. Since some degree of progress was  nevertheless made in the last round of shuttle trips between  Damascus and Jerusalem, I think that everyone -- the Syrians,  Israelis, and also the Americans -- thought that this window of  opportunity should be taken advantage of. However, this does  not necessarily indicate any dramatic progress in the  negotiations.    [Friedman] The term window of opportunity sounds like a very  diplomatic expression to us. What is the size of this window  and what opportunities can be seen through it?    [Rabinovich] This window has a time frame of several days  and the opportunity lies in the very fact of the secretary's  arrival. When Secretary of State Christopher was here last time,  he knew he would be returning to Europe in the middle of May to  discuss issues related to Bosnia. Therefore, a proposal to hold  the next round of negotiations in the region in mid-May was  already raised then. This indeed is happening.    [Friedman] You earlier spoke of the encouraging signs that  the secretary of state discerned during his stay in Damascus.  Perhaps you could tell us what those signs were?    [Rabinovich] The positive side of what took place during the  secretary's last visit was that the Syrians for the first time  came out with a comprehensive, detailed, and substantial  reaction to all the components of our package. A reaction which  was quite novel in some aspects. This is the positive side of  things. The other two less positive facets are first and  foremost the fact that the Syrians started off by adopting a  tough negotiating position. There is a significant gap between  the package we presented and the Syrian reaction. Second, the  Syrians still refuse to relate to our proposals as a package.  They still believe they can take the package's six components,  extract those specific elements that are of interest to them --  such as the issue of withdrawal -- and focus exclusively on  them. Our position was and remains that we are discussing a  comprehensive package that must be treated as a whole.    [Friedman] Professor Rabinovich, you are still officially  the head of the Syrian-Israeli bilateral committee which has not  convened for a long time. Are we fated to be in a situation  where any progress in the Syrian-Israeli track, in the event  that such progress indeed takes place, can only be made when  Secretary of State Christopher finds some free time on his  agenda?    [Rabinovich] If one looks at the last nine months, the talks  had a certain rhythm where momentum was created by the secretary  of state's visits to the region or by the summit meeting between  Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. This momentum could then be  translated into limited progress at the Washington talks;  progress which could then be exploited in turn during the next  visit. This was the talks' rhythm. Since not enough momentum  has accrued to justify another round of negotiations in  Washington, the talks have not been convened. We all hope that  the upcoming visit will effect sufficient progress to justify  holding another round of talks in Washington which will prove  fruitful and constructive. We do not want to hold an empty  round of talks.    [Dan] Prof. Rabinovich, a headline on the front page of  HA'ARETZ reports that Israel has asked for $5 billion from the  United States as financial compensation for returning the Golan  Heights. Can you confirm this report?    [Rabinovich] No, I do not think that we want to get into any  details. Speculation is rampant; however, the discussion was  held in a very limited forum and I think that it is both  preferable and possible that work on such a hypothetical aid  package be conducted quietly. One must remember that this whole  matter is conditional on both parties actually reaching an  agreement and beginning to implement its arrangements.  Everything is hypothetical and it is too early to start  discussing details. Even if the details appearing in various  articles are not accurate, I would prefer not to comment on them.    [Friedman] We are left with a lot of speculation and very  little information. Thank you, Professor Rabinovich.</p>

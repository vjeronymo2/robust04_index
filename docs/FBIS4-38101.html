			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Hoseyn Shari'atmadari: "A Word With the </F> Orator"]    [Text] In this commentary we do not want to discuss the  unjustified imports of American goods into Islamic Iran or  whether they should or should not be imported, because we  discussed this issue following Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri's  remarks on 28 May, and stated that our firm belief is that  allowing the importation of American goods is, first, an insult  to the noble and Muslim Iranian nation and to all those who gave  their lives to free our homeland from American domination.    Second, it turns us into a toy in the hands of American  plundering murderers who, because of the fact that Islam rules  in Iran--and only because of this--are, in addition to their  numerous hostilities, overtly preventing the export of advanced  technology to this Islamic country and are also threatening and  intimidating the other industrial countries to prevent them from  doing so. But at the same time they are trying--very  magnanimously!--to find a way into our unfortunately weak  markets by exporting various brands of American cigarettes, soft  drinks, candy, chewing gum, chips, lollipops, and other  unnecessary items.    Third, the sacred system of the Islamic Republic is  considered to be the standard-bearer in the fight against the  world hegemonists. And in the full-fledged campaign that has  recently been carried out in various parts of the world of Islam  against the aggressors headed by America, the deprived and  oppressed nations follow the pattern of victorious resistance by  the Islamic Iranian nation in their sacred jihad. Thus, the  importation of American products only helps to mar this sacred  pattern.    We believe that, for America, this part of the charade which  it has started is more important than the other parts, in the  sense that on the one hand it prevents the exporting of advanced  technology from the industrial world to Iran, thus slowing down  the progress of this Islamic country and, on the other, by  exporting chewing gum, cigarettes, candy, lollipops, chips, and  other such items, it puts up the false "representational sign"  in our Islamic country. But even though this "sign" is false,  other nations who have turned their eyes to Islamic Iran in  their anti-American struggles are starting to doubt whether they  should "tread" the same path that our Muslim people have taken.  We believe that the boycotting of American products by the late  imam, may his soul be sanctified, was meant, first and foremost,  to maintain the dividing line that separates us from America and  to state to the world of Islam that the enmity that the great  satan has toward Islam, the Muslims, and the deprived people  will never be forgotten in history.    We can go on and on in discussing this topic. But in this  commentary we want to discuss another issue. And that is that  in his news conference with domestic and foreign  correspondents--the text of which was carried by the Vision of  the Islamic Republic of Iran--esteemed President Hojjat ol-Eslam  val Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani stated in answer to a question  put to him by a KEYHAN-E HAVA'I correspondent on why some of the  esteemed officials of the system are not very keen on being  interviewed by domestic correspondents: "This should not be so.  All the ministers are ready to give the necessary explanations,  each in his own sector." This is very encouraging and will help  to clarify the ambiguities spread by our enemies about the  policies of the sacred system of the Islamic Republic and of its  caring officials in the same way that the esteemed president's  news conference played an outstanding and effective role to this  effect.    But in another part of his news conference, Hojjat ol-Eslam  val Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani stated in answer to a KEYHAN  correspondent that some American goods should be imported for  some of the country's industrial needs, such as spare parts for  factories and aircraft which have been mostly manufactured in  the United States; and then he asked the KEYHAN correspondent:  "Are you suggesting that we should stop all this?" And when  the KEYHAN correspondent explained that he was speaking  metaphorically and referring to products such as Coca Cola,  which is a good example of an unnecessary commodity--as a symbol  of foreign presence--the esteemed president stated: "In my  opinion, that symbolism is somewhat common."    In view of the outstanding Islamic and revolutionary  personality of the esteemed president, who was one of the  backbones of the revolution and one of the closest and most  devoted and committed companions of his eminence the imam, may  his soul be sanctified, and of the leader of the revolution, we  consider it our duty to refer to the question by the KEYHAN  correspondent, whose remarks were left incomplete in the recent  news conference, and to point out that the reason why Coca Cola  was cited as an example of an unnecessary item is that  unfortunately without any justification, an extensive  advertising campaign is continuing in our markets with posters  on city walls for unnecessary items such as American cigarettes  and so on. And while we do not believe that looking at American  products from this angle is a "common" issue, we firmly believe  that had the esteemed president paid closer attention to what  our correspondent meant with his question, he would have agreed  with our point of view, since in his news conference the topic  of vigilance and alertness toward American ploys were clearly  visible.    Another point is that in view of Hojjat ol-Eslam val  Moslemin  Hashemi-Rafsanjani's remarks in answer to the question put to  him by the KEYHAN-E HAVA'I correspondent on the need for the  esteemed ministers and officials of the Islamic system to speak  with the press in order to clarify ambiguities, it is feared  that in justifying their lack of attention to some questions by  the correspondents, the esteemed officials will avoid answering  by alleging that these questions are "common!"</p>

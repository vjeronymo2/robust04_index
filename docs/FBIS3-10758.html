			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] On 9 March, Dr. Augusto Ramirez Ocampo,  chief of Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador], voiced his  concerns over anomalies in the electoral process related to the  transfer of ballot boxes and the issuing of voter identity  cards. Regarding these problems, Ramirez pointed out that the  Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] decided to transfer polling  stations from four Chalatenango Department municipalities to the  departmental capital. He noted that this violates the Electoral  Code. Mario Jovel filed this report:    [Jovel] Dr. Ramirez was displeased with the TSE plan to  transfer polling stations from several Chalatenango  municipalities to the departmental capital. The Onusal chief  said that transfer is unjustified and violates the Electoral  Code.    [Begin Ramirez recording] It is indispensable that we  consult  with the municipal electoral boards and the supervision  [vigilancia] board. The latter, in an announcement on 8 March  -- according to information available to me -- did not recommend  this transfer. [end recording]    [Jovel] Ramirez added that despite efforts by the TSE,  Onusal, and political parties to overcome problems with requests  to enter names on the voter rolls without the prior submission  of identity documents, there are still 75,000 people unable to  obtain their cards. The diplomat said that 45 [word indistinct]  points were established where requests may be rejected. Most of  these, he added, are located in former conflict zones. But this  is not enough to claim that there is any sort of fraud:    [Begin Ramirez recording] The 75,000 [word indistinct] not  supported by identity documents are distributed proportionally  throughout the country. They are distributed on the basis of  electoral volume [volumenes electorales]. In other words, it is  difficult to determine just who is affected by this situation.  [end recording]    [Jovel] The Onusal chief noted that not all the news is bad.  For example, the 2.3 million citizens supplied with voter  identity cards -- a figure predicted by his organization -- was  increased by 100,000. Ramirez added that this represents 90  percent of the potential vote, the highest ever for the country  in its electoral history.    [Announcer] In this regard, Dr. Jaime Romero Ventura, TSE  magistrate for Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance], said  that Article 117 of the Electoral Code has definitely not been  violated, because the decision to transfer ballot boxes to  Chalatenango was made in consultation with the departmental  boards. Erwin Gongora filed this report.    [Gongora] Dr. Romero stated emphatically that the decision  to  transfer ballot boxes from certain Chalatenango Department  municipalities for the elections arose from an agreement with  the departmental boards and was not an arbitrary decision. This  change in polling stations, the Arena magistrate added, is being  made for specific reasons.    [Begin Romero recording] First, 90 percent of the residents  of those four municipalities live in the departmental capital.  Second, two of these municipalities don't have electricity or  telephone service. This would hinder the forwarding of results.  [end recording]    [Gongora] Romero pointed out this is not an isolated case,  as  similar instances have been reported, including those in Colon  in La Libertad and San Francisco Menendez in Ahuachapan, where  the same request was made for similar reasons. He also  explained why approximately 79,000 people will not be able to  obtain their voter identity cards in time to vote on 20 March.    [Begin Romero recording] Specifically, the 79,000 people  were  not validated because their birth certificates are not  registered in the corresponding municipalities. Thus, we do not  have those files. I want you to know that these 79,000 citizens  who unfortunately will be unable to vote are dispersed  throughout the country. Actually they live in municipalities  destroyed by the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front] during the war. [end recording]    [Gongora] Romero also announced that the TSE has redoubled  security upon the discovery by state intelligence organs of a  plot by unidentified people to seize the TSE computer center.  He added that the goal of this action is the destabilization of  the electoral process.</p>

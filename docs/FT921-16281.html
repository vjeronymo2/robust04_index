			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Arts: Victoriana in the harem - A look at an unfamiliar period of Iranian art THE TEHRAN version of high Victoriana is not guaranteed to appeal to purists who associate Persian art with exquisite good taste. Iran in the 19th Century, at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford (until 26 January but closed on Mondays; 0865-278000), may well be the first exhibition ever mounted on this subject in Britain. It is a modest show, with no catalogue and not much in the way of text, but it is interesting because Qajar period art is so unfamiliar. The focus is on secular and not religious objects, and the exhibits are the kind of decorative pieces that well-to-do merchants of the Qajar period would have had in their homes; mirror-cases, books, a perfectly splendid cat made from steel, daggers and enamelled tableware. Qajar connoisseurs (a rare breed) will find pieces never before loaned out of private collections, and others which are usually buried in museums' lumber-rooms. A small group of 19th-century photographs sketches in some sort of background. The Qajars were the dynasty which ruled Iran from the 1790s and through the last century. We see pictures of two great Qajar rulers, Fath Ali Shah and Nasr al-Din Shah, and pictures of eunuchs and the women of the anderun, which was the Iranian equivalent of the harem. Fath Ali Shah, you may recall, was the sexually hyperactive monarch notorious for having left some 5,000 legitimate heirs. His successor but one, Nasr al-Din Shah, was more moderate, with a mere 60 or so concubines in his anderun. An album of portrait-photographs of these ladies implies they were dreadfully plain, perhaps because eyebrows that met above the nose were considered beautiful; if nature did not oblige, the gap was briged with a tattoo. Photographs of drawingrooms of the period give a strangely 'Victorian' impression, with a mass of bric-a-brac, standard lamps and upholstered furniture with long fringes. A tidal wave of European influence was flooding through the Middle East in the 19th century, and fashionable society in Iran was thirsty for images of the Western way of life. Traditional miniature painters responded by lifting images from Western prints and photographs. They borrowed landscapes, they borrowed Holy Families. Most of all, however, they imported images of European women. Lacquer pencases and bookcovers feature prominently in the exhibition because they were favourite places for paintings of this sort. Persian lacquerware was unusual in being made out of papier-mache, and I do not much care for its toffee colour. Even so, there is so much charm to the way Persian artists represented European society. The traditional Iranian heroes and heroines were not entirely abandoned, nor bird-and-flower designs. But the fashionable subjects were taken, very selectively, from western sources. Ingres-type women with fans lean against mantlepieces and Gainsborough-type ladies wear wigs like piles of sausage rolls. Vaguely Elizabethan banqueting scenes allowed artists to show ladies in daring necklines committing the enormity of sitting down to eat with their menfolk. Men and women take the air in open carriages wedged tightly together. To the merchants of Tehran and Isfahan, images like these must have hinted at the charms of a Europe which was scandalously, yet deliciously, decadent.</p>

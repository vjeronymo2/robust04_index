			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> AFGHAN REBELS ATTACK CITY  </P> <P> Afghan guerrillas said they launched a major attack on the eastern city of  Jalalabad, but the Soviet-backed Kabul government said its forces retaliated  with artillery and air attacks, causing heavy casualties. The official Kabul  Radio, monitored in Pakistan, said government forces killed about 250  Western-backed guerrillas after they launched a three-sided attack. Rebel  spokesman said the attack was aimed at capturing the airport and three  government bases. The rebel offensive, begun last month, has been bogged down  by heavy bombing by government planes and by mine fields. The guerrillas want  to establish Jalalabad as the capital of their government in exile.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOW, THE TOUGH TRANSITION;  </P> <P> CZECHOSLOVAKIA: THE SUPPRESSION OF NORMAL POLITICS FOR 40 YEARS MAKES IT  DIFFICULT TO RECONSTRUCT ALTERNATIVES OF CHOICE, LET ALONE A GOVERNING  COALITION.  </P> <P> With each turn, the wheel of revolutionary change in Eastern Europe seems to  revolve faster. In a fortnight, opposition groups in Prague have made gains --  the dethronement of the Communist Party from its constitutional leading role,  the concession of coalition government and free elections -- that their  counterparts in East Berlin have not yet fully secured and their colleagues in  Warsaw and Budapest took months to achieve.  </P> <P> Yet everywhere, making the transition to democracy will be more difficult than  breaking the Communist power monopoly. In Czechoslovakia, as elsewhere in  Eastern Europe, the systematic suppression of normal politics for more than 40  years makes it very difficult to reconstruct a choice of organized political  alternatives, let alone build a viable governing coalition.  </P> <P> The main coordinator of protest in Czechoslovakia, the Civic Forum, is an  umbrella network of disparate groups united in their opposition to the current  regime. Its spokesmen see themselves realistically as reluctant amateurs  pressed into political service by extraordinary circumstances. Some, like  playwright Vaclav Havel, may eventually accept symbolic high office; most will  go back to their literary, intellectual and college careers. The Forum itself  may give rise to a new democratic movement that will become part of a spectrum  of organizations including existing and reshaped parties.  </P> <P> The small non-Communist parties that have eked out an existence as cosmetic  partners in the Communist-led National Front may become serious alternatives.  The two Christian-oriented, rural-based parties have considerable potential for  growth, as they can draw upon an increasingly active Catholic population,  especially in Slovakia. The Czech Socialist Party possibly has a larger  political role to play. Its daily paper Svobodne Slovo (Free Word) has for some  time been quite outspoken, and some of the party's leaders have joined the  student and intellectual opposition in calling for mass Communist Party  resignations. The Socialist Party is likely to experience a rapid influx of  members, as occurred in 1968, though now as then it will face competition from  a revived Social Democratic movement. As in 1968, so now the Social Democrats  are likely also to present competition to reform communism.  </P> <P> Reform communism will form a key part of the new political spectrum. The  present Communist Party will probably split, producing a conservative faction  and a large reformist group based on the  </P> <P> "shadow party" -- the half-million members purged in the aftermath of 1968 and  now starting to re-enter Communist ranks. Some of its leaders, including Jiri  Hajek, formed the Renewal group earlier this year; others, like Zdenek Mlynar,  have returned from exile. Headed by Alexander Dubcek, they represent a group  with unquestioned political experience and some moral credibility yet by no  means a buoyant long-term future.  </P> <P> The reformist policies that Dubcek still cherishes, centered on socialism with  a human face led by a more "open" Communist Party, have surely been overtaken  by events. Few in Czechoslovakia today believe in an improved Communist  Party-led system; most want a democratic one offering free political choice.  The watchwords are freedom and democracy, harking back to traditions of the  First Republic, the only regime in Eastern Europe to sustain democracy through  the interwar period.  </P> <P> The coalition governments of the interwar and even the early postwar period,  when the Communists shared power, provide a more useful model for the future  then does 1968. A reformed Communist Party, with policies that go beyond 1968,  could at most provide a political bridge in the coalition that manages the  transition from the ruins of Communist dictatorship to the beginnings of  multiparty democracy.  </P> <P> Managing that transition will be far from easy. Recriminations over the past  will inevitably accompany the beginnings of democratization. What will be  needed is a government of national unity based on a balanced coalition  embracing Socialists and Christians as well as reform Communists, and Slovak  groups as well as Czech. Past antagonisms, the scarcity of experienced  politicians and the volatility that follows the overthrow of an established  dictatorship will mean that this process will take much effort and time.  </P> <P> But more political time and more stable conditions may be available in  Czechoslovakia than in Poland, Hungary or East Germany, since the economic  situation is less pressing and the population less polarized and impatient.  Relative economic prosperity and traditional political moderation, the very  factors that delayed the outburst of protest and made Czechoslovakia the last  key country in East-Central Europe to challenge its Communist rulers, may now  help it to complete the transition to democracy and a mixed economy more  rapidly and ultimately more successfully.  </P></p>

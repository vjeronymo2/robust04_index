			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Papua New Guinea wants 30% stake in Lihir gold project THE NEW government of Papua New Guinea has indicated it wants a 30 per cent shareholding in the Lihir Island gold project, which aims to develop one of the world's biggest and lowest-cost deposits of the precious metal. Until recently it was expected that the government would take a 20 per cent stake. RTZ Corporation of the UK owns 80 per cent and PNG-based Niugini Mining 20 per cent. Mr Geoff Loudon, chairman of Niugini, said the partners in the project would welcome government involvement at this level but he questioned PNG's ability to pay. Mr Loudon, talking to analysts in London yesterday, pointed out that the PNG government would have to provide 30 per cent of the costs incurred so far - totalling USDollars 125m - as well as its full share of development costs, estimated at Dollars 760m. He said the present disputes between the PNG government and the owners of the Porgera and Mt Kare gold mines - which have sent share prices of the mines' operating companies tumbling - obviously did not make it any easier to raise money. Mr Loudon suggested the PNG elections had delayed the start-up of Lihir until 1996 because it was unlikely the government would issue the necessary special mining lease until March or April next year. It would then take at least 27 months and up to 33 months for construction of the processing plant and underground mine. There are 42.2m troy ounces of gold in Lihir's proven and possible reserves. Production is scheduled to be an annual 620,000 ounces for the first few years, rising to 1.3m ounces. Lihir is expected to be one of the world's lowest-cost gold mines with total costs of Dollars 248.75 an ounce in the early years (including Dollars 163.20 cash operating costs) but it will take several years for the partners to cover their investment. Mr Loudon said this was acceptable for a project with a life of 30 years already established. He said negotiations for RTZ to sell some of its shareholding in Lihir were going smoothly and RTZ's eventual stake would depend on the PNG government's final decision about how much it wanted. Niugini had first right of refusal on the RTZ shares and previously Mr Loudon said his company would buy all that was available. Yesterday, however, he said that if RTZ decided to sell its total holding in Lihir, 'it would be unrealistic in present market conditions' for Niugini to buy all the available shares.</p>

Feelings ran high yesterday following a  Bophuthatswana cabinet decision not to participate in the April  election. The announcement came amid an already volatile  situation as civil servants demanding reincorporation into South  Africa continued their strike. At the Mmabatho Sun Hotel, which  was occupied by disgruntled workers yesterday, it was business  as usual, and by midnight last night all communication links had  been restored.</p>

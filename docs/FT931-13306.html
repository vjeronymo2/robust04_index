			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Glaxo's Zantac to go OTC in Japan GLAXO, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group, is planning to switch Zantac, its best-selling drug, from prescription to over-the-counter status in Japan, the world's second largest market after the US. Nippon Glaxo, of which Glaxo holds 50 per cent, the balance being privately held, has signed an agreement with Sankyo and Taisho Pharmaceuticals of Japan, to co-develop Zantac, the world's best-selling drug. It is expected to file an application for over-the-counter sales at the end of 1994, about the same time as its main competitors, Yamanouchi which markets Samotidine, and SmithKline Beecham which sells Tagamet. Zantac generated prescription sales of about Pounds 180m in Japan during the last financial year to June, according to analysts. The Japanese over-the-counter gastro-intestinal market is worth about Y57bn (Pounds 300m) a year. Taisho is the market leader with Sankyo third. The Japanese welfare ministry appears increasingly keen to move drugs from prescription to over-the-counter status, in an effort to keep down state drug expenditure. The move is part of Glaxo's general strategy of licensing out development and eventually marketing, according to Mr Nigel Barnes, pharmaceuticals analyst at Hoare Govett.</p>

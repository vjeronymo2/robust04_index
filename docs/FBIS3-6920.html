The warning by North Korea's ambassador to China, Chu  Chang-chun, is the latest threat in the stand off over North  Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program. Mr. Chu says the  deployment of American Patriot missiles in South Korea will only  accelerate the speed towards war on the Korean peninsula. The  ambassador also says if international sanctions are imposed on  North Korea, Pyongyang would, what he called, make the necessary  response. From Beijing Ali Moore reports.    [Moore] North Korea's ambassador Chu Chang-chun says America  should not forget the Korean war of the 1950's and should use  the experience as a lesson. As well, he accused the United  States of organizing international pressure against North Korea  and said all the moves will only accelerate the speed towards  war. If there is another war he said the United States and  South Korea will be fully responsible. North Korea has a large  diplomatic presence in China, its most important ally and  trading partner. Chinese leaders say they oppose using pressure  to resolve the nuclear dispute. Ali Moore, Beijing.</p>

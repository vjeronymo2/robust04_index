			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Jacques Vert gives warning of 'substantial' pre-tax loss THE CLOSURES of a factory and a warehouse and the abandonment of a leisurewear line has led Jacques Vert, the womenswear group, to warn of a substantial pre-tax loss for the year just ended. Yesterday's warning that there would be a substantial exceptional charge in the annual results follows a fundamental review of operations. Before exceptionals, the group had been expected to break even at best. The problems came to light in January when the group shocked the market with a Pounds 125,000 pre-tax loss for the six months to October 26. About Pounds 1m profit had been expected compared with the previous year's Pounds 1.23m. The factory to be closed is at Upton, Yorkshire, mainly used for making skirts. Mr Malcolm Heald, who has replaced Mr Sashi Mylvaganam as finance director, said it had been losing money for some time. One of the nails in its coffin was the prospect of having an open-cast coal mine next door to it. Production would mainly be replaced by outside sources. The group has been making nearly 60 per cent of its goods in-house. The discontinuance of the Alain Cannelle leisurewear label, which had quality problems, would also mean closing a warehouse in Harlow. In closing the two main sources of group losses, 174 jobs would be lost, leaving the total workforce at 750. Mr Heald said the Jacques Vert label and JV Plus had remained profitable. The write-offs would reduce shareholders' funds, which stood at Pounds 11.7m in April 1991. Net debt was about Pounds 6m at the interim stage and had not materially changed.</p>

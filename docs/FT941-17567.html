			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Paris to probe schools' safety The French government will shortly launch an inquiry into physical safety in the country's state schools, in an attempt to defuse allegations that it is favouring private over public education. The conservative government sparked a row with President Francois Mitterrand and other Socialist politicians when, in the pre-Christmas legislative rush, it scrapped an 1850 law which limited local authorities to funding only 10 per cent of the construction and repair of private schools, which in France are mainly Catholic. Some 70,000 people, many of them teachers, protested against the action on December 17, and a similar national protest is planned for January 16. Socialist deputies have asked the constitutional court to rule on the move, complaining that it will drain money from state education and favour religious over lay schools. By setting up an inquiry, which is expected to recommend that more money be spent on state schools' infrastructure, the government hoped to show 'it is not robbing the public sector for the benefit of private education', an official of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said yesterday. But a Socialist spokesman said there was ample evidence already on the state of safety in public schools, and any inquiry should be directed at how a government commission managed to conclude last month that half the country's private schools were physically dangerous.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / New orders continue rise NEW orders for durable goods rose for the fourth consecutive month in April, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, Michael Prowse writes from Washington. Orders increased 1.4 per cent last month - more than expected in financial markets - and by 4.6 per cent in the year to April. Gains were concentrated in the volatile transport sector, where orders rose 6.1 per cent between March and April. Excluding transport, orders fell 0.2 per cent. Orders for non-defence capital goods, excluding aircraft and parts, fell 2.6 per cent last month, suggesting that civilian investment spending is likely to remain sluggish in coming months. Reuter adds: A prominent US economic forecasting group said its latest national survey showed little likelihood of renewed recession, and saw stronger 1992 growth than forecast.</p>

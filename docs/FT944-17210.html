			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Party is warned of decline in numbers The Tory party faces the threat of a drastic decline in its grassroots membership unless it takes action now to attract new and younger members, says an independent study published today. Detailed research by three university lecturers has revealed that only 5 per cent of the party's estimated 750,000 members are below the age of 35. The average age of members is 62 and almost a half of the members are aged 66 or over. The study warns that without a shift in that balance the party could lose 40 per cent of its membership in the next decade. The authors, Mr Patrick Seyd from Sheffield University, Mr Paul Whiteley from William and Mary College in the US and Mr Jeremy Richardson from Warwick University, base their analysis on interviews with nearly 2,500 activists. The research shows that typical party members are retired, come from middle-class occupational backgrounds and are owner-occupiers. The membership is composed fairly equally of men and women. It confirms that big majorities of the party faithful favour hanging, encouragement for immigrants to return home and tougher laws to discourage divorce.

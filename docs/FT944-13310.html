			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / OECD ponders deal on top job Members of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development are considering a compromise in their long disagreement over a new secretary-general. Under the 'two-plus-five' deal, Mr Jean-Claude Paye of France who presently holds the post would be reinstated for another two years. He would then be succeeded by Canada's Mr Donald Johnston, a former cabinet minister, for a full five-year term. The Canadian foreign affairs department said yesterday that 'we don't have a consensus yet. No deal has been done.' The appointment requires consensus among all 25 members. While it is clear that Paris and Ottawa favour the deal, the US has indicated it is likely to oppose it. Washington is expected to hold firm to its contention that new blood is needed in the OECD and that jobs in the increasingly global trading system should no longer be based on regional origin. US officials believe the jobs call for 'higher profile people' who have easy access to leaders and ministers. The OECD job has become caught up in horse-trading over other top international posts, notably head of the new World Trade Organisation, successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . The three contenders for that post are South Korea's trade minister Mr Kim Chul-su, Italy's former trade minister Mr Renato Ruggiero and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. France and Canada have been discussing ways to break the deadlock over the OECD post since Mr Andre Ouellet, Canada's foreign minister, visited Paris earlier this month. Mr Johnston, who works for a Montreal law firm, has been strongly backed by the US and several other non-European members. They insist it is time for a non-European to fill the post. But France, supported by most European members, has until now refused to withdraw Mr Paye's candidacy for a third five-year term.</p>

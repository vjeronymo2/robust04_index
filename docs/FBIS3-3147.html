It was presided over by CPPCC National Committee Chairman Li  Ruihuan.    Members of the Standing Committee first examined and passed  the agenda and schedule of the current Standing Committee  meeting. According to the agenda, the meeting will examine and  approve the Standing Committee's work report and the person to  deliver the report at the Second Session of the Eighth National  CPPCC Committee; discuss the "Report on the Work of the  Government" (draft for soliciting opinions); examine and approve  the "CPPCC Constitution (Draft Revision)"; hear and discuss a  report by Comrade Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission, on the current situation of  the anticorruption struggle; and examine and approve the  namelists of the additional members to be elected to the Second  Session of the Eighth National CPPCC Committee and the members  to be elected to replace members of the Second Session.    At the meeting, Zhu Zuolin, deputy secretary general of the  National CPPCC Committee, made an explanation on the agenda  (draft) and schedule (draft) of the Second Session of the Eighth  National CPPCC Committee. Chen Jinyu, deputy secretary general  of the National CPPCC Committee, made an explanation on the  drafting of the work report (draft) of the Eighth National CPPCC  Committee Standing Committee. Lu Zhichao, deputy secretary  general of the National CPPCC Committee, made an explanation on  the "CPPCC Constitution (Draft Revision)." National CPPCC  Committee Vice Chairman Wang Zhaoguo made an explanation on the  namelists (draft) of the additional members to be elected to the  Second Session of the Eighth National CPPCC Committee and the  members to be elected to replace members of the Second Session.    In his speech, Li Ruihuan hoped that, during the session of  the current meeting, Standing Committee members will seriously  examine the aforementioned drafts, freely express their  opinions, and submit the drafts to the current Standing  Committee meeting or the Second Session of the Eighth National  CPPCC Committee for examination and approval.    In November 1993 National CPPCC Committee member Shi Jiuyong  was jointly elected a judge of the International Court for a  nine-year term by the UN General Assembly and the UN Security  Council. To abide by and to implement relevant stipulations of  the International Court's rules, he tenendered his resignation  as National CPPCC Committee member. National CPPCC Committee  member Qian Qing tendered his resignation as member of the  National CPPCC Committee's Foreign Affairs Committee for health  reasons. After examination, the 10th chairmanship meeting has  approved their requests to resign. The above was reported to the  Standing Committee for the record.    The meeting examined and approved a decision on approving  Comrade Song Demin's resignation as secretary general of the  National CPPCC Committee for health reasons.    Because Liu Hanzhen supported and took part in fraudulent  activities of "seeking treasures [zhao bao (2109 1405)" and  "presenting treasures [xian bao (3759 1405)," and because Ma  Liesun committed serious crimes, the meeting examined the cases  and approved a decision on annulling Liu Hanzhen's and Ma  Liesun's credentials as members of the Eighth National CPPCC  Committee and its Standing Committee.    Those attending today's meeting included National CPPCC  Committee Vice Chairmen Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, Yang Rudai,  Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Hong Xuezhi, Zhao Puchu, Qian Weichang, Hu  Sheng, Qian Zhengying, Su Buqing, Ding Guangxun, Dong Yinchu, Su  Fuling, and Ann Tse Kai.</p>

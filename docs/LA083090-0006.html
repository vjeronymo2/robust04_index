			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM  </P> <P> In your article "Community College System Is Failing" (Part A, Aug. 12), state  Community College Chancellor David Mertes complains he's unable to fill top  administrative positions in his office because he cannot offer salaries greater  than $100,000 per year (plus benefits, of course). Mertes makes $101,000 and  wants to pay his chief deputy $107,888.  </P> <P> The Department of Personnel Administration has approved "only" $86,533.  </P> <P> Locally, San Diego Community College Chancellor William Wenrich announced he  will cancel his $105,000 district contract after only two years because he  could not resist the $140,000 pay offered by the Dallas Community College  System. If we are paying administrators more than $100,000 and our college  system is still failing, will it improve if we give them another  $25,000-$50,000? Why are we paying administrators two, three and even four  times the amount we pay teachers who have the ultimate responsibility for  educating our citizens?  </P> <P> Schools must not allow themselves to be forced into bidding wars. We must seek  individuals who are eager to meet the challenge of turning around an  educational system in crisis, not those simply seeking high-salaried career  opportunities.  </P> <P> DENISE MORENO DUCHENY  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

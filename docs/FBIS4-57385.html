According to these analysts, who are conducting an  investigation in the region, Ramirez started to collect this  money--which accounts for one-third of the total flow moved  through the marketing of cocaine paste in the region under  Shining Path [SL] control; that is, $600 million--a few months  before the arrest of Abimael Guzman.    Ramirez managed to do this despite the fact that the SL has  lost control of major drug centers such as Crespo, Castillo,  Pueblo Nuevo, Pacayacu, Loro, and recently--as a result of  Operation "Aries"--Mohena, Moyuna, Venenillo, Mongon, and  Ancayacu, among others.    By contrast, cassava, rice, corn, and other legal crops have  yielded only $30 million.    Through disclosures made by repentant drug traffickers at  the  303d Battalion on the Huallaga Front, it has been learned that  "Feliciano," "El Manco," and other SL leaders who deal with the  drug traffickers have permanent ground-air contact through  powerful receivers, portable transmitters, and using coded  messages.    Huallaga Front strategists believe Operation "Aries"  prompted  the suspension of flights by Colombian planes in the Leoncio  Prado (Huanuco) and Padre Abad (Ucayali) areas.    Despite the information obtained by counterintelligence  agents from repented former SL leaders and peasants forced to  work for the SL for some time, there is no firm clue as to the  place where the fortune Ramirez amassed by exacting kickbacks  from drug traffickers is hidden.    There is evidence, however, that drug traffickers and SL  members circulate large amounts of dollars through local  branches of banks and financial companies. The fact is that not  all the proceeds from drug sales are "laundered" in Lima by  individual money exchangers or through investments in legally  constituted companies.    There are several financial companies competing for  narcodollars along the coca belt region. According to  intelligence sources, no one should be surprised if "Feliciano"  made large deposits through a front, if he is keeping a major  portion of the money, or he distributed it through his closest  aides and henchmen.    The truth is that the money is concentrated in few hands  because those terrorists who are clashing with security  forces--the ones called the "rank-and-file"--are poorly fed,  dressed in rags, and suffering from contagious diseases such as  scabies, tuberculosis, and cholera.    Some repented SL leaders who were recently captured admitted  that most of those now following "El Manco" have absolutely no  morale, that they are following him out of fear for their  families who have been kidnapped by the SL, which has threatened  to murder them.    It has been reported that drug shipments have been suspended  after the dismantling of the so-called "Red Sea" battalion and  as a result of the capture and/or surrender of many subversives  and the action of antisubversive forces at the Ucayali Navy base.    Based on information obtained in the region, it has been  ascertained that each shipment consisted of 300 or 500 kg of  basic cocaine paste, depending on whether the carrier was a  single-engine or twin-engine plane, respectively.    DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] agents said that basic  cocaine paste produced in the coca belt is transported to large  refinery laboratories located in the Amazon Trapeze jungle (an  area located between Brazil, Colombia, and Peru) where, after  being processed into cocaine hydrochloride, it is shipped to the  United States and Europe.</p>

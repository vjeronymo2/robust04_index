			<p>BFN     [Text] President Kravchuk has ruled that the Crimean  President's decrees "On the property of the Republic of Crimea"  and "On the privatization of Crimea's state-run enterprises"  contravene Ukraine's legislation.    He dismissed as illegal the declaration of Crimea's control  over the property of state-run transportation depots,  information and communication facilities, higher educational  establishments and other institutions in Crimea.    The decree maintains that in line with Ukrainian law, this  is  part of the property that belongs to all in society.    Besides, part of what is to be privatized in accordance with  the Crimean President Meshkov's decree relates to the national  property of Ukraine, the decree stresses.</p>

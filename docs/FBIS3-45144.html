			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 11 (XINHUA) -- China's capital  retained a two-digit economic growth rate last year as it took  bold strides in overhauling its infrastructure and developing a  new market.    According to official figures, the city reached a 12 percent  growth in gross domestic product (GDP), the second successive  year of over ten percent growth.    The city saw the so far fastest rate of construction last  year. Partially tempted by the city's unsuccessful bid to host  the Olympic Games, it hugely boosted investment in  infrastructure work. The 10.2-billion government funds  [currency not specified] went to various projects, including  highways, flyovers, telephone switch-gear, power, gas and  heating stations, as well as sewage and rubbish disposal plants  and green land.    Foreign funds played a major role in renovating the run-down  areas of the city. A total of 900 million U.S. dollars of  overseas investment flowed into the city in 1993, of which 70  percent went into infrastructure construction and service  industries.    As the economy grew, the citizens' income increased. The  average per capita income reached 5,500 yuan, 24.4 percent  higher than in 1992. Its growth rate beat the inflation rate by  eight percentage points.    Policemen received the greatest increase in income last  year.  They earned an average of 6,086 yuan annually, up nearly 40  percent over the previous year. They were followed by  enterprise workers, who earned an average of 5,955 yuan, up 25.7  percent over 1992, school teachers who earned an average of  5,638 yuan, up 36.6 percent, and government employees with an  annual average of 5,482, up 33 percent.    The inflation rate stood at 16.9 percent for the year,  according to official statistics.    The capital city speeded up the development of a new market  system. It has pushed four state-owned enterprises onto the  international market by issuing their shares abroad.    It continued the process of replacing the old  government-sponsored housing system with a more market-dependent  housing scheme. A total of 120,000 apartments were sold at  their market price last year, a four-fold increase over 1992.</p>

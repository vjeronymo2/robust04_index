			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRACKDOWN ON LOUD CAR STEREOS URGED  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council has voted unanimously to send a letter to the state  Assembly endorsing a bill that would cite drivers who play car stereos too  loudly.  </P> <P> The decision follows a letter to the council from a group of residents near  Torrance Beach who said they are annoyed almost daily by noisy car stereos.  </P> <P> Councilman George Nakano had asked the city staff last week to study ways to  regulate or cite drivers with "boom box" stereos. The staff recommended council  support of a bill authored by Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) that  would make it a violation of the state Vehicle Code to play a car stereo louder  than 82 decibels. (Noise from a busy street may be rated 70 to 80 decibels.)  </P> <P> Irene Ishizaka, an aide to Isenberg, said the bill is being held in committee  because the decibel limit is difficult for police to enforce without a sound  meter, and the bill leaves unclear what the penalty would be for a violation.  </P> <P> City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said the city is aware of the bill's problems but  supports it in principle.  </P></p>

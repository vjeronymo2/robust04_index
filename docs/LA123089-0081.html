			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN FALLS TO DEATH OFF LA JOLLA CLIFF  </P> <P> An unidentified woman, age 65 or older and dressed in jogging clothes,  apparently slipped and fell to her death down a La Jolla cliff Friday  afternoon, officials said.  </P> <P> The woman's body was discovered in a tide pool at 3:45 p.m. by three passers-by  at the bottom of the cliff, in the 1500 block of Coast Walk.  </P> <P> "It appears that she fell from the cliff to the rocks below," San Diego Deputy  Coroner Jerry Hillbrand said.  </P> <P> The 5-foot-1 woman, who carried no identification, was wearing a white Nike  jogging sweater with blue trim and gray draw-string sweat pants, Hillbrand  said. The 111-pound, blue-eyed woman wore white metal-rim glasses and carried  two black Volvo keys, Hillbrand said. Beneath her jacket, she wore two  long-sleeve sweaters: one tan, the other white.  </P> <P> "The cliffs are very slick after the rain, and that could have been the reason  she fell off," San Diego Lifeguard Lt. Brant Bass said.  </P> <P> Four lifeguards and four San Diego police were involved with the rescue, Bass  said. The victim was taken from the area, which is normally underwater, by  helicopter, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As of today, three of the 14 generating units in  Ukrainian nuclear power plants are on the verge of being shut  down due to the lack of nuclear fuel. The radio agency NOVYNY  asked [name indistinct], first deputy head of the State  Committee for Nuclear Power, to comment. According to him, the  problems with nuclear fuel supplies from Russia are due to the  lack of funds for energy resources. To secure this year's  supplies of fuel and spare parts for Ukrainian nuclear power  plants, Ukraine needs 350 billion rubles. At present, the State  Committee for Nuclear Power does not possess such a sum. The  Committee leadership believes that this problem could be  resolved when the trilateral agreement signed in Moscow is  implemented.</p>

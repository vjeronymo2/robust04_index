The officials said the State Planning Commission has  approved  the plan to build the bridge crossing the river at the border  between Jingzhou and Shashi cities on the north bank and Gongan  County on the south bank.    The bridge will connect with the No. 207 National Highway  connecting Inner Mongolia and Guangdong, and the No. 318  National Highway connecting Shanghai and Lhasa.    According to the officials, the prestressed stay-cable  bridge  will be 4,015 m long and 24 to 25 m wide, with six lanes. It  will allow a clear height of 18 m for navigation at the highest  water level.    Investment for the bridge is estimated at 1.13 billion yuan.  The officials hope that the overseas economic cooperation fund  of Japan will be able to provide a loan of 60 million U.S.  dollars. The rest of the money will be provided by the local  government.    Construction of the bridge is expected to start in 1995 and  be completed in five years, the officials said.    It is believed that the bridge will greatly boost the  economic development of the area, which is reputed as one of  China's most important producers of grain, cotton and oil plants.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Palestinian-Jordanian Coordination"] </F>   [Text] Palestinian-Arab relations remain one of the most  important pillars that are supposed to be firm and sound and  which can be relied on during all crises and dangers confronting  the Palestinian cause at present and in the future. The Arab  dimension of this cause represented and continues to represent a  strategic and moral weight for the Palestinian people, who will  never renounce their Arab affiliation and will not allow  transitory events to instill doubts in them about or weaken  their faith in the common pan-Arab destiny which links them with  the other peoples of the Arab nation.    In this context, Palestinian-Jordanian relations derive  additional importance. Jordan has been linked to Palestine with  a close fraternal bond which has been enhanced socially,  politically, and in terms of population. One can say, without  exaggeration, that this relationship or bond has reached the  stage of inter-family cohesion, whereby it seems impossible to  split this link without almost fatal consequences for the two  fraternal people.    Although neither the Palestinian nor the Jordanian side has  precisely explained the reasons for the misunderstanding between  them other than what was stated in the Jordanian monarch's two  speeches, from which one can discern the emphasis placed on the  importance of prompt coordination between the two leaderships,  apparently the speeches' reverberations invoked a rational  understanding by the Palestinian side. Hence, the visit by  Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, to Amman.  This visit reflects the Palestinian leadeship's eagerness to  preserve the special fraternal relationship with Jordan and  develop it in the interest of the two brotherly people and the  future of the Arab nation.    It is certain that adopting an approach of openness and  frankness, overcoming the difficulties, and clarifying any  misunderstandings that occur constitute a healthy and correct  basis for any sort of coordination between the two parties. If  at present the PLO is experiencing negotiating problems with  Israel, one of the priorities of the Palestinian and Jordanian  sides is to exchange views, coordinate positions in a climate of  mutual trust, remove suspicions, and clear the climate. This is  the only way for enhancing the two sides' negotiating stance  vis-a-vis Israel with the aim of reaching a just and  comprehensive settlement aspired for by the two sides and the  entire Arab nation.</p>

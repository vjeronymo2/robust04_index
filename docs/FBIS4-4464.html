			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Human Rights Dilemma"] </F>   [Text] When President Suharto once again criticized certain  developed countries for linking aid programs with environmental  and political conditions in an address the other day, he was  joining the increasingly louder chorus of Third World leaders  who steadfastly stand against pressures to bow to the Western  countries' so called "conditionalities."    What we should underline from Suharto's remark is his  warning  that the disagreement over the issues of the environment and  human rights could become new source of conflict in North-South  relations.    True enough. The indications of this are there all right.    In the last several weeks the escalating war of words  between  the United States and China over human rights issues linked with  China's most favored nation trading status has soured their  relations to such an extent that, as Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen expressed the other day China has threatened "to  live without any trade relations with the U.S."    Other Asian countries, like Vietnam and noticeably Malaysia,  also have raised the hardliner's flag. Even Singapore, a  country which is known for its close association with Western  countries, snapped back a few weeks ago when President Clinton  protested the Singapore court decision to sentence an American  teenager to six strokes of the cane and four months in jail for  spray-painting cars.    While we acknowledge that human rights conditions in many  Asian countries, including Indonesia, need much improvement, and  that foreign pressure has helped the situation to improve, there  are reasons to be concerned that without a proper switching  mechanism, the still developing row could lead into a tragic  collision course, something which we believe nobody wants.    Judging from the heated nature of the words being shot back  and forth, many Third World countries are becoming ever more fed  up with the conditions imposed by the developed countries. But,  different from the situation a few years back, they now have  economic clout to back their hardliner stance: Asia's economic  growth has boomed to an extent the failing Western countries'  economies cannot simply ignore.    Some Asian countries, like China, for example, have even  come  to the conclusion that Western countries need them much more  than they need the Western countries. The statistics and the  projections seem to support these views.    For example, by the year 2000, Asia will have one billion  consumers with sufficient spending power which will certainly  create some of the biggest financial opportunities in history.  Over the next decade, non-Japanese Asia is said to be planning  to spend US$1 trillion on infrastructure projects, something  which Western companies are surely eager to be a part of. But,  if these developed countries are overzealous about Asia's human  rights conditions, they may lose this huge market.    On the other hand, Western countries like the U.S., are  bound  to their commitment to environmental and human rights causes.  In the case of President Clinton, he cannot back off on these  issues because Congress and other pressure groups would crucify  him. Hence, a nation's credibility is at stake.    In the midst of this dilemma some sort of compromise and  face- saving solution must be sought. To a certain extent,  foreign pressure on Asian human rights conditions have yielded  positive results. This can be seen not only in the improvement  of the human rights conditions themselves, but more importantly  in the spreading awareness of the significance of human rights  and the encouraging of local peoples to fight for their rights.    Thus, to a certain extent, the pressure and the momentum  thus  achieved must be maintained. But different approaches must be  taken. For example, Western countries should drop their "high  and mighty" approach, which amounts to dictating their concepts  of democracy and human rights to Asian countries. Nothing much  will be gained from playing "globocop" now. The response is  bound to be annoyance, resentment and possibly rage.</p>

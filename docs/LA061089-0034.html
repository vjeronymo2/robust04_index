			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOMETHING IS MISSING, AND IT'S MORE THAN JUST LASORDA'S BELLY  </P> <P> Any Dodger fan would admit that a scan of the team's statistics in the morning  paper is enough to ruin a good cup of coffee.  </P> <P> Let's face it, last year it was Kirk Gibson. This year it's Eddie Murray. The  Dodgers are not a one-man team, they are a team that has simply forgotten they  are still this year's world champions.  </P> <P> RAUL MARTINEZ  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

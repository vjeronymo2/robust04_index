In a statement on Thursday, she said the  reports in the SOWETAN and NATAL MERCURY on Wednesday were based  on an incorrect interpretation of comments she had made at a  news conference on Tuesday.    Mrs. de Lille had said the PAC's armed wing, the Azanian  Peoples Liberation Army, had temporarily suspended its armed  struggle pending negotiations with the government and South  African Defence Force on a mutual cessation of hostilities. She  said further meetings to discuss the ending of hostilities could  be held within the next two weeks.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / World Trade News: More Japanese car exports Japan and the European Commission have revised upwards their forecasts for exports of Japanese cars to the EU by 9,000 cars, a rise of 1.3 per cent against the 1993 agreement. The increase formed part of an agreement in July 1991 allowing for a transitional period during which time Japan will monitor exports to the EU and the five member states that previously restricted imports. It reflects the unexpectedly higher number of vehicle registrations this year. The Commission and the Japanese government now predict that demand this year will increase this year by 4.4 per cent. The forecast of exports to the five member states that previously restricted imports are France, 78,500; Italy, 47,000; Portugal 39,500; Spain, 35,500; UK 184,600.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / The Renault-Volvo Merger: Schweitzer faces a bumpy ride on difficult journey MR Louis Schweitzer, who will be in charge of the merged industrial operations of Renault and Volvo, has enjoyed a smooth rise through the elite of the French public administration to the top of French industry. But he now faces his most difficult task, as he oversees the sensitive task of merging two independent and politically sensitive companies and steers a course towards privatisation. The merger with Volvo was not Mr Schweitzer's idea. He inherited the alliance, which began in 1990, from Mr Raymond Levy, who stepped down in May 1992. But since taking the reins Mr Schweitzer has energetically pursued the consummation of relations between the two groups. 'Co-operation between Renault and Volvo has been perfect,' he said, 'but we have to be highly sensitive to competition, so speed is necessary for success.' The same might be said about his personal career. A student of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the training ground for the elite of the French government service, he worked his way quickly up the economic administration, culminating in 1986 with his appointment as adviser to Mr Laurent Fabius, the former socialist prime minister. From there, he joined Renault, where he was named head of the planning department in 1987. In 1990, at the age of 48, he was appointed managing director of the car group, making him heir to the Renault throne. The final jump to the top appeared threatened for a while by resistance from Mrs Edith Cresson, then socialist prime minister, who opposed the link with Volvo because of its weak financial position. But support from Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the head of Volvo, helped secure Mr Schweitzer's appointment as chairman of the French car group. The two chairmen say there is a close rapport between them. 'He has an excellent analytical mind,' said Mr Gyllenhammar of his counterpart yesterday. 'I know we are going to work well together.' Mr Schweitzer, for his part, praised the visionary capacity of his counterpart. Such warm ties are going to be essential in the delicate task of combining their operations. Apart from avoiding strains with Renault's new partner, Mr Schweitzer's most difficult task will be to steer the new group through the depressed European car market. His record so far includes encouraging signs. The recovery in Renault's fortunes has coincided with Mr Schweitzer's stint at the company. Since he joined in 1986, Renault has reversed a period of heavy losses which saw six consecutive years of deficits until 1987 and net losses as high as FFr12.6bn in 1984. Last year, by contrast, profits reached FFr5.5bn (Dollars 940m). Much of this progress was due to Mr Levy's legacy. But French industry officials say that Mr Schweitzer also played an important role in improving quality and efficiency and in introducing innovative new products such as the Twingo small car which was launched last year and has sold strongly. Since he took over as chairman, however, times have become harder. First-half profits, announced last month, fell by almost 90 per cent compared with the same period in 1992. Resisting the downturn, and forging the two parts of the new group into a greater whole, will be the test of Mr Schweitzer's success.</p>

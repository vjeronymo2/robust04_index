			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> DEMONSTRATORS SEEK RELEASE OF MILITANT  </P> <P> Chanting "liberty for Dr. Bosch" and waving Cuban flags, about 1,000 Cuban  exiles marched through Miami's Little Havana section to call on the U.S.  government to release jailed anti-Castro militant Orlando Bosch and end its  efforts to deport him. Bosch has been branded a terrorist by the Justice  Department but is hailed as an anti-communist hero by many Cuban exiles. Since  his deportation from Venezuela in 1988 he has been in jail in Miami on a parole  violation on a conviction for firing a bazooka at a Polish freighter in the  Port of Miami.  </P></p>

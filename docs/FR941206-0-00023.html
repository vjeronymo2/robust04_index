This action requires a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual that prohibits takeoff in certain icing conditions unless either a tactile inspection is performed or specific takeoff procedures are followed. This amendment is prompted by several accidents in which Fokker Model F28 series airplanes lost aerodynamic lift when attempting takeoff with ice contamination on their wings. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent degradation of aerodynamic lift during takeoff when icing conditions exist.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective December 21, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before February 6, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;174&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Information concerning this amendment may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Timothy J.

The FAA has determined that airplanes with wings that do not have leading edge high lift devices, such as the Fokker Model F28 series airplanes, are particularly susceptible to loss of lift when attempting to take off with minimal amounts of ice accumulation (contamination) on the wings. Further, the FAA finds that airplanes with this configuration account for a disproportionate number of the total number of accidents attributable to wing ice contamination. In light of this, the FAA has determined that, for airplanes with this configuration, an extra degree of protection is necessary beyond reliance solely on operation in accordance with the current requirements specified in section 121.629 (``Operation in icing conditions''), amendment 121&hyph;231, of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 121.629).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has determined that one acceptable (interim) method of addressing icing problems associated with airplanes having this configuration is a physical (tactile) and visual check of the leading edge and upper wing surfaces to verify that there is no accumulation of ice, frost, and snow prior to takeoff. The FAA previously issued AD 93&hyph;11&hyph;01 [amendment 39&hyph;8593 (58 FR 33898, June 22, 1993)], which requires such a tactile check of McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;10 series airplanes; those airplanes, like the Model F28, do not have leading edge high lift devices. The intent of checks such as these is to prevent takeoff with wing ice contamination, which can result in the degradation of wing lift, and can result in the airplane stalling at lower than normal angles-of-attack during takeoff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, issued Netherlands Airworthiness Directive (BLA) 93&hyph;167/2 (A), dated April 29, 1994, applicable to Fokker Model F28 series airplanes operating in the Netherlands. This BLA describes an ``alternative'' takeoff procedure that can be followed to improve stall margins whenever icing conditions exist. [This ``alternative'' takeoff procedure was developed in response to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) Safety Recommendation A&hyph;93&hyph;023.] The ``alternative'' takeoff procedure requires the availability of 120 percent of the minimum takeoff distance for the actual gross weight. Additionally, the 20 percent increase in takeoff distance must be accounted for in the obstacle clearance analysis. The BLA specifies that the ``alternative'' takeoff procedure is an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> optional <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  procedure that is available for use when sufficient runway length and obstacle clearance margin are available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved this ``alternative'' takeoff procedure as an interim measure that will acceptably address the problems associated with takeoff and operation of Model F28 series airplanes in icing conditions. Although the RLD has classified the procedure as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> optional <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the FAA has determined that it must be mandated as one method to ensure that these airplanes have adequate lift to effect a safe takeoff when icing conditions exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated previously, the FAA has determined that the accomplishment of these types of additional actions is necessary in order to provide an extra degree of protection for Model F28 series airplanes, beyond that provided by the current operating requirements specified in part 121 of the FAR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fokker has advised the FAA that it is currently developing a modification to the thermal anti-ice system on all Fokker Model F28 series airplanes. This modification would allow the thermal anti-ice system to operate on the ground, which would prevent reformation of ice on the wing leading edges after ground equipment has been used to properly de-ice/anti-ice the airplane, and would minimize the effect of undetected ice/frost/snow contamination. Fokker has indicated that this proposed modification will be similar to the one required by AD 93&hyph;11&hyph;01 for McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9&hyph;10 series airplanes. (That AD requires a modification of the wing leading edge bleed air anti-ice system on so that it can operate on the ground to prevent the reformation of ice after de-icing procedures have been accomplished.) However, because this proposed modification for Model F28 series airplanes currently is under development, any associated modification instructions or required parts are not available at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. The FAA has determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent degradation of the aerodynamic lift during takeoff due to wing ice contamination, which could result in the airplane stalling at lower than normal angles-of-attack during takeoff. This AD requires a revision to the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), which requires that, whenever icing conditions exist, one of the following actions must be accomplished:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A physical (tactile) check to detect ice, frost, and snow accumulation on the leading edge and upper wing surfaces must be performed prior to takeoff. (This check is similar to that required by AD 93&hyph;11&hyph;01 for McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;10 series airplanes).

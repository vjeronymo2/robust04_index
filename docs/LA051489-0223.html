			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOTTERY MILLIONS AND ACCOUNTABILITY  </P> <P> Last Tuesday we went to the polls for a special school district election on a  bond issue for more school capacity. We have no argument with the need for  adequate school availability, nor for the overriding need for education of  young and old.  </P> <P> We do wonder what has been done with that money that was to flow into  California's educational program -- from the devious promises made by the  backers of the lottery in order to give the lottery a semblance of  respectability. We have yet to see any detailed accounting of how many of those  millions have gone to schools, or of how the money is being spent.  </P> <P> We believe some kind of detailed report on the amounts and uses of this  "windfall" is long overdue.  </P> <P> LOUISE AND HAROLD JILLSON  </P> <P> Dana Point  </P></p>

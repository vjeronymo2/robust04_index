			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Ellis &amp; Everard rises 30% to Pounds 15.9m - Company wins greater market share and makes significant volume gains Shares in Ellis &amp; Everard rose 16p to 225p yesterday after the chemicals distributor defied historic lows in the price of some industrial chemicals with a 30 per cent profits increase. The Bradford-based group saw pre-tax profits rise from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 15.9m after winning greater market share and making significant volume gains in the year to April 30. The improvement was fuelled mainly by a strong performance in the US, where operating profits rose 23 per cent to Dollars 12.2m (Pounds 8m), against Dollars 9.9m, on turnover of Dollars 363.4m (Dollars 352.4m). The group also made a Pounds 700,000 gain on favourable currency transactions, which helped offset an average 5 per cent fall in chemical prices. Mr Peter Wood, chief executive, said the results had pushed the company into fifth position in the league of leading distributors and pledged to improve that ranking with further investment in facilities in Cleveland and Atlanta. In the UK, operating profits rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 10.7m despite low prices, especially for products such as anti-freeze and caustic soda. Mr Wood said the figures had been held back by flat operating profits of Pounds 600,000 in Ireland and increased losses of Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 200,000) in its swimming pools equipment and chemicals business. However, turnover rose from Pounds 171.1m to Pounds 183.5m and he predicted 'significant future benefits' from Ronmar Plastics, the polymer distributor acquired for Pounds 1.2m in January. The group also acquired three US businesses - Metrochem, Tristate and Trinity - but overall capital expenditure fell from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 8.8m as the tough pricing environment delayed expansion plans. Those plans, including the redevelopment of its South Yorkshire storage tank facility, are expected to be completed this year following a recent upturn in chemical prices. Earnings per share rose by 30 per cent to 13.4p (10.3p) and the prospect of a recovery in prices persuaded the company to lift its final dividend to 5.15p, making 7.6p (7.05p) for the year. Shareholders have been offered a scrip alternative for the second successive year. COMMENT The international distributor has moved swiftly to shore up its activities after seeing chemical prices fall by 25 per cent against the 1990 average. It has delayed some large capital spending, overhauled its sales team and forged partnerships with suppliers such as BP and customers including Nutrasweet and Indchem. This has reduced its exposure to price volatility, while also ensuring a product range wide enough to reduce the burden of environmental regulations on some of its facilities. With prices moving upwards, profits this year are expected to reach Pounds 18.3m on a multiple of 14.6, making the shares one of the cheaper options in the chemicals sector.</p>

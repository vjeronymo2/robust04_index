			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRANT TO FIGHT OIL REFINERY SOUGHT;  </P> <P> FUNDING: COMPTON NEIGHBORHOOD BLAMES PLANT FOR HEALTH PROBLEMS. STATE MONEY  COULD HELP RESIDENTS' CAUSE.  </P> <P> About a dozen people, mostly elderly men with time on their hands and young  women with sleeping babies or squirming preschoolers on their laps, met  recently in the library at Jefferson Elementary School.  </P> <P> They are "sensitive receptors," the scientific term for people in the path of  pollutants.  </P> <P> "I'm in bed most of the time. I've been hospitalized with asthma and  emphysema," said the only elderly woman in the group.  </P> <P> "One of my sons has a lot of asthma," said one young woman.  </P> <P> "She says her daughter has a stomach ailment and . . . a rash," said another  woman, translating for a Spanish-speaking participant.  </P> <P> They blame DeMenno-Kerdoon, an oil refinery in the center of their  neighborhood, for their health problems. And with a grant from the state they  hope to mount a campaign to get rid of the refinery. About half of those in the  group did not speak English. None had been to college, and many did not have  high school educations.  </P> <P> Yet they must do battle in an arena where the rules revolve around such things  as suspended particulate matter, annual arithmetic averages, source performance  standards and nitrogen and sulfur dioxide.  </P> <P> The group is applying to the state Department of Health Services for money  under a new state program called the Community Technical Assistant Contract  Grant Program. It is designed to put ordinary people on an equal footing with  state bureaucrats and experts hired by private industries that are accused of  polluting neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The Compton group wants a $25,000 grant to hire a scientist to evaluate the  performance of the oil refinery a block from Jefferson school on the city's  north side.  </P> <P> DeMenno-Kerdoon and other refineries are going through a new and extensive  permit process that takes almost two years to complete. The Compton group wants  the scientist to help them prevent the refinery from obtaining a permit.  </P> <P> "The people don't want it here," said Joe Ochoa, a longtime Latino community  activist and labor organizer who is spearheading the quest for the state grant.  </P> <P> "Maybe this group can do something," Ochoa said.  </P> <P> DeMenno-Kerdoon's hulking black storage tanks cover the block on North Alameda  Street between Pine Avenue and Oaks Street. The firm employs about 60 people.  Bruce DeMenno bought it in 1974, and Steven M. Kerdoon became his partner in  1975. It recently underwent a financial reorganization under federal bankruptcy  laws, Kerdoon acknowledged, and now 80% of it belongs to World Oil Co.  </P> <P> For more than a decade, residents around the refinery, reputed by its owners to  be the nation's largest recycler of petroleum, have complained that it is  polluting the neighborhood, threatening their health and sullying everything  from their laundry to their lungs.  </P> <P> "Even when you roll your windows up, you feel it in your nostrils and your  throat. It's terrible," said Sylvia Perez, describing the odor that residents  say hangs over the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Macedonia Ponce, 71, and her husband, William, have made their home in the same  location for 57 years. The oil refinery was built at least 40 years ago just a  block away, and Macedonia Ponce blames it for her respiratory ailments. Two  years ago they became so severe that she was in and out of the hospital and on  a respirator for a while. A film of oil from the refinery lies over the entire  neighborhood, she said.  </P> <P> "I close all my windows and doors to try to keep it out," she said in a  interview this week. "But it doesn't stay out, because in the morning the  tables and chairs, they all have a film of oil or soot or whatever it is. It's  hard to keep our curtains clean."  </P> <P> At the school, complaints about the fumes are commonplace. "Some days it was so  bad it actually made certain people nauseated and a lot got sore throats," said  Hector Contreras, who worked at Jefferson until this fall, when he became vice  principal at another school.  </P> <P> "The first year I was (at Jefferson) was 1985 and I developed an acute case of  asthma," Contreras said. "I had asthma as a child, but I had not suffered an  asthma attack since then."  </P> <P> The fumes were so bad sometimes, he said, that they invaded the classrooms and  the children had to be rushed outside to gulp fresh air.  </P> <P> Indeed, DeMenno-Kerdoon last year pleaded no contest and paid $2,300 in fines  and penalties as a result of misdemeanor charges that the firm contaminated the  air around the school on two separate occasions. The charges were brought  against the firm after school officials summoned investigators from the South  Coast Air Quality Management District.  </P> <P> Kerdoon said he and his partner are doing everything possible, including  investing millions of dollars in new equipment, to prevent pollution. The firm,  he said, wants to be a "good neighbor." It has a checkered history on that  score, however.  </P> <P> In 1986, DeMenno and Kerdoon pleaded no contest to criminal charges of  transporting and handling nearly 50,000 gallons of toxic chemicals without a  permit. The firm was fined $400,000, and DeMenno and Kerdoon were placed on  three years' probation.  </P> <P> The chemicals were mostly cleaning solvents discarded by gasoline stations. The  refinery now only collects oil from gasoline stations and recycles and resells  it as diesel fuel or for use in making asphalt.  </P> <P> Kerdoon points out that in the Huntington Beach oil spill last year, it was his  firm that was hired to recycle the oil sucked up from the ocean before it hit  the beaches. His firm, he says, is providing an environmental service by  recycling oil.  </P> <P> "We're not just making a product that can be controlled. We're taking care of a  product that would pollute the environment if we weren't here."  </P> <P> Put his firm out of business, he says, and people will pour the oil down their  drains or in the public sewers.  </P> <P> Kerdoon says he wants to talk to the neighbors and work with them to solve the  problems. His business, he says, can be made compatible with a residential  neighborhood. "If people have a problem, we need to deal with it," he said.  </P> <P> The state provides assistance to the community groups and is sending  representatives to the school again this month.  </P> <P> There are, for example, strict accounting procedures that must be followed if  the group wins a grant.  </P> <P> In all, the state will award $147,000 in grants, according to Deborah Koven,  public participation coordinator for the Department of Health Services in  Sacramento. The Compton group and one other near Santa Barbara are the first  two in the state to take advantage of the new program, Koven said.  </P></p>

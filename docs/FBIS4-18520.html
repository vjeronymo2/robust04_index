			<p>BFN     [Text] Finland's trade with Russia has taken a clear upward  turn. Exports to Russia doubled last year compared to the  previous year. According to a review by the Board of Customs,  the value of the exports was just over 6,000 million Finnish  markkas [FMk]. Imports increased by 17 percent from 1992 and  were worth FMk7,800 million. Last year's trade with Russia  exceeded the trade with the Soviet Union in 1991, but still  remained considerably smaller than in the final years of the  eighties.</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / What's wrong with the Eurowets The Maastricht treaty and the European exchange rate mechanism have been considered in two separate compartments. The first has been the concern of foreign ministries; the second of finance ministries and central banks. As a result, politicians and officials who want to establish their European credentials, but dislike - or are indifferent to - the sound money implications of present and proposed European monetary arrangements ('Eurowets' for short) are tempted to advocate the ratification of the Maastricht treaty, after arrangements have been made to meet the concerns of Denmark, but to leave the monetary side in abeyance. This is not, however, a sensible distinction. It may be that the Maastricht treaty is dead. Or it may be that the ERM will break up beyond hope of resurrection. But on the assumption that both survive - even if Germany and France also adopt a fast track towards monetary union - the monetary and the political sides will have to be brought together. The Eurowets have a legal case. The exchange rate mechanism was established in 1979 by a protocol between central banks outside the Treaty of Rome. The ERM comes into the picture in relation to the transition to stage three of full economic and monetary union (Emu). Countries will only be eligible to take part in the latter, if they have been for two years within the narrow band of the ERM without devaluation. If monetary union is established at the beginning of 1997, the implication is that participants will have to have been in the ERM in 1995 and 1996. Given the difficulty of moving from being out in the cold to a rigid adherence to the narrow band, a would-be participant would be well advised to join the ERM under less restrictive conditions by 1993 or early 1994 at the latest. If Britain exercises the protocol which allows it to opt out of monetary union, then there will be no obligation to rejoin the ERM. At this stage however the question the arises: what is Maastricht for? The makers of the Maastricht treaty envisaged a three-stage process with stage one (in which we are already supposed to be) consisting of the ERM, stage three marking the beginning of full monetary union and stage two as a transitional one beginning in 1994. Many statements by governments and central bankers have made it clear that all the main players are expected to be in the ERM by that year and to move to narrow bands not long afterwards. Countries like Portugal and Greece would, of course, be allowed to move at a slower pace. The ERM was established as a first step to monetary union. The Delors committee was set up in 1988 with the express object of reviving the project. Indeed Jacques Delors himself has always regarded Emu as the central part of Maastricht and the main political vehicle for European integration. The foreign policy and defence aspects were inserted at a later stage, partly because the German government was not prepared to sign away the D-Mark without progress towards a federal Europe. Predictably, the wider provisions turned to be mainly foliage around Emu. The provisions for a common foreign policy avoid majority voting and bypass the Brussels Commission for the most important decisions. There will only be a common foreign policy if Community countries can get their acts together on issues such as Yugoslavia. But that was the case before. I was always puzzled by John Major's insistence that the Maastricht treaty was at least as valuable for what it leaves out as for what it contains. If the UK opts out of both the Social Charter (as it should) and of monetary union (as it should not) the treaty becomes an empty shell. Its main advantage for the UK is that it provides a route by which a House of Commons can one day join a monetary union. So long as Britain rejoins the ERM or any successor arrangement, the hope remains alive. Otherwise, it makes no difference whether parliament ratifies Maastricht or not.</p>

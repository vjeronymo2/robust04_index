			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HARTLEY ASKS CHIEF BURGREEN TO TALK TO GUARDIAN ANGELS  </P> <P> San Diego City Councilman John Hartley on Friday called on Police Chief Bob  Burgreen to meet with the Guardian Angels and volunteered to help mediate the  talks.  </P> <P> "I think at a time when we have a crime problem, any group that wants to help  should be encouraged and not discouraged," Hartley said.  </P> <P> The Guardian Angels, a civilian street-patrol unit, has asked the Police  Department to participate in a "partnership against crime," which the  department refused citing liability problems. The request was made amid  allegations that the Angels overstepped bounds when making a recent citizen's  arrest.  </P> <P> "There are major questions about the Guardian Angels," Hartley admitted, "but,  through communications, these can be fixed up." Hartley sent his request for a  discussion through assistant City Manager Jack McGrory.  </P> <P> On March 19, Cmdr. Larry Gore, head of the department's public-affairs unit,  met with Weston Conwell, the Angels' regional director. Conwell asked the  department to conduct background checks of would-be members and to help train  members. The request was refused because it could leave the city liable for the  group's actions, said David Cohen, police spokesman.  </P> <P> McGrory said he had received Hartley's request and would discuss it with  Burgreen. But, he said, a decision about a partnership has already been made.  </P> <P> "There have already been lengthy meetings, and there has been no change in the  department's position. . . . And the city manager's office supports that  position."  </P> <P> Seven Guardian Angels were detained by police March 15 and cited for  misdemeanor battery and false imprisonment after a confrontation when they  attempted to place two men under citizen's arrest. Because witnesses told  police that the two men had done nothing to merit detention, the incident  sparked police worries that the group might be abusing the citizen's-arrest  privilege.  </P> <P> "We encourage them to be our eyes and ears, just like any another citizens  group," Cohen said. "But they have to abide by the same rules."  </P> <P> Hartley, who represents the 3rd District, said the group is open to police  suggestions. "I think they are willing to cooperate. I think they are willing  to compromise."  </P> <P> The group patrols downtown streets and has been patrolling in the Clairemont  neighborhood where three young women have been fatally stabbed. Hartley said he  has invited the group to begin patrols in his district, which includes most of  East San Diego, Kensington, Normal Heights as well as portions of North Park,  Encanto Heights, University Heights, Talmadge, Webster and Oak Park.  </P> <P> Conwell said his group has gathered more than 1,000 signatures from citizens  requesting that Burgreen meet with the Angels.  </P></p>

Rong said that since the two countries established  diplomatic  relations in 1978, bilateral friendly relations of cooperation  in various fields have developed continuously; the two countries  share similar views on some important international issues; and  they have cooperated well in international organizations,  supporting each other and coordinating their steps in handling  some issues.    Rong said that China is ready to make concerted efforts  together with Libya to further strengthen such friendship and  cooperation.    He expressed the conviction that al-Muntasir's visit to  China  will help further the friendship and cooperation between the two  countries.    Al-Muntasir conveyed the compliments of the head of state of  Libya Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi for the Chinese Government and  people.    Al-Muntasir said that Libyan leaders are committed to  strengthening and developing friendship and cooperation with  China, hoping that such relations would be furthered.    Prior to the meeting, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen held talks with al-Muntasir on bilateral  relations and issues of common concern.    Qian said that since the establishment of diplomatic  relations between the two countries, China and Libya have  conducted effective cooperation in various fields, and China is  satisfied with the development.    He noted that China is willing to continue to develop  friendly relations of cooperation with Libya on the basis of the  five principles of peaceful coexistence.    On Lockerbie incident, Qian said that China has all along  been concerned with the issue. China opposes terrorism of any  description and holds that international disputes should be  settled through peaceful means.    He said that China advocates for the settlement of the  Lockerbie crisis through consultation and negotiations by  parties concerned. "We disapprove of imposing sanctions on  Libya, let alone imposing severer sanctions," Qian said.    He pointed out that sanctions against Libya have brought  about pains to the Libyan people and caused difficulties for  Libya's neighboring countries and other countries concerned,  thus intensifying the already strained regional situation.    He said that China understands and sympathizes with Libya  concerning the current conditions and does not want to see the  situation worsening.    He said that China appreciates the stand of Libya and the  flexibility exhibited by it in settling the Lockerbie incident  through peaceful negotiations.

Al-Muntasir praised China for its important role in  establishing a new world order, saying that Libya is to  strengthen bilateral relations, coordination and cooperation in  international affairs with China.    He also briefed Qian on the latest development concerning  the  Lockerbie incident and Libya's stand on the issue, adding that  Libya will apply negotiations and peaceful means to resolve the  international crisis.

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Barclays union threatens action Barclays Group Staff Union, which has about 50,000 members, will decide soon whether to take industrial action over the decision by Barclays Bank to cut a further 3,000 jobs over the next two years. The decision will follow an emergency meeting of the staff union's regional chairmen next week. The Bifu banking union, which has about 12,000 members at the bank, said industrial action was 'a real possibility'. The union is particularly concerned that a much higher proportion of the job losses will come from compulsory redundancies than in previous cuts. Bifu also issued a warning that thousands of other job losses in the sector were coming, with statements from two other financial institutions expected this week. The Barclays announcement takes the total of job losses in the bank's five-year programme to 21,000 - 16 000 have already gone. Barclays said it believed there was still some scope for voluntary redundancies. It would resort to compulsory redundancies only 'when other avenues have been fully explored'.</p>

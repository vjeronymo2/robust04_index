			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIGIL, PRAYERS MARK KING BIRTHDAY  </P> <P> As Americans remembered Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on his 60th birthday  anniversary with a candlelight vigil and prayers, his widow, Coretta Scott  King, gave her annual "State of the Dream" address Sunday, calling the civil  rights gains her late husband inspired "fragile" and warning that "much remains  to be done."  </P> <P> At Boston University's School of Theology, where King received a doctorate  degree in 1955, students and teachers gathered for a Sunday night candlelight  vigil.  </P> <P> President-elect Bush, returning to Washington on Sunday from a three-day  Florida fishing vacation, scheduled an address to a prayer breakfast at a  Washington hotel today -- a federal holiday recognized by every state except  Arizona, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, South Dakota and New Hampshire.  </P> <P> King was killed by a sniper on April 4, 1968, while standing on a motel balcony  in Memphis, Tenn. The assassin, James Earl Ray, was imprisoned for life.  </P> <P> In Selma, Ala., three blacks will be sworn in as members of the Dallas County  Commission today. It was there that King began the historic 1965  Selma-to-Montgomery march that resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act.  </P> <P> The swearing-in of Erskine Minor, Perry Varner and D. L. Pope will end 112  years of white county rule and 10 years of legal battles to keep the commission  white in a place where 55% of the residents are black. The three new  commissioners were elected in special balloting last month.  </P> <P> Mrs. King, speaking at the packed Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where  King and his father shared the pulpit, said the ceremony was to honor "a  courageous young dreamer who picked up the torch of freedom and carried it from  Montgomery to Memphis with an unshakable faith in the promise of the American  dream. Martin passed that torch to us to continue the pursuit of the dream.  </P> <P> " . . . Although the 'white only' signs of the 1950s and 1960s are gone," she  said, "segregated neighborhoods and schools remain a pervasive fact of American  life."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Play by Boston Students  </P> <P> The city of Boston was hosting a ceremony and a tribute to King, including a  performance today of a play written by students titled "Dreams." The play's  title was taken from King's moving 1963 "I Have a Dream" speech in Washington.  </P> <P> An interfaith service was held in the nation's capital at the Washington Hebrew  Congregation to commemorate King's birthday, and the civil rights leader was  remembered in religious services throughout the country.  </P> <P> In Salt Lake City, the Mormon Church said it is closing its offices today to  allow church employees to observe the holiday.  </P> <P> Boston University was holding religious services to commemorate King's birthday  and to mark today's holiday.  </P> <P> The Rev. Jesse Jackson, in a sermon Sunday at a church in New York's  poverty-stricken Harlem section, lashed out at those who set back King's  efforts by "self-destruction" through drugs and violence. "Dr. King was our  gift from God. Martin Luther King did not fight and die for your right to use  cocaine, crack and heroin," said Jackson, who marched for civil rights with  King.  </P> <P> Jackson will be in Atlanta today to deliver a sermon and help lead a parade.  Tonight in Los Angeles, he will receive the SCLC Martin Luther King Award.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: CUDAHY;  </P> <P> FORMER CITY MANAGER'S SUIT SETTLED FOR $225,000  </P> <P> The city has settled a two-year lawsuit filed by a former Cudahy city manager  who charged that his employment contract had been unjustly terminated.  </P> <P> John F. Porter, who was fired in September, 1986, after the first year of a  five-year contract, was given a $225,000 settlement by the city earlier this  month.  </P> <P> City officials argued that the contract was too long and denied future City  Councils the right to hire city staff members of their choice. A Superior Court  judge ruled in the city's favor, but an appeals court recently overturned the  decision.  </P></p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Now, it's the motor card - A look at a new initiative from Vauxhall THE LAUNCH by Vauxhall Motors this week of a British version of the GM credit card available in the United States, means that the motor card has arrived in the UK. The GM card aims to compete with the established credit cards both on basic price and through added benefits from frequent use. Using the general purpose card - available at the customer's choice as either as Visa or MasterCard - earns points towards a discount on buying a new Vauxhall vehicle. Five per cent of the value of any transaction on the card counts as a rebate on a car, up to a maximum of Pounds 500 worth of discount points in a year. Points can be accumulated for up to five years but can be 'spent' at any time after the first monthly statement. The greatest available reduction on a car or van would be Pounds 2,500, but this could be achieved only by having spent at least Pounds 10,000 through the GM card each year for five years. This is considerably higher than the average spent on a credit card in a year. But points will be transferable within an immediate family - for example, to a spouse, daughter or son - so increasing the prospects of accumulating a more substantial amount. Vauxhall says the rebate points will not affect any saving from other promotions or incentives; nor need they inhibit any individual car buyer's ability to haggle with the dealer. Anyone wanting to use the GM card points towards a Vauxhall need not reveal that until after a price has been agreed. Meanwhile, a special scheme is to be set up in April next year to cater for company car drivers. too. While Vauxhall obviously would prefer company car drivers to use discount points to buy a Vauxhall as a second car, those who do not want to do so will be able to use the points they acquire as vouchers for high street goods and services. The co-operating hotels, shops and restaurants have yet to be named. A balance transferred from another credit card will also qualify for the discount points, at the same 5 per cent rate that a purchase would do. With the GM card itself not available until January, this offers a way of acquiring points in money spent through any credit card in the run-up to Christmas. The Vauxhall GM card will not carry an annual fee and has an annualised percentage rate of interest of 19.9 per cent. This compares with 22.9 per cent at Barclaycard and 23.9 per cent at National Westminster bank. Most card issuers now charge an annual fee of Pounds 10-12. HFC bank, which will be handling adminstration of the card, says its credit-scoring will be in line with general market practice. It does not guarantee, however, that it will match the credit limits offered by the established cards. At some point, the card could also entitle the holder to a discount on other goods and services: Vauxhall is looking hard at taking on corporate partners, but does not necessarily expect to have arrangements in place for the first day of the venture.</p>

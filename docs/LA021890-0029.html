			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TARGET IS ROCK  </P> <P> In the article "The Target Is Rock" by Chuck Philips (Feb. 11), Ramona Ripston,  executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Civil Liberties  Union, said that: "Rock 'n' roll is an art form just like literature. Nobody  would dare suggest labeling classic books which deal with controversial  subjects."  </P> <P> The fact of the matter is that the literary world has reached a level of  success in the area of censorship; it has fought long, pitched battles against  government agencies which opposed the dissemination of so-called obscene  materials. Let us not forget the battles fought in publishing James Joyce's  "Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man," or William S. Burroughs' "Naked  Lunch." These works were attacked and went through litigation before  publication in their respective eras -- now both are considered "classics."  </P> <P> The record industry must begin its own march against the dark hand of  censorship. The heavy-metal and rap artists of the '90s are faced with new  conservative opposition to their music. They must find the happy median between  iconoclasm and a sense of community.  </P> <P> JOSH MOSCOV  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

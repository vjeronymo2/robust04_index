			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Arts: The Pope and the Witch I have always found the Italian sense of humour somewhat elusive: the country has many virtues, but jokes are not among them. Some of the English, on the other hand, seem to think the Italians are funny just because they are Italians. And that, I suspect, is what has gone wrong with this production. Dario Fo's The Pope and the Witch, as presented at the Comedy, is not only unfunny; it is not even remotely satirical. If it reminds one of anything, it is a dismal performance at the Young Vic last summer of a play by the American, Tom Kempinski, called Sex Please, We're Italian] Although it starred Helen Mirren and despite all the resources that were put into it, Kempinski's piece failed to work because having English actors mimic Italians is not funny, indeed is frequently embarrassing. I shall list the virtues first. The Pope and the Witch is very well directed by Jude Kelly. When several characters are required to speak together, they do so in unison. It is very well designed by Rob Jones. The production moves easily from the papal apartments in the Vatican to a drug rehabilitation centre in Rome. All the elements of the commedia dell'arte are there. When a character needs to perform a somersault - and even when he does not  - he does so with effortless superiority. When the Pope ascends, if not into heaven, at least into the flies, the chandelier drops smoothly to collect him. Even the acting is not to be faulted. Berwick Kaler is a very versatile Pope. When he is down, he looks a bit like Neil Kinnock, though I assume that is accidental. Frances de la Tour is not really a witch, nor is she meant to be, just a woman who has knocked about a bit in the third world, doesn't like abortion much more than the Pope, but sometimes regards it as a necessary alternative. (That is the serious part.) In the circumstances, she gives an accomplished performance, as do several others. I liked, in particular, Clive Merrison as Cardinal Pialli, the Pope's private secretary. The trouble is the play and, even more so, the lines. The Banco Ambrosiano and the Calvi scandal (the man who was found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge) are in the background. So are third world dictators, the CIA, drug-running, the Red Brigades, Italian politics and corruption in general. The plot, such as it is, is that the Pope declares that drugs and contraceptives should be legalised and made available free of charge. As an example of the lines, we have 'Pope sanctions dope' and 'Pope no longer firm on condoms'. In a bow to the Italian fashion industry, the Pope introduces 'the poverty look'. Andy de la Tour, who is responsible for the script, writes in a programme note that he worked from a literal English translation and cut out many of the Italian references on the ground that they would be too obscure for an English audience. Poor Dario Fo: the English never did understand Italian style. Comedy Theatre, London SW1. (071) 867 1045</p>

It is  not official yet, but it is no secret that the [Belgian] F-16's  cannot take part in the [possible NATO] operations because they  are not fitted with the necessary equipment. However, the  Netherlands' F- 16's are operational should air raids be  decided. Christophe Deborsu has investigated this issue.    [Begin recording] [Deborsu] Our F-16's were not involved in  the Gulf war and they also will not be used in Bosnia. The F-16  is an excellent aircraft, but the Belgian Air Force has not had  the [financial] means in 15 years to outfit it with proper  components. Freddy van de Weghe, spokesman for Air Force  foreign operations, explains why:    [Van de Weghe] Our F-16's are not yet fitted with certain  devices -- although they will be next year through the 1995  investment project -- in particular, with an electronic  countermeasure system, which therefore makes them more  vulnerable to certain types of antiaircraft weapons than other  planes which are fitted with that system and which could be used  in air raids.    [Deborsu] Next year, our F-16's will finally be fitted with  a  so-called passive electronic countermeasure system. This device  makes it possible for the pilot to know if an enemy radar has  locked onto him. Thus, the pilot knows in advance if he is a  target and, therefore, has some time to try to escape the enemy  missiles. On the other hand, the Belgian Air Force cannot  afford to purchase an "active" countermeasure system, i.e., a  system that not only detects enemy radar but also jams it. The  Netherlanders have electronic systems -- active and passive --  on their own F- 16's.    Another problem is that the Belgian Air Force jets are not  equipped with laser components. In order to target Serbian  artillery positions with precision, without causing harm to the  surroundings, the laser guidance system is by far the best  solution.    As a consequence, NATO will use, if necesary, aircraft  better  equipped than ours. But the lack of those electronic systems  should not be criticized overly. Indeed, according to  Beauvechain Air Force base, our pilots often beat foreign pilots  who fly better-equipped planes during training sessions. The  reason for this is easy to understand: The Belgian pilots have  learned to make the best use of the limited equipment they have  while foreign pilots are at a loss as soon as one of their  gadgets breaks down.

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / International Company News: Theme park closure talk dismissed by Disney MR Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, the US entertainment and leisure group, has dismissed as 'ridiculous' speculation that EuroDisneyland, the French theme park, may be forced to close because of financial problems. Euro Disney, the park's operator, which is 49 per cent-owned by Disney, is in severe financial difficulty. It is negotiating with banks to restructure its finances, and is dependent on its US parent company for financial support until those discussions are completed. Mr Eisner, speaking in an interview with Variety, the US entertainment magazine, said EuroDisneyland, the most expensive leisure attraction ever built in Europe, had been 'monumentally successful with the consumer' since its opening in April last year. He denied press speculation that the group was considering either closing EuroDisneyland, or moth-balling the park during the slack winter season. Mr Eisner said Euro Disney's losses - which reached FFr1.08bn (Dollars 183m) in its last financial year and are expected to rise to FFr2bn this year - were not 'a tremendous loss' to the Disney group. 'We'd do it all over again,' he said. However, the Disney chairman's comments failed to calm investors' nerves. Euro Disney's share price slipped from FFr57 to FFr56.80 yesterday, having already fallen sharply from FFr65.25 at the start of the week. EuroDisneyland has been beset by problems ever since its opening. It attracted more than 11m visitors in its first year - becoming the second most popular attraction in France after Notre Dame cathedral - but has fallen well below target in terms of merchandise sales, catering revenue and hotel occupancy. These problems have been aggravated by the burden of servicing Euro Disney's debt, which now stands at more than FFr21bn. Because of this, Euro Disney has been left with serious cash flow difficulties. The group last month confirmed it had been forced to delay plans to build a second theme park and to ask Disney for support while it tried to restructure its finances.</p>

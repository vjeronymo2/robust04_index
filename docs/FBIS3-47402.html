			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "A Weak Yen Gives Export Industries </F> Breathing Space"]    [Text] The exchange rate of the yen against the dollar,  which hit a record low of 100 yen per dollar last August, has  maintained a level of 113 yen per dollar from the beginning of  this year. The automobile, household electrical appliance, and  steel industries, which suffered a heavy blow from the drastic  appreciation of the yen, see the weakness of the yen as  temporary, providing them some breathing space. Nonetheless,  they show no signs of changing their restructuring plans to  streamline their businesses, cut their employees, or increase  their overseas production.  <H5>  Automobiles </H5>   The prevailing view in the automobile industry is that "even  though the yen cannot be considered weak in terms of its current  rate of exchange with the dollar, the exchange rate is working  favorably for us" (Muneo Munekuni, vice president of Honda Motor  Company).    The automobile industry is strongly hoping for a return to  the level of 120 yen per dollar. From mid-December last year,  when the exchange rate fell to 110 yen per dollar, Toyota Motor  Corporation and Nissan Motor Company have announced their plans  to raise the prices of their cars in the American market after  suffering a fall in their export earnings.    The trend of a weak yen, although small in scale, is working  favorably for the management of each automaker. Tatsuro Toyoda,  president of Toyota Motor Corporation, says: "With the trend of  a weak yen appearing, conditions are being created in which we  can restore our business performance."    Each automaker has compiled its budget in anticipation that  the yen will continue to appreciate against the dollar during  the latter half of fiscal year 1993. While Toyota Motor  Corporation has anticipated an exchange rate of 110 yen per  dollar, Nissan Motor Company anticipates 105, while Mazda Motor  Corporation foresees 108. For every unit the yen depreciates, it  is possible for each automaker to reap earnings of 3-10 billion  yen.    Whenever the yen has appreciated in the past, each automaker  has overcome difficulties resulting from the appreciation by  simply reducing exports and increasing overseas production. If  the automakers stop exporting cars amid a decline in domestic  production, employee redundancy and a surplus of production  equipment will result.  <H5>  Household Electrical Appliances </H5>   Toshiba Corporation, which loses about 4-4.5 billion yen for  each yen unit of appreciation, welcomes the weak yen, saying:  "We feel helped a bit by the weak yen. The weak yen will  increase our ordinary income. Our profits are expected to  exceed our losses due to the difference in the quotations in our  exchange contracts." Many household electric appliance  manufacturers have compiled their respective budgets in  anticipation that the dollar-yen exchange rate will continue to  hover around 105 yen per dollar during the later half of this  year.    Sony Corporation, meanwhile, is a bit pessimistic. The major  consumer electronics maker says: "We have suffered a great loss  from differences in quotations because we have concluded  exchange contracts at about 108 yen per dollar. The current  weakness of the yen will not generate an immediate effect of  improving our performance."    President Takashi Kitaoka of Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd. said:  "We expect that the weak yen will put an end to our sluggish  exports; however, we are not supposed to fully boost exports  because the latest appreciation of the yen was triggered by the  growth of the nation's trade surplus."  <H5>  Steel </H5>   The current weakness of the yen is giving breathing space to  seamless pipe makers in the steel industry. The drastic  appreciation of the yen is expected to cause a loss of more than  10 billion yen for each seamless pipe maker in its 1994  January-March settlement of account. Therefore, seamless pipe  makers have begun studying the possibility of lowering  production while continuing their efforts to cut costs. An  executive of NKK [Nippon Kokan Limited] Corporation says: "If  the exchange rate between the yen and the dollar stands at 120  yen per dollar, we can manage to withstand international  competition. The yen has depreciated by 10 units from the time  its appreciation peaked last year, and this will help us reap 3  billion yen in profits. We hope the yen will depreciate a  little more."  <H5>  Chemicals, Textiles </H5>   Chemical and textile industries are proceeding with their  plans to move their production overseas. Asahi Chemical  Industry Company, for example, is now promoting a project in  China to produce nylon material, and is forging a partnership  with Du Pont in the United States to produce chemical products  in Southeast Asia. Reiichi Yumikura, president of Asahi  Chemical Industry Company, says definitively: "A small  depreciation of the yen cannot lead to a change in our business  strategy." Now that Japan is committed to lowering tariffs on  imported chemical products following the conclusion of the  Uruguay Round (the multilateral trade negotiations of GATT),  companies in the chemical industry find themselves in a  situation where they cannot back away from plans to streamline  their businesses and bolster their competitiveness.</p>

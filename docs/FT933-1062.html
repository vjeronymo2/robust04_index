			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / International Company News: Credit Local reports 5% rise to FFr698m CREDIT Local de France, the French bank which earlier this year staged a share sale on the Paris stock market, yesterday announced a 5.1 per cent increase in net profits to FFr698m (Dollars 122.5m) for the first half of 1993, compared with the same 1992 period. The French banking industry has suffered in recent months from the impact of the recession on demand for credit and on property prices. However, Credit Local, a specialist bank which provides loans to local authorities, has been spared many of the problems that have affected its competitors in retail banking. Mr Pierre Richard, chairman, described the group's first-half performance as 'very satisfactory'. He anticipated continued growth in the second half, with net profits increasing by around 7 per cent to between FFr1.26bn and FFr1.28bn for the full financial year. Credit Local saw net banking income rise by 6.8 per cent to FFr1.66bn at the interim stage this year, from FFr1.55bn in the first half of last year. Operating profits increased by 2.4 per cent to FFr1.07bn from FFr1.05bn, and exceptional charges were FFr10.2bn, against FFr4.2bn in the previous interim period.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Lantsman report under the "The Whites" rubric: </F> "People's Workers' Union Wants To Erect an `Ideological Core' in  Russia. For Starters, it Proposes That Market Be Crossed With  Collectivism"]    [Text] The ideological and moral principles of the White  movement are still topical in present-day Russia, leaders of the  People's Workers' Union of Russian Solidarists [NTS] claim.  Despite the collapse of communism and the Soviet power, the  oldest anti-Soviet organization does not consider its historic  mission played out. At a press conference held at the  Revolution Museum yesterday, NTS leaders unveiled their program  for erecting Russia's "new ideological core."    The victory of the Reds in the four-year Civil War  undoubtedly amounted to a national catastrophe that has brought  about the corruption of morals and the social enslavement of  Russian citizens, Dmitriy Khanov, NTS activist, said. Having  long predicted an end to the Soviet system, the solidarists did  not expect that the revival would take so long to complete. The  ideology to heal the nation and create a new Russian community  should be a theory of solidarism synthesizing a liberal market  economy, collective traditions, and statehood, the NTS believes.    An integral part of the overall national revival are  geopolitical efforts to bring the nation to a healthy state.  The RSFSR's administrative borders inherited from Bolshevism  cannot be seen as enduring boundaries of the Russian state, the  chairman of the NTS executive bureau thinks. Nonetheless, the  future merger of historical Russian lands, NTS leaders believe,  will proceed peacefully through the natural attraction of a  number of republics to each other. Meanwhile, the issue of  Crimea, where a referendum has already been held, should be a  subject of international talks. In the solidarists' view, the  Russian leadership should courageously and openly announce its  historical responsibility for the future of the Crimean  peninsula. The Russian leadership, however, can acquire the  moral right to solve territorial disputes only after it gets rid  of the Soviet heritage.    The NTS, which has not been encumbered with a totalitarian  heritage, is already preparing the ground for future talks.  "The NTS congratulates you on the results of the referendum,"  said a leaflet distributed by solidarists in Sevastopol.  "Crimea was the last corner of Russian land that was defended  from the Bolsheviks by Vrangel's White Army. Your will, your  craving for Russia is a bone in the throat of [Ukrainian]  independence-seekers."</p>

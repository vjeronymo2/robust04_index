"We achieved all objectives," said Russian team leader  Nikita  Smidovitch, who told reporters his 10-day mission to Iraq had  been "successful."    Smidovitch was inspecting Iraq's military arsenal under UN  Security Council Gulf war ceasefire resolutions.    "The Iraqis had a forthcoming attitude," Smidovitch said.  "Iraq has promised to cooperate and said they will do what they  can to shorten the period" needed to set the monitoring process  in motion.    He was to leave Manama, the United Nations' base for Iraqi  missions, late Sunday.    The long-term monitoring of the Iraqi arms program is  critcial to Baghdad's hopes for an end to the embargo imposed  after the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. By accepting  Security Council Resolution 715, Iraq hopes to at least have UN  sanctions on its oil exports lifted.    Asked how many missions were still needed before long-term  monitoring could begin, Smidovitch replied? "Quite frankly, it  will take time. We need more activities to set up the  monitoring process."    The surveillance program is the next UN step following the  destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction after the Gulf  war of January-February 1991.    Iraq agreed to the surveillance in November after rejecting  it for three years and has been lobbying hard for an end to the  embargo.    On Wednesday, the UN's deputy disarmament chief said  long-term monitoring of Baghdad's weapons program was still some  way off despite Iraq's efforts to have sanctions lifted.    American Charles Duelfer, deputy head of the UN Special  Commission (UNSCOM) disarming Iraq under the Gulf war ceasefire  resolutions, spent five days in Iraq preparing a visit there  this week by his boss Rolf Ekeus.    Ekeus is due to arrive in Baghdad on Tuesday to discuss  monitoring, but has said he is unlikely to recommend a lifting  of sanctions before the end of the year.</p>

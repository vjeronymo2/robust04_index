This rule is intended to have preemptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations, or policies which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of its provisions all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the Food Stamp Program the administrative procedures are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For program benefit recipients_state administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(10) and 7 CFR 273.15;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities) or part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) for retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 278.8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551.

L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, September 19, 1980). The Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), has certified that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The changes would affect food stamp applicants and recipients and State and local agencies which administer the Food Stamp Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule does not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act Amendments of 1991 (Pub.

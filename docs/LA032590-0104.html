			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DECLARATION' CAUSES OUTPOURING OF DEEPLY DIVIDED OPINIONS  </P> <P> I am appalled at what your paper thinks is news. The Times once again has shown  its views as being non-traditional, liberal, immoral and biased.  </P> <P> The article contains the story of a woman who was supposedly "born again," and  after feeling sexual desires for another woman, rejects her faith and follows  after her own lusts by giving into the lie that homosexuality is an acceptable  alternative lifestyle.  </P> <P> STEVEN J.

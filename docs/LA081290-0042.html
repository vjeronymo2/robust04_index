			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIKING / LOS PADRES NATIONAL FOREST: LOS PADRES LAND MAY BE RENAMED TO HONOR  CHUMASH INDIAN GROUP  </P> <P> The Chumash were the largest tribal group in California at the time of explorer  Juan Cabrillo's arrival in 1542. Occupying the coastal and inland territory  from Malibu to San Luis Obispo, the Chumash enjoyed the bounty of both land and  sea. They had a complex village and religious life, as well as a practical and  mystical astronomy.  </P> <P> A small portion of the Chumash's ancestral land is currently proposed for  designation as a wilderness area within Los Padres National Forest. Congress  approved HR 1473, sponsored by Rep. Robert Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), which would  preserve about 36,000 acres of pine forest and juniper woodland, grasslands and  badlands.  </P> <P> Two differing bills in the Senate -- S-1625 (sponsored by Alan Cranston) and  S-2784 (sponsored by Pete Wilson) -- would also set aside a Chumash Wilderness  of this or, in the case of Cranston's bill, greater size.  </P> <P> As the bill makes its way through various legislative committees, the Chumash  Wilderness boundaries are sure to be adjusted by the political process. If  action is not taken by September, when legislators adjourn, the bill will die  and likely be reintroduced in the next Congress.  </P> <P> One thing conservationists and politicos alike can agree upon: The name Chumash  Wilderness will be an improvement over "Sawmill-Badlands Further Planning Area  No. 134," as the U.S. Forest Service calls this land.  </P> <P> It's quite a land to hike, to behold. Although just 75 miles northwest of Los  Angeles, it seems much, much farther from the metropolis. After a day of hiking  across the broad shoulders of Mt. Pinos, highest peak in Los Padres National  Forest, you start to get some inkling of why the mountain was so sacred to the  Chumash.  </P> <P> "It's time we honor the Chumash," said Sally Reid, a Sierra Club activist who  has been leading the charge for wilderness designation. "This land, highest in  Los Padres National Forest, center of the Chumash universe, is very special."  </P> <P> Reid is certain the land is of wilderness quality. "It has high mountains with  clear-day views from the High Sierra to the Pacific, it has examples of  ecosystems from alpine down to high desert, as well as remarkable badlands  unlike any in Southern California."  </P> <P> The proposed wilderness has much diversity. A cool pine-and-fir forest covers  Mt. Pinos and a couple of its more than 8,000-foot neighbors. Mt. Pinos is a  great place to cross-country ski during winter and to hike during the rest of  the year.  </P> <P> Another highlight is Quatal Canyon, a kind of Bryce Canyon-in-miniature,  complete with dramatic pinnacles and weird, eroded rock formations. Scientists  are fascinated by the canyon because it is rich in vertebrate fossils,  particularly from the Miocene Epoch (12 to 16 million years ago).  </P> <P> Quatal Canyon has been proposed as a Natural National Landmark, a federal  designation by the Secretary of Interior that recognizes outstanding examples  of ecology or geology and helps to preserve them.  </P> <P> Another area of interest to scientists is San Emigdio Mesa, a large, flat  alluvial fan forested with pinyon pine and dwarf oak. The 1,200 acres of pinyon  pine woodland is by far the most extensive of its kind in Southern California,  and recalls some of the mesas of the Great Basin.  </P> <P> For the hiker, the new Chumash Wilderness offers two major trails. One is the  popular six-mile, roller-coaster-like path between Mt. Pinos and Cerro Noroeste  (Mt. Abel). This trail offers a fine trek over sub-alpine slopes, the highest  in Los Padres National Forest.  </P> <P> Another possibility is a five- or six-mile round-trip hike from Quatal Canyon  Road to Quatal Canyon for a close-up view of the badlands. This is a good hike  in cooler months, when snow covers the nearby high peaks.  </P> <P> A more difficult trail, today's hike begins in a high pine forest but passes  through other ecosystems -- pinyon-juniper woodland, chaparral and grassland --  as it descends from Mt. Abel to Toad Spring Camp. It's a great introduction to  the lay of the land, a fine overview of the proposed Chumash Wilderness.  </P> <P> One word of warning: The second half of this hike uses Toad Spring Trail,  which, much to the consternation of conservationists, the Forest Service  designated in 1976 as a motorcycle route. Because of current drought and fire  danger, the Forest Service has closed the Toad Spring Trail to motorcycles, but  not to hikers.  </P> <P> Wilderness status for this area means that Toad Spring Trail would be closed to  motorcycles and revived as the footpath it was prior to 1976. Though it's not a  particularly popular motorcycle trail, and it's currently closed to such use,  the concerned hiker may wish to contact the Mt. Pinos Ranger District for the  latest trail update.  </P> <P> Directions to trailhead: This trip requires a car shuttle. Hikers will want to  depart from the Mt. Abel trailhead and arrive at the Toad Spring Campground  trailhead.  </P> <P> From Interstate 5 in Frazier Park, exit on Frazier Mountain Park Road and head  west. The road, which becomes Cuddy Valley Road, continues to a Y-junction. The  left fork leads to Mt. Pinos, but you stay right and join Mil Potrero Road.  </P> <P> Drive 8 1/2 miles to Cerro Noroeste Road and turn left. Proceed seven miles to  the signed trailhead, half a mile below the summit of Mt. Cerro Noroeste (Mt.  Abel). Parking is not plentiful right at the trailhead, so park in a safe  manner along the road.  </P> <P> From the Cerro Noroeste Road/Mil Potrero Road junction, continue right (west)  on the latter road, which, to make matters confusing, takes on the name Cerro  Noroeste Road. Travel a mile to the signed turnoff for Toad Spring Campground,  turning left on Forest Road 9N09, continuing three-tenths of a mile to the  camp, then another four-tenths of a mile to the unsigned trailhead on the left  (south) side of the road.  </P> <P> The hike: Leaving signed Mt. Abel trailhead, the path descends very steeply for  half a mile down a draw into a forested hollow. Here there's a signed junction,  with (incorrect) mileages for the trail leading left (southeast) to Mt. Pinos.  </P> <P> Bear right on unsigned Mesa Spring Trail and descend past huge and widely  spaced ponderosa pine. Scattered among the pines are silver fir, some of which  are large enough and pretty enough to be the White House Christmas tree.  </P> <P> After a mile you'll pass through a gate (the Forest Service allows some cattle  grazing on this land). The path descends through a mixed transition forest of  pine and oak. The area has unusual botany. Inhabitants of dry lands -- coffee  berry and manzanita and scrub oak -- mingle with sub-alpine species: pine, fir  and snow plant.  </P> <P> The path drops a couple more miles through pinyon pine country to Mesa Spring  Camp, at an elevation of about 6,000 feet. It's a simple trail camp with picnic  tables and water. A hundred yards from camp is a huge watering trough used by  bovine forest visitors.  </P> <P> Mesa Spring, Mesa Spring Camp and Mesa Spring Trail are named for San Emigdio  Mesa, the pinyon pine-covered territory visible as the path leaves camp. Stay  right at an unsigned trail junction just below camp and continue walking for a  couple miles on a flatland between the mesa on your left and the tall shoulder  of Mt. Cerro Noroeste on your right.  </P> <P> At a (poorly) signed trail junction, you'll join Forest Service Trail 22W01,  Toad Spring Trail, which leads northward 3 1/4 miles to Quatal Canyon Road.  </P> <P> The trail climbs and dips over pinyon pine- and juniper-dotted slopes. There  are grand views west and south over the proposed Chumash Wilderness and of the  Cuyama Badlands to the northwest. Best view of all is the view right below of  Quatal Canyon. The pinnacle rock formations resemble those in southwest Utah.  </P> <P> Toad Spring Trail, seriously eroded by motorcycles in some places albeit  passable, skirts the rim of Quatal Canyon. The last mile of the trail marches  steeply up and down some minor hills before reaching its terminus (or  trailhead, depending on how you look at it) at Quatal Canyon Road.  </P></p>

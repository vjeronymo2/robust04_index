"The last C-5 aircraft left Mogadishu at 9:13 A.M. local  time  en route to the U.S.," Perry said at a Pentagon press briefing.    General Thomas Montgomery, the commander of the American  military forces in Somalia, then departed by helicopter and he  will be back at Andrews Air Force Base on Monday, Perry said.    A welcome home ceremony will be held for Thomas and about 25  of his staff at Andrews Air Force Base on Monday.    "The return of General Montgomery marks the completion of  the  withdrawal and the exit of U.S. forces peacekeeping duties in  Somalia," a Pentagon spokesman said.    About 50 American Marines were left in Somalia to guard the  12 diplomats at the U.S. Liaison Office, and about 13 American  military men remain at the U.N. forces' headquarters.</p>

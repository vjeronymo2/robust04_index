			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Major pressed on ministers' role Mr John Major, the prime minister, has been asked by Lord Justice Scott to give his views about ministerial responsibility in the dissemination of intelligence. He is being pressed to state whether he subscribes to a set of guidance notes on ministerial accountability which the judge is using as a working tool to test some of the evidence which he has heard from Whitehall officials and ministers. The notes are in the form of a draft document entitled Ministerial Accountability for the Failure to Ensure the Proper Dissemination of Relevant Intelligence. The document puts the onus of responsibility on individual ministers for ensuring that intelligence is efficiently gathered and disseminated. The document states: 'Accountability requires that a failure in the organisation and structure which results in a failure by the government to carry out its policies is a matter for which the relevant minister must answer. 'Answerability requires not only accountability in parliament after the event; it may require the minister to take an active interest in the organisation and structure of his department.' It goes on to state that specifically 'where a minister has the responsibility for taking decisions in a sensitive area and knows of the sensitivity of the decisions which he is taking,' he has the duty personally to assure himself that he is adequately briefed. An official with the Scott inquiry last night described the guidance notes as a 'consultation document' which did not necessarily represent the views which the judge may express in his final report. The document draws on the procedures for ministers set out by the head of the civil service and which are supposed to circulate within Whitehall. It has been alleged that documents made available to the Scott inquiry show lack of co-ordination and in some cases misuse of intelligence data by officials and ministers for apparently political ends. Mr Major is due to appear at the Scott inquiry hearing on Monday. He has already submitted written evidence.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WIDOW'S NIGHTMARE;  </P> <P> MAN ONCE CONVICTED IN HER HUSBAND'S DEATH FILES $500,000 SUIT AGAINST HER  </P> <P> Ruth Langlos has battled a reluctant bureaucracy, tangled with an unpredictable  legal system and endured some bitter surprises ever since her husband's body  was found in a blood-spattered Downey office in 1976.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County coroner's office had determined that John T. Langlos, a  52-year-old clinical psychologist, had died of a heart attack. But his widow  waged a stubborn, six-year campaign to persuade authorities that, in fact, he  was a murder victim.  </P> <P> Her persistence was rewarded when Eugene Clarence Hartman was convicted in 1984  of second-degree murder and sentenced to state prison. That triumph, however,  was short-lived when Hartman was freed in 1985 because of a legal technicality.  </P> <P> For Langlos, it was a painful conclusion, but it appeared her odyssey was over.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Back in Court  </P> <P> Now, four years later, the 69-year-old Langlos finds herself back in court --  this time as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the very man once convicted of  killing her husband.  </P> <P> "I am now the accused, and my husband was taken from me," an anguished Langlos  said from her Huntington Beach home. "This just shows that the wheels of  justice can backfire, and I didn't think that could happen in this country."  </P> <P> Langlos, who underwent triple-bypass heart surgery last spring, said she was  stunned several weeks ago when she received a court summons informing her that  Hartman was suing for "malicious prosecution" and seeking $500,000 from her.  </P> <P> "It was devastating. I just could not believe he wanted a half-million dollars  from me," Langlos said. "I was shocked. It brought everything back, all the  memories."  </P> <P> Those nightmarish memories stretch back to Feb. 2, 1976, when her husband's  body was discovered wedged partly beneath an office desk. There was a gash in  his head. Three buttons were torn from his shirt and his wallet and money clip  were missing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cashed a Check  </P> <P> A few days later, Hartman, a psychologist who occasionally worked with Langlos  at the clinic, was arrested by Oakland police after he cashed a check drawn on  Langlos' account and used Langlos' credit card to buy a watch and airline  tickets.  </P> <P> Originally charged with murder, Hartman, 61, was released after a deputy  medical examiner ruled that Langlos had died of natural causes. Authorities  theorized that Langlos had suffered heart failure and fell, striking his head  on his desk, and that Hartman had discovered and looted the body. Hartman was  freed after serving 36 days in jail.  </P> <P> Still, Ruth Langlos insisted that her husband had been murdered and embarked on  her quest to prove county officials wrong. She spent $50,000 for independent  autopsies that challenged the original county findings. But then-Coroner Thomas  Noguchi refused to change the death certificate -- a required step before new  murder charges could be filed against Hartman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coroner's Jury Conclusion  </P> <P> Undaunted, Langlos took her case to a coroner's jury, which concluded in May,  1982, that her husband had died of "undetermined causes . . . at the hands of  another." Less than a year later, the district attorney's office filed a new  murder charge against Hartman, and in 1984, he was convicted of murdering John  Langlos.  </P> <P> In 1985, the state Court of Appeal overturned Hartman's conviction, ruling that  he was denied due process because the lengthy delay between Langlos' death and  the trial resulted in a loss of evidence. When the state Supreme Court later  that year declined to consider a prosecution appeal, Hartman was permanently  free.  </P> <P> Hartman, who now lives in Sacramento, told The Times that he was the target of  a politically motivated prosecution and filed his lawsuit to underscore his  innocence of the murder charge.  </P> <P> "I think the case was so bizarre and there was so much media value and Mrs.  Langlos kept pushing (for a conviction), that put me at a disadvantage,"  Hartman said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Whereabouts Unknown  </P> <P> Although he filed the lawsuit in January, 1987, Hartman said he only notified  Langlos this month because he could not determine where she lived until  recently -- a fact that terrifies Langlos.  </P> <P> "I thought now I can go on with my life, but I can't," she said. "He's stopped  that, and now he knows where I am."  </P> <P> Hartman said Thursday he has no intention of harming Langlos, although he  blames her for his conviction. In his lawsuit, he also named Gov. George  Deukmejian, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, then-Dist. Atty. Robert H.  Philibosian and several state and county officials as defendants and accused  them of pursuing the case against him merely to "gain political advantage and  to aid Ruth Langlos's campaign of harassment."  </P> <P> In addition to the $500,000 claim against Langlos, Hartman is seeking $2  million from the county and $500,000 from the state.  </P> <P> But Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert B. Lopez on Thursday dismissed the  state defendants from the case, ruling that as public officials they are immune  from such civil lawsuits. The judge had earlier removed Philibosian and the  county as defendants for the same reason.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling Norris, who filed the original case  against Hartman, said the real victim remains Ruth Langlos.  </P> <P> "I think it's atrocious. I don't think there is any merit to the lawsuit at  all," Norris said. "The tragedy is that she has to respond and retain a lawyer.  . . . It's a real system of injustices that needs to be addressed."  </P> <P> Harry Simon, an attorney with the Senior Citizens Legal Advocacy Program of the  Legal Aid Society of Orange County, agreed and said his office has been asked  to represent Langlos. "Mrs. Langlos has been through this for 13 long years,"  Simon said, "and it just seems to never end."  </P></p>

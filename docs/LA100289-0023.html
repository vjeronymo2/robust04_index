			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GILBERT DOWNS JARRYD TO WIN FIFTH TITLE  </P> <P> Third-seeded Brad Gilbert won his fifth singles title of the year before  hometown fans by defeating unseeded Anders Jarryd of Sweden, 7-5, 6-2, in the  $425,000 Volvo tennis tournament in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Gilbert, of Piedmont, Calif., used a powerful serve, a pinpoint forehand and  change of pace to beat Jarryd for the second time in as many weeks. Gilbert  eliminated him at a tournament in Los Angeles last week.  </P> <P> "My forehand was good but the key was that I played very aggressively in the  big points," Gilbert said. "I got into the net and took some chances."  </P> <P> Jarryd was pleased with his week's performance but remained puzzled on how to  beat the world's No. 6 player.  </P> <P> "I need to find the shot to beat him," Jarryd said. "He's so fast and he's  always coming up with good passing shots. There are only a couple of guys who  can do that. He returns well, too."  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl, a master on the clay courts of France, played so well that even he  was satisfied.  </P> <P> But his 6-2, 6-2 victory over Emilio Sanchez of Spain, also reminded Lendl of  his French Open frustration this year.  </P> <P> "I wish I played like this at Roland Garros, I would have won that tournament,"  said Lendl, who lost in Paris to eventual French Open champion Michael Chang.  "When you go out and hit the ball this well in a final, it's a nice feeling."  </P> <P> The top-seeded Lendl had no trouble in the $250,000 tournament at Bordeaux,  France. He broke Sanchez twice in the first set, coming up with a big serve and  powerful forehands to force the pace.  </P> <P> "Ivan played too good," said Sanchez, seeded second. "He hit too hard the whole  match. His forehand was too good in the first set so, I tried to play his  backhand."  </P> <P> That tactic failed and Lendl easily won the second set, finishing the match in  1 hour 35 minutes.  </P> <P> "I hit the ball today better than at Flushing Meadow," Lendl said, referring to  the U.S. Open, where he lost to Boris Becker in the final. "It should translate  into something good."  </P> <P> This victory, which gave him his eighth tournament title of the year, was worth  $45,000 and improved his year's earnings to more than $1.1 million, second only  to Becker of West Germany.  </P> <P> Since losing in the fourth round to Chang at the French Open in June, Lendl has  lost only three times, to Becker at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, and last week  to Ecuador's Andres Gomez, in Lendl's first match on clay courts since the  French Open.  </P> <P> Guillermo Perez-Roldan of Argentina needed a little less than two hours to  defeat Paolo Cane of Italy, 6-1, 6-4, in the final of a $123,400 clay-court  tournament at Palermo, Italy.  </P> <P> John Lloyd rallied from a 5-3 deficit in the third set to defeat Bob Lutz, 4-6,  6-1, 7-5, in the final of a $40,000 masters tournament in San Antonio.  </P></p>

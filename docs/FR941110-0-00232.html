			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to commenters, we are requiring that States provide an opportunity for informal dispute resolution whereby providers dissatisfied with survey findings can request a review of the deficiencies upon receipt of the official HCFA&hyph;2567. Dispute resolution augments the various other opportunities facilities have during and after the survey to challenge the surveyors' findings, including during the survey, at the exit conference, while awaiting receipt of the official deficiency statement, through dialogue with State and regional officials, and upon receipt of the official statement of deficiencies. The process we are requiring generally reflects current practice and guidance we have consistently given States, except that here it is formally adopted as a rule. While we believe that many formal hearings will be avoided by utilizing dispute resolution, the regulations provide facilities with the opportunity to appeal certifications of noncompliance leading to an enforcement remedy, and specify the formal administrative and judicial review processes. However, because the Act mandates that enforcement systems minimize the time between identification of violations and the imposition of remedies, we are not requiring that hearings be held before the effective date of the enforcement action, except in the case of civil money penalties. Facilities facing civil money penalties may also appeal the level of noncompliance but only where a successful challenge would affect the amount of the civil money penalty that HCFA or the State could collect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the variety of alternative remedies now available, we believe termination will be the enforcement response to the most serious noncompliance, and it can be avoided by facilities that are willing and able to effectively allocate their resources to ensure substantial compliance. To the extent that those marginal facilities that are most at risk from these provisions are able to come into substantial compliance, there may even be a reduction in the frequency of enforcement actions. Of course, facilities will ordinarily incur some costs associated with compliance efforts. Those costs could be significant if they necessitate substantial staffing increases or alterations to a physical plant. Our elimination of FFP after termination of the provider agreement during the administrative hearing process provides an incentive for facilities to comply promptly with enforcement actions, but could also add to the impact on facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Effect on State Survey Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The impact that this final rule will have on State survey agencies' surveys must be viewed in the context of other ongoing activities related to survey and certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 1, 1986, HCFA implemented its new long term care outcome-oriented survey process (formerly called PACs: Patient Care and Services Survey Process). This system shifted the emphasis away from the facility's capacity to provide adequate care to the facility's success in providing such care. On October 1, 1990, HCFA implemented a revised outcome-oriented survey process that includes the OBRA provision of resident rights review. Because the effective date of this rule is July 1, 1995, training courses can be designed and offered timely to provide the State agency surveyors and other staff with information on assessing the seriousness of deficiencies. The knowledge they gain in applying Federal survey requirements in an accurate, consistent, and time efficient manner, should lead to improved surveys at no increase in costs. We do not expect that assessing the seriousness of the deficiencies will add to the time needed to conduct a survey since this process is one that surveyors have essentially engaged in for years. We do not expect these regulations to necessitate greater expenditures on the part of State survey agencies; however, they probably will result in a reallocation of resources, particularly geared to more intensive monitoring of marginal facilities. Further, these regulatory changes will contribute to a shift toward more enforcement-oriented roles for State survey agencies and surveyors. Although States will have an expanded role and increased responsibility as a result of this final rule, they will also be given increased flexibility in carrying out their responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We expect some incremental costs to facilities and to States as a result of facility appeals of termination and alternative remedies. Although we have no experience on which to predict increases in volume or cost, we believe that the increase will be offset somewhat as some hearings will be avoided as a result of dispute resolution. The appeals process has been thoroughly explained elsewhere in this preamble. The responses to comments illustrate the thoughtful approach taken, with a view to minimizing burden in implementing statutory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Effect on Residents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We expect this final rule to result in improved quality of life and care for residents of long term care facilities. Because of the various enforcement tools provided by this regulation, facilities will have more of an incentive to remain in compliance with participation requirements. This sustained compliance will provide residents with consistent, high quality health care. Because quality of life can be affected by a resident's sense of satisfaction with his or her environment, the quality of care received, and the extent of control over his or her life, heightened facility interest in maintaining substantial compliance should be perceived by residents and their families as improved care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While termination of SNFs and NFs could have a significant impact on residents, especially those living in rural areas, this final rule provides a variety of alternatives to termination for those facilities that are able to come into compliance. To the extent that termination occurs less frequently, there would be less disruption to nursing home residents and ensured access to needed services. In those cases in which termination becomes necessary, the termination is for the ultimate benefit of the residents to assure that they receive the quality care to which they are entitled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Information Collection Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 4204(b) and 4214(d) of OBRA '87 provide a waiver of Office of Management and Budget review of information collection requirements for the purpose of implementing the nursing home reform amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

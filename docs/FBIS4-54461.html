			<p>BFN     [Text] The Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP] calls on the  leader of Hungarian Television to ensure the cleanness of  political programs in the remaining part of the election  campaign and to suspend from their jobs the editors of the  "Newsreel" and "Panorama" programs. Imre Szekeres, executive  deputy chairman of the HSP, notes in a letter addressed to TV  Deputy Chairman Gabor Nahlik that the television documentary and  news programs contain false allegations that fulfill the  conditions for defamation and public slander. The HSP demands  that the editors responsible for the programs apologize publicly  to the party and the slandered politicians, and that Deputy  Chairman Gabor Nahlik apologize for the false accusations by 2  May. The HSP is asking the National Election Committee to take  a stance in connection with Hungarian Television's political  programs; if no change occurs the party will appeal to the  supreme state prosecutor.</p>

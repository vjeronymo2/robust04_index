			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Machine tool makers urge subsidy for workers laid off Europe's machine tool makers want the European Commission to introduce a scheme that would allow them to keep skilled workers on the payroll in recessions and re-employ them when recovery starts. The plea follows the worst recession in the history of Europe's machine tool industry, which accounts for 41 per cent of world production. Employment in Europe has dropped from 200,000 in 1990 to 132,000 this year. At a meeting last week with Mr Alexander Schaub, deputy director of the commission's industry affairs directorate, the European machine tool umbrella body Cecimo asked for a scheme similar to one introduced recently in Japan. Under this, the Japanese government pays up to three-quarters of the wages of workers when a company is obliged to cease production temporarily. The subsidy can last for up to one year. Mr Pierluigi Streparava, president of Brussels-based Cecimo, said in a recession the industry was forced to shed highly-skilled workers - needed to develop and sell sophisticated machinery. 'Later, you need them back, but the workers have most probably found a job elsewhere,' he said. 'So you have to wait two to three years before you can train someone else to the same level.' The plea is one of a number of proposals from Cecimo, which has 12 member countries in western Europe. They complement a recent commission communication on strengthening competitiveness in the European mechanical engineering industry, which was presented to industry ministers last month. Among other proposals from Cecimo are a research and development programme for manufacturing technology that would combine the relevant projects in the European Union-backed Esprit and Brite/Euram programmes. Cecimo says this would be easier for machine tool producers, which are mainly small and medium-sized enterprises, to enter. Cecimo described last week's talks as the most positive it had had with the Commission, which will discuss the communication in January with member states and the mechanical engineering industry. Cecimo hopes that, under the French presidency in the first half of next year, the communication could become a resolution adopted by industry ministers. Meanwhile, it says production and consumption of machine tools in Europe has stabilised this year after falls of 19 per cent and 30 per cent respectively last year, but prices and profitability were still under pressure.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Hwang brothers linked to County Hall development Hong Kong property investors Mr George Hwang and Mr Victor Hwang are in discussions which could lead to their involvement in controversial plans to turn County Hall, the former Greater London Council headquarters, into a hotel and leisure complex. The Hwang brothers, who bought Battersea Power Station last year, are talking to Mr Takashi Shirayama, the Japanese investor whose company's Pounds 60m offer for the main building in the County Hall complex, across the Thames from the Houses of Parliament, was accepted by the government two years ago. A proposal, which enjoyed cross-party support, to relocate the London School of Economics to the site was rejected. Shirayama said yesterday that redevelopment was on schedule and the company had no intention of selling its interest. Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group has a management contract to run the 600-bedroom hotel, which is expected to open early in 1997. However, the hotel will take up less than a third of the available 1.5m sq ft and Shirayama is considering proposals for the remaining space. The London Residuary Body, which has the job of disposing of former GLC property, is still looking for buyers for three other buildings on the site which total 700,000 sq ft. It was suggested yesterday that the Hwang brothers' principal interest was in the main building.</p>

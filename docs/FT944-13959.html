			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (1): Dynamism versus deadweight - There is a remarkable contradiction between the strength of the 'real' economy and the difficulties caused by political instability Italian cartoonists invariably have the sharpest eye for summing up what is going on. A recent newspaper cartoon depicted a businessman scratching his head. Behind him a smoking factory, humanised with face, arms and legs, is running at full speed. The man comments: 'If everything is going so well, why is everything going so badly?' This pinpoints a remarkable apparent contradiction between the strength of the 'real' economy and the continuing difficulties caused by political instability and the weakness of Italy's public finances: the dynamism, on the one hand, of private initiative and the resilience of the thousands of small companies that are the lifeblood of Italian industry - and, on the other, the continued deadweight of the public sector and the burden of debt that has reached 125 per cent of gross domestic product. The industrial recovery is now well under way after three bleak years. Order books are swelling, utilisation of capacity is increasing, energy consumption is up and profits are returning. The big private industrial groups such as Fiat and Pirelli, which have gone through painful and costly restructuring programmes, are signalling that the worst is over. 'The recovery is very strong and everywhere one goes there is a tremendous sense of confidence among industrialists,' says Mr Stefano Miscossi, head of research at Confindustria, the industrialists' association. He is shortly to take over the directorate of industry in the Brussels Commission. The converse of this picture is the serious weakness of the Berlusconi government and the high interest rates which are needed to attract buyers of Italian debt. Industrialists thus lack a stable political and financial environment in which to plan investments. Despite these negative considerations, Confindustria is convinced that official GDP growth projections of 2.7 per cent in 1995 are too conservative. Figures released earlier this month showed that the economy had grown 2.3 per cent during the second quarter compared with the same period last year. Industrial activity in the period to the end of July had registered 12 consecutive months of growth. It is up 6.4 per cent on July 1993. Order books initially lagged behind the growth in production but have begun to pick up more quickly. Industrial orders increased almost 16 per cent in the 12 months ending July this year. Export orders have provided the drive behind the growth in production. The export element in industrial turnover was up 12 per cent in the year to the end of July, compared with 4.2 per cent in the case of the domestic market. And although exports were undoubtedly given a big boost by the September 1992 devaluation of the lira, the exchange rate is by no means the sole explanation for the extraordinary success of Italian exports over the past two years. In this context, it is significant that Italian exports have increased at more than twice the rate of Britain's even though both countries devalued at the same time and by a similar amount. Those who gained most from the devaluation have been large-scale industries such as chemicals and steel, as well as the vehicle industry. But in general, the commerce ministry claims that Italian companies are winning orders because they have pruned their production costs and raised productivity through shedding labour and by investment in new plant. Since 1992, wages have been rising more slowly than inflation and last year in large industrial groups the rise was less than 2 per cent - half the rate of inflation. Just as importantly in ensuring costs are competitive, Italian companies are providing quality products with good customer service. This has been especially true in the highly competitive emerging market of China where Italian machine tools and engineering products have done well against tough competition. More generally, Italian companies have benefited from the strength of emerging economies in Asia and Latin America. Here too, traditional industries such as shoe-making, textiles, clothing and leather goods have done well. Without their exports, the clothing and leather goods industries would have fared far more badly in the domestic recession. Indeed, there have been cases of factories switching their export orientation from 40 per cent to 80 per cent of total production. However, the balance is beginning to be redressed. In the 12 months to July, domestic orders increased by 17.6 per cent and stronger domestic demand is clearly in evidence both for capital goods and consumer items. There are still considerable variations within individual sectors. The vehicle industry has picked up strongly, thanks in good measure to an enthusiastic response to Fiat's new Punto saloon produced at the greenfield Melfi plant in southern Italy. At the weaker end is the foodstuffs industry which remains stagnant, reflecting a combination of intense competition and cutbacks in domestic household spending. The construction sector is in worst shape. As a result of the recession and the effects of corruption scandals, the construction business and the market for construction equipment and materials has been deeply depressed. Construction activity fell by almost one third in 1993. The Berlusconi government revoked a freeze on public works contracts, imposed in late 1992 to prevent bribes, pending the framing of new tendering rules. The effects of the new government's move should begin to be felt in the final quarter. The problem areas of industry now tend to be those where the state still continues to play an important role - chemicals, defence industries, mining, steel and ship-building. ENI, the state oil concern, has being carrying out a costly restructuring of its chemicals and fertiliser operations. The main financial cost is over but rationalisation of some plant in the south still has to be carried out. Defence industries, badly affected by three years of reduced sales and high costs, look likely to be a big casualty of cuts in the 1995 budget. As much as L1,000bn has been taken out of planned spending and 1995 investments will be L3,100bn against L3,340bn this year. This cutback could affect the merger between the defence interests of Efim, the state holding in liquidation, and Finmeccanica, the state-run defence and high-technology group. Finmeccanica agreed to take on the defence side of Efim, provided the government guaranteed orders from the armed services to sustain production lines. At the same time Fincantieri, the ship-building subsidiary of IRI, the state holding company, could lose one of its two remaining naval shipyards as a result of the cuts. In the case of steel, the saga of the break-up of Ilva, the state steel company, is not fully resolved. Although the government is committed to complete privatisation of Ilva by the end of the year, the fate of the huge flat products factory in Taranto is not clear. Nor is it certain that Italy will comply with European Union agreements on cuts in overall steel production capacity, especially as demand is picking up. The Berlusconi government is committed to continue the retreat of the state from its dominant economic role. But the process is extremely complex and politically sensitive since the state apparatus has long been a source of patronage and jobs, especially in the south. The termination of state subsidies to industry has forced the pace of the privatisation process but IRI, the giant state holding company which still controls more than 3 per cent of GDP, has yet to define its future role. It could wind itself up as its assets are divested. Alternatively, it could become the instrument of continued state influence through minority ownership and 'golden share' control. Some members of the government want to see the state retain a strong presence in areas of high technology and strategic interest. The majority are wary of foreign penetration in such sectors as telecoms and energy. These considerations will play an important part in the forthcoming privatisation of Stet (telecoms), ENI and Enel, the electricity authority.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One refinery operator suggested that RSPA except non-pipeline companies from part 199, if they have a comparable drug program and few low-stress pipelines. This commenter's primary concern was the cost of administering two separate anti-drug programs, the company's own program and another to satisfy part 199. RSPA believes this commenter may have overestimated the burden of compliance with part 199. Operators with comparable programs need not begin a separate part 199 program. They could modify their present programs as necessary to meet part 199 standards. Separate plans would not be required, although the parts of a single plan intended to meet part 199 would have to be clear and distinct from separate company requirements. Separate tests and analyses would be required only if the company's program required testing for drugs not covered by part 199. Considering the savings in compliance costs for operators with comparable programs and the continuing concern that illegal drug use may adversely affect the safe operation of pipelines, we did not adopt the refinery operator's comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> O. Marine Terminal Piping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One operator pointed out that the US Coast Guard already regulates certain low-stress pipelines at marine terminals. This commenter recommended that RSPA continue to except these pipelines from part 195. Alternatively, the operator suggested RSPA establish a jurisdictional boundary with the Coast Guard to avoid duplication of agency efforts. A boundary, said the operator, also would eliminate the confusion over which DOT regulations apply to low-stress pipelines at marine terminals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In port areas, RSPA and the US Coast Guard have independent regulatory missions, as assigned by federal statutes. So, hazardous liquid pipelines in port areas come under a combination of RSPA and Coast Guard regulations. At present, we know of no conflicts or undue burdens created by these separate regulatory programs. If such difficulties surface with respect to low-stress pipelines, we will work with the Coast Guard to minimize their impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> P. Miscellaneous Clarifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Pipelines Subject to Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenting on low-stress pipelines that cross navigable waterways in rural areas, API and an operator suggested that the final rule clarify how much of the entire pipeline the regulations cover. The operator thought only that part of the pipeline that actually crosses the waterway should be covered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, for non-HVL low-stress pipelines, we intended to apply the regulations only to that part of the pipeline in the populated area or navigable waterway. Final &sect;195.1(b)(3) clarifies this intended application by including ``or pipeline segments'' immediately after ``pipelines.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One operator thought the wording of the proposed compliance period (proposed &sect;195.1(d)) was inconsistent with the proposed revision of &sect;195.1(b)(3). The operator thought proposed &sect;195.1(d) implied that operators of non-HVL low-stress pipelines located outside populated areas and navigable waterways would have to comply with the regulations within 1 year. To avoid this misconception, we changed proposed &sect;195.1(d) (now &sect;195.1(c)) to show that the compliance period applies only to existing low-stress pipelines covered by part 195. We also clarified the wording of proposed &sect;195.1(b)(3) to better identify low-stress pipelines that part 195 does not cover.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Definition of Low-Stress Pipeline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another operator suggested the final rule define the various kinds of low-stress pipelines covered. As stated above, the proposed rules affected several kinds of distinct pipelines that operate over their full length at 20 percent or less of SMYS, such as trunk lines and inter-facility lines. Nevertheless, since the final rules do not refer to low-stress pipelines by kind, there is no need to define each kind of low-stress pipeline the rules cover.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

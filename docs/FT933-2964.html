			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / People: Quantec QUANTEC, a provider of investment technology services, is hoping to capitalise on the growing interest among UK fund managers for quantitative applications in stock selection and asset allocation. It has hired Bruce Pullman, formerly of County NatWest Investment Services - and very briefly at Hill Samuel Asset Management - to head a new investment management consultancy service. The service will help traditional fund managers to incorporate some arithmetic approaches into their product and understand their own performance better. Pullman moved to CNWIM in 1981 where he set up the bank's quantitative fund management team. Earlier this year, he was recruited to head a team at Hill Samuel, but left after two months following disagreements over the scope of his brief; he said his departure was amicable.</p>

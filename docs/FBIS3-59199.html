			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Prodi to Delors on Privatisations"] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 25 Jan (ANSA) -- IRI [Institute for  Industrial Reconstruction] Chairman Romano Prodi today assured  European Commission President Jacques Delors of Italy's capacity  to absorb the big privatisations lined up for this year, saying  that "the Milan bourse [stock exchange] may be small, but so was  Paris before they started the privatisation process there,"  adding that "when you put banks like (already privatised)  Credito Italiano or Banca Commerciale Italiana (Comit) on the  market, it gets bigger, it becomes a real market...and will get  even bigger when we float 40 percent of telecom giant STET  [Turin Telephone Finance Company] later this year."    Prodi, who presented Delors with an IRI study on the  communications infrastructures envisaged in the European  Commission President's White Paper on boosting European Union  [EU] growth and employment, said that the upcoming Comit  privatisation would respect rules of "transparency" and  safeguard shareholders' rights.    In its last IRI balance sheet, approved today in Milan,  Comit  reported a 1.7 percent rise in 1993 net profits to 268.2 billion  lire and a 65 percent leap in its operating result to 1.510  trillion lire. It announced an unchanged dividend of 200 lire  per ordinary share and 230 lire per savings share still in  circulation at the end of the conversion period, February 11.    Prodi also had talks with European Competition Commissioner  Karel Van Miert on the recent European steel accord, reiterating  the strategic importance of Ilva plants to be privatised and  saying he had "no worries" on Dalmine's coming tubes joint  venture with Mannesmann and Vallourec despite EU clouds  apparently brewing.    On the freeing-up of Italy's mobile phone market with the  second, "European" licensee, Prodi stressed the importance of  competition, "even if it costs dear."    Illustrating the main points of IRI's communications network  study -- the first in Europe to issue a concrete response to  Delors's vision -- Prodi proudly pointed to its provision for  what Premier Ciampi recently called the missing piece --  high-speed links between north and south and not just the east  and west of Europe. The study had also highlighted the need for  any link between West and East Europe to pass through the Po  Valley, he said.    European Institutional Affairs Commissioner Raniero Vanni  d'Archirafi and Public Works Minister Francesco Merloni pointed  to the "coordinated approach" shown for the first time in IRI's  Trans-European Network (TEN) blueprint, and its crucial  importance for speeding European integration. Prodi highlighted  the "watershed" change represented by the almost wholly private  funding of the scheme, via the proposed EU bonds.</p>

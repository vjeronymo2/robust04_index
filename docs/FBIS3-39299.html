			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tom Hansson: "Time Favorable for a EU Agreement"] </F>   [Text] "I have a feeling that we are close to an  agreement. The time is favorable, particularly with regard to  the European Parliament. If we do not seize the opportunity  now, it will be a parliament that is newly elected in June that  will decide the matter. Things would then immediately become  much more uncertain."    It was perhaps not intended as a contribution to the Swedish  EU [European Union] debate, but the message was clear. Act now,  was more or less what French European Affairs Minister Alain  Lamassoure said when he gave a short news conference yesterday  with his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Dinkelspiel.    At the invitation of the Swedish Government, Lamassoure has  discussed issues in the negotiations with Prime Minister Carl  Bildt, among others. One of these is Sweden's northerly  location.    "We understand that the northern countries need some form of  compensation and have reach the conclusion that Objective 1  status could apply to Norway and Finland. But for Sweden we  will have to find something else. Objective 5, perhaps, a form  of support intended for regions that are threatened by  depopulation. Or something else."    Grand French words were spoken about the importance of  European cooperation, the significance of Swedish civilization,  and our qualities in the diplomatic field. But there was also  what was actually a rather gruff remark:    "The question of the Swedish contribution to the EU budget  is  a difficult one. Sweden is richer than the EU average and will  therefore be a net contributor. We have learned a painful  lesson from the British rebate and do not want a new exemption."    However, Sweden has not asked either for a rebate or for any  exemption. At issue is a phasing in. But there was no time to  ask questions about that.</p>

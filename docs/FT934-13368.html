			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Swedish rate cut Sweden's central bank cut its key interest rate yesterday in a further attempt to pull the country's economy out of its worst recession since 1945, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The reduction from 8 per cent to 7.75 per cent is the latest in a series of cuts which has brought the bank's marginal rate down from 12.5 per cent last November before the Swedish krona was floated. The cut was made before the Bundesbank decided to lower German interest rates.</p>

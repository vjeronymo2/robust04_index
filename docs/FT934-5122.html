			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Clarke committed to erasing budget deficit by year 2000 - Medium-term outlook The Budget announced yesterday differs markedly from its March predecessor in its medium-term projection of a steady fall in the public sector borrowing requirement from Pounds 50bn this year, almost to zero by the end of the decade. Mr Kenneth Clarke's explicit commitment to erasing the budget deficit is based both on projections of lower public spending - as well as a significant increase in revenue - and also on a slightly more optimistic picture of the medium-term prospects for the economy. Mr Norman Lamont, the previous chancellor, had forecast a progressive but more modest fall in the PSBR to 3.75 per cent of GDP by 1997/98. The Treasury's Red Book forecast yesterday that the economy would grow by an average of 3 per cent per year over the medium term, and that inflation as measured by the GDP deflator would drop to 2 per cent by the 1998/99 fiscal year from 4 per cent in 1994/95. In March, it had predicted average economic growth of around 2.5 per cent, and inflation expectations were almost the same as yesterday's. Retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments is forecast to rise slightly to 3.25 per cent next financial year from 3 per cent this year, but then to drop steadily to 2 per cent by 1998/99. The Treasury said spare capacity would continue to exert downward pressure on inflation. The Treasury noted that 'the pace at which the PSBR declines will depend significantly on the growth of the economy over the medium term'. It said that if the economy were to grow faster than expected, by an average of 3.5 per cent per year in the medium term, the PSBR would be eliminated by 1997/98. But if it grew by an average of 2.5 per cent, the PSBR would still be 2 per cent of GDP in 1998/99. Spending cuts and substantial tax revenue increases both contribute to the rapid projected fall in the PSBR. The measures announced yesterday reduce projected public spending by Pounds 3.6bn in the next financial year and Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2.9bn in the following two years respectively, compared with plans announced in the March 1993 budget. They also raise expected revenue from taxes and national insurance contributions by Pounds 1.7bn, Pounds 4.9bn and Pounds 6.1bn in the next three financial years respectively. The Treasury projects that general government expenditure as a percentage of GDP will fall from 45 per cent this year to 41 per cent in 1998/99. It noted that spending as a proportion of the economy, which had been on a downward trend for much of the 1980s, has risen in recent years because of the recession. It is now projected to fall from 1994/95 onwards. These reductions are accompanied by significant cuts in the expected amount of interest to be paid on government debt from 1994/95 onwards. In that year, interest is forecast at Pounds 22.5bn, Pounds 0.8bn lower than previously forecast. The figures for succeeding years of Pounds 24.5bn, Pounds 25.6bn, Pounds 26.5bn are respectively Pounds 1.3bn, Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 3bn lower than previously forecast. For 1997/98, interest is projected at Pounds 27bn. The Treasury said, however, that public sector debt as a proportion of GDP would continue to rise, and would peak at 44 per cent before beginning to fall in 1997/98. On the revenue side, the Treasury forecasts that general government receipts as a pro portion of GDP will rise from 36 per cent of GDP this year to 40.25 per cent in 1998/99. The Treasury said the economic recovery, as well as previously announced tax increases, should reverse the recent fall in government receipts as a proportion of the GDP. Corporation tax, for example, had halved as a proportion of GDP during the past four years. 'This should be reversed in the upswing, albeit gradually given the lags in tax collection and assessment.' Big increases in tax revenues will start to appear in 1995/96, according to the Treasury's projections. Taxes on income, expenditure and capital are forecast in that year at Pounds 220bn, compared with Pounds 212bn projected in the March Red Book. By 1997/98, this measure of tax revenue is forecast at Pounds 254bn, a Pounds 13bn increase from the March estimate. For 1998/99, total tax revenue is forecast at Pounds 341bn, and total government spending at Pounds 345bn, giving a general government borrowing requirement of Pounds 4bn. But after taking account of borrowing by public corporations, the PSBR would be only Pounds 2bn.</p>

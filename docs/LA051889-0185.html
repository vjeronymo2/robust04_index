			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S.-SOVIET YOUTH THEATER COOPERATIVE VENTURE IN WORKS  </P> <P> A chance meeting in Munich last year between two young stage directors has  prompted an unusual U.S.-Soviet youth theater exchange.  </P> <P> The Mark Taper Forum's Improvisational Theatre Project has been invited to  bring its critically acclaimed production of "One Thousand Cranes," a play  about a child's fears of nuclear war, to the Soviet city of Rostov-on-Don (near  the Black Sea) as part of an international children's theater festival in  October.  </P> <P> In addition, ITP and the Theatre for Young Spectators in Rostov-on-Don have  begun tentative plans for a new, joint production.  </P> <P> Vladimir Chigishev, director of the Theatre for Young Spectators, was impressed  by "One Thousand Cranes" when he saw it performed at the 1988 international  children's theater festival in Munich. It was then that he and ITP's artistic  director Peter Brosius began discussing a cooperative effort between their two  companies.  </P> <P> That idea is now a few steps closer to reality. Sponsored in the United States  by the International Theatre Institute in New York and given local support by  the Taper, Chigishev recently made a 10-day visit to Los Angeles, where he and  Brosius held preliminary planning sessions.  </P> <P> Chigishev returned to the Soviet Union this week, with Brosius, who will  conduct informal workshops with Chigishev and his actors.  </P> <P> In an interview at the Taper offices, Chigishev had said through an interpreter  that although he speaks little English and Brosius no Russian, "we speak the  same language as if we grew up in the same street. Our countries are very  different, but the language of the theater is the same."  </P> <P> Chigishev, 36, is highly regarded in the Soviet Union for his imaginative stage  work for young people. He directs a four-theater complex, with a permanent  company of 35 actors, in a continuous repertoire of musicals, puppet theater,  modern and classic dramas.  </P> <P> This would not be the first Soviet-American youth theater exchange. Moscow's  Central Children's Theatre and the Children's Theatre Company in Minneapolis  are currently cooperating on two productions. The Taper project differs in that  it would feature actors from both companies in one play.  </P> <P> Brosius and Chigishev hope to begin rehearsals on the new work in October.  (U.S. Artists at International Festivals has provided $10,000 toward the  $75,000 October trip.)  </P></p>

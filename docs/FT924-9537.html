			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares ease on political uncertainty THE LONDON stock market was slipping lower towards the close of yesterday's trading session as Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, opened the Maastricht debate in the House of Commons. The market's response to the Clinton success in the US presidential election was somewhat muted, and cooled further after Wall Street started its new session with a loss of 9 points on the Dow Average. Oil shares proved to be the first sector of the UK market to react sharply to the prospect of a Clinton presidency. Suggestions that the new president might impose stricter anti-pollution and environmental policies upset the oil majors, which are significant components of leading UK market indices. Other blue chip UK stocks took a cautious view of suggestions that a Clinton administration may increase taxation of non-US companies. After falling by 11 points at first, the FT-SE Index rallied determinedly and succeeded in regaining the 2,700 mark early in the second half of the session. But Wall Street's uncertain opening and the focus on the Maastricht debate in the UK parliament took the heart out of investment interest. Shares began to drift down again and by the close the FT-SE was 13.9 off at 2,691.7. However, the underlying mood remained firm. At least two buy programmes were identified in the market and traders believed that the market would have gained ground but for the political uncertainties in the background. The latest surveys of political opinion confirmed only that the outcome of the Maastricht debate, on which the immediate prospects for government policy must hang, remained highly uncertain. City analysts left forecasting to the political strategists yesterday, but admitted that a defeat for the government in the Maastricht debate would make the future for its economic strategies even more uncertain. With no sign of the US buyers who had boosted the London market over the two previous sessions, trading volume was reduced yesterday. The day's Seaq total of 506.7m shares compared with 586.6m on Tuesday, when retail, or customer, business of Pounds 1.24bn maintained the improved levels of recent weeks. Although investment activity was restrained by the political uncertainty, there were signs of continued confidence that action to stimulate the UK economy will be taken soon. Housebuilding and contruction stocks outperformed the rest of the market in spite of the sluggishness in their respective markets. Firmness in sterling helped to buttress hopes for early cuts in UK base rates but were offset by weakness in UK government bonds. Currency-influenced stocks, waiting for US markets to make a more considered response to the election of President Clinton, traded a mixed path. The lack of a definite trend left the market susceptible to corporate statements or to more speculative influences. BAT Industries shares were better after the company's trading announcement found a welcome reception in the market. But J. Sainsbury, the food supermarket group, declined after good profit figures were counterbalanced by reports of a stock overhang. Market indices were restrained by profit-taking in ICI and Glaxo.</p>

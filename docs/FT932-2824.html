			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd condemns Bosnia pressure MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, yesterday condemned unrealistic demands for action by the European Community and its allies to ensure compliance with UN security council decisions by the warring factions in Bosnia, Ivor Owen writes. In question-time exchanges in the Commons, he also warned that if British and other troops had to be withdrawn because of unacceptable risks to their safety a 'massacre' would probably follow. Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, described the recent Washington agreement as 'deeply flawed' because it gave clear signals to Serbia that its aggression would be rewarded by extra territory. Mr Hurd accused Mr Cunningham of resorting to a 'something must be done' approach, and said it was the least useful advice that could be given in present circumstances.</p>

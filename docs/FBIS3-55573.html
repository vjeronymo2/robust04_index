Over the last two days the scientific part of the crew's  flight program mainly comprised geophysical studies. The  cosmonauts took several series of shots of the earth's surface  and carried out an experiment to assess the state of the  atmosphere's ozone layer over various regions of our planet.  Preparations have begun to hand over to the crew of the 15th  main expedition, scheduled for liftoff 8 January. The flight of  the "Mir" manned complex is going normally. The cosmonauts are  healthy and feel fine.</p>

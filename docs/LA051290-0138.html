			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE PAYS LAST RESPECTS TO ITS FIRST LEADER;  </P> <P> MEMORIAL: 'CHANCELLOR DAN' IS HONORED IN THE GARDEN HE CALLED THE HEART OF THE  UNIVERSITY. HIS SUCCESSOR SAYS ALDRICH WILL ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE IN ITS HEART.  </P> <P> He was remembered as a gregarious and compassionate man of the soil, a fierce  competitor and a builder of human bridges who, through vision and force of  personality, created and molded a thriving university that aspires to  greatness.  </P> <P> In honor of UC Irvine founding chancellor Daniel G. Aldrich Jr., who died last  month at 71 after a long battle with cancer, two citrus trees were dedicated  Friday in the rock garden he had chosen to be the university's heart.  </P> <P> There were many moist eyes among the more than 350 colleagues, friends and  family of the man known affectionately as "Chancellor Dan" when his successor,  UCI Chancellor Jack Peltason, read the inscription placed at the foot of the  rocky outcropping in Aldrich Park:  </P> <P> "May these rocks be so regarded: That the right man came here at the right time  and from this bare ground built a place as lasting."  </P> <P> Those words were written by the late architect William Pereira in his memoir  recalling how in December, 1961, the towering Aldrich strode the rolling  expanse of the Irvine Ranch until he spotted the craggy outcropping in a  bowl-shaped depression. Instantly, he declared it the spot around which the  fledgling university would take shape.  </P> <P> "This is the heart of (UCI)," Peltason said as sunlight streamed over his  shoulder through tall eucalyptus, sycamore and pine trees ringing the central  greensward. "It is the place where those of us . . . have had occasion to come  and to dream and to build. . . .  </P> <P> "Dan wanted us to continue to build. He did not want us to spend a moment in  mourning. No sadness, no tears. He asked that we continue to look forward . . .  (to focus) on UCI and what it will become," Peltason said.  </P> <P> Nearly 25 years after the first freshman entered its doors, UCI has become "one  of the most respected campuses in the country," University of California  President David P. Gardner said in a letter read by UC Vice President William  Baker.  </P> <P> A soil chemist when he began his career with the University of California  citrus experiment station in Riverside in 1943, he became the UC system's dean  of agriculture in 1958. Four years later, he was named chancellor of UCI, which  held its first classes in September, 1965.  </P> <P> A native of New Hampshire who never lost his Yankee accent, Aldrich was  instrumental in recruiting top-flight scholars such as the co-discoverer of the  neutrino, Frederick Reines, brain scholar James L. McGaugh and ozone layer  expert F. Sherwood Rowland. By the time he retired in 1984, UCI had vaulted  into the ranks of top of American universities.  </P> <P> Aldrich's retirement was short-lived, however. The same year, UC President  Gardner tapped the man he dubbed his "utility chancellor" to take over UC  Riverside upon the death of its leader, Tomas Rivera.  </P> <P> Aldrich served at Riverside until July, 1985. In July, 1986, Gardner again  brought him out of retirement to take over UC Santa Barbara, when Chancellor  Robert A. Huttenback resigned amid accusations of misusing university funds.  </P> <P> Aldrich left Santa Barbara in June, 1987, and was named chancellor emeritus at  UCI, where he kept an office and stayed active in academic affairs.  </P> <P> Michael J. Krisman, member of UCI's first graduating class of 1969 and former  UCI student body president during the days of draft-card burnings, sit-ins and  anti-war protests, recalled Aldrich's honesty and appreciation for new ideas,  even those he did not agree with.  </P> <P> During one demonstration, Aldrich telephoned him and asked, " 'Michael, how  long are the students planning to live in the English Department? Let's talk  about it.' . . .  </P> <P> "In a time of antiheroes, Dan believed in setting an example. In a time of  questioning values, Dan knew there were eternal truths. In a time of practiced  cynicism, Dan was an optimist . . . (who) saw and expected the best in people."  </P> <P> For Irvine Co. vice president Ray Watson, who was a young architect charged  with building the planned community of Irvine around the University of  California campus, Dan Aldrich was a builder of bridges -- between the  institution and the development firm, between people and communities.  </P> <P> "He built a solid bridge to a conservative Orange County that was skeptical, if  not hostile, to the idea that a liberal institution from Berkeley was locating  here," Watson said. "He taught us what can be achieved through communication,  cooperation, mutual respect and bold ideas . . . to achieve the greatest good  for the most people."  </P> <P> At the last, Aldrich accepted his illness and was prepared to "get on with it,"  his widow, Jean, recalled.  </P> <P> Gazing into the faces of those assembled on the grassy knoll, she recalled the  simple, direct man whose life was devoted to making the world in which he lived  a cleaner, better, happier place:  </P> <P> "I would venture to guess that on the road to heaven, if he saw one small gum  wrapper, he stopped and picked it up."  </P> <P> Peltason, who was UCI vice chancellor for academic affairs in the university's  earliest years, invited all to share Aldrich's vision.  </P> <P> "This (campus) is his monument. Most of all, end your day doing what Dan would  want you to do: sit on the grass, perch on a bench and dream. . . . And for  heaven's sake, don't forget to pick up any litter you may see lying about.  Remember, Dan is watching."  </P></p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Murray and Roberts posts midway setback THE depressed South African economy and industrial action caused earnings at Murray and Roberts, the construction, engineering and supplies group, to fall in the six months to the end of December. Turnover rose 23 per cent to R3.27bn (Dollars 1.04bn) from R2.65bn, but this was largely attributable to a number of acquisitions made during 1992 involving Blue Circle, Darling &amp; Hodgson and Standard Engineering. These acquisitions also helped boost operating profits by 19 per cent to R340m from R286m and attributable earnings by 16 per cent to R111m from R96m. An increase in the number of shares in issue, however, meant earnings per share fell by 13 per cent to 177 cents from 204 cents. The dividend, however, was increased by 6 per cent to 56 cents from 53 cents a share.</p>

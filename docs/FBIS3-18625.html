He  did not rule out the lifting of the oil blockade if "Baghdad  complies with its international obligations." During a dinner  banquet Juppe said: "I believe that Iraq has achieved progress"  by accepting UN Resolution 715, which stipulates that "its  weapons of mass destruction be subjected" to UN inspection. The  minister said that "at another level, we have achieved major  progress in the work of the special (UN) committee entrusted  with supervising the elimination of its war arsenal. And we are  now in a six-month trial period to ascertain whether Iraq is  complying with its obligations." Baghdad recently stressed that  it now has no weapons of mass destruction and is no longer  capable of producing them.    Juppe said: "This development should be taken into account  step by step," pointing out that, if that proves to be the case,  it will be possible to "use 22" [as published] of Security  Council Resolution 687, which stipulates that the oil blockade  imposed on Iraq be lifted if the country implements the Security  Council resolutions relating to its disarmament.    However, Juppe pointed to the existence of other Security  Council resolutions with which Baghdad has not complied, like  the resolution on the inviolability of the border between Iraq  and Kuwait. He said it is a "necessary condition" for Iraq's  return to the international community.    Furthermore, it was learned yesterday from an Arab  diplomatic  source that Riyad al-Qaysi, director of international affairs at  the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, will arrive in Paris today to hold  talks with French officials.    The Iraqi diplomat's arrival has been confirmed by a  spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry. He pointed out that  al-Qaysi, who visited Paris last July, "will hold talks with  officials at the ministry." The spokesman added that "we will  discuss with him Iraq's position on its international  obligations stipulated in the Security Council resolutions in  the light of the contacts made by the special committee  entrusted with disarming Iraq" under the chairmanship of Rolf  Ekeus of Sweden.

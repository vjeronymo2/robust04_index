			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Rarefied air to Bolivian election A FORMER military dictator, a mining tycoon, a brewing magnate and a TV talk show host were the main candidates tussling for votes yesterday in Bolivian presidential elections. Expectations of a big turnout were thwarted by a series of last-minute administrative problems such as a lack of voting slips in the city of Santa Cruz. Voting in a substantial number of areas has been delayed until next Sunday. But while oxygen may have been in short supply at the 12 de Octubre polling station in the poor El Alto township above La Paz which, at 13,000 feet, claims to be the world's highest voting booth, enthusiasm for democracy was not. Swarms of people queued to vote, the women in their distinctive bowler hats, embroidered shawls and multi-layered skirts. Most did not seem to care who won, enjoying instead the power of voting in their third election since 1985 in a country until recently so riddled by coups that it was considered the most unstable in Latin America. Waiting to cast his vote, Mr Vladimir Benita, a stallholder, said: 'It's important that we vote so that we get a good government. We're proud to be a democracy after so many years of dictatorship.' There were some dissenting voices. Mr Zairo Villasuelo, a carpenter, said: 'I wouldn't vote if it wasn't compulsory. Politicians are all corrupt.' These are the first Bolivian elections to be held under an independent electoral court, and President Jaime Paz Zamora said yesterday that Bolivians should be proud of the most transparent elections in the country's history. However, there were charges of fraud due to a surge in the number of registered voters to 2.4m against less than 2m in 1989, and the Santa Cruz problems led some candidates to demand a new election. Fourteen parties were fielding candidates, but the real fight was between Mr Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, 62, from the main opposition party and General Hugo Banzer, 67, a former military dictator and now the rightist candidate of the ruling party. US-educated Mr De Lozada owns the country's biggest private mining company and, as planning minister from 1985 to 1989, fathered a stabilisation plan which reduced inflation from 26,000 per cent to just 15 per cent. There was little difference in their campaign platforms, both favouring a continuation of the austerity programme. The last opinion poll put Mr De Lozada slightly ahead, but no one was expected to secure a majority. This would leave the balance with Mr Max Fernandez, the brewing magnate, and Mr Carlos Palenque, the talk show host. Under Bolivia's electoral system the candidate with the most votes may not win, as Mr De Lozada learnt in 1989 when he topped the polls but was not named president. The decision rests with Congress, which holds a secret vote in August.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] For the first time in 74 years the Labor Party has  lost control of the powerful Histadrut Labor Federation. In  elections yesterday, Hayim Ramon's list received about 47  percent of the votes, compared to Labor's 33 percent, and the  Likud's 18 percent. Ramon and Labor are expected to form a  coalition in the Histadrut, as we hear in this report from Dani  Gur-Arye:    [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Hayim Ramon, Meretz, and SHAS  [Torah Observing Sephardim] did in a month what the Likud has  been trying to do for 74 years: they knocked the Labor Party out  of the Histadrut. Ramon dominated among almost all the voting  groups -- people under 30, pensioners, kibbutzim members, and  development town residents. In a restrained victory speech,  Ramon and Prime Minister Rabin agreed to set aside their  differences. Ramon said: I think that on the basis of what the  prime minister said, we should definitely continue our  cooperation. The prime minister made a statement I think is  important, let's set aside for now the formalities. They are  less important.    Meretz and SHAS members went into a state of euphoria at  MAPAM [United Workers Party] headquarters in Tel Aviv when the  results were announced. Ramon watched the news from home,  joining the celebration after midnight.    At Labor headquarters meanwhile, the atmosphere was grim.  Histadrut Secretary General Hayim Haberfeld and top party  leaders locked themselves in one of the offices when the results  were announced, and emerged defeated a half hour later. Once  the results set in, even Ramon's harshest critics said they  would be willing to join his coalition. This is Economics  Minister Shim'on Shetrit:    [Shetrit] With regard to coalition, we have made coalitions  with the Likud, which is totally opposed to our views in the  political and also in social matters, and I don't think that  anyone who is sensible could say that he objects to coalitions  with any group.    [Gur-Arye] Haberfeld will continue acting as secretary  general for the time being. Ramon's party members will take up  their new positions in August. Until then the two parties will  have a tough time negotiating a coalition agreement. When it's  all over, Haberfeld will vacate his office for Hayim Ramon, the  new secretary general. [end recording]    Prime Minister Rabin hinted more than once overnight that  the  fact that Hayim Ramon, 'Amir Peretz, and Shmu'el Avital remain  members of the Labor caucus in the Knesset, provides a loophole  through which to bring them back into the party. The three in  fact remain Labor Knesset members [MK's] even though they ran in  a separate list in the Histadrut elections, and they ardently  support the Gaza-Jericho accord between Israel and the PLO,  which the Knesset is to debate today and tomorrow. The Knesset  took the day off yesterday for the Histadrut elections, but is  back in session today in a new political reality. David Ze'ev  reports:    [Begin Ze'ev recording] The Labor Party is waking up to a  difficult morning in its parliamentary life, amid the inner  conflict over whether to allow Hayim Ramon, 'Amir Peretz, and  Shmu'el Avital to participate in the party's Knesset caucus.  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin himself last night pointed out to  reporters the awkward situation that while the Labor  constitution requires the three to be expelled from the party,  they do remain members of the Knesset caucus due to Knesset  regulations. Peretz and Avital attended a caucus meeting last  week. There were some bitter, sarcastic comments over whether  they should be present, though most of the Labor MK's at the  meeting seemed to support their bid to continue to be considered  members. Either way, the three Labor Histadrut breakaways will  all support the government in the Knesset plenum vote over the  Gaza-Jericho accord signed last week.    The debate over the agreement with the PLO is due to begin  this morning, resume tomorrow, and last perhaps until the early  hours of Friday morning. For this debate Meretz will be back in  the Labor Party's corner, as will SHAS. In the Knesset, Labor  and Meretz are still in the same coalition, and SHAS is expected  to be on its way back in. But in that coalition there are  bitter feelings by Labor leaders towards Meretz. Meretz, which  for the most part has compromised in the name of the peace  process, has shown it knows how to confront Labor and win.  Prime Minister Rabin can take solace only in the fact that  whenever the marathon debate ends and the vote takes place, he  is likely to prevail. The Knesset speaker's office has  announced that the debate will start today, assuming the Prime  Minister's Office presents before the Knesset this morning the  Hebrew translation of the accord with the PLO. The English  version was before the Knesset yesterday. The Knesset speaker's  office says many MK's came to get a copy, even though the house  was not in session due to the Histadrut elections.

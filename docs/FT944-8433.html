			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Pensions): Why household names can cost you plenty - Be on guard for big differences in what providers charge When it comes to selecting a personal pension, relying on a household name with a good performance track record could prove an expensive mistake. The amount of your premium deducted in charges not only varies from provider to provider but can vary greatly between contracts from the same stable. The latest research from Bacon &amp; Woodrow, a leading actuary and consultant, shows that Gartmore, Equitable Life, Legal &amp; General and Britannia Life - all top providers for one or more example combinations of term and premium - are over-priced for others (see table). The survey also raises a serious concern about the details financial institutions provide on their charges. Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of partnership pensions at B&amp;W and author of the report, said: 'The annual management charge, bid/offer spread (the initial charge) on the purchase of units and administration fees are not the only costs passed on to policy-holders. 'In most cases, unit-linked funds bear additional costs which are reflected in the unit price - for example audit fees, dealing commissions, trusteeship fees, custody fees and stamp duty.' According to Warwick-Thompson, these costs can add up to the equivalent of an extra 0.5 per cent on the annual management charge and are most likely to occur where the stated annual charge appears low. He pointed out also that these hidden charges will not be revealed under the rules that come into force on January 1 1995 and require providers to show prospective clients the management and sales commission costs - an oversight the regulators should have spotted. B&amp;W examined 233 managed unit-linked funds, the most popular choice for investors. Using performance statistics, it eliminated funds that achieved below-average returns, or were inconsistent or volatile. As Warwick-Thompson explained: 'The use of past performance statistics is probably the best guide to gauge future performance - provided it is coupled with a clear understanding of how past performance was achieved, an assessment of the investment style of a management team, and a knowledge of whether the individuals responsible for past performance are still in place.' Only funds with a five-year track record and Pounds 20m under management made it through to the final short-list. Since B&amp;W operates on a fee basis, it also excluded providers who were not prepared to strip out the commission costs and re-invest these in the fund. And several funds were eliminated where the provider's contract imposed penalties on transfer or early retirement. The final short-list of 15 funds from 12 providers was: Britannia Life, Commercial Union, Equitable Life, General Accident, Gartmore, Legal &amp; General, Lincoln National (three funds), London &amp; Manchester, M&amp;G, Norwich Union, Standard Life (two funds) and Sun Life. B&amp;W then calculated reduction in premium (RIP) figures for each fund to find the most competitive provider for a series of contract terms and premium levels (see table). RIP analysis shows the effect of charges expressed as a percentage reduction of each premium paid throughout the term of the policy. The short-list and tables do not tell the full story, however. Recently, B&amp;W published a report that predicted the imminent demise of 40 of the 100 life offices now in business. Smaller life offices, particularly the mutuals, are vulnerable to take-over in the post-January 1995 competitive environment. Thus, advisers may not recommend for long-term investments those offices regarded as take-over targets. The results of the survey are based on the terms negotiated by B&amp;W. These may not be available through other advisers.

Cleveland limited the Steelers  to five first downs and 53 net yards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Philadelphia Eagles' defense scored one touchdown and set up another as it  had four interceptions, three sacks, a blocked a punt and held Seattle's  running game, led by Curt Warner and John L. Williams, to 77 yards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW FACES  </P> <P> How the top rookie's fared in their debuts:  </P> <P> Troy Aikman of Dallas, the first pick in the NFL draft, completed 18 of 35  passes for 180 yards and was intercepted twice in the Cowboys' 28-0 loss to New  Orleans. Aikman has a 22-yard touchdown pass to Michael Irvin nullified by a  penalty.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders of Detroit entered the game late in the  third quarter and finished with 71 yards in nine carries and scored on an  three-yard run in the Lions' 16-13 loss to Phoenix.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deion Sanders of Atlanta, who was playing baseball for the New York Yankees  last Wednesday and signed a contract Thursday, returned the second putn of his  career 68 yards for a touchdown against the Rams.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Andre Rison of Indianapolis has three receptions for 62 yards in the Colts'  30-24 loss to the defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Paul Frazier, a free agent out of Northwestern Louisiana, an NCAA Division 1-AA  school, rushed for 74 yards and a touchdown in 12 carries in New Orleans'  victory over Dallas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tim Worley of Pittsburgh lost three fumbles and managed only 36 yards in 10  carries as Pitssburgh suffered the worst lost in the history over its rivalry  with Cleveland, 51-0.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shawn Collins of Atlanta, the 27th selection in the draft out of Northern  Arizona, had six receptions for 76 yards in the Falcons' 31-21 loss to the Los  Angeles Rams.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW PLACES  </P> <P> Some familiar faces who made their debuts in new surroundings Sunday:  </P> <P> </P> <P> Charger quarterback Jim McMahon, acquired from the Chicago Bears on Aug. 18,  had a 35-3 record as a starter in regular-season games since 1984. But he  completed only 7 of 18 passes for 91 yards without an interception against the  Raiders and was replaced by David Archer midway through the third quarter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dan Henning's debut as Charger coach was equally inauspicius. The Raiders  scored first and trampled the San Diego defense for 418 yards in total offense  in a 40-14 win.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jimmy Johnson downplayed the significance of his regular-season debut after  Dallas' 28-0 loss. "I didn't think of it as a first game," said Johnson, who  replaced the fired Tom Landry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> George Seifert guided the defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers to  a 30-24 victory over Indianapolis, then confessed: "There's a lot more pressure  on that sideline than I realized."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bud Carson fielded a revamped Cleveland defense that forced eight turnovers and  produced the most one-sided game in the history of the Browns' rivalry with  Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Denver converted four Kansas City turnovers into 24 points to continue overcome  the Chiefs and new Coach Marty Schotenheimer, the former Cleveland coach who is  now 0-5 against the Broncos.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BIG PLAYS  </P> <P> Jim Kelly scored on a two-yard run with no time remaining to lift Buffalo to a  27-24 victory at Miami. It was Kelly's first NFL rushing touchdown. Kelly set  up the score by completing five of six passes on the game-winning drive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Al Del Greco converted a 33-yard field goal with 13 seconds remaining to list  Phoenix to a 16-13 victory over Detroit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reggie Dupard scored on a four-yard run with 1:55 remaining as New England held  on to defeat the Ney York Jets, 27-24, after blowing a 21-point halftime lead.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mike Tomczak threw a 20-yard scoring pass to James Thornton in the fourth  quarter to lift Chicago past Cincinnati.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Derrick Shepard scored on a 56-yuard point return to highlight New Orleans'  shutout victory over Dallas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> STREAKS  </P> <P> Buffalo won its fifth consectuive game against Miami. . . . The Dolphins have  lost 10 consecutive games to AFC East Division teams. . . . The Bills snapped  Miami's 13-game winning streak in home openers, longest in the NFL. . . . New  Orleans posted its first shutout in an opener with a 28-0 win over Dallas. . .  . The Cowboys were shut out for the first time in the regular season since  1985.  </P> <P> </P> <P> INJURIES  </P> <P> Seattle receiver Steve Largent sustained a small fracture of his right elbow  and did not return after intermission in the Seahawks' 31-7 loss to  Philadelphia. Before leaving, Largent caught his 98th career touchdown, one shy  of the NFL record held by Green Bay's Don Hutson. Seattle Coach Chuck Knox said  Largent would be sidelined for six weeks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Raider quarterback Jay Schroeder separated his left 6ollarbone on the Raiders'  first possession and was replaced by Steve Beuerlein. Later, the Raiders said  Schroeder could have returned to the game if needed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Houston guard Mike Munchak played only the first half because of an Achilles  tendon injury.  </P> <P> </P> <P> IN QUOTES  </P> <P> Detroit Coach Wayne Fontes on rookie Barry Sanders: "This young man will  restore the roar. He's everything we thought he was. . . . Hopefully, he'll  make me a great coach."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly: "I don't think anyone in this (interview) room  could have said the Buffalo Bills were going to come back in the last few  minutes. The only person who knew that was me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pittsburgh offensive guard Tom Ricketts after the Steelers' 51-0 loss to  Cleveland: "I've never been in a mess like this in my life."  </P></p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Mirror cleared to buy Independent The consortium backed by Mirror Group Newspapers was yesterday given government approval to take over Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, decided not to refer the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the grounds that the papers 'are not economic as going concerns' and there was a case for urgency. Unless there is judged to be a serious financial threat to the existence of a title an MMC reference is usually required when the combined circulations of newspapers involved in takeovers is more than 500,000 a day. Mr Heseltine did not, as many expected, accompany his permission with conditions. He said: 'I have concluded that the public interest does not require me to stipulate conditions.' Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of MGN, emphasised that guarantees of editorial independence were 'enshrined in print in the consortium agreements and we are bound by them.' Mr Heseltine rejected the views of 99 MPs who signed an early day motion arguing that as an absolute minimum conditions should be imposed to protect the editorial independence of The Independent. The Commons trade and industry committee is expected to consider on Wednesday whether to seek an inquiry into the issue. Journalists at the two loss-making newspapers asked for the reference to the MMC and Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers group of Ireland, the largest shareholder in Newspaper Publishing at 29.9 per cent, wanted conditions to be imposed. Mr Heseltine also cleared its stake. The consortium, whose other members are a group of founders led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith and newspaper groups El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, will press ahead with the reorganisation of Newspaper Publishing. MGN will become responsible for running The Independent apart from the editorial department. The Independent will join the MGN titles in the Canary Wharf tower in London's Docklands in the next two months. Apart from the reorganisation as much as Pounds 20m may have to be put into the company to improve editorial content and increase promotion. Mr Whittam Smith will be chairman and editor-in-chief. There are no plans to offer board representation to Mr O'Reilly's group.</p>

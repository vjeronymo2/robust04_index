			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 29 Jun (AFP) -- The foreign ministers of 26  nations and 11 dependent territories agreed here today to create  the Association of Caribbean States (ACS). The document must  now be countersigned by the respective chiefs of state and  government in July.    Tonight, the foreign ministers signed a document  establishing  the framework of the ACS, which will be an organization of  consultation, joint efforts, and cooperation aimed at promoting  expanded economic trade and investment projects.    Among the countries joining the ACS are members of the  Caribbean Community (Caricom), Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, El  Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama,  the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela.    The presidents meeting that will ratify the ACS shaping  document will be held 24 July in a yet-to-be-determined country,  Foreign Ministry sources told AFP. In addition to promoting  economic integration, the ACS proposes active and coordinated  participation in multilateral forums, environmental protection,  and conservation of regional natural resources, particularly in  the Caribbean Sea.    The ACS will have full members and observers, and its  permanent organizations will include a Council of Ministers and  a Secretariat. The Secretariat will be headed by a secretary  general, who will be elected by the Council of Ministers every  four years. Also, the Council of Ministers will establish a  special fund designed to support technical cooperation and  research programs.    The document signed by the foreign ministers says: "None of  the positions outlined in the current agreement should be  interpreted as conflicting with the rights and obligations of  the parties in regard to other agreements." The document adds  that these positions will not affect "other existing mechanisms  of cooperation, joint effort, and consultation."</p>

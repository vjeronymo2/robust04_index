			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Steel puts Hoogovens in the black A strong turnround in steel enabled Hoogovens, the Dutch metals group, to swing back into a net profit of Fl 63m (Dollars 35m) in the first half-year from a net loss of Fl 189m in the same period of 1993. The company's second biggest business, aluminium, saw a marked improvement in the period but it remained in the red overall. Hoogovens forecast a further 'considerable' rise in the second half, before any extraordinary items. It said steel profits should see a substantial rise, while losses in aluminium should narrow. The first-half results were at the top end of analysts' expectations. The company's shares jumped by 4.7 per cent to close up Fl 3.60 at Fl 80.70, helped in part by Hoogovens' optimism for the rest of the year. Commenting on the turnround, Hoogovens said the pace of European economic recovery had been quicker than forecast earlier in the year. 'The improvement is due, among other factors, to increasing exports, with the strength of the US economy having a beneficial influence,' it said. Group turnover was up 4.1 per cent at Fl 3.67bn, while operating profit surged to Fl 209m compared with a loss of Fl 42m a year earlier. The steel division, which had already begun to emerge from losses in the 1993 second-half, posted pre-tax profit before extraordinary items of Fl 163m against a loss of Fl 70m a year earlier. Hoogovens attributed the rise to cost-cutting measures, a rise in selling prices, and stable prices in Dutch guilders for raw materials such as iron ore and coal. In aluminium, losses were halved to Fl 64m from Fl 128m. Although sales of rolled and extruded aluminium products rose, selling prices fell compared with early 1993. Hoogovens' results were also helped by a decline in financial charges to Fl 96m from Fl 121m a year earlier. A string of divestments of smaller subsidiaries and associate companies reduced net borrowings by more than Fl 300m.</p>

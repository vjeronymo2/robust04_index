			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by </F> Maria Urruzola; place and date not given]    [Text] [Urruzola] The day you arrived in Montevideo, you  made some remarks with respect to the "model of economic  transformation within which we are working." However, Carlos  Lage [Cuban Council of Ministers Executive Committee secretary]  told GRANMA last November that they were not looking for a new  model, as the whole point was to maintain the socialist model.  Don't you see a contradiction between these remarks made by two  key members of the present political leadership?    [Robaina] The way we expressed ourselves might seem  contradictory, but deep down we are talking about the same  thing. I prefer to explain things publicly rather than look for  a label for the model. I do not want to maintain a label that  is no longer entirely correct, nor import a label that is not  ours. That is why I decided to summarize the model within which  we are working -- for anyone who might insist on finding a label  for it -- by saying that it is a viable Cuban economic model  where many things can be modified, where there is room for other  things, and where the essence of many things is maintained.  Those are the things Lage defends, with all clarity. About the  modifications, I expressed myself in one way, and Lage in  another. But it is clear that we are not talking about a model  that is identical to the one we had before, because substantial  differences already exist.    [Urruzola] You are part of the generation of Cubans who were  educated under the principle that "Cuba belongs to the Cubans,"  even if they make mistakes. That is changing today. You  accepted opening a space for foreign capital in the country's  economy. At some time you will have to deal with that capital's  interference in the decisionmaking process. When I was in Cuba  I perceived that the people had certain difficulties in  accepting that.    [Robaina] Only "certain difficulties?" Cubans have a lot of  difficulties understanding that. But the success of what we  defend depends not so much on the resemblance of what we are  doing with what we supported in other circumstances, than on our  capacity to adapt ourselves to the moment in which we are  living. In the same way I was educated in that concept you  mentioned, I was also educated to adapt to new times. In this  process of adaptation the point is to know to what extent Cuba  continues belonging to Cubans under the new rules of the game.  We cannot continue to stagnate. But I would be lying if I said  that the process is clearly or easily understood. It is a very  complex and tough process, even for the new generations, as they  were educated based on a series of tenets that are today in one  way or another being adjusted. We need to do a lot of  persuading and convincing.    [Urruzola] What do you mean when you talk about "what we  defend" or "the essence?"    [Robaina] For us the essence is sovereignty, independence,  to  be able to speak with one's own voice, and not wait for someone  to signal to us what we must do when there is something in the  world we must speak about. We do not want the infant mortality  rate to rise, or life expectancy to drop. We do not want to  need money, support, or relatives' help to act professionally.  We do not want to stop doing our best in the Olympic Games. We  want to continue to develop our scientific world. For us the  essence is not disturbed if we accept mixed associations in our  economic model, or liberalize work, or let one work on one's  own, or hand the land to peasants for their use for an  indefinite period, or reorganize the state administrative  apparatus.    [Urruzola] Nevertheless, with the new economic situation in  Cuba, scientists, university students and professors, and  intellectuals have been particularly harmed. Given their  relationship with government organizations, they are still  earning 300 pesos, which is equivalent to $3. At the workers  congress of the National Research Center I heard scientific  researchers saying: "They are forcing us to do things that we do  not want to do." Is it not a serious risk that precisely that  sector which must find a solution to the country's problems is  in such a situation?    [Robaina] My country is a country of many risks. We  nevertheless prefer to run these risks instead of running a more  serious risk: that of not facing life, and believing that  problems will be resolved in some other way. Cubans do not sit  back and do nothing. Cuba believes that, under circumstances  such as these, it is actually through the discussion of all the  issues by workers' congresses that the wise voice of the people,  which will convey to our country's leadership the need to  introduce new transformations, will be raised. These  transformations, for example, include putting domestic finances  on a sound footing so that sectors like that of the scientists  will not in some way be harmed after all the contributions they  have made to our country. This does not merely involve  deregulating the dollar, but also finding compensation  mechanisms for the sectors dollars do not reach. This is the  challenge.    [Urruzola] The state's role in the previous period, that is,  when measures to become self-sufficient were not taken, is now  strongly criticized on the island. Not everyone believes that  the current situation has arisen solely from the downfall of  Eastern Europe and the U.S. blockade -- about which there is  also discussion of its real economic impact -- but people talk  about "squandering" and "irresponsibility." Has your country's  leadership been unable to devise alternative economic policies?    [Robaina] We have openly done a self-examination on this  issue. In my opinion we were overconfident. For a long time we  got used to the existing pipeline and to the mechanisms that  guaranteed certain sectors. This led us to believe they were  guaranteed for life. We thus neglected, for example, the arable  land and the habits that made the population consume or not  consume the currently successful crops.    It is a very serious responsibility that we are taking on as  a state. When we began to change, we believed that we would  have more time, but we were overwhelmed by an extremely tough  situation in a period of time much shorter than had been  envisioned. This is one of our dilemmas today: to what extent  the state must remain in those areas in which it has  demonstrated efficiency, and what the priorities for change  might be in those areas in which it has not. I believe the  phenomenon of mechanically transferring mistakes or copying  models is very clear. Therefore, with both calmness and  alacrity, we must avoid running into the same stumbling block.  Everywhere there are positive and negative experiences, but we  cannot -- again -- mechanically transfer policies from others.  I share the opinion of those who must have told you that for  some time the state implemented measures that led us into  stagnation. I am also among those who believe that, even though  the blockade represents the greatest problem in coping with the  current situation, there are also problems that do not depend on  the U.S. blockade. There is a second blockade that life has  imposed on us. And there is a third blockade that involves us,  that depends on our mistakes, our bureaucracy, and our inability  to resolve some issues. There are many things on our shoulders,  but all depends on what we are able to do. Our country cannot  remain waiting for the blockade to be lifted. We must  constantly condemn it, and sooner or later it will be lifted,  but we cannot wait, sitting back and doing nothing. Undoubtedly  we had to learn things in a tense and very difficult situation.  Had we done these things before, the country would not be  experiencing the current economic situation.    [Urruzola] Until recently you headed the Union of Young  Communists. You must therefore be well acquainted with young  people. Apparently, most of those who are 20 years old dream of  leaving Cuba. Those who are 30 years old hope to be free to  leave and enter Cuba, a freedom they do not have nowadays  because of laws or regulations that have existed for many years.  Isn't this at odds with the current situation?    [Robaina] The situation is, first, not only no longer the  same as that which prevailed many years ago, but it is also no  longer that which prevailed a few months ago, either. The  ability to enter or leave our country currently does not depend  on Cuba's having more or fewer regulations. For the first time  Cuba is now under the same conditions as the rest of the world,  and the people's only limitation -- which is serious, essential,  and very complex -- is the lack of money or foreign currency.    [Urruzola] University graduates, for example, say they  require the education minister's authorization to go abroad.    [Robaina] Incidentally, I was going to discuss the issue of  professionals. As in any country in the world, some people are  subject to regulatory processes, not for traveling, but for  certain proceedings that are required depending on their task.  As never before, we have become more flexible concerning age  limits, proceedings, and paperwork. Even though this issue has  not been entirely resolved, I assure you it will be resolved  soon, because it will be one of the points for discussion during  a conference on emigration scheduled for 22-24 April. Many of  these migration issues were proper for a time that has  definitely been overcome. In the past, people eagerly sought  travel. Now there is a process that will be increasing as  regulations are removed. In this process, people will discover  their own ways. Nowadays many talk about leaving because they  have not experienced what is felt when one leaves.  Nevertheless, it has become normal for people to leave and  return, even with unexpected frequency. Some people believed  hundreds of people were going to remain abroad. Actually there  are hundreds of people who returned with their own conclusions.  We are experiencing a normalization process, not only for those  who are inside and want to leave, but also for those who are  outside and want to enter.    [Urruzola] For many years the issue of Cuban exiles has been  marked by politics. In other words, those who were leaving were  "worms," or leaving was tantamount to betrayal. This caused an  entire generation, your generation, to grow up harshly  criticizing their fellow countrymen living abroad. All of a  sudden this does not apply, and the people are told that the  Cubans living abroad, save those who are engaged in "hysterical  politics" as you have described it, have a right to become  concerned about your country's destiny. This represents a very  drastic change.    [Robaina] I do not believe it is all of a sudden. We are  talking about 30-odd years, and there are precedents for this  new period. It is not the first time that our country has  maintained a relationship with Cubans abroad. And changes are  taking place not only within our country, but also outside. Now  the Cubans who are living in other countries are not  characterized by the historical attitude of those who, committed  to politics, claimed for themselves the total and absolute  representation of the Cuban community abroad. Part of this  community has remained silent for many years, fearing  harassment, but now it is no longer silent, and the hysterical  people are actually concerned. My country requires people from  outside to become familiar with our internal situation, and the  people inside need to become familiar with the outside situation.    I believe our country needs to understand that today we have  two paths: Either we hold out our hand and control the  Cuba-emigration connection as does any country in the world, in  a normal and civilized relationship, or that large mass of  people will remain instrumental to policies hostile to our  country. This must be understood, and overstatements must be  avoided. If they were called worms at a given time, it was  proper in a given situation. It is also not necessary to cry  repentance because, as I have already said, it actually is  important to be abreast of the new times and stick to  essentials. And it is essential for this relationship to be  normal and fluid. There is a limit to this: All those who left  our country do not have a right to tell us, those of us who  remained in our country, what to do. These are the rules of the  game that my country imposes today for talks and rapprochement.  It would not be true to tell you that everyone understands  this. And I believe in the people who harbor doubts. I believe  they are more sincere and more authentic. And I am willing to  talk and discuss things with these people.    [Urruzola] According to Cuba's current legislation, the  foreign capital that is eligible to invest in Cuba is that  belonging to companies or individuals residing abroad. Does  this mean that Cubans living abroad will be able to invest in  their country?    [Robaina] This is a very serious problem. From a legal  standpoint Cuba cannot embark on a foreign investment drive  saying that "everybody except Cubans who have left the country  are eligible to invest here." No country in the world would  tolerate or understand this. The problem lies in the fact that  the country in which they want to invest is a country they have  left, and there are wounds that have not yet healed. In my  view, we have to build a climate of trust through foreign  investment in general, because there are many Cubans who are not  yet convinced that the country needs foreign investments, and  still less that those who left Cuba should be allowed to invest  here. The country has just implemented an opening drive. There  is therefore no need to give precedence to Cubans residing  abroad, but by the same token we cannot say that they are the  only ones who are not eligible to invest in our country. The  challenge that we now face is to try to find a happy medium,  something that is indeed quite difficult for us Cubans.    [Urruzola] There will come a moment when, of necessity,  Cubans living abroad will invest in Cuba.    [Robaina] Precisely.    [Urruzola] Will this fact lead to the question: "And why not  Cubans who live on the island?"    [Robaina] That will be at a later stage. It is obvious that  we cannot limit ourselves to the Cubans that went into exile, as  this would entail other problems. Scientists will contend that  they, who stayed behind to do research and were thus unable to  amass a fortune, are not allowed to invest in their country,  while others who made money through other means are allowed to  do so. These are unavoidable risks; and as you see, they cannot  be solved overnight.    [Urruzola] I was told in Cuba that of every 10 youngsters  who  reach the age limit for affiliation with the UJC [Young  Communists Union], approximately nine do not want to join the  party. At a university, faculty members even told me that they  were having trouble having students elect class delegates,  because youngsters did not want to be elected. Have Cuban  youngsters gotten tired of politics?    [Robaina] One needs a lot of background information to make  that judgment, and I personally do not share that view. During  their first years at school, just to cite the example you  brought up, students always ask themselves whether or not they  should take on political responsibilities incident to the life  of young university students, which is something very complex.  I can assure you that the UJC registered an all-time growth in  1993 -- 100,000 youngsters affiliated with it.    [Urruzola] There are those who contend that party  affiliation  used to be selective in the past, whereas now there is mass  affiliation.    [Robaina] No, there is no mass affiliation at any level. The  selection criteria are even more strict, as affiliation is no  longer dependent on the request made by a youngster to join the  party, as was the case for some time, but rather on the decision  to accept or reject this request made at a board meeting. Yet  the underlying subject concerning the UJC is that it should not  only devote itself to working with militants, but rather extend  its wings to target the mass audience. Furthermore, party  affiliation by youngsters has always had its ups and downs, in  every place and every province, and even according to the work  of the party itself. Many times the UJC is blamed for this.  And yet things do not always depend on the UJC, but also on the  party in general and the party in particular, and on the body  the youngsters are to join.    I believe the greatest exchange of ideas undoubtedly  continues to be among the young. Even though throughout the  world signs of apathy can be seen most clearly among the young,  things are different in Cuba, as there are a great number of  youngsters involved in economic, political, scientific, and  social pursuits. And yet to contend that the change the country  is undergoing has had no repercussions would be to deny  something that has been traumatic, for example, for my  generation. The most important challenge that the UJC faces at  present is to come to grips with a process involving 5.7 million  Cubans who are under 30. What my parents considered sacred  conquests, to be defended until death, are nothing novel to any  of us as this was already in place when we were born. Moreover,  the young do not like to be constantly reminded that they never  lived under capitalism, because they are not to blame for that.  One cannot establish dialogue or the rules of the game on the  basis of these codes. I do believe, however, that the key to  success is that they feel they are participants in and masters  of their pursuits; otherwise they will not defend them.    [Urruzola] Do you feel you are participating today?    [Robaina] I think young people are participating. I am not  saying an overwhelming majority of them; nor do I believe in the  concept of unanimity. I believe in the thousands of young  people who participate in the country's development, although I  also know that many young people feel disillusioned with our  project, for family, social, or political reasons, or due to  foreign influences. Or better said, they do not feel enthusiasm  for our project, but feel attracted by the siren songs emanating  from abroad.    When the blockade is lifted it will not only be medicines  and  food that Cuba will receive. The country and the new  generations will have to face much tougher decisions than the  ones we are facing today. The discussion will be at the level  of values, ideas, and lifestyle. The enemy is not as clearly  perceived as before, which is complex and difficult to  understand for young people. I think what Cuban young people  need most today is to learn about young people in the rest of  the world, and how they live. Their biggest problem is that  they do not value what they have today. This attitude is also  due to an excessive paternalism developed over a long period of  time.    [Urruzola] When I visited Cuba I did not feel that Cubans  were really concerned about the issue of a multiparty system.  What seems important is the separation of the state from the  party, the revaluation of civilian society and the role of  citizens. Cubans seem to want the party reduced to a more  specific role. They seem to want the party out of numerous  areas where its opinion and decisions are not necessary. Is  this so?    [Robaina] I am glad you have perceived both feelings,  particularly the one referring to the multiparty system, which  is not a priority in my country. The world has taught us that  like it or not, accept it or not, the single party system in my  country, in practice, has resolved more situations that the  multiparty system in other countries. It is a very typical  Cuban solution. We implemented it because of a threat that has  not yet disappeared. The interest in setting limits on state and  party responsibilities is not only society's concern. The party  itself is concerned about the problem. The issue was discussed  at length in recent meetings. When the party started  administering the country, it neglected more appropriate  political tasks. Besides, it was not prepared to administer,  and did not do a good job. We realize that clearly. The  important thing today is to determine what party role we should  strengthen, which roles are appropriate, and how to strengthen  the state and the government, also through their own particular  roles. That means we must strengthen state power structures and  establish state jurisdictions which for a long time were very  much superimposed. This situation made it very difficult to  know who was responsible for what. In this sense we started  walking down a certain path. But there are more things that we  must still do than things we have already done.    [Urruzola] On that path there has already begun to appear  something that will probably increase with time: the Cuba of  differences. Differences of possibilities, opportunities, and  dollars. This is seemingly provoking an irreversible  deterioration in the ethical values on which the revolution was  built. Does the country leadership perceive it that way?    [Robaina] That is part of the inevitable risk. We know that  it will be worse if we do not face reality. I think you are  correct. Today we live a world of differences. But I think it  is also necessary to make clear that it was much more serious  when those differences existed in an illegal world. The  elimination of penalties for holding dollars did not create  differences, it only brought to light things that already  existed. The options we had were either to ignore that reality,  or to face it and seek mechanisms to compensate for it.    We sought mechanisms to prevent society from going  backwards.  We wanted society to continue having a solid base, a structure  of extremely rich moral values. That is not easy to implement.  Even in the Cuba of differences, there are a lot of examples of  solidarity and equality. For instance, when young people  working in the area of tourism decide, on their own initiative,  to share their incomes with others working in sugar harvesting.  Or when someone receives hard currency and purchases staples  for himself and his neighbors, or tennis shoes for his children  and a friend's children. Cuba is not only a country with  differences. It is also a country where people share. But it  is true that we are facing an important challenge in the area of  values and ethics.</p>

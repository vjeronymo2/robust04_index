			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Novelties have not worn off - Clive Fewins visits a family business that has been big in party hats for 40 years They were in turmoil at Gaffney of Tiptree over what to wear at the family party for Ted Gaffney's 70th birthday. Should it be the fireman's hats, or the glitter crowns, Father Christmas masks, or stars and stripes bow ties? Perhaps a combination of all these might be more suitable . . . 'In the event we'll probably settle for plain suits and dresses,' said grandfather Gaffney, managing director of party novelty specialists Gaffney of Tiptree. 'We don't like to be too outrageous - not in public, at least]' The family business has specialised in the outrageous since the end of the second world war when Bow-born Arthur Gaffney, then 47, had to find something to make instead of pumps to remove the water from air raid shelters. The only material to hand was plywood. There were tons of off-cuts, scrap from a local company that had made wooden wings for aircraft. Arthur started making toys. he was joined in 1946 by his three sailor sons, Arthur, now 72, Ted, 70, and Reg, now 67. The quartet moved the business twice before moving 50 miles north of London to a former builders' merchant's 16 acre site on the edge of the Essex fruit growing village of Tiptree 18 years ago. There they decided to concentrate on novelties. 'Cheap imported toys were making our products less and less competitive. We had been building up our stock of party lines and knew there was a good market for many of them,' Ted said. The workforce, full and part-time, numbers 120, and there are 200 outworkers. 'The quiet patch after the Christmas boom does not usually last very long,' Ted said. 'At the end of November we had a rush for fairy wands and tiaras to be delivered to theatre gift shops in advance of the pantomime season. As soon as Christmas is over we shall have to gear ourselves up for Valentine's Day.' The Gaffneys supply many British stores with seasonal novelty items. They claim to be the only UK company with an automated line manufacturing party streamers, and their warehouse usually stocks 100m balloons. 'At peak times we pack 1m balloons a day,' said Ted. 'All our balloons come from Mexico. They are among the 10 per cent of our lines that we import, but they account for about 20 per cent of our turnover. Most other products we make here, but because they are mostly cheap items, made of cardboard and plastic, our profit on turnover is low - we aim at about 12 per cent.' Last year was the best in the company's history. Turnover was Pounds 2.75m. 'In times like the present people often don't have the money for large items such as holidays and cars, so they often spend their money on small inexpensive things like our novelties,' Ted said. 'There is scarcely a day when we are not working on some new line,' said Reg, who is chief ideas man and works closely with his son Raymond, 38, to develop products. The Gaffneys have lost count of their total lines, but a glance at their multi-coloured catalogue reveals at least 500, if you can be bothered to count. These all sell in shops under the Galaxy brand name, but a high proportion of the output also sells under the own brands of many of the big high street chains. 'Our association with Woolworths goes back 52 years. It was 1941 and the bombs were dropping when a Woolworths buyer knocked on the door of dad's original factory in Walthamstow to ask if there was anyone in the area who made things for kids,' Ted said. The brothers do not know what proportion of their products end up overseas, except in the case of punchboards. They manufacture several hundred different designs of these under the brand name Money Makers. These are fund-raising devices used in clubs and by charities all over Europe, and are made in nine languages. In the late 1960s, when the Gaffneys were trying to get into punchboards (originally a US idea), they had problems working out how to insert the tickets into the boards. Ted went to Chicago and bought machines built in the 1920s by associates of Al Capone. They are still functioning in the Gaffney factory, and are lovingly maintained by the fifth male Gaffney in the business, 43-year-old Paul, son of Arthur. Irene, who is married to Ted, supervises the payroll and Arthur's wife Louise, looks after the accounts. Hats and other novelties form about 50 per cent of turnover. Of the other novelties three of the biggest lines are tooters, blowouts and bubble kits. The bubble filling department is one of the biggest in the factory. At peak times there is a staff of 12, stirring the magic brew - there are 17 separate ingredients in the secret recipe - and packing the tubs into boxes. 'There used to be about 10 companies making bubble tubs in this country. Now there's just us and one small competitor,' said Ted. 'We keep a careful eye on him.' Bubbles are a big spring line. Early in the new year a number of the Gaffneys' staff will move into the bubble department to form a double shift. 'It is one of our lines that seems to just grow and grow,' Ted said. 'Sometimes we wonder when the bubble is going to burst.' Gaffney of Tiptree, Progress House, 60-72 Newbridge Road, Tiptree, Essex CO5 OHZ. Tel: 0621 815910.</p>

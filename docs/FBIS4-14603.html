			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Tamara Zamyatina and Anna </F> Melnikova]    [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- Russian presidential  spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov denied on Thursday [31 March]  allegations about the existence of a "secret presidential decree  on the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Kuril islands."    The statement to this effect was made by Viktor Ilyukhin,  head of the State Duma Committee on National Security.    Speaking at a press briefing at the Kremlin on Thursday,  Kostikov said that the decree is not secret and has not been  published because of it is purely technical nature.    The spokesman noted that the decree envisages the withdrawal  from the Kuril islands of "long-obsolete equipment and the  maintenance personnel." Additionally, the decree provides for  better border protection, rather than "surrendering" the islands  to Japan as the opposition claims.</p>

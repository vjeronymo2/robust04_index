			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The frankest guide to Manhattan - The man who tells New Yorkers where to go WOULD you buy a guide to London written by a Muscovite? Or, if you were a publisher presented with the finished manuscript written by one, take the risk of publishing it? The answers to both these questions must be 'No.' But in New York (where, as the sweatshirts declare proudly, many are 'Born to Shop') the most successful guide - called, appropriately, Find it, Buy it, Eat it in New York - is written by Gerry Frank, an Oregonian, born and brought up 3,000 miles away from Manhattan. But if Frank lacks native skills, he has more than made up for them in other qualities. His guide has sold more than 500,000 copies, most of them to New Yorkers, and has been published in spite of a string of rejection letters from publishers there. Frank comes from an eminent family which controlled Meier and Frank, the state's largest retailer. As a boy, he worked in its store-room. Then, after stints in the army, Cambridge and Stanford universities and in the front of the stores, he rose to become vice-president. Since the company was sold in 1965, Frank has devoted his time and organisational flair to a myriad of charities, public committees - and to Senator Mark Hatfield, for whom he has been chief of staff in Washington DC for 19 years. Frank enjoys Washington's corridors of power but not what the capital had to offer socially. Soon after moving to the East Coast, he began to spend weekends in New York. There, like any visitor, he walked the streets. But, like any born retailer, he did so with pen and paper. Frank quickly compiled the most obvious lists - where to eat, shop and find the best breakfast - but then began to show his pedigree. Which 'discount stores' really were cheaper than the department stores, and where could you find a dry cleaner open on Sunday? Where could you play miniature golf in Manhattan? Frank quickly found out. His large circle of friends soon took advantage of these discoveries and then suggested, selflessly, that they would make a good book. Frank began to approach publishers, who failed to see a market for the guide or the determination of its author. In 1980, Frank hired a publisher in Oregon and printed 10,000 copies of his first guide at his own expense. Back in New York, he began the hard sell, first at Dalton on Fifth Avenue and then at other large bookstores. Persuaded by his charm (or merely to see the back of him), each ordered a few copies which began to sell. Frank made them sell even faster. He went on talk shows; he sold to executives at ABC-TV and Merrill Lynch, which ordered the book as corporate gifts, and he worked the more unusual markets. New York Air bought 75,000 copies for a promotion, and one leading hotel a further 5,000. By 1986 and its third edition, the guide had broken even. Frank had spent several hundred thousand dollars of his not inconsiderable fortune but the arithmetic now is more comforting. It costs Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 111,700) to print 75,000 copies, which will bring him in almost Dollars 400,000. His biggest investment now is in shoe leather. Over the years, Frank has visited more than 1,400 restaurants and walked in, around and out of every store mentioned (plus, he estimates, about 10 times as many that are not included), while a female assistant does the same for women's stores and beauty salons. Every other weekend, he picks a different district of New York and walks the streets. When he is not collecting data, Frank collects chocolate cakes. Wherever he travels, he pursues his quest for the perfect chocolate shop. Perhaps he will write a guidebook.

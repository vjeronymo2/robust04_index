			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: EIT placed into administration EIT Group, the USM-quoted information technology company formerly known as Maxiprint, has been placed into administration. Mr Michael Radford and Mr Paul Barratt, both of Radford, Sons &amp; Co, were appointed joint administrators of the company by the High Court on Friday under the provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986. EIT's shares were suspended at 9 1/2 p in February pending clarification of its financial position. Earlier in the day the group, which has been hard hit by continued rationalisation costs at Sintrom, reported a sharp increase in pre-tax losses from Pounds 99,000 to Pounds 950,000 for the half year ended September 30 1992. Trading in the period had been 'satisfactory' taking into account the economic climate, the directors said. The group supplies and supports computer software for communications systems. With the benefit of acquisitions turnover went up from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 8.6m, but operating expenses outweighed the gross surplus for an operating deficit of Pounds 670,000 (Pounds 74,000). Losses per share were 3p (1.05p).</p>

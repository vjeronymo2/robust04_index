			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / 'Threat' to advice bureaux Citizens' advice bureau services across England are under 'serious threat' because of a central funding crisis at a time when record numbers of people seek help with social security benefit and debt problems, the national organisation for the bureaux said yesterday. A four-year funding freeze imposed on the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux seems likely to disrupt core services to local bureaux across England. Staff fear that the national information system, on which the bureaux rely for advice, will be hit. That would lead to patchy services when they are most needed. They blame officials at the Department of Trade and Industry, which has imposed the cash standstill on the national association, which relies on the government for 80 per cent of its funding. Workers said the service would receive Pounds 12m for 1993-94 and the figure would remain at that level for four years. Ms Helena Shovelton, who chairs the association, said: 'The CAB service is facing a serious threat. A funding standstill in reality means serious cutbacks in services, and this is something we cannot just sit back and accept.' She vowed to fight for more money and added: 'It is neither reasonable nor realistic for the government to expect the CAB service to deal with an ever-increasing workload - much of it resulting directly from the government's own legislative programme - without proper recognition of our own resource needs.' Introduction of incapacity benefit and the job-seeker's allowance, and plans to tighten homeless legislation, were all likely to increase the workload, she added.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Thomson climbs 9% to Dollars 221m in third quarter THOMSON Corporation, the international publishing and travel group, lifted third-quarter earnings by 9 per cent. But the Canadian-owned company warned that its performance was being held back by slow holiday bookings in the UK and the poor newspaper market in Ontario. Much of the improvement in earnings came from the group's US publishing interests. Despite a lacklustre performance by Thomson's UK regional newspapers, operating profits of the information and publishing division jumped by 19 per cent after amortisation charges. The company has also been helped by a substantial drop in financing charges, including lower preferred share dividends. Total third-quarter earnings rose to USDollars 221m, or 38 cents a share, from Dollars 202m, or 35 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose to Dollars 1.94bn from Dollars 1.76bn. Thomson Travel's operating income rose fractionally to Dollars 150m, with a 9 per cent rise in summer packaged-tour volumes being offset by fierce discounting. October departures were 'weak' and holiday bookings for the coming winter season are below the level at this time last year. Summer 1993 bookings have also started slowly. Thomson Newspapers, which includes the group's US and Canadian papers, reported third-quarter operating profit of Dollars 34m, almost unchanged from last year. But advertising lineage in the first nine months was 2.7 per cent lower in the US and 5.8 per cent down in Canada. The newspaper operations benefited in the third quarter from lower newsprint costs and various belt-tightening measures. Thomson noted in general that 'economic conditions remained depressed in both Canada and the UK, and the very modest recovery in the US has not to date materially benefited the markets in which we operate'.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Ireland invests to create jobs: Government plans IPounds 20bn spending in six years A SIX-YEAR plan for investment of IPounds 20bn (Pounds 19bn), the largest and most ambitious in Ireland's history, was unveiled yesterday by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. The package aims to achieve an average 3.5 per cent annual growth rate in gross domestic product up to the end of the decade. The government expects to create some 200,000 jobs as a result of the investment, although the net effect, allowing for job losses in declining sectors, may be only around 10,000-15,000 additional jobs a year. This is still a long way short of the number of young people entering the workforce each year - almost 70,000. Funding for the plan will be partly from European Community structural and cohesion funds (IPounds 8bn), matching exchequer funds of IPounds 8bn and a further IPounds 4bn expected to come from the private sector. Public and private sector investment targeted under the 1994-99 National Development Plan will in effect be double that from 1989-93, with over 50 per cent earmarked for the priority sectors of industry, transport, training and energy. Private sector investment is expected to concentrate in the industrial sector, with indigenous industry to receive greater government support than in the past. EC funds are to be channelled primarily towards training - with particular emphasis on the long-term unemployed - and upgrading of the road and rail network. Public sector investment, sourced from the exchequer and generated from within public sector enterprises, is to be weighted towards training, energy, telecommunications and development of small and medium enterprises. A total of IPounds 3.7bn is earmarked for industry, followed by IPounds 3.1bn to be spent on training programmes. The plan notes that 75 per cent of the registered unemployed have no school qualifications and 40 per cent have not gone beyond primary school education. IPounds 1.1bn is to be spent on the primary road network, including completion of motorway links around the capital and improved access to Dublin port, while IPounds 330m is to be spent on public transport, including IPounds 200m for a light rail transit system to ease traffic congestion in Dublin. IPounds 1.2bn is targeted at local development intiatives, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, while IPounds 1.5bn is aimed at farming and forestry.</p>

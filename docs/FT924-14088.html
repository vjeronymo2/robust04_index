Its intention was to demonstrate how delightfully the products of the country's vineyards, normally drunk as aperitifs, go down when matched with food. And 25 writers about wine and purveyors thereof duly assembled for the treat . . . which they might have ended up enjoying if only the wine supplies hadn't run out. Only two bottles of each of the dozen varieties to be sampled had been provided which, even allowing for the 15 pours per bottle possible in a tasting, was never going to be enough.

Alas, when he came back with the seemingly statutory two bottles, the German red wine inside them was not only at best uninspiring, but one of them was decidedly off.</p>

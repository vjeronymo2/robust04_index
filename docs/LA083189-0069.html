			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOOTBALL '89;  </P> <P> VALLEY PAC-8 CONFERENCE;  </P> <P> MID-VALLEY LEAGUE  </P> <P> Birmingham  </P> <P> COACH: Chick Epstein, 9th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 2-7; tied for 3rd in league, 2-5  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: "As our quarterback goes, we'll go," says Epstein of the  Braves. That places a lot of responsibility on the left arm of senior Danny  Larson (6-2, 185), a returning all-league performer who threw for more than  1,300 yards last year. Who will shoulder the load with Larson is another  matter. Grant transfer Jake Brescher (6-3, 170) has impressed Epstein at wide  receiver, and sophomore running back Daryl Moore, the son of former NFL player  Manfred Moore, will start. Up front, Epstein expects good things out of junior  center Jason Mansfield (6-3, 180), a second-team all-league selection who will  play a role in the frequent deployment of the shotgun offense. Mansfield is  just part of an inexperienced offensive line that includes Shaw Rast (5-11,  190), Donnell Grey (6-0, 230) and Robert Taracevich (6-0, 210), all starters  last season. On defense, Epstein is unsure about a defensive line that will be  composed almost entirely of newcomers. At linebacker, though, is junior Jon  Zuccaro, an honorable mention all-league selection who also might play  fullback. Also returning at linebacker is Anthony McComb (6-2, 200). In the  secondary, Larson, who was an all-league safety as a sophomore, will team with  Moore.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: "We have a lot of inexperience and a lot of kids who will play both  ways," Epstein said. Larson should have a big year, but Reseda and Monroe are  major obstacles in the league. "I hope we can -- and should -- do better than  last year," Epstein said. "We played well in the summer passing league, but  that doesn't mean anything."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Monroe  </P> <P> COACH: Dave Lertzman, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 9-2; 1st in league, 7-0  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Like league rival Birmingham, Monroe's fortunes will rest  heavily on a returning all-league quarterback. The Vikings' man will be senior  Jesse Wallace (5-11, 195) who, unfortunately for Lertzman, will have trouble  finding experienced targets. One receiver Lertzman does like is Gerrit Maxwell,  who broke his collarbone last season. Monroe's only returning offensive lineman  is senior Gerrard Taft (5-9, 195), who Lertzman calls "the hardest hitter on  the team." Junior Jason St. John (6-0, 200), a linebacker, also will play  center. Lertzman will also take a chance at tackle, using sophomore man-child  Paul Pedroza (6-4 1/2, 290), who has never played before. Another big but  inexperienced lineman is senior Casey Dugan (6-5, 250). The running game has  large shoes to fill with the graduation of Curtis Scott (1,943 yards). Lertzman  will look to second-team all-league linebacker Jim Rose (5-9, 170) to add the  tailback position to his chores. Junior Fabian Speights (6-0, 200) will round  out the backfield. On defense, many of the same names appear. Wallace will play  cornerback and Maxwell will play safety. Rose, St. John and Speights will play  linebacker. The line will be anchored by senior Tom Taylor (6-0, 200), a 4.0  student who bench presses 330 pounds. Scott Christenson (6-0, 180), a senior  who didn't play last year, also will play on the line along with candidates  Dugan, Pedroza or junior Darnell Lowe (6-3, 200).  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Monroe went unbeaten in Valley Pac-8 Conference play last year, but a  repeat performance will be difficult. Still, with Wallace, the Vikings have a  shot at winning another title. "We appear to have good athletes. If we go in  thinking we have a chance, then we'll be competitive," Lertzman said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reseda  </P> <P> COACH: Joel Schaeffer, 12th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 9-2; 2nd in league, 6-1  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Schaeffer appears to have another solid if inexperienced  team, with its strength lying mainly in its linemen. Division I recruit Jason  Kiederling (6-5, 265), a senior, will keep opposing defensive lines on edge at  offensive tackle, and senior center Arturo Rodriguez (6-0, 195) also could be a  force. Guards Edgar Fernandez and Michael Green are Schaeffer's "clones" at  tackle: Both are 5-10, 190-pound juniors. Reseda is green at the skill  positions. Schaeffer has tabbed Andre Jackson (5-9, 170) at quarterback.  Jackson backed up graduated Coley Kyman last year and has no experience  starting. The Regents will move tight end Donald Johnson (6-1, 205) to  fullback, but the tailback situation remains uncertain. Joey Tushnet (5-9, 170)  and Steven Culp (5-10, 170) are the two candidates fighting for the job.  Schaeffer has confidence in the defense, though, which traditionally is strong.  Rodriguez and Johnson form a tough tandem at inside linebacker, and Schaeffer  is high on junior defensive end Marco Mendoza (5-11, 190). Jackson enjoys  playing outside linebacker "He doesn't want to play quarterback unless I let  him play defense," Schaeffer said. In the defensive secondary, Rocky Tribble  (6-3, 200) will play cornerback and wide receiver Herman Williams (6-1, 180)  will play safety.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Schaeffer knows that it will be an unusual year for the Regents in  that they are green at the skill positions. "We're going to have to claw and  scratch for everything we get," he said. "We've got some seedlings that we're  planting." Considering the fact that Reseda has won 31 of its past 35 games,  it's likely to be a bumper crop.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P> <P> COACH: Kenji Mochizuki, 3rd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 3-6; 3rd in league, 2-5  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: With 18 starters returning, the Wolves may contend for the  league title in 1989. Four talented running backs will share time but Mochizuki  has been impressed by senior Birmingham transfer Diallo Frazier (5-7, 155).  Joining Frazier in what looks to be a ground-oriented game is senior Tony  Indecato (6-0, 175), junior Aaron Gadasy (5-5, 140) and sophomore Harold  Boudeux (6-0, 175). That group will run behind an experienced offensive line:  all of last year's starters return, including by senior tackle Lae Freeman  (6-5, 265). He is joined by fellow seniors Edvin Babayovo (6-3, 225, guard),  Jeremy Gross (6-0, 206, center), Corey Borns (6-0, 235, guard) and Fernando  Frausto (6-0, 235, tackle). "We're going to win with our line," Mochizuki says.  The Wolves have a new quarterback in senior Roy Vasich (6-2, 180), last year's  backup who "has improved quite a bit," according to Mochizuki. Vasich will  throw to senior wide receiver Cuneyt Karacuha (5-11, 165). The Wolves also  boast experience on defense, with Babayovo at linebacker and Freeman and  Frausto as down linemen. Mochizuki is "really high" on junior lineman Jose  Martinez (5-10, 210). Senior David Hwang (5-11, 170) will anchor the defensive  secondary at cornerback.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Van Nuys is playing in a league without a dominating favorite, leaving  the race wide open. The Wolves have experience on their side, but Mochizuki is  hesitant to say anything. "I don't like to predict," he said. "I don't know  what (the rest of the league) has."  </P></p>

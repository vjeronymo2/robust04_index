			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bernard Estrade] </F>   [Excerpts] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, May 19 (AFP) -- A UN  plane made two safe flights in and out of Tuzla airport Thursday  [19 May], flying the first humanitarian mission to the northern  Moslem enclave since the reopening of the airport in March, UN  officials said. NATO stepped up air cover of the airport, with  an AC-130 Spectre hovering above the airport in the morning and  several fighter planes flying over at low altitude, particularly  during unloading of the white Ilyushin 76 transport plane. It  landed two days after Bosnian Serb artillery shelled the airport  when another UN plane landed there, UN spokesmen said. [passage  omitted]    The first plane Thursday brought in material and equipment  --  including radar -- for the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in  Tuzla, a UN-declared safe area. On its second trip out of Tuzla  the plane evacuated five people needing medical treatment,  accompanied by nine members of their families, on behalf of the  UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It was the first  time since the solemn reopening of the airport by special UN  envoy Yasushi Akashi that a UN humanitarian mission has taken  place at the airport. UNHCR spokeswoman Radna Vikoren said the  agency hoped "security conditions will allow the airport to be  used again."    A third flight was expected to take place later in the day.  [passage omitted] The United Nations said there were no  problems Thursday and no Serb artillery fire when the Ilyushin  76 made two successful trips in and out of the airport, on a  circuit from Split to Tuzla to the Croatian capital Zagreb then  again through Tuzla before heading back to Split. The mainly  Moslem Bosnian army handed over control of the airport to the  UNPROFOR on March 22. Twenty-two flights carrying equipment for  UN forces stationed here landed at the airport through April 14,  but no humanitarian flights have yet arrived.</p>

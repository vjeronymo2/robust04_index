			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Vlasov] </F>   [Text] Pskov 7 April, TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev met on Thursday with his Swedish counterpart  Margaretha af Ugglas in the town of Pskov to consider  possiblities of revitalizing the economy of Russia's  northwestern region.    The Pskov region attracted the attention of Swedish  businessmen by its rich natural resources and developed  industry. They also hope to benefit considerably by taking part  in rehabilitation of the region's ailing agrarian sector.    After discussing ways of improving the Pskov region's  economy  by joint efforts and seeing the sights of the old Russian town,  Mrs. af Ugglas left for Sweden.    Meanwhile, her Russian counterpart visited the Pechora  segment of the Russian-Estonian border, where he was informed  about the construction of border facilities and about the  current situation on the border which has been deteriorating  with every passing day.    Senior officials of the regional administration told the  Russian foreign minister that they would like to improve ties  with the Baltic republics rather than to tighten a border  regime. Nevertheless, Kozyrev said, it would be better to  reinforce the border with technical means than with bodies of  Russian soldiers.    On Thursday night, the Russian foreign minister flew off  back  to Moscow.</p>

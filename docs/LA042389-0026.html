			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FENCE FACTS  </P> <P> For several weeks now, Andy Lang has given misinformation regarding building  codes in the Southern California area (in general) and Los Angeles in  particular.  </P> <P> Regarding last week's Handyman Q&amp;A column ("Discuss Fence With Your  Neighbor"), permits are almost never required for fences, if one stops below  the 6-foot height in rear and sides, and 30 inches at the front. A variance,  without a conventional building permit is sufficient if those heights are  exceeded.  </P> <P> Hope this information is helpful -- before the building departments are flooded  with requests for fence permits.  </P> <P> ANTHONY NICOLETTI  </P> <P> Studio City  </P> <P> Nicoletti is an architect.  </P> <P> </P></p>

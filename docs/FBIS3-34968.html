He stated that the government  supports a ceasefire, provided that it is not used by the outlaw  troops as camouflage for launching military offensives and  subsequently hampering the peace endeavors.    Addressing the regular weekly forum of the Foreign Ministry  yesterday, Dr. Abu-Salih said that many messages and statements  recently had been issued by French, American, and UN  personalities in relation to battles taking place in the south,  noting that these messages and statements espoused that the  Sudan Government was determined to end the southern question  militarily. The foreign minister said that the miscarriage of  the round of peace talks in Abuja two days ago was due to the  interference of western circles, which are against the  achievement of peace in Sudan. Dr. Abu-Salih described  allegations of miltiary offensives by the government on  civilians in the south as completely false and baseless. He  added that John Garang and his companions are using civilians as  human shields, referring to the outlaws' determination to keep  ammunition stores and military at [words indistinct] and more  civilian areas. Dr. Abu-Salih reiterated the government's  commitment to cooperate with regard to delivering relief  materials to war-affected citizens through Operation Lifeline,  Sudan.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Accountancy Column: Laying it on the line for future auditing standards A BOLD red line slices across the black and white cover of the exposure drafts issued earlier this week by the Auditing Practices Board. To certain senior accountants contemplating the birth pangs of the new standard-setting regime, it represents more than a simple design feature. It was at an 'awayday' conference for members of the Auditing Practices Committee at the Gatwick Hilton three years ago that Mr Graham Stacy, a technical partner with Price Waterhouse (and now representing the firm for its work as auditor to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International), purposefully picked up a red felt-tipped pen. With it he drew a horizontal line across a blank flipchart. Above it he a placed a wiggly line, and on top of that a second straight line running along the peaks. The lowest line represented existing auditing standards; the middle one, the quality of auditing actually achieved by the large accountancy firms; and the top one, the firms' own ideal standards. 'Some members of the committee were arguing that we should set auditing standards very high to give firms something to aim for,' he recalls. 'I said the big firms always have to keep their own standards far higher, so even when they fall short of perfection, they are still clear of the minimum. Otherwise they won't be able to survive.' 'Stacy's red line' - which has become part of the folklore at Price Waterhouse - has jumped sharply up the page following the publication of the first salvo of proposed documents from the Auditing Practices Board (APB) on Tuesday. It also stands as a symbolic high-water mark below which the old Auditing Practices Committee (APC) has drowned. The APC may have seemed a significant step forward when it was created to draw up coherent guidelines in the late 1970s, but a decade later it was looking very stale. That was the main conclusion of discussions held by the APC at the same Gatwick venue, and in a widely-leaked letter penned afterwards by Mr David Tweedie, the final chairman of the APC and now chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, and Mr Ian Brindle, his predecessor and now senior partner at Price Waterhouse. The APC was underfunded, unwieldy and undemocratic. It was far too secretive in its operations. And its decision-making was continually being slowed down by its owners, the six members of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies: the Institutes of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, in Scotland and in Ireland, the Chartered Institutes of Management Accountants and of Public Finance and Accountancy, and the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. The new, improved APB, which began operations early last year, looks in much better shape to address the criticisms facing auditors in the 1990s, even if it is still owned by CCAB. There are 18 voting members - of which half are not practising accountants - and four observers. A series of working groups is beginning to tackle an ambitious series of future auditing standards. 'Exposing' the drafts for public comment and focusing on users of accounts as the APB's customer is a prudent if obvious step. The process of producing in plain English just two types of statement - standards (which are mandatory) and practice notes (which are best practice on emerging issues) - is a welcome relief from the range of confusing edicts with varying degrees of authority that were loftily pronounced in the past. On the downside, criticism of the APB's tardiness in getting to work over the last year are somewhat petty. A more significant concern - how independent the body can be - can only be judged over time. But its refusal to tow the line of the accountancy firms - which argued against the expanded audit report it has now put forward - bodes well. In place of a meaningless, pro forma paragraph that has been almost universally ignored, the auditors' report in companies' accounts will from next year become a dense and detailed page of text, which users of financial information will do well to turn to very early in their perusal. Some will see the proposals as defensive. Much of the text will still have a standard - albeit lengthier - format. A good chunk (if not provided elsewhere in the accounts) will spell out that it is the directors and not the auditors who are responsible for the accounts being true and fair. The number of qualified audit reports (present in just 6 per cent of UK companies last year) is likely to fall, because auditors will no longer be required to qualify companies facing 'material' or 'fundamental' uncertainties in the following 12 months, provided they are satisfied that disclosure of these elements in the accounts is adequate. That will at least ensure any remaining qualifications are unequivocal, rather than in terms of unqualified approval 'subject to' certain items, as the current guidelines allow. At least on paper, auditors are being given greater powers to actively use their skills to detect these uncertainties, and cast their judgment forward as well as back across the previous year to which the financial statements relate. While the qualification will be lost, the proposed audit report will have a section flagging the uncertainties in compensation. But that raises two potential difficulties. First, the definition of 'fundamental' is likely to generate intense debate. The draft guidelines cite examples such as cash flow problems, inadequate borrowing facilities, major litigation and large debts falling due. Assessment of their significance may well prove highly contentious. Second, it will be difficult to tell how far companies will accept disclosure of these fundamental items in the new-style auditors' report. Theoretically, each would currently result in a qualified audit report. In reality, directors fight very hard to resist a qualification, and may have been able to conceal some important information from their shareholders up till now as a result. The hope is that some of these uncertainties that might previously have just escaped attracting a qualification will now be clearly flagged. But companies may fight equally hard to prevent disclosure, arguing, for example, that it would jeopardise their commercial position. A separate but vital point is the relationship between the APB and the Accounting Standards Board. The proposed auditing guidelines do nothing to clarify what constitutes 'true and fair' in accounts. Until new ASB standards have dealt with what Mr David Tweedie calls 'accounting fiddles', there is little the auditors can do. They can only be as effective as accounting standards allow, while finance directors hide behind these current standards. That point is reflected in the preface to the APB's 'going concern' draft, which calls on the ASB to develop a standard on the treatment of uncertainties. There is little sign yet that the ASB has taken the issue seriously in its own work programme. A final problem is how the new auditing standards will be policed. Mr Bill Morrison, chairman of the APB, talks about a 'twin barrel' approach. The Financial Reporting Review Panel is scrutinising companies, while the self-regulatory Joint Monitoring Unit of the accountancy bodies is watching the auditors, now armed with improved auditing guidelines. Unfortunately, like the deliberations between auditors and their clients, a great deal of the regulatory process remains behind closed doors. Whether that is inevitable or even desirable, it does little to remove the suspicion of accountants and auditors by the outside world. Users of accounts must hope that Stacy's red line does not open up new gaps below as it eagerly rises up the page of future APB documents.</p>

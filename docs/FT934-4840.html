			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Lucas moves will cost up to 280 jobs Lucas, the international engineering group, yesterday started a series of factory moves which will mean the loss of up to 280 jobs in the Cheltenham area of Gloucestershire. The group announced that manufacture of engine control systems at what was the Dowty Fuel Systems plant in Cheltenham would move to factories in Birmingham. That will create 100 new jobs in Birmingham and the 380 Cheltenham employees will be encouraged to apply. The Cheltenham factory will be used by Lucas Bryce, which manufactures diesel fuel injection systems. The lease on the Lucas Bryce plant at Hucclecote, Gloucestershire, will expire soon and its 330 employees will move to Cheltenham. However, the new Lucas plant at Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, is expecting to recruit more staff.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 26 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the state  enterprise Cuba Petroleo (Cupet) confirmed it could receive  Mexican crude oil to be refined at the almost-halted Cienfuegos  Refinery to supply the domestic market.    Juan Fleites, director of Cupet, which is negotiating a  joint  venture for the plant with its Mexican counterpart, Mex-Petrol,  told NOTIMEX the following: "Should we reach an agreement on the  refinery, we could start receiving Mexican crude oil."    Since March, Cupet and Mex-Petrol have been studying  alternatives to extending and modernizing the Cienfuegos  refinery, the country's largest refinery, located on the  south-central coast.    Yesterday, Carlos Ferrer Argote, Mexican Foreign Relations  Secretariat Caribbean affairs director, said the negotiations  could include the supply of crude oil. He added: "Both parties  are working to yield results in the best of interests. We are  trying to conclude as soon as possible, but it is difficult to  conduct studies."    The lack of oil and the shortage of spare parts for its  Soviet-made infrastructure are keeping the refinery, which can  refine 3 million tons annually, almost halted.    Cuba is also negotiating with Colombia the supply of oil to  offset the fuel deficit that emerged from the drop of purchases  from the defunct Soviet Union. The purchases dropped from 13  million tons to less than half that amount between 1991 and  1992. According to the agreement, Cupet and Mex-Petrol will  invest $200 million to start production at the extended and  modernized plant, to supply the domestic market, and to export  surpluses.    Ferrer, who was in Merida, Yucatan State, attending the 19th  Caribbean Studies Association Congress, pointed out exports  could be sold to countries in the region. He also said the  Cuban-Mexican study is analyzing "an ample spectrum of crude  oils, from the lightest to the heaviest, to match the quality of  supply to the prices of hydrocarbons and their byproducts."    Cupet's director confirmed the project has already  determined  its investment strategy: Each party will invest $100 million,  half the total investment. The Mexican contribution will be as  follows: 50 percent in resources and 50 percent in joint venture  assets, which will be charged to the Cuban debt. The Cuban and  Mexican central banks have an agreement that, among other  issues, allows the settling of the $310 million Cuban debt  through "swap" [previous word in English] operations.</p>

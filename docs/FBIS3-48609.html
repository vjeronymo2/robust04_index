The country's smallest party, in a political statement read  by its chairperson Megawati Sukarnoputri at the commemoration of  its 21st anniversary here last night, said a `single majority'  is not in line with the 1945 Constitution or the Guidelines of  State Policy decreed by the People's Consultative Assembly last  year.    "The Constitution says the state protects `all Indonesians'  based on the national unity for their good and welfare," the  statement said, adding that the state must rise above the  interests of individuals or groups in pursuing this goal.    "The system of deliberation leading to a consensus is the  core of Pancasila democracy, while the `single majority' clearly  deviates from this spirit," it said.    "`Single majority' is also in opposition to the spirit of  openess, cooperation, and ethics in politics," the statement  said. It added that the system tends to discourage people from  observing the Guidelines of State Policy.    "Democracy means that sovereignty comes from the people, for  the people and is supervised by the people," it said while  throwing doubts on the congruity between the system of single  majority and democracy.    The PDI also urged government to avoid the unnecessary cost  of development paid by the people in the second 25-year  development program.</p>

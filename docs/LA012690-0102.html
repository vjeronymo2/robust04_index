			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 12 INJURED IN RIOTING AT OVERCROWDED JAIL  </P> <P> Black and Latino inmates armed with homemade knives brawled at an overcrowded  county jail Thursday, and 12 were injured, three critically, officials said.  </P> <P> Inmates retreated to their cells and order was restored after deputies entered  the cellblock armed with electric stun guns.  </P> <P> The brawl, attributed to overcrowding and racial tensions, occurred in a  cellblock designed to hold 24 inmates, but which held 100 prisoners at the  time, jail Cmdr. Ben McLaughlin said. A similar racially motivated fight at the  jail 15 miles east of San Diego left four inmates injured Dec. 13.  </P></p>

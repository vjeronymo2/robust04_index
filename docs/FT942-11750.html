			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bavarian bank plans DM1bn rights issue Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank, one of Germany's two big Bavaria-based banks, is planning a one-for-10 rights issue. The terms will be fixed around June 20 and the issue of 2.3m new shares is likely to raise about DM1bn (Dollars 588m). The bank, which recently reported a 33 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for last year, said it needed the money in the context of strong business growth last year and in the early months of the current year. In the first two months of the year, Hypo-Bank's group operating profits rose by 17 per cent, reflecting the bank's strong position in the buoyant mortgage lending market. The issue is the fourth from a leading German bank in the past six months. The most recent was Dresdner Bank's innovative DM1.2bn equity placing with international investors, details of which were announced last month. Of Germany's biggest five banks, only Deutsche Bank, the largest, has said it will not tap the equity market for the time being.</p>

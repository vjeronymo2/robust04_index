			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (22): Freedom to switch is the big advantage - Unit-linked bonds THE INSURANCE industry has an answer to unit trusts. It is the unitised single-premium investment bond. As with a unit trust (see C for Collective investments), your money is invested in units of a managed fund, whose value will fluctuate in line with the value of the fund. When you want to take the profits, you surrender the policy, and receive the full value of the units you have bought. Another similarity with unit trusts is that you can buy bonds which invest in specialist geographical areas, fixed interest securities, money market instruments, or property. But the bond is still a life assurance policy. This adds extra complications, expenses, and tax-planning opportunities. Disadvantages, compared with unit trusts, include the charges, with generally higher commissions to intermediaries (see F for Fees versus commissions), and the fact that you must buy life assurance. The bid-offer spread, as with unit trusts, is normally around 5 per cent. If you die, your dependant will receive the value of the bond as life assurance. This can affect returns, although there is no case for taking out a unit-linked bond as life assurance in its own right. This can be done much more cheaply. What of the difference in returns? According to Finstat, the average UK equity insurance fund rose by 45.1 per cent in the five years to the beginning of 1993. Over 10 years, they rose by 265.6 per cent on average. These figures assume that income is reinvested, but do not include the bid-offer spread. Unit trusts in the UK general sector, for which comparative statistics include the bid-offer spread, did better. Over five years, average growth with income reinvested was 53.6 per cent, according to Finstat, and over 10 years average growth was 333.7 per cent. This gap makes bonds hard to justify on investment grounds. But their 'switching' facility could be an advantage. One bond can be used as the shell for any number of funds. Switching between them can usually be done for a very low charge, and in some cases for free. Those prepared to try active management of their portfolio might therefore prefer insurance bonds to unit trusts where, even if you are switching between trusts run by the same management company, you will usually have to pay the full initial fee when you switch. Then comes the tax argument. No capital gains tax is payable on gains - but this is not much of an incentive for the vast majority of British savers, who pay no CGT in any case. Basic-rate tax is paid by the funds at source. Top-rate payers can then be charged the 15 per cent difference between the basic and top bands when the bond is surrendered. But tax-planners can use the reliefs available to avoid this. Up to 5 per cent of the original value of the bond can be withdrawn each year, free of income tax. This can therefore be carried on for 20 years. Top-rate tax will still be payable when the bond is finally encashed, but the painful sounding 'top-slicing relief' will apply. Any profit made over the lifetime of the bond is averaged out over the number of years for which it was in place. The result is added to the investor's income to arrive at the tax due for that year. However, tax management must be done very carefully - a withdrawal of more than 5 per cent in one year can trigger a liability to the extra 15 per cent tax. In the last two years, the life industry's most successful product has been a new kind of bond which is sold to people who often do not need the tax advantages - the with-profits bond. These bonds are a hybrid of the unit-linked and the with-profits approaches. Your investment buys units in the main life fund of the company concerned (see W for With-profits policies), so it will include holdings in property, equities and gilts. Each year, when bonuses are announced, they are added to the value of each unit. So, in theory, as soon as you want to surrender your bond, you will receive your units, plus the value of all accrued bonuses. During 1991, double-figure annual, or reversionary, bonus rates were quoted, which many found tempting. However, less publicity was given to the fact that most life companies maintained the right to make a 'market value adjustment' (MVA). If a big reversionary bonus was followed by a fall in the market, the company could use the MVA to pay out less than the level of the total bonuses. Many investors who had not realised the investments were meant for the long term surrendered the bonds early, only to find that the MVA had bitten. In many cases, they were left with less money than they had originally invested. The MVA is a fatal flaw in a with-profits bonds, which destroys its advantages over unit-linked bond. It is best to look for one which makes guarantees about the MVA - for example, some promise not to apply it on certain anniversaries, or on death, or on regular income.</p>

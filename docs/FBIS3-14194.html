When several states, including big powers, such as the PRC,  Russia, and France, three major powers that enjoy the veto right  at the UN Security Council, change their positions, this means  that Iraq's steadfastness has paid off, and that the gambles of  the United States and Britain have failed, although they have  chosen to oppose changes in the new international position by  forcing their evil wishes on others. The United States and  Britain have realized that continued enforcement of the embargo  was merely an impasse that causes whoever chooses to stick to it  to collapse in terms of political and international positions.    As the leader of the camp hostile to the national yearnings  and ambitions of other peoples who are not about to let go of  their independence, the United States is bound to forfeit  further allies, even if these belong in the camp of the second-  or third-rate powers that, in 1990 and 1991, rushed to support  the U.S. aggression on and siege of Iraq. America's loss will  then be compounded and the United States will not be in a  position to lead the world. There will be a dwindling in its  international standing, after it had been afforded the  opportunity to gain exclusive control of the world by the former  Soviet Union.    The world Zionist movement and the United States wanted  their  aggression on Iraq and the sanctions to create conditions that  would make it impossible for any other power to take them on.  Such a scenario has certainly failed to materialize, but the  Zionists and the Americans continue to pursue that objective.  The credit for the failure of that goal to come to fruition  must go to the steadfastness of the Iraqi people and the  brilliance of Saddam Husayn. The forces of aggression assumed  that where the comprehensive 30-state aggression and the page of  treachery and treasons failed, the comprehensive siege would  succeed.    Iraq's steadfastness and President Saddam Husayn's historic  leadership are the most outstanding features of the 20th  century's most outstanding and ferocious battle. Neither  ancient nor the modern history has seen such a massive array of  forces ranged against such a small-sized people with a  disproportionately strong will-power. Iraq's steadfastness  illustrates that the Washington-Tel-Aviv plot to partition Iraq  and defeat its nationalist movement, led by the peerless leader  Saddam Husayn, has collapsed, with the Americans and Zionists  left without any viable forces to help them weaken Iraq's unity.    The split in the ranks of the world's leading powers at the  United Nations is a heavy blow to the alliance, which had  attracted 30 nations by trickery and misrepresentations. If  there is a lesson to be learned from the split at the Security  Council, it is that Iraq's stamina and pan-Arab and socialist  and independent policies have won the day. It is such  principles that have shielded Iraq and its national unity, made  it a role model, and turned the siege into an ever-increasing  burden for the aggressors.</p>

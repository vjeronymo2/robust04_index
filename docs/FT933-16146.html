			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Georgia scorns Russian threats Georgia yesterday shrugged off Russian threats of sanctions, aimed at imposing a peace settlement on it and its separatist region of Abkhazia, as it emerged that Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, was almost killed on Sunday, writes Leyla Boulton. An aide said a shell narrowly missed Mr Shevardnadze's car as he was driving through the war-torn province, where hundreds of people have died in almost a year of fighting. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, warned on Sunday that Russia would take harsh measures unless the two sides signed a peace agreement within two days. However, a spokesman for the Georgian Foreign Ministry said sanctions would make no difference as the republic was 'under an economic blockade from Russia anyway'.</p>

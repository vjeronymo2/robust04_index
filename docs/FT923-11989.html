			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Owner-managers' optimism faulted BUSINESSES that are owner-managed expect to achieve an average 4.8 per cent growth over the next 12 months, according to a survey of 900 businesses conducted by Mori for accountants Ernst and Young. Such confidence by owner-managers reveals a 'disturbing expectation gap,' given economic forecasts of zero or negative growth over the same period, Ernst and Young said. The firm urged companies to be realistic: 'We suspect that the estimates are based on hope rather than hard evidence. Forecasts that cannot be supported will undermine confidence among companies' financiers.' A total of 63 per cent of owner-managed businesses thought the economy would improve over the next year and 66 per cent said the election result had increased confidence. The companies surveyed all had annual sales of between Pounds 5m and Pounds 100m - those with sales of more than Pounds 50m were most likely to think the economy would improve. In spite of forecasts for growth, businesses expected staffing levels to remain constant, suggesting that productivity remains below desired levels, according to Ernst and Young. 'If output does not increase sufficiently, or possibly even if it stays constant, staffing levels could be reduced further,' the survey found. The majority of businesses (68 per cent) said their financial goals had remained unchanged over the past six months and they had no plans to raise additional finance. Ernst and Young questioned whether businesses would be able to increase output from existing resources. In general, the businesses surveyed found their banks helpful, although banks in the Midlands were seen as less helpful than elsewhere. Manufacturing companies also viewed their bankers as less helpful than businesses in the retail, distribution and service sectors. Managing in a Zero Growth Economy, July 1992 survey.

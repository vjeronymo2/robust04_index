			<p>BFN     [Text] At the last experts meeting about the Pact of  Stability in Athens, Slovakia succeeded in pushing through its  demands. This has created conditions to enable the Pact of  Stability to become a suitable platform for the implementation  of the foreign policy interests of Slovakia. This was said by  Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik in an interview given to the Press  Agency of the Slovak Republic in connection with the preparation  of his official visit to France, where he is to discuss, among  other things, this initiative. Prime Minister Moravcik envisages  that, at this stage, the drafting of the documents for the Pact  of Stability is acceptable to Slovakia. In this connection, he  stressed that the pact unequivocally respects and promotes the  principle of the inviolability and immutability of borders.</p>

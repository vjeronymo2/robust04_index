			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Things threaten to fall apart: A failure of political will endangers South Africa's transition to democracy Will we, five or 10 years from now, look back on the events of the past few weeks in South Africa and say: That was when it all started? That was when South Africa's dream of a stable, prosperous, multiracial nation turned to ethnic nightmare? Every South African, every international investor, every foreign government  -everyone with a constructive interest in the African continent - must hope that scenario is mere hysterical fantasy. Many believe it is: they argue that the far right's support is minimal and the strength of the military overwhelming; that South Africa's security forces can crush violent dissent from the black and white right, which have vowed to resist April's all-race elections and missed their final chance on Saturday to register for the poll, so casting doubts over whether a poll can be conducted in all parts of the country. But if no one can quite believe that South Africa could join the list of ethnic horror stories of our time - it is a fate too ghastly to contemplate  -the country's politicians have yet to demonstrate the will to avert such an outcome. The collapse of trilateral talks between the government, the African National Congress and the rightwing Freedom Alliance illustrates a spectacular failure of political will on all sides. A deal was within reach which might have brought at least a large proportion of the white far right and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party into elections, consolidating the centre and leaving only the lunatic fringes in violent opposition. But in the end, South Africa's politicians failed to reach out and take it. It is easy to heap most of the blame on Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi: he shouts at journalists, insults ambassadors, exasperates businessmen and, in the words of political columnist Ken Owen, of the Johannesburg Sunday Times, 'has alienated his democratic friends, here and abroad, by petulant quarrels . . . surrounded himself with eccentric foreigners and sycophants . . . (and) drifted into shabby alliances with bantustan leaders and rightwing racists' - among them Eugene Terre'Blanche, leader of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB). Chief Buthelezi is his own worst enemy. But if his behaviour is outrageous, his demands for constitutional change are not: one can question his motives, his reliability as a negotiator, his willingness to contest free elections. But his basic constitutional demand is far from unreasonable: he wants a federal South Africa, arguing that such a model would best cater for one of most ethnically fragmented societies on earth. No issue is so central to South Africa's future: will the political system guarantee ethnic minorities real power, or relegate them to the role of permanent, impotent opposition? Every democracy is, in some sense, the dictatorship of the majority. But can South African democracy survive if the constitution creates permanent losers, who can never hope to rule? Can it prosper if a significant minority of the electorate rejects the legitimacy of the constitution. Federalism would offer regional minorities, such as the Zulus, a chance to secure a political base, and use it to keep the majority - ruling from the centre - in check. But the ANC is suspicious of this argument: for its goal has always been to create a colour-blind South Africa where ethnicity is subsumed in a single nationhood. (Afrikaner Volksfront leader General Constand Viljoen mocks this, saying nations cannot be built 'like you make instant coffee': a little black, a little white, a little bit of coloured . . .) Still, the ANC seems willing to accept the need to accommodate Afrikaner ethnicity. For though it is easy to dismiss the white far right as neo-fascist racists, the ANC accepts that some ordinary decent Afrikaners also want a homeland, or volkstaat. Indeed, though the deal has since fallen through, the ANC agreed in principle to establish such a volkstaat after the elections, with a separate Afrikaner chamber in parliament to work out the details. But when it comes to assuaging Zulu fears of domination, the ANC draws the line: they believe Chief Buthelezi's only goal in arguing for federalism is to perpetuate his power in a tribal state called KwaZulu. While they are prepared to allow the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini to remain a symbolic monarch under Natal's new constitution, they refuse Chief Buthelezi the strong provincial powers he demands. It is almost as though the ANC accepts that whites may fear blacks - but that blacks may not fear other blacks. Yet the history of African decolonisation suggests the highest price is usually paid by Africans. So, after 2 1/2 years of stop-start constitutional negotiations, the gulf between the rightwing and the ANC remains as wide as ever. The ANC believes it needs a strong central state to carry out its sacred charge: to empower blacks economically, after centuries of deprivation. And the right wants regional autonomy to protect itself if the ANC uses that central power to oppress rather than to uplift. Yet even some ANC officials believe the party did not try hard enough to accommodate the Freedom Alliance. It could have conceded marginally greater powers to regions, including limited regional taxation, and offered to entrench these powers in the final constitution. Such a deal was on the table, agreed between the Freedom Alliance and government last year, but the ANC rejected it. In the end, the ANC made a purely tactical offer: two ballots, but nothing on regional powers. They won the tactical battle, but lost the moral high ground. 'I put myself 10 years down the road and I say: should we have been so stubborn on this and that? Was it worth it?' asks one ANC official. His concern is echoed by a government negotiator: 'Is the ANC really prepared to accept a civil war to ensure central government has overriding powers on health policy?' Even now, it is not too late to avert this grim prospect, whatever legal deadlines have passed. Parliament could retroactively extend the election registration deadline. Creative solutions could be found to allow last-minute participation, but only if parties find the will to reach real agreements, and not just move deadlines. At least all parties say they are still committed to negotiations, and have stopped short of an overt call to violence. There is a chance that the white far right could yet be persuaded to participate: both the ANC and AVF tried hard to do a deal, and may yet succeed. But the breach with Inkatha appears permanent. Inkatha negotiator Ben Ngobane accuses the ANC of 'sacrificing national unity for power'; it is far from clear that the ANC is willing to reverse that order of preference. Either way, April's elections will almost certainly go ahead, however violently the right resists. Government officials vow that they will be 'ruthless' in suppressing dissent (with full ANC support). As one government official says: 'If the fight is on, then it is on. We will act with full force right at the beginning and wipe them out.' But one can be forgiven for wondering whether the right - the Zulu impis (war parties) and conservative whites with military training and access to commercial explosives from the mines and, possibly, to larger arms from military armouries - can be crushed so easily. Neither is a majority, even within their own ethnic group; but each, and especially both together, can cause havoc through sabotage and terrorism, and a sharp increase in serious township violence. Ben Ngobane warns: 'The constitution should reflect the diversity of South Africa. If it does not, there is every chance that there will be no new South Africa.' Dr Ngobane is almost certainly wrong. The new South Africa will be born on schedule; but it could prove less stable, prosperous and democratic than seemed possible only months ago. South Africa's politicians can step back from the brink - but first they must find the will to do so.</p>

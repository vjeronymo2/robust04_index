			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Ministers accused on Ulster committee Labour yesterday accused the government of engaging in 'gerrymandering at its worst' by allotting representatives of Ulster's nationalist community only one seat on the new 13-member Northern Ireland select committee. The opposition, however, failed in its attempt to replace Tory nominees. As MPs cleared the way for the new body to begin work soon after Easter, Mr Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, charged ministers with misrepresenting Labour's parliamentary strength by giving it only two seats. Mr McNamara said ministers were setting up the committee in return for support from the Ulster Unionist party's nine MPs in a 'squalid' deal to shore up an 'increasingly shaky' government. The formation of the committee - widely seen as a symbol of the government's commitment to the province's unionist majority - 'reduces still further' the prospects of agreement on a devolved Ulster assembly with a broad Irish dimension, he said. MPs from both leading unionist parties spoke in support of the committee but Mr Eddie McGrady, the MP for South Down who is set to be the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party's sole representative, said his party had not been consulted on it. MPs rejected a series of Labour motions seeking to replace Tory nominees for the committee with its own representatives. The original motion setting out the names of the committee members was then approved without a vote. In Belfast, loyalist terrorists yesterday launched a gun and rocket attack on Sinn Fein offices and said they would continue to target Sinn Fein and the IRA whether or not they accepted the Downing Street declaration. No one was injured in the attack, for which the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters admitted responsibility. Sinn Fein later called on Dublin to join it in pressing for a public inquiry into allegations of collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and agents of the British government to attack nationalists.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marcia Carmo: "The Discreet Charm of the </F> Minister"]    [Text] Brasilia--On a trip between New York and Tokyo,  Fernando Henrique Cardoso enchanted the Japanese flight  attendants who, in tolerable English, wanted to know where he  buys his beautiful ties. Patiently, he ended up talking about  his work and his trip, his last as foreign minister, eight  months ago. This kind of disinterested attention is one of the  secrets of Fernando Henrique's success in making even enemies  like him, despite monthly inflation rates of 40 percent. He  maintains his charm and credibility despite the current economic  situation and partial defeat of his stabilization plan at the  hands of Congress.    "I do not know the reason for this charisma, I only know I  have the deepest admiration for him and really envy him for it,"  admits Deputy and former Minister Roberto Campos (PPR-RJ)  [Progressive Renewal Party, Rio de Janeiro State]. "This success  of his is a mystery. With inflation rates like these, I would  have been tarred and feathered." The enigmatic success of  Fernando Henrique, 62--a senator, the son of a military officer,  and grandfather of three--generates envy, especially within the  administration. It is believed in some offices along the  Esplanade, for example, that his secret has to do with being in  the good graces of the media. "Fernando is incredible,"  President Itamar Franco never tires of repeating when people ask  him why the finance minister holds onto his job.    "I do not know whether I would be as lucky with the press,"  he commented, recently. Itamar uses very few words to justify  his faith in his government's fourth finance minister. "Our  friendship is fraternal. I believe in his work, and his plans  make sense, logical sense."  <H5>  Fascination </H5>   Still, the president is also impressed by Fernando  Henrique's  personality; he finds him an intelligent academic. It is  stimulating to deal with him, notes a diplomat who worked with  Fernando Henrique for seven months at Itamaraty. Perhaps this  explains the fascination that even his closest aides feel for  him. "The minister has an electrifying personality, and anyone  who talks with him is almost bound to be charmed."    A man of many interests--he adores politics, science and  technology, theater, music, the visual arts, and buying  meringues at the corner bakery--Fernando Henrique is genuine,  according to those who work with him. This could be yet another  explanation for why he is still unscathed despite the economic  crisis.    "The finance minister has worked alone. He is his own man,  whether in the Executive or the Legislative Branch," argues  former Minister Mailson da Nobrega, who once held the same  portfolio and is now a successful businessman in Sao Paulo.  Mailson took over the economy during the Sarney administration  when inflation was running at about 15 percent a month. By the  time he got out, the rate had risen to the incredible level of  84 percent. Even so, he was not scorned. Which also goes to show  that the Fernando Henrique phenomenon has occurred before.  <H5>  Secret </H5>   "Today I can walk the streets in peace, and people even  mention me with a certain affection," Mailson reports. He tries  to explain that charm is not enough to bewitch the voters in  times of high inflation rates. "Credibility is the secret," he  said. "In Fernando Henrique's case, this is explained by his  background, his resume, integrity, and work ethic." Mailson and  a former minister in the Itamar administration who once occupied  FHC's chair but prefers to remain anonymous would almost go so  far as to say that Fernando Henrique is irreplaceable at the  helm of the economy.    "He is the tent pole that you had better not kick," remarked  Mailson. "He is not that good, but the possibility of replacing  him could lead to the uncertainty of hyperinflation," the other  former minister commented. Antonio Britto, a former colleague in  the Cabinet, is another who spares no praise for the finance  chief and his plans, even though he [Britto] did not show up for  last Thursday's vote on the provisional measures. "He tells the  country the truth. And since the country is tired of magicians  and lies, now it believes he really knows that the right road is  the one he wants us to take." Whatever the secret of Fernando  Henrique's success, and even with high inflation rates, the  number of letters addressed to the Ministry of Finance grows  with every passing day. Most are from women, who are  particularly concerned about his backaches.</p>

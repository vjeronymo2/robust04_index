			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: REMODELED 'PALACE'  </P> <P> Fans of "White Palace," the novel, may be surprised by "White Palace," the  movie.  </P> <P> Directed by Luis Mandoki for Universal Pictures, it stars James Spader as an  upscale advertising exec who falls for slatternly waitress -- and older woman  -- Susan Sarandon.  </P> <P> What was a fairly gritty, realistic story about two people from different  worlds and classes falling in love appears to have been largely homogenized  into a Hollywood fairy tale that omits or softens many of the book's  potentially offensive details.  </P> <P> Amy Robinson, who co-produced the film with Griffin Dunne and Mark Robinson,  disagrees with that assessment.  </P> <P> "We set out to tell a story -- not to make a slavish translation of a book,"  she says. "I believe the movie captures the feeling, sentiment, milieu and the  story of the book." Among the notable changes: The book's "pear-shaped"  waitress (with small breasts and a "monumental rear end") has become the slim  but curvaceous Sarandon. Spader's character is now less snobbish, Sarandon's  considerably less coarse -- gone are her racist and anti-Semitic attitudes, for  instance. Her heavy alcohol use -- a subject of his concern in the book -- now  seems almost romantic. And so on.  </P> <P> Robinson acknowledges that the film went through extensive re-editing --  including a decision to re-shoot the ending.  </P> <P> "Many people were involved" regarding the changes, she adds, including motion  picture group chairman Tom Pollock and other Universal executives.  </P> <P> Some alterations were made so recently that publicity materials distributed for  the film -- now being reprinted -- list cast members who didn't make the final  cut, and even an actress who was recast.  </P> <P> "White Palace" author Glenn Savan tells us he had nothing to do with the  screenplay, which was written by Ted Tally and Alvin Sargent.  </P> <P> "I had no real input," Savan says. "I feel what's on the screen reflects  someone else's artistic endeavor. I don't feel comfortable in commenting on  it." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries soar on sharp drop in consumer index US TREASURY bond prices soared yesterday as the market reacted to an unexpected sharp drop in the consumer confidence index which more than offset concern about supply ahead of the afternoon's two-year note auction. The benchmark 30-year government bond, which broke through the psychologically important 7 per cent yield barrier on Monday, continued to set new records yesterday. In the late afternoon, the long bond was 1 3/8 higher at 103 3/4 , yielding 6.824 per cent. Among shorter-dated maturities, the three-year note added 5/16 to 100 29/32 , yielding 4.286 per cent. The Federal Reserve refrained from operating in the open market, and Fed funds were changing hands at 2 15/16 per cent in late trading. Bond prices withstood an early round of selling and a slight decline in the Dow Jones Utility Average, which has lent support to the bond market's recent gains. Investor confidence in President Bill Clinton's economic package remains the main force underpinning the market's bullishness. News that February's consumer confidence index had fallen to 68.5 in February from 76.7 in January added to the market's euphoria. Bidding was weak at the treasury's afternoon Dollars 15.25bn two year note auction, with a bid-cover ration of 2.14 to 1. EUROPEAN bond prices proved volatile yesterday as concern about pressure on the weaker currencies prompted substantial switching between markets. The Spanish and Italian bond markets again bore the brunt of selling pressure. Spanish bonds fell more than half a point, following a  1/2 -point drop on Monday. Dealers said the Bank of Spain's defence of the currency was seen as a signal to sell bonds. In addition, short rates rose as high as 20 per cent, shaking out speculative positions in the bond market which had become too expensive to fund. ITALIAN bonds also lost ground as the lira's slide was exacerbated by political uncertainty ahead of this week's vote of confidence in the government. Bond prices slid nearly half a point, undermined further by the weak reception to the latest T-bill auction. FRENCH bonds also weakened as nervousness increased ahead of next month's election. Dealers are expecting the spread between the French and German markets, which has recently increased to about 85 basis points, to widen further ahead of the election, although the French market would still benefit from any reduction in German rates. AFTER rallying more than a point on Monday on expectations of a full-scale rate cut, the Danish bond market fell back again yesterday when the suggestion of a rate cut sparked pressure on the currency. Overnight rates rose as high as 20 per cent, prompting selling of Danish bonds. The spread between Danish and German bonds widened to 189 basis points from 176 basis points. GERMAN bund and UK gilt prices both ended slightly higher, but showed little fresh direction. The German bond market recovered from earlier weakness, benefiting from currency concerns in other markets. The gilts market remained firm, but lacked impetus, as dealers saw no sign of further interest rate cuts.</p>

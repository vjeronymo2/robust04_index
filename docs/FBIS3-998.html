Addressing a news conference in Pretoria, President de Klerk  said he would do everything possible in the next few days to  allay fears that general chaos could break out elsewhere in the  country. [passage omitted]    Referring to the Bophuthatswana debacle, Mr. de Klerk said  the government was considering prosecuting right wingers  involved in the invasion of the homeland. Possible violations  of Bophuthatswana and South African laws by AWB [Afrikaner  Resistance Movement] members and other members of the Afrikaner  Volksfront [National Front] were also being investigated.</p>

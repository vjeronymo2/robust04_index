			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Letter: Satisfied customer comes to defence of banks Sir, Over the past 12 months criticism has been heaped upon the banks for not passing on interest rate cuts to their customers and for their often quoted 'uncaring attitude' in dealings with their small business customers. I would like to redress the balance with our experience with Barclays Bank. We are a small (12 bedroom) country house hotel in Cornwall with average borrowings. We have benefited with a review of our monthly loan repayments at every interest rate cut including the most recent. I have been constantly in touch with the bank's branch in Bath which could not have been more helpful and patient in working out the best arrangement for us, including extending the length of the loan to help our cash flow position. The past two years have not been all one would wish them to be for the catering industry and Cornwall particularly has suffered with many owners being forced into liquidation. With that scenario we were apprehensive about whether Barclays would further extend its loan facilities to us last year when an opportunity to expand into the next door property proved irresistible even though the timing was not opportune. Not only did Barclays provide us with the loan, it has since extended an overdraft facility, accepting that while the business is marginally making a profit, our track record shows that once the country is out of recessionary conditions, we will be in a position to start reducing the overdraft. I am convinced that if more small businesses kept in touch with bank managers, keeping them up to date honestly with their financial situation then the banks would be in a better position to be more helpful.

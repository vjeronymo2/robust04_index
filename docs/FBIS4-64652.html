			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MAE: "Initial Investigation for `Purple' </F> Seems Inevitable"]    [Text] The Hague, 4 May (ANP) -- It is pretty much definite  that the first option to be investigated in the upcoming  government formation in the Netherlands is the "purple"  coalition comprising social democrats (PvdA [Labor Party]),  leftist liberals (D66 [Democrats 66]), and rightist liberals  (VVD [Peolple's Party for Freedom and Democracy]). Although, on  Wednesday [4 May] none of the newly elected floor leaders wanted  to make any explicit statement about the advice which they will  offer the Queen, it appears that an initial investigation is  inevitable.    With the four parties that have, since Thursday, become  "almost the same size," just as many combinations of three are  conceivable. A future coalition will consist of at least three  parties, now that a duo cannot count on a majority in the Second  Chamber.    During the election campaign, PvdA leader Wim Kok and his  VVD  counterpart, Frits Bolkestein, both ruled out a combination of  the PvdA, the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal], and the VVD,  meaning that there would be just three possibilities in the  upcoming formation talks.    In all these coalitions, the participation of Thursday's  biggest winner, Hans van Mierlo's D66, is essential. As one of  the four large parties, van Mierlo made it quite clear well  before the elections which coalition he felt deserved  preference. "That would be purple, purple, purple, and once  again purple," as a prominent D66 member of parliament  emphasized on Wednesday.    This arrangement, in fact, leaves little choice for the  other  major players in the formation. This applies in the first  instance to Kok, who, as the leader of the largest party, should  with reason have the initiative in forming the government. Due  to van Mierlo's preference, he is more or less compelled to  first set about trying to form a coalition of the PvdA, the D66,  and the VVD, even though the PvdA leader has made it known that  he certainly expects something more from a coalition between the  PvdA, the D66, and the CDA.    Also on Wednesday, Kok continued to keep his options open,  repeating what he always said during the election campaign. The  PvdA wants to work together with the D66 for "strong,  progressive support," and to form a government with a third  party. Whether this third party will be the CDA or the VVD  depends on the policy that can be followed with these parties.  One tough issue in particular for the PvdA leader is the future  of the social security system. "We feel that policy is more  important than `color,'" Kok said.    Nevertheless, he will probably have to tell the Queen on  Friday that she will not be able to back away from van Mierlo's  wish either. Two politicians from the PvdA and the D66, will  have to investigate next week whether serious coalition talks  are possible between the PvdA, the D66, and the VVD. It is  inevitable that these politicians will also make a courtesy call  to Brinkman. However, the CDA will get a real chance in the  government formation if it turns out that a "purple" coalition  looks impossible.</p>

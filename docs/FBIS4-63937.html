			<p>BFN     [Text] The signing of a Declaration of National Accord and  Unity took place in Tbilisi today. The ceremony was opened by  Academician Aleksandr Javakhishvili. Participants in the  meeting were addressed by the head of state, who spoke about the  great importance of the document.    This was followed by the signing of the declaration by  representatives of various public and political organizations.  Among the many signatories were the Association of Georgian  Professional Unions, the Liberal Democratic Party, the People's  Front, the Green movement, the Russo-Georgian Cultural Society,  the National Democratic Party, and the Citizens' Union.    At the end of the ceremony our correspondent spoke with  Eduard Shevardnadze and Giorgi Chanturia.    [Begin recording] [Shevardnadze] I think that this is the  beginning of a very important movement. I cannot say that the  declaration will solve all problems. However, the fact that it  was signed by such reputable political associations, forces and  public organizations and that we were all united by several  principles stemming from national interests, means that we have  embarked upon the path of unity in our struggle for the  salvation, independence, and democratic development of the  country.    As for the parties that are not represented here today, some  of them have stated that they need some time to make up their  mind. I think that if we do well and observe these principles,  they will also join us, and a single front that is to lead us to  a single Georgia will finally be formed.    [Chanturia] Unfortunately, we have not recently had the  luxury of holding political events like this. This is  undoubtedly a political event. I know that there will be many  demagogues and populists saying that the mere signing of  something does not mean much [words indistinct].    If we agree on these important principles, it will mean that  we have a future. Opponents may say that some forces will not  observe these principles. Those who will not are not going to  benefit from doing so. This declaration gives us an opportunity  to use it against any organization which has signed it and is  not observing it.    In any case, this document should have been signed. The  signing of this document has started off a major process. It  may be not so conspicuous, since there is no waving of flags and  destruction. Nevertheless, a very important political process  has started. I hope that if this process gains sufficient  momentum, we will be saved and will emerge as a state and a free  society. Not only will we defend and retain our independence,  but we will regain some of the lost ground as well. [end  recording]</p>

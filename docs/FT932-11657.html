			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Men to face unisex threat on annuities  -Lower payments could follow legal moves in EC IT IS a fact: women live longer than men. But a key opinion this week from the advocate-general of the European Court of Justice says that, when it comes to pensions, employers must forget all that. Those who have contributed more to women's pensions because they will draw them longer after retirement will, apparently, have to stop. The advice, if followed by the ECJ in its final ruling in June, could mean that men will receive lower monthly payments from an annuity bought upon retirement. The advice to the court follows its consideration of a group of cases led by the trustees to the pension scheme of Coloroll, the UK home furnishings company now in liquidation. The trustees asked the ECJ to clarify how they should carry out an earlier ruling in the case of Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange. In that ruling - on May 17 1990 - the court ruled pensions were deferred pay and that employers may not discriminate between sexes in pay awards. But pensions are a complicated subject, and employers needed guidance on the nuts and bolts of equalising them. Across Europe, both occupational and state pension schemes have, typically, allowed women to retire on full pension at 60 while requiring men to wait until 65. This difference in retirement ages meant, for instance, that male and female twins who joined an employer on the same day, and left for a new employer on the same day, had different transfer values. If they retired on the same day, the woman received a pension roughly 25 per cent higher than that of her brother; and if the employer bought an annuity out of a lump sum for both of them, he would have to pay more to buy the woman the same monthly income as her brother. Now, it appears as if this will come to an end. 'The mere fact that, in general, women live on average longer than men cannot, therefore, be a sufficient reason to provide for different treatment in the matter of contributions and benefits under occupational pension schemes,' the advocate-general said in his opinion. While they do live longer, there is no evidence that any one particular woman will live longer than any one particular man; and if sex is to be a guide to the size of pension, than the inclination to smoke or drink ought to be as well, the advocate-general added. The ruling has particular significance for those employers who finance pension benefits through the purchase of an annuity for each employee upon retirement, said John Cunliffe, a partner at solicitor McKenna and Co, which represented the Coloroll trustees. It also has huge implications for so-called money purchase schemes in which the employee receives a lump sum upon retirement, although the court has not been asked specifically to give an opinion on this matter. The question is how insurers are going to respond to the ruling. The advocate-general said there was no legal basis for requiring insurance companies which sell annuities to calculate rates on a unisex basis. But clues about what might happen can be gleaned from the US, where the Supreme Court made a similar ruling nearly 10 years ago. In broad terms, insurers there have cut men's annuity payments to the lower levels of women. And data culled from annuity rates offered by Equitable Life offer a picture of just how much difference there will be with unisex rates. An annuity paying Pounds 100 a month will cost a 65-year-old man Pounds 9,894, while a 65-year-old woman will pay Pounds 11,295. A monthly annuity purchased with Pounds 10,000 will buy a 65-year old man a benefit of Pounds 101.07 a month, but a woman of the same age will get only Pounds 88.53 for the same sum. Significantly, the ruling does not affect those who receive a lump sum from their employer and then go out into the market-place to buy it on their own behalf. For those people, the response of the insurance industry to the ruling will be what matters. Consider, though, the position of employers trying to provide equal pensions. According to Equitable Life's data, a pension scheme which is 75 per cent male and 25 per cent female will find the cost of a Pounds 100-a-month annuity for those at age 65 to be Pounds 10,244. As the balance shifts to 75 per cent women, the cost rises to Pounds 10,945. But even that is less than providing an annuity for a woman on her own. Pension schemes offering an 'open market option,' in which members can either go with the trustee's annuity policy or buy one on their own, may find that sex will be the key determinant in deciding whether to exercise that option. 'If I were a woman, I'd stick with the trustee. If I were a man, I'd run to the nearest insurance company,' said Cunliffe.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by Igor Blazevic; </F> place and date not given: "Indifference to Violence Makes Me  Angry"]    [Text] Igor Blazevic is a Saralian journalist and, among  other things, is last year's recipient of the Frantisek Kriegel  Prize, which is awarded by the Charter 77 Foundation. His  interview with President Vaclav Havel, recorded at the beginning  of May 1994, is being prepared for the Saralian magazine B-H  DANI. Igor Blazevic offered the Czech version of the transcript  to LIDOVE NOVINY and the English version to the INDEX ON  CENSORSHIP magazine.    [Blazevic] Mr. President, despite the political risk, you  have many times expressed an opinion on the Bosnian issue. You  have made repeated calls for a more resolute stance by the  international community toward Bosnia. Can you tell us why?    [Havel] There are three basic reasons that I air my views on  this issue. I am firmly convinced that, in today's so  manifoldly interconnected world, it is necessary to strengthen  and systematically expand the feeling of universal  responsibility. The fact that we are all actually responsible  for the whole world applies not only in the case of military  conflicts but also in ecology and many other spheres. I feel  somewhat that the existence of an attitude of global  responsibility is lacking in world politics. That is a kind of  politico-philosophical reason. There is another more specific  reason: The Czech Republic has had its own rather unfortunate  historical experience of democracy's diminished ability to  commit itself on behalf of the values that are intrinsic to it  and upon which it is based. We saw this most explicitly in  Munich. After the Munich diktat, Chamberlain said that he did  not see why English boys should risk their lives for a far away  country of which they knew little. We know the repercussions.  The hope that human lives would be saved and the view that it  is necessary to sacrifice some values in the name of peace  turned out to be a sheer illusion. The result was the exact  opposite. No lives were saved. In the end, many more were  sacrificed. We can see certain parallels today, when the  reluctance of the international community to enter more  decisively into the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  throughout the former Yugoslavia may again have suicidal  consequences, especially for Europe. The integrating Europe is  founded on the principle of civic coexistence, the coexistence  of different peoples, cultures, and religions. If, within an  area that is an impermeable element of Europe's political  actuality, these very values are in a brutal fashion being  denied, trampled upon, and flouted in the name of nationalism  and the principle of ethnic purity, this presents a direct  threat to the values upon which Europe itself is based and upon  which it is becoming integrated. The issue here does not involve  mere solidarity with the suffering. It involves solidarity with  one another because the principles for a secure life are  endangered by indecision. The other reason lies, perhaps, in my  character. I am simply one who gets angry about indifference to  violence and lawlessness.    If I sometimes air my views on this issue, I have to say  that  it is always accompanied by a certain shamefacedness that I am  not one who can enter more forcibly into the situation and, even  less so, one who will risk his life; it is accompanied by the  shamefacedness that I am not the one making the decisions, but  that this role falls to the international community--the North  Atlantic Alliance, the European Union, and the United Nations.  It is a little peculiar if the person giving the advice is not  the one to bear the consequences of his decisions. Of course,  if we envisage an international operation with the involvement  of many states, it is possible to consider a form of  participation by a Czech unit. Nevertheless, it is easier for a  person not directly involved in decisionmaking to give advice on  something than it is for the person who will bear the  consequences of that decision to decide.    However, it is true that, despite these moments of  indecision, for some time now I have been pointing out, during  various occasions on international forums, that the issue in  Bosnia involves more than a local squabble, that it indeed  involves the elementary values upon which not only European  integration is based but upon which coexistence among people on  the planet should be based in the future. Given the constantly  increasing number of people on the planet, conflicts between  nations or communities that feel their differentness with regard  to others present a major threat, and that very differentness is  the reason for conflicts.    [Blazevic] You have criticized the Geneva talks. In a joint  statement with Slovene President Kucan, you said that it is  necessary for the international community to redefine its  political aim in Bosnia. Do you think there is still a  requirement and opportunity to change this aim?    [Havel] I was made uneasy by the course of the Geneva talks.  This unease grew with the impression that various uncontrollable  warriors were capturing all sorts of territory and drawing  different maps and that the Geneva conference was accepting  their drawings, adopting them, and supplying and looking for  maps of ethnic division that would suit all of the warring  sides. I consider this to be a typical example of surrendering  the defense of the values that should be the issue here. It  created the impression that Karadzic was, in fact, suggesting to  the Geneva negotiators the agenda for the negotiations.  Therefore, I was quite skeptical; I was aware of a certain  hypocrisy.    It was as if the Geneva talks were held merely so it could  not be said that nothing was being done. At the same time, they  were based on the very logical and fundamental argument that the  warring sides must sit down at the negotiating table and that it  is necessary to agree upon a truce and ultimately peace by  peaceful means. Moreover, in fact, the negotiators acceded to  something that should be intrinsically alien to the institutions  at such negotiations. What I mean is that borders cannot be  changed and states cannot be divided by force. In this case, it  even involved an internationally recognized state.    At the same time, it is impossible to recognize a state  within its existing borders and also conduct negotiations with  uncontrollable armies on how it will be turned into several  other states.    Nevertheless, it seems that, since then, the situation has  moved forward a little. The concept of a Muslim-Croatian  federation, which would enjoy a kind of confederal relationship  with Croatia, is, it seems, accepted as a solution by the  citizens. If it were possible to eventually involve the Serbs  in Bosnia-Herzegovina in this federation as a recognized state  and to restructure it on the federal principle--and I have grave  doubts about this--this could be a way forward. We ourselves  know what it is like to be two nations that sense their  individuality and try to express it in a specific constitutional  and legal manner. We tried to establish a just federation,  which, as you know, did not succeed. So, we decided to separate  by peaceful means. I understand that peoples here and there  want to have their own state; I am not so lacking in  understanding. There is a great deal of intermingling and  affinity among the communities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  network of coexistence here was so rich that division on the  ethnic principle would never end. Each home, each family, and  each village could draw a border. This is simply dragging  things out ad absurdum.    [Blazevic] Following your meeting with Lord Owen, you said  that your views were not entirely harmonious. I would rather  say that your views are entirely unharmonious. For many  Bosnians, Lord Owen has become the symbol of a hesitant and  pragmatic policy without vision. On the other hand, you, Mr.  President, have become the symbol of a politician who insists on  values but seems a little like a dissident who can raise his  voice repeatedly but cannot fundamentally influence the  decisions on "major" policy. Would you comment on this?    [Havel] First of all, let me speak about Lord Owen. We  indeed agreed that we have a somewhat different view. This does  not mean that I do not respect him. This is a man who has good  intentions and who has expended a great deal of energy.  Nevertheless, I have very grave doubts about the road he is  following.    When he was here, we had a very friendly conversation. He  said that he was going to Belgrade, where he wanted to meet  President Milosevic, Karadzic, and others and that he wanted to  conduct another dialogue with them from which something could be  expected. This reminded me a little of the illusion that it is  possible to convince a nondemocrat of something by charm alone.  This is what Munich and Lord Runciman remind us of. The latter  also had good intentions and came here to see how he could  reconcile us with Hitler.    This does not mean I am placing an equal sign between anyone  and Hitler, of which, as I read, I am suspected of doing. I  have even been suspected of being an enemy of the Serbian  people. That is absolute nonsense. The very opposite is true:  I disapprove of any kind of collective condemnation of nations,  and I cannot be, from my very marrow, an enemy of any nation. I  am the enemy of certain policies and certain actions taken by  the Serbian leadership, especially Karadzic's Bosnian-Serb  leadership. I condemn violence, fanaticism, and brutality. I  do not condemn any nation, however.    As far as my position is concerned, of course, I am not the  one who will make the decisions. Nevertheless, I think that  each voice has its own significance. When a person is a  president, albeit of a small state that does not make decisions,  his voice may perhaps be listened to more than if he were a  private individual. And it makes sense to repeat certain  things. I was criticized a year ago for recommending a more  emphatic approach by the international community; it ultimately  adopted this approach. It may have been a year later and,  again, it was a little inconsequential, imperfect, and  befuddled; nevertheless, it happened. I do not think this was  because I made a statement a year ago. However, many people  referred to this situation, and newspapers throughout Europe and  America again and again subjected the indecisive and befuddled  policy to critical reflection. This, undoubtedly, had an  influence on the decision to issue threats of an air strike,  whether in Sarajevo or later around Gorazde. In this instance,  it was, of course, a little ambiguous.    [Blazevic] The democratically oriented people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina who were in favor of a multi-ethnic state now  feel defeated by the nationalists and fascists. At the same  time, they feel betrayed by the Western democracies.    [Havel] I absolutely understand these feelings, and I know  that, apart from the three warring sides, there is a powerful  fourth side here--the side that does not want a war and that  does not feel the need for confrontation among the individual  ethnic groups. I am on the side of these people. However,  whenever we say that someone has betrayed us, and when we are  angry at someone, we have to associate this with certain  self-reflection. After all, the leaders of the current conflict  were once elected by someone. Karadzic was elected as the  representative of a certain side in elections in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Society must reflect on its own mistakes or  breakdowns and not only shoulder all the responsibility onto  others.    [Blazevic] When you speak about Bosnia--now, however, we are  speaking not only about Bosnia--do you perceive a conflict  between Havel the intellectual and Havel the politician?    [Havel] I admit that this issue perhaps bothers certain  commentators more than it bothers me. I do not feel that it is  such a major problem. Fate has placed me in a role in which I  must express my views--which I would have even if I were not  president--in a manner corresponding to the responsibility  arising from my position. I often have to choose other words,  perhaps more diplomatic or cautious words, but I have to remain  true to myself and say what I really think. I accept this as a  new challenge and as a task that I am faced with, a task with  which I have to come to terms. This is nothing new because life  and fate have always confronted me with all sorts of strange  tasks. And, perhaps, their novelty will, to a certain extent,  encourage and provoke me into performing them.</p>

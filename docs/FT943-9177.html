			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: CRP Leisure falls deeper into red CRP Leisure, the USM-quoted maker of sets for the theatre, exhibitions and theme parks, saw losses increase from Pounds 117,000 to Pounds 145,000 in the half year to April 30, on reduced turnover of Pounds 230,000, against Pounds 340,000. Mr Paul Townsend, chairman, said CRP's only active subsidiary, Victor Mara, which makes theatre scenery, continued to show a disappointing performance. Trading conditions in its business were likely to remain competitive and unpredictable. First-half losses per share were 0.91p (0.73p).</p>

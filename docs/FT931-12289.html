			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK wins Pounds 4bn defence deal: Saudi contract secures 19,000 jobs in one of largest export orders won by Britain SAUDI ARABIA is to buy 48 Tornado aircraft as part of an arms package worth Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn agreed last night by Mr John Major and King Fahd, the ruler of the Gulf state. The deal is believed to be one of the largest export orders won by the UK and will secure 19,000 jobs at British Aerospace and its subcontractors. It will be welcome news to BAe which has been forced to lay off thousands of workers because of cuts in defence spending. The Saudi deal represents a significant success for Mr Major, who has faced fierce criticism over mounting unemployment. Earlier, he confirmed that Oman had agreed to buy Challenger 2 tanks from Vickers of the UK in a deal that could be worth Pounds 150m. That deal should safeguard some 1,600 jobs at Vickers' factories in Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne. The package, announced after lengthy talks in Riyadh, covers a significant military infrastructure programme in addition to the Tornado bombers, which are worth about Pounds 2bn with weapons and spares. Other items are understood to include ground defence radars as well as the construction of hardened shelters for the air-craft. However, an expected sale of up to 60 more BAe Hawk light jets has yet to materialise. Confirmation of orders for three further mine-hunting vessels for the Saudi navy from Vosper Thornycroft, the shipbuilding and engineering group, also remains uncertain. Mr Dick Evans, BAe chief executive, said last night he was delighted with the conclusion of the deal, adding that it owed a lot to the support of Mr Major. The Saudi deal represents the first real progress on the second phase of the Al Yamamah defence co-operation agreement for more than four years. The project, negotiated in 1985 when Mrs Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, currently sustains about 33,000 jobs in the UK, largely in the north-west. The project covers the sale of aircraft, warships and other defence infrastructure, as well as training and refurbishment. Britain is estimated to have already supplied Pounds 10bn of defence-related equipment as part of the project. Under the first phase, BAe supplied 72 Tornados and 30 Hawk trainer jets. The second phase had been postponed by difficulties over financing and by the Gulf war. Yesterday's deal came at the end of Mr Major's overseas tour, which also included India and Oman. He has won praise from UK industrialists who accompanied him for taking an active role in boosting overseas sales. Saudi Arabia was only added to Mr Major's itinerary this week, suggesting the prime minister knew a deal was imminent. Britain has been anxious to conclude a deal on the second phase of Al Yamamah, mainly because of the large number of jobs involved. The Tornado sale will help fill a gap at BAe's main military aircraft plant at Warton, Lancashire, before the start of production of the four-nation Eurofighter 2000 around 1996. Work on previous orders for the Anglo-German-Italian Tornado has virtually ended. Other major UK beneficiaries of the deal will include GEC-Marconi and Rolls-Royce. The Challenger 2 purchase by Oman is the first export order for the new British tank in a fiercely competitive world market. It follows British contracts from Oman for Hawk jet aircraft and two missile-carrying corvettes. The initial contract will involve 18 tanks and four armoured repair and recovery vehicles and is expected to be followed by another order for 20-30 tanks. The Omani deal follows a big setback to Vickers' export hopes last October, when Kuwait opted to buy 236 M1A2 Abrams tanks, made by General Dynamics of the US, in preference to the Challenger 2. In the past few days, the prime minister has been able to announce that a Pounds 140m contract for an electricity inter-connector in India had been won by a UK company. He also announced a joint venture between British Gas and the Gas Authority of India. Gulf allies' fears, Page 4 Aircraft makers fight recession, Page 17</p>

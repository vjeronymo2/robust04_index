			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. Vasilyev: "Ruinous Price Discrepancies"] </F>   [Text] Each one of us is a consumer. Naturally we become  very upset when faced with the unpleasant fact of increased  prices for goods, especially for food products.    There are many factors that contribute to the growth in  market prices. One of the important ones is increased  procurement prices for agricultural products. But do enterprises  themselves benefit from them? The growth in procurement prices  only partially covers expenditures by villagers needed to obtain  industrial goods. Let us look at data recently prepared by the  price policy administration of the Russian Ministry of  Agriculture. Here is how procurement prices for agricultural  products increased in terms of 1986 prices after so-called price  liberalization. In 1992 they increased by a factor of 18, and in  1993 -- by a factor of almost 150. Now let us look at how  wholesale prices for industrial goods have changed. During these  years they increased by factors of 44 and 495 respectively.    It is not difficult to see that the pace of growth of prices  for industrial products is considerably higher than for  agricultural, and this difference is increasing. Procurement  prices should be increased at least threefold in order to give  villagers the opportunity to buy material-technical products in  the necessary quantities. But at present no one is moving in  this direction. To act in this manner means to overstock store  shelves with food products in the face of their obvious  shortage. The problem comes up against the low solvency of the  population.    Despite the difficult economic situation within industry as  well, its enterprises nevertheless find themselves in an  advantageous position as compared to agricultural enterprises.  Their products can "await" a buyer until better times. But many  agricultural products are subject to rapid deterioration. This  is why it is not wise, and even wasteful, to establish very high  prices for them.    Today specialists suggest various ways to eliminate the  negative consequences of price disparities for industrial and  agricultural products. Some feel that supplementary expenditures  by villagers related to non-equivalent exchange between the city  and the village should be covered by adequate government  subsidies. Others propose the introduction of guaranteed  (protective) prices that will provide peasants with a minimum  income needed for simple reproduction. But the amounts of  subsidies remain small and are allocated with great delays, and  protective prices remain good intentions.    In actuality, the problem does not lie in the selection of a  form for providing financial support for villagers. It is  important to provide a type of aid that will protect them from  inflation and enable them to manage efficiently and profitably.  It is this kind of considerable support that the developed  countries of Western countries give to their farmers, and this  experience is what our people like to cite more and more often.</p>

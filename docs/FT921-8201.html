			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Twin banknotes embarrass mint ARGENTINA is investigating claims that its National Mint has been forging banknotes, writes John Barham. Last July, two authentic banknotes appeared with identical serial numbers and worth Dollars 50 each. Alarm grew when a pair of smaller denomination notes surfaced. It soon emerged that the duplicates were coming from the mint, although how they leaked into the economy was unclear. The central bank has no idea how many duplicates are in circulation but strenuously denies massive printing of fakes. Argentina has about 1.1bn banknotes in circulation, worth Dollars 6.1bn (Pounds 3.4bn), so the probability of detecting duplicates is tiny. Officials claim the affair has been blown out of proportion by a press baying for scandals. But the government ombudsman said yesterday he had reopened an inquiry begun in July. A letter written in August to the mint by Mr Roque Fernandez, central bank president, and leaked at the weekend indicated high-level concern. Mr Fernandez rejected the explanation by Mr Armando Gostanian, head of the mint, that the twin banknotes were produced by faulty printing equipment. The central bank now believes the extra notes were replacements for notes with small printing errors that should have been destroyed.</p>

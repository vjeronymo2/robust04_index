			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'BOY DETECTIVE': A CASE OF A MISSING STORY  </P> <P> The popular children's book series by Donald J. Sobol, "Encyclopedia Brown: Boy  Detective," makes it to the small screen in "The Case of the Missing Time  Capsule," a one-hour special airing on HBO at 8 tonight.  </P> <P> It starts out with a few unexpected chuckles -- a sort of kids' version of the  slapstick satire "Police Squad"; unfortunately, its obnoxiousness and dumbness  increase in direct ratio to the time it's on the screen.  </P> <P> The limited acting expertise of some of the cast becomes more obvious as well.  </P> <P> Encyclopedia Brown (Scott Bremner) is a small 10-year-old genius with his own  detective agency ("No Case Too Small; $1 a Day, Plus Expenses") who habitually  solves mysteries that his helpless, vacuous elders cannot.  </P> <P> When someone steals a buried time capsule that was due to be opened at the  Idaville centennial celebration, Brown has several suspects, including a rock  guitarist, a bad kid named Bugs Meany and the local auto mechanic, Buddy (Rick  Overton).  </P> <P> With vast superiority -- much easier to take in Sobol's books than in D.J.  McHale's uneven teleplay -- Brown saves the day.  </P> <P> Questions: Why have Brown's mom look into the camera and utter a rude street  expression? Why have the rock star make a reference to certain tests at a  health clinic? And do we really need to see all the threatening gun play?  </P> <P> Sobol's books are for kids, but McHale and director "Savage" Steve Holland seem  to be confused about their target audience.

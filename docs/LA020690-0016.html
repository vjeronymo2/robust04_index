			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KASHMIR  </P> <P> India has ordered all foreign correspondents out of Kashmir (Part A, Jan. 28).  The world's largest democracy is determined to continue its undemocratic hold  on Kashmir and does not want the world to know about it.  </P> <P> India's international commitment to a United Nations supervised plebiscite in  Kashmir remains unfulfilled.  </P> <P> The leadership in India presents this struggle as a resurgence of Islamic  fundamentalism. The focus is thus shifted from the right of self-determination  for Kashmiris, to an uprising of religious fanatics against secular India, with  the implication that the movement is against democratic interests.  </P> <P> Reality is that, in the four decades of Indian independence, free elections  have been an exception rather than the rule in Kashmir. A protester in Kashmir  is routinely branded as a fundamentalist and as pro-Pakistani. Even kids below  10 years of age have been arrested under the anti-terrorism act.  </P> <P> In Kashmir, the economic base has not expanded; what has expanded is the depth  and breadth of corruption. Kashmir, once a bread basket for the neighboring  areas, is now a net importer of agricultural and consumer goods.  </P> <P> True friends of democratic India need to impress upon the Indian leadership  that for a democracy to survive, human rights cannot be the exclusive domain of  some but must be universal. Kashmiris must have their basic human rights: the  right of self-determination by free and impartial elections.  </P> <P> RAFIQUE A. KHAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

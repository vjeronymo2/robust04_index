			<p>BFN     [Text] The military authorities in Nigeria have again  assured the people that they have no hidden agenda to perpetuate  themselves in office. Rather, they said, their ardent desire  was to return the country to a democratic rule in the shortest  time possible. This assurance was given by Lieutenant General  Oladipo Diya, the chief of general staff, at a meeting in Lagos  last night with traditional rulers and leaders from the western  part of the country. Explaining that the meeting was to brief  the traditional rulers and leaders of thought on the current  political situation in the country to allow them to judge for  themselves, Gen. Diya said the situation did not call for them  to fold their arms and wait for government to slug it out with  its detractors -- the so-called democracy groups. Gen. Diya  said the government would continue to talk with the reasonable  ones among the agitators, but would ignore the radical ones  within the groups. The chief of general staff repeated his  condemnation of certain people, whom he accused of mobilizing  some news media to publish things that would not advance the  cause of peace and unity in the country.    Earlier yesterday, Gen. Diya had addressed a similar meeting  of traditional rulers from Edo and Delta states in Benin. The  general had told the traditional rulers that the planned  constitutional conference remained the only platform left for  Nigerians to articulate their different political interests. He  discounted a newspaper report alleging that the government had  given 10 million naira to some traditional rulers and stated  that the present administration had never and would never sell  anybody.</p>

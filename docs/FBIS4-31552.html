			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in two installments by Emil Sterjevski: "Is There a </F> Division in the Leadership of the VMRO-DPMNE?"]  <H5>  [27 May p 4] </H5>   [Text]  <H5>  Democratic Faction in a Democratic Party </H5>   A development which has recently been mentioned and become a  topic for speculation publicly is that something serious is  happening within the ranks of the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal  Macedonian Revolutionary Organization -- Democratic Party for  Macedonian National Unity] and this change is now appearing  clearly. Although it has not been officially disclosed, it is  certain that a so-called Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] National Democratic Faction has  proclaimed itself within the party. As we have learned, this  faction includes a large number of parliamentary representatives  of the VMRO-DPMNE and is a counterbalance to the party's core  leadership (it is said that there are more than 10  representatives attached to the faction). In this faction of the  VMRO-DPMNE are representatives Stoile Stojkov, Tomislav  Stojanovski, and the coordinator of the party group Tomislav  Stefkovski.    The day before yesterday, before the announced beginning of  the parliamentary session, a special party meeting was held  during which some positions emerged which, for unknown reasons,  were not revealed publicly in the announcement. The faction  explained the reasons for its declaration primarily as a  reaction to the ideological, national, and organizational  failures of part of the party's core leadership in the  VMRO-DPMNE.    Representative Stoile Stojkov allegedly at one point in the  Assembly openly announced the formation of the Macedonian  National Democratic Faction of the VMRO-DPMNE. Although the  disunity in positions could be "read" in the attacks from the  assembly podium, he explained some of the reasons for this step.  It was brought to the attention of the core leadership of the  VMRO-DPMNE, for example, "the closing of the party to the  acceptance of new members, especially those with higher  education." Similarly, the following reasons for the  (un)revealed existence of the faction were cited: "the  characterization of the party as terrorist," the behavior and  statements of certain members, as well as those of the  VMRO-DPMNE parliamentary by-election candidate in the electoral  district 103 in the Skopje-area Kisela Voda opstina, Branislav  Sinadinovski, and the simultaneous support of these comments in  the name of the VMRO-DPMNE by the general secretary of the  party, Boris Zmejkovski. We found out first-hand that the  representatives and [local government] councillors of the  Macedonian National Democratic Faction of the VMRO-DPMNE  "remaining faithful to their constituents and sympathizers, will  continue their political commitment to the well-being of the  Macedonian state and the Macedonian nation." Stoile Stojkov  believes that "We have serious observations concerning the  privatization of the party. That a mass party like the  VMRO-DPMNE should allow privatization by certain leading members  is completely undemocratic."    Among those better acquainted with conditions in "the most  Macedonian party," this development is not unexpected. What is  interesting is the manner in which the disagreement over the  policy of the party's core leadership is expressed, that is, in  the formation of a faction within the party and not a secession  from it. Anyhow, factions do exist in parties and probably will  continue to exist, but it is another thing whether they are  revealed or not. Nevertheless, the (non)declaration of the  Macedonian National Democratic Faction in the VMRO-DPMNE, which  is now a fact, became more visible a few days ago when the  VMRO-DPMNE Opstina Committee (OK) in Kisela Voda issued a public  communique. In it, the committee broke its silence about some  "methods" of activity in the party. The chairman of the OK  reacted to "the despotic act committed by VMRO-DPMNE General  Secretary Boris Zmejkovski, which has been documented in one of  the OK publications in Kisela Voda; this is an act, according to  the OK, which is typical only of totalitarian parties." The  committee strongly protested to the VMRO-DPMNE leadership and  asked (in writing, according to the communique) Zmejkovski to  explain to the Macedonian public "why he employed such  antidemocratic methods and why he found party policies like  those of Aleksandar Dinevski and Ivan Sokolov necessary." The  VMRO-DPMNE OK chairman in Kisela Voda characterized that same  act as personal retaliation and a demand for an alibi for the  unsuccessful by-election in the 103d district, saying "with his  pledge to distinguish himself, the unsuitable candidate  Branislav Sinadinovski brought the VMRO-DPMNE the slander of  terrorism."    It is not accidental that this public disclosure from the  VMRO-DPMNE OK in Kisela Voda has appeared at the same time as  the declaration of the Macedonian National Democratic Faction;  behind this faction there are a large number of representatives  and, as we have learned unofficially, a large number of  councillors. Namely, in the first multiparty election, Kisela  Voda was the largest trump card for the VMRO-DPMNE. From this  area came a solid number of representatives. We should recall  that it was thanks to the voters in this Skopje-area opstina  that Boris Zmejkovski, Kole Lulovski, Ratka Dimitrova, Tomislav  Stefkovski, Nikola Krstevski, and Dosta Dimovska arrived on the  political scene.    In any case, if there is discord in the attitudes of party  members--we are not speaking of just the representatives--then  that fact would better highlight the declaration of this  faction. The analyst can expand this trend to include the  opstina committees in Titov Veles, Bitola, Ohrid, and even now  in Kisela Voda. It is not possible to forget the divided party  positions about the visit of the party's core leadership to  Bulgaria, and especially, the (un)expected presence of Deputy  Chairman Dosta Dimovska at the recent support rally in Skopje of  the Movement for Cooperation and Friendship between the Republic  of Macedonia and the Republic of Bulgaria.  <H5>  [28 May p 4] </H5>   [Text]  <H5>  Farce About Alleged Espionage </H5>   The formal (non)declaration of the so-called "Macedonian  National Democratic Faction" in the VMRO-DPMNE was no surprise  for those who are better informed about this party, a party that  has the most representatives in parliament. Just the fact that  one can now speak of any kind of faction within a party is a  surprise in itself. Perhaps for the public, the fact that is  surprising is that in the faction there is a large number of  representatives, among whom there are people who, until  yesterday, were considered to be "the most ingrained VMRO  types." The reason for such a division within the party,  according to the faction, lies in the "dissatisfaction with the  ideological, national, and organizational scrambling by the core  leadership of the VMRO-DPMNE." Let us be more concrete: It is a  question of a disagreement with Chairman Ljupco Georgievski,  Deputy Chairman Dosta Dimovska, General Secretary Boris  Zmejkovski, and some others among them, like Dragi Arsov or  Branislav Sinadinovski, for example.    According to Stoile Stojkov, "A mass party like the  VMRO-DPMNE permits itself to be privatized by individual leading  members. This is not democratic. Moreover, practically from the  convening of parliament, there have been disagreements and  differences--and what are they, if not factions? This process  began already at the time when Vladimir Golubovski left the  party and has continued through the settling of accounts in the  opstina committees."    And, in fact, much has happened in the ranks of this  numerically strong party. From its ranks emerged first the  VMRO-DP [VMRO-Democratic Party], then the VMRO-Fatherland, and  the VMRO-United. The formation of these parties became necessary  because of divisions or secessions over some party policy of the  VMRO-DPMNE. And not just that. Some attacks made from the  assembly podium by representatives of this party show that  something serious is happening within this party. The  culmination probably was the contradictory explanations  following the election in the 103d Skopje-area district, which,  in effect, divided opinion about the kinds of methods the  VMRO-DPMNE would employ to gain power. The latest case is the  visit of the core leadership to the Republic of Bulgaria just at  the time when the second round of voting in the 103d district  was taking place, and the promotion of the movement for  Macedonian-Bulgarian friendship and cooperation, at which,  according to some party members, Deputy Chairman Dosta Dimovska  was suspiciously in attendance. From this, one could hear more  audibly talk of some pro-Bulgarian option.    What is perhaps more essential is whether the division in  the party leads to reciprocal accusations and suspicions: Which  is the pro-Bulgarian orientation, which the pro-Serbian, who is  the infiltrator from state security, and so forth. In this  context, the departure of Ratka Dimitrova from the coordinating  function and her particular distancing from the party is an  example. All these coincidences, especially the declaration of  the faction, are open to many "interpretations" about what is  going on within the party. Thus, Stoile Stojkov, who also serves  as chairman of the parliamentary Commission for Control over the  State Security Service, has been called a spy by some people in  the VMRO-DPMNE leadership, while Tomislav Stefkovski is  allegedly an infiltrator from the party with "special tasks."  Stoile Stojkov says categorically: "Such a farce about alleged  espionage is not only untrue, but also counterproductive.  Besides, this is no new tactic; such tactics were used at the  time against Vladimir Golubovski and Ratka Dimitrova."    This, however, is not everything that can be heard within  the  party. For some people, that measure (the faction's declaration)  is, in fact, the first step toward movement into the Democratic  Party (DP). In the DP, however, this is roundly denied, and it  is said that such an allegation is a banana peel intended for  the VMRO-DPMNE by state security. Those, again, who have had  somewhat different perspectives maintain that it is precisely  that faction and its members, now said to number 11 and to  include members of the parliamentary staff, who are really  closer to the so-called Macedonian left, as can be seen in their  attacks in the assembly. On the other hand, the motive is  distancing from the stubborn attitudes and the phobia of the  leadership headed by Ljupco Georgievski and General Secretary  Boris Zmejkovski with respect to the government and, especially,  toward the president of the country.    According to Stoile Stojkov, "The latest version of my visit  and of the consultations of Tomislav Stefkovski with President  Kiro Gligorov is already in the making. General Secretary Boris  Zmejkovski maintains that there is an audio tape of the meeting  the two of us had with Gligorov. If that were true, I would ask  him to release the tape publicly, so it can be known what we  talked about at that meeting. And if there were anything to it,  then the question arises whether someone is controlling the  chief of state, or, on the other hand, whether Zmejkovski is so  skillful and installed the listening devices."    Stojkov's faction has reproached the core leadership for its  privatization of the party, exclusiveness, and the lack of  respect for the opinions of others. Another VMRO-DPMNE  representative, Kole Lulovski, is likewise estranged from the  party. "I have always been on the second flank for the party,  and now I am on the third. We should recall that my positions  are individual; I do not participate in the caucuses of the core  leadership, and I am absolutely even more aloof from these  revelations. The formation of the faction is new to me--`a  special firm' in the VMRO-DPMNE." In any case, he continues, "It  would be good to clean up the situation before the elections."    Obviously, the VMRO-DPMNE has some calculating techniques.  Meanwhile, another matter comes to mind. The practice in this  party has been that whenever it is understood that there is  dissent from the leadership, those espousing such views are  simply excluded from the party. Whether that was done with the  aim of acquiring the impression that there were no people within  the party with dissenting views is another story. In any case,  the outcomes in the VMRO-DPMNE opstina committees in Bitola,  Titov Veles, and Ohrid are in themselves indicative. Out of  them, a new party (VMRO-Fatherland) has emerged, and the local  leadership in Ohrid, along with the party youth group there,  went over to the competition (at least from Ohrid's point of  view), that is, the VMRO-DP. Whether this time there will be a  deviation from that practice will be a difficult question to  answer, although it is known that things are not harmonious.  Perhaps the key lies in the distribution of members, who, in any  case, have led the VMRO-DPMNE parliamentary group, more  precisely in the existence of the Macedonian National Democratic  Faction of the VMRO-DPMNE, to act as a serious counterbalance  within the party ranks.    For those who want to make forecasts, a nerve-racking party  resolution is soon to be settled. But, no one knows how at this  time.</p>

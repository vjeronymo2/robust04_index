			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TAFT STANDS TALL DESPITE 24-19 LOSS  </P> <P> After the game, a single thought kept running through the mind of Taft High  Coach Tom Stevenson, who stands 6-foot-5.  </P> <P> It had nothing to do with his team failing to measure up.  </P> <P> "We came up short," Stevenson said. "We came up a little short."  </P> <P> Indeed, Stevenson's overachieving Taft team just ran out of time Friday night  against Granada Hills, dropping a 24-19 decision in a West Valley League game  at Taft.  </P> <P> The Toreadors scored with 5 minutes 37 seconds left to take a 19-18 lead,  marking the first time this season the Highlanders had trailed in Northwest  Valley Conference play. Taft quarterback Lamar Lawson scored on a one-yard  keeper to finish off an 11-play, 36-yard drive.  </P> <P> Granada Hills (7-1, 5-0 in league play) fired back, however. After Bryan Martin  (seven of 16 for 221 yards) connected with Alonzo Finney for a 39-yard gain to  the Taft 38, fullback Brett Washington rumbled inside for 12 yards.  </P> <P> On the next play, Washington went outside on a draw, cut back against the grain  and scored from 26 yards to give the Highlanders a 24-19 lead with 4:08 left.  </P> <P> Washington finished with 102 yards in 10 carries.  </P> <P> "I just started left, and then I saw more of my guys to the right," Washington  said of the cutback, which froze several defenders. "All I saw to the left was  (Taft) red."  </P> <P> Yet Taft almost had the Highlander defense turning a similar color. Taking  possession with 4:03 left at its 26, Taft drove to midfield, primarily behind  tailback Darnell Hendricks. Granada Hills almost left Taft (4-3, 3-2) with too  much time.  </P> <P> "It was almost too quick," Granada Hills co-Coach Darryl Stroh said, shaking  his head. "We almost scored too fast."  </P> <P> On a fourth-and-one play at the Taft 49, Hendricks gained eight yards to keep  the drive alive with 51 seconds left.  </P> <P> After an incomplete pass, Lawson was sacked for an eight-yard loss. Lawson  completed a 12-yard pass to Hendricks to the Highlander 37, but a desperation  pass to Hendricks and Byron Duncan at the goal line was intercepted by  defensive back Robert Haywood at the final gun.  </P> <P> Hendricks gained 116 yards in 22 carries, the most any ballcarrier has managed  this season against the Highlanders.  </P> <P> "He's the best back we've seen all year," Stroh said.  </P> <P> Tailback Derrick Stewart gave the Highlanders a 6-0 lead on a one-yard run with  38 seconds left in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Even though its offense was held in check in the first half, managing only 69  yards, Taft pulled even in the second quarter on a 29-yard interception return  by Daryl Cash.  </P></p>

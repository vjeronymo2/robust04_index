			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Highgate audience warms to Glenda GLENDA JACKSON, the Oscar-winning election candidate for whom the Hampstead and Highgate seat would be an even classier prize, must imagine she is heading for Westminster purely on the strength of local concern about the health service. If this week's constituency public meeting on the issue - a steamy blend of slanted statistics and personal abuse - was any guide, fears for the future of the NHS will hand Hampstead to Ms Jackson. The north London seat, Conservative-held by just 2,221 votes, has hardly clasped the government's health reforms to its bosom. There are no fund-holding general practitioners in the borough, and residents voted overwhelmingly against their local general hospital taking trust status. The government's decision to overturn the result has not won many friends. Ms Jackson scored a fairly easy victory over her principal opponent, Mr Oliver Letwin, the Rothschilds banker who carries a Thatcherite banner and is an unabashed proponent of the reforms. The 'scandals' of the poll tax, poverty and the waste of female skills were delivered with a passion which this election has failed to provoke. NHS underfunding was identified by Ms Jackson but not quantified. The Tories' 'bottomless pit' which could never be filled with enough cash was exposed as a Tory plot to privatise. Labour, she said, would revive the NHS, although it could not 'turn this pumpkin of a country into a golden coach overnight'.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> WILL THE RECESSION BE GLOBAL?;  </P> <P> THERE ARE SOME DIRE WARNINGS THAT THE WORLD'S ECONOMIES COULD FALL LIKE  DOMINOES. BUT INDUSTRIAL NATIONS MAY PROVE SURPRISINGLY RESILIENT.  </P> <P> When Iraqi troops marched into Kuwait on Aug. 2 and threw the world's oil  markets into disarray, Philipp Holzmann AG, Germany's largest construction  company, did not bat an eye.  </P> <P> In the next month, Holzmann won contracts for a $57-million office building in  Munich, a $40-million housing complex elsewhere in Bavaria and a $30-million  apartment building in Dusseldorf. Marching into the new market in what was then  East Germany, it also signed up for a $48-million hotel in Weimar.  </P> <P> "Nothing has stopped," said Claus Pfeiffer, a spokesman for the company. "Our  clients haven't cut back, and neither have we."  </P> <P> Holzmann's go-for-it posture belies mounting fears among economists and  business executives that the world is on the edge of a deep recession, one that  could savage the economies of the biggest industrial nations and their smaller  trading partners.  </P> <P> So far, the latest oil crisis has taken nothing like the economic toll of its  two predecessors in the early and late 1970s. The risks to the world economy  have increased, but the betting now is that tomorrow won't bring global  economic decline.  </P> <P> Worldwide growth is certain to weaken. There will be mass layoffs. Some nations  may suffer greatly. But the most common assessment is that a substantial  segment of the industrial world will remain remarkably buoyant and reasonably  healthy.  </P> <P> Good luck is not the only reason. In the last decade, the industrial countries  have insulated themselves from oil shocks by curbing their appetite for oil.  And their policy-makers have learned how better to cope with outside shocks to  their economies.  </P> <P> For all that, the world is paying an economic toll for the latest oil crisis.  The United Nations has imposed a worldwide boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil,  and oil prices have shot up.  </P> <P> Some nations, notably the English-speaking ones, seem to be on the slippery  slope to recession. Canada and Australia, whose economies shrank in the three  months from April to June, seem almost sure to meet the traditional definition  of recession -- two consecutive quarters of declining economic production.  </P> <P> The United States and Britain, whose economies were also foundering even before  Aug. 2, are probably not far behind.  </P> <P> The investment banking firm of Salomon Brothers projects that the U.S. economy  will produce less next year than this year. The Confederation of British  Industry finds business pessimism at a 10-year high.  </P> <P> But many economists believe that Japan, Germany and much of the rest of  industrial Europe will take little more than a glancing blow from the current  crisis -- unless, that is, the crisis grows much worse.  </P> <P> "The key to whether there will be a worldwide recession is how high oil prices  go and how long they stay there," said Ron Napier, a London-based economist  with Salomon Brothers.  </P> <P> However, a substantial school of economic thought holds that the seeds of a  worldwide recession had already been sown well before Aug. 2.  </P> <P> According to this camp, the all-but-inevitable U.S. recession will reverberate  around the world by cutting into export sales in countries from Brazil to  Japan. And the crash in Tokyo's stock market, which lost nearly half its value  this year before turning back up last month, will deplete Japan's ability to  finance investment in other countries around the globe.  </P> <P> Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist with Washington's Brookings Institution, said  the world's economies have become far more dependent on each other in the last  decade. Viruses in the United States and Japan, he said, can quickly spread to  all corners of the globe.  </P> <P> A. Gary Shilling, head of his own economic-consulting firm in New York,  predicts nothing less than a full-scale depression. "Our view," he said, "is  that it's going to be global and deep."  </P> <P> Already, business activity is noticeably slowing in industries that depend  heavily on oil. Air Canada recently announced that it was laying off 2,900  employees, or 12.5% of its work force. Five American airlines -- Pan Am,  Midway, USAir, TWA and American -- have announced layoffs, and others are  likely to follow.  </P> <P> In the transportation sector, the wreckage is not confined to economies that  appear headed for recession. Despite the generally prosperous Dutch economy,  KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has announced a 15% reduction in staff and overhead  costs over the next three years and the loss of 500 support-staff jobs.  </P> <P> Car companies are also feeling the heat. In a generally bullish Germany, most  car makers are trimming their sails, according to Ernst Moritz Lipp, chief  economist for Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt. And in France, Renault is planning  for a 3% decline in sales next year -- not as bad as the 15% after the first  oil shock or the 5% after the second, but bad news nonetheless.  </P> <P> Japan, at least at present, is a relative island of tranquility. Toyota, for  example, is sticking with plans to invest a whopping $4.5 billion during the 12  months that began July 1 and to open one new auto assembly plant and two new  parts plants in 1992.  </P> <P> Economic growth generally continues strong in Japan, which owes its boom of the  last five years not to increased sales to the United States but to a surge in  demand by Japanese consumers. The Japan Department Stores Assn. reports that  sales growth over the same month the previous year dipped in August to 8.8% --  still vigorous, but down from the 14.2% registered in June.  </P> <P> "We haven't seen any decline of people's personal consumption since the gulf  crisis," said Kazuo Iwai, a spokesman for Takashimaya Department Stores. Not  only have purchases of daily necessities held up, he said, but "sales of  paintings and precious metals have been very good for the last several months."  </P> <P> And outside such oil-dependent sectors as transportation and petrochemicals,  the outlook remains generally bright in continental Western Europe.  </P> <P> Germany, which enjoys a happy combination of robust growth and inflation of  less than 3%, is at the head of the class. Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest,  said consumer demand, up nearly 5% in the last year, is fueling economic growth  there just as it is in Japan.  </P> <P> The investment firm of Goldman Sachs expects moderate to healthy growth next  year in all the major Western European economies: 2.8% in Germany, 2.5% in  Italy and 1.8% in France.  </P> <P> For the world as a whole, Morgan Stanley, another investment firm, foresees  economic growth of 2% next year, down a full percentage point from this year  but far short of a global recession.  </P> <P> But whether the world can keep its head above water will depend on a host of  unknowns.  </P> <P> Paramount is the depth and duration of the current oil shock, which is now in  only its fourth month and has so far led to only about a doubling in oil  prices. The two earlier shocks lasted far longer, with the first ending in a  fourfold increase in oil prices and the second in nearly a tripling.  </P> <P> That is far from the only imponderable. What effect will the decimated Soviet  economy have on the rest of the world? Will the former West Germany prove rich  enough to solve the economic problems of the East now that they are unified?  What about the recession in Eastern Europe as the formerly Communist economies  test the waters of the free market? Closer to home, will continuing problems  with the U.S. budget deficit finally come home to roost?  </P> <P> In that environment of uncertainty, analysts divide generally into two camps:  the cautious optimists and the irrepressible doom-sayers.  </P> <P> The optimists expect the Persian Gulf crisis to end before Jan. 1, whether  through diplomacy or violence. They expect the massive Saudi Arabian oil  fields, so vital to the industrial economies, to escape unscathed.  </P> <P> The average price of foreign crude oil to U.S. refiners, which has more than  doubled from less than $15 a barrel to about $34 since the crisis began, will  gradually retreat, according to this scenario. Prices in 1991 will average  somewhere in the $25 to $30 range.  </P> <P> Dresdner Bank's Lipp, among many others, finds this scenario compelling. Unlike  the first two oil shocks, he said, the world is not facing a major crude oil  shortage because Saudi Arabia and other major producers are nearly making up  for the 4.3 million barrels a day that have been lost from Iraq and Kuwait.  </P> <P> Prices have soared, he said, largely because consumers are stocking up. In  Germany, for example, homeowners began laying in their heating oil in September  instead of waiting as usual until November.  </P> <P> And even if oil prices head up to $40 a barrel and remain there through 1991,  the global economy might well escape disaster. Brian V. Mullaney, a  London-based economist for Morgan Stanley, said he expects the vigorous  economies of continental Western Europe to grow by an average of 2.5% next year  if oil prices fall back and to still manage growth of about 1.5% even if oil  sells for $40.  </P> <P> "The oil price shock of 1990, unlike its predecessors of the 1970s, is not  likely to be the straw that broke the back of global expansion," Mullaney and  New York colleague Robert S. Gay recently wrote.  </P> <P> Since the last oil shock in 1979-1981, the world's major economic powers have  insulated themselves to a considerable degree from the effects of rising oil  prices.  </P> <P> Altogether, the 24 leading industrial nations consumed slightly less oil last  year than in 1973, even though the sum of their economies had grown by about  75%.  </P> <P> Savings seem even more impressive when measured in dollars rather than barrels  of oil. As a percentage of national economic output, oil consumption in each of  the seven biggest industrial nations plunged by an astonishing two-thirds to  three-quarters, according to Morgan Stanley.  </P> <P> Even the United States, the biggest oil consumer of the group, spent only 2.3%  of its gross national product on oil last year, down from 8.1% in 1980.  </P> <P> The declining price of oil -- it fell by about 50% during the 1980s -- accounts  for about half of the improvement. The other half results from more lasting  factors, including energy conservation, a deliberate switch from oil to other  fuels and a trend away from energy-intensive manufacturing industries to  service industries.  </P> <P> "Structural adjustment over the last 10 years has given us earthquake  protection that will more easily absorb the impact of a doubling of oil  prices," said Jean-Claude Paye, secretary general of the Paris-based  Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation,  </P> <P> Compared to the two oil shocks in the 1970s, the latest crisis has hit at a  less vulnerable part of the industrial world's economic cycle.  </P> <P> Before the oil shocks of the 1970s, Dresdner Bank economist Lipp said,  inflation was already rampant in many of the industrial countries. The soaring  price of oil made inflation intolerable. Central banks responded by clamping  down hard on national money supplies, and recession inevitably followed.  </P> <P> This time, by contrast, economic growth was solid in most industrial countries  immediately before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, but prices were not getting  out of hand. So the risk of exaggerated inflation is much less, and so is the  likelihood of a downturn that generally accompanies the battle against runaway  inflation.  </P> <P> Economic policy-makers have learned how to cope with outside shocks such as  suddenly soaring oil prices.  </P> <P> During the first oil shock, in 1973-1974, some countries, notably Japan and  Britain, tried to keep interest rates low to prevent recessions, Morgan  Stanley's Mullaney said. Instead, prices soared, and subsequent efforts to  retaliate by raising interest rates merely deepened the inevitable recession  that followed.  </P> <P> During the second oil shock, which began in 1979 during a period of  particularly high inflation in the United States, the U.S. Federal Reserve and  other central banks raised interest rates promptly. Once again, global  recession resulted.  </P> <P> "Central banks are not inclined to repeat the mistake of the 1970s," Mullaney  said.  </P> <P> Lipp pointed to the worldwide stock market crash of October, 1987, as evidence  that policy-makers have learned that a steady-as-she-goes approach to external  shocks works best. After the crash, central banks initially poured money into  their national economies to ensure against an abrupt slowing of economic  activity. But they tightened up again quickly enough to prevent runaway  inflation.  </P> <P> The International Monetary Fund, in its recent report on the world economy,  suggested that policy-makers have also learned not to try to shelter consumers  from huge oil price hikes. With the example of the United States in mind, the  IMF said direct government subsidies for oil consumers result in little more  than bigger budget deficits. And oil price controls merely distort markets and  dampen incentives for oil companies to produce and for consumers to conserve.  </P> <P> But some analysts find the grounds for optimism less than compelling.  </P> <P> For one thing, they are not prepared to assume that the Persian Gulf crisis  will end quickly and without major damage to Middle East oil fields. But even  if it does, the doom-sayers find plenty of reasons for alarm.  </P> <P> Lawrence, of the Brookings Institution, said that the optimists have  underestimated the domino effect of such ominous events as the likely U.S.  recession and the recent plunge in the Tokyo stock market.  </P> <P> The U.S. recession, he said, will wreak havoc in the heavily indebted Latin  American countries that rely heavily on the United States as an export market.  Jeffrey Schott, a research fellow at Washington's Institute for International  Economics, said Brazil will take the hardest hit.  </P> <P> "And Brazil's economy was already at the precipice," Schott said. The  government managed to rein in inflation from 80% a month to about 10%. But the  cost was brutal -- the economy has contracted by about 10% in the last year.  </P> <P> Even Mexico, a major oil producer, will not benefit as much as it might from  rising oil prices because it has done little in the last decade to develop new  oil fields. Production is up less than 10% since Aug. 2, and government  officials concede privately that even that rate cannot be sustained.  </P> <P> Moreover, Mexico will be hit particularly hard by a recession in the United  States because two-thirds of its exports go to its neighbor to the north.  </P> <P> There are danger signals from the other side of the globe as well. Tokyo's  stock market plunge, which at its worst slashed asset holdings by a staggering  $2 trillion, has already cut into Japan's ability to continue financing  economic expansion around the world and the budget deficit in the United  States.  </P> <P> The newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that overseas purchases of stocks  and bonds by institutional Japanese investors plummeted to $20 billion during  the April-to-September period this year, contrasted with $51 billion during the  same six months a year ago. If sustained, that trend could seriously impede  world economic growth.  </P> <P> Shilling points to a host of additional perils -- the persistent U.S. trade and  budget deficits, the savings and loan disaster in the United States, the  staggering debt burdens of many Third World countries and what he regards as  massively overvalued real estate and other assets in Japan. All of these, he  said, leave the world economy off balance and vulnerable to outside shocks.  </P> <P> Moreover, Shilling finds one peculiar feature of the latest oil crisis that  bodes ill for the world economy. In the two earlier shocks, he said, the  oil-producing nations invested their "petrodollars" in oil-consuming countries,  whose own investment dollars had been siphoned off by soaring oil prices.  </P> <P> This time, by contrast, Saudi Arabia, which is reaping the lion's share of the  windfall from rising oil prices, is using much of it to defray the cost of the  U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf. However noble that effort may be in  geopolitical terms, Shilling said, it is not as economically useful as  financing industrial expansion in the oil-consuming countries.  </P> <P> Paye, the head of OECD, told the European Parliament recently that the economic  outlook for the 24 industrial countries in his organization had turned from  satisfactory to uncertain.  </P> <P> "The world," he said, "appears to be poised on the brink of the unknown."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Sam Jameson in Tokyo and Juanita Darling in Mexico City  contributed to this article.  </P> <P> </P> <P> IS GLOBAL RECESSION LOOMING?  </P> <P> In 1973-74 and again in 1979-81, a sharp rise in world oil prices was followed  by a global recession.  </P> <P> 1990 oil prices  </P> <P> June: $14.89  </P> <P> Sept.: $29.74  </P> <P> But this time, the industrial countries depend far less on oil.

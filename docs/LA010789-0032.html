			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABDUL-JABBAR NOT TOO OLD TO PROVIDE INSPIRATION  </P> <P> By suggesting early retirement for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar just because, at 41,  he's not playing as he did 10 or 20 years ago, Scott Ostler (Dec. 29) ignores  the Laker center's real value to this team -- experience and inspiration.  </P> <P> Every year about this time, someone writes this team and Kareem off, and every  year they're right back in the thick of the championship race.  </P> <P> I think Ostler should offer to retire if the Lakers go all the way again. That  will really give them some motivation.  </P> <P> KEN KRAGEN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

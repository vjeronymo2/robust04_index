			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Observer: Out of flavour By now the whole world knows that one of the more interesting chief executiveships is up for grabs. Ben and Jerry's, the US ice cream company founded by New Yorkers Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, threw the field open  -and has been swamped by more than 22,000 CVs. But how much will the new boss get? Ben and Jerry's has abandoned its egalitarian policy of paying top executives no more than seven times lowest-paid employees, who get an estimated Dollars 20,000 annually, giving Ben and Jerry Dollars 140,000 under the old regime. The company is now hoping to make it in Europe, starting with the UK. Trying to flog the banana-tasting Chunky Monkey to Wigan presumably warrants more than the peanut-flavoured cheque previously on offer.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARR, MARCIAN OF FIRST EXECUTIVE TO BE RE-SUBPOENAED  </P> <P> The head of the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee has vowed to  re-subpoena next week Fred Carr and Doug Marcian, two top officers of Los  Angeles-based Executive Life Insurance Co., after their legal challenge to the  committee's original summons.  </P> <P> However, the committee is unsure whether it will make a second attempt to get  Michael Milken, the indicted junk bond trader, to appear as originally  requested.  </P> <P> Milken has said he intends to invoke his Constitutional rights against self  incrimination and not answer any questions.  </P> <P> Carr and Marcian will apparently comply with the new subpoena.  </P> <P> "Of course, if a (legal) subpoena is issued, we will comply," said the  company's general counsel, William Adams.  </P> <P> Milken, Carr and Marcian were subpoenaed last month to testify at insurance  hearings involving the health of Executive Life, which insures the lives and  pensions of at least 100,000 Californians. Carr is chairman and chief executive  of First Executive Corp., Executive Life's parent company, and Marcian is the  company's chief investment officer.  </P> <P> Executive is one of the nation's biggest investors in the high-risk, high-yield  junk bonds once promoted by Milken. The insurance committee is investigating  whether junk bonds are too risky for insurance companies and whether California  needs a guarantee fund for life insurance policyholders. The state is among  only six that do not formally protect holders of life insurance policies from  losses, said Committee Chairman Patrick Johnston.  </P> <P> Carr's attorneys objected to the Assembly's original subpoena on technical  grounds and asked why the Assembly didn't invite the executives to attend  before sending the subpoena.  </P> <P> The committee then "invited" Carr and Marcian, who declined, saying they feared  that adverse publicity generated by such a hearing would harm the company.  </P> <P> But Johnston considers Carr and Marcian vital witnesses, so the drama  continues.  </P></p>

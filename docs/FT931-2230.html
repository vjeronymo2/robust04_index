			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Private View: Challenging the new gods - Science critic Joseph Schwartz explains how he evaluates the most complex of theories MUSIC critics and theatre critics we know about, and literary critics, art critics and ballet critics. But what on earth is a science critic - apart from a contradiction in terms? Dr Joseph Schwartz is a New Yorker with a west coast drawl, a Harpo Marx hairstyle and a gift for polemics. As a child, he stood on garment workers' picket lines; as a youth, he produced pi meson particles in Berkeley. In his 20s, he was inspired by the civil rights movement. He took up psychology and now he is a psychotherapist in Belsize Park, London. Also, Schwartz writes. He is a science critic. Opera, he will tell you, is another way of singing, just as painting is another way of seeing. Science is simply another way of understanding the world. It is not so pure, after all. It is as susceptible to an informed critique as any other human activity. 'I don't paint the pictures,' he said. 'I don't make up the theories. But I evaluate them. A painter can talk about a painting: we don't have to agree with what the painter says is in the painting. We look to see what it says for ourselves. 'Well, waddya think?' he said, jumping up from the kitchen table. 'When the man in the white suit says radiation won't hurt you, waddya think? I'd like people to have confidence with their own assessments. Sure, they have to be open to information. I suppose I'm attacking the authority, the inflated authority of science.' And attack he does. Today's particle physicists are autistic, he says, staring vacantly at mathematical expressions of their own creation. 'String theory' may be the dernier cri, but is boring and cannot be tested experimentally. DNA has replaced the Deity as the agent of predestination. We have lost confidence in our capacity to understand, and our science writers - whether of the 'gee-whiz' or 'shock-horror' school - have not liberated us from primitive notions of what science really is. What does it mean, I asked Schwartz, to say that a work of science, like a work of art, is 'poor'? Either a theory works or it doesn't. 'Well, you could say it doesn't work, or it has too many assumptions, it's not testable, can't be compared to experience; or it's unsatisfying, it's unaesthetic . . . What I'm trying to do is formalise the kinds of conversations you could have quietly, in the corridor, with scientists at a scientific meeting.' Schwartz began an imaginary dialogue. 'What do you think of 'strings'? (You're not going to get an active physicist saying it's the truth or anything like that.) They might say: well, it really stinks. What do you think of quantum mechanics? Well, I don't see how to do anything better, but yeah, I was always bothered by it as a student . . . That kind of thing.' In 1959, CP Snow gave us the phrase 'the two cultures' to describe a state of mutual incomprehension between science and the humanities. Today the sociology of science is itself in conflict: one group continues to see Western science as anonymous, universal, dispassionate and privileged. The newer, relativist group, describes scientific knowledge as a social construct whose focus and direction owe as much to history and culture as to empirical analysis. Lobbies have formed and tempers have frayed, with exaggeration and misrepresentation on both sides. We are watching a replay of the 19th-century Darwinian controversy, Schwartz said. The traditionalists will not recognise that science is a human activity - that we create our understandings. The anti-science lobby will not acknowledge the power and utility of our understanding. Schwartz is of the new school but not, he would insist, its militant wing. He agrees that we are looking at a real world and that science is a 'special kind of understanding' of that world; he is simply reluctant to accord it supreme status. He took an example from aesthetics. 'A hundred years ago we said art was Beauty. We don't believe that any more. We don't believe beauty is so simple. We see it is not eternal but historically formed: what is aesthetically pleasing varies over time. The same is true for science and truth. What is perceived to be true in one epoch may be completely unsatisfactory in another.' It follows, of course, that Schwartz's critique is itself under the influence of his own history and culture. His father, a furrier and trade union activist in the 1930s, came from Bessarabia in the former Soviet Union. His mother's family had migrated from a town near Chernobyl in the Ukraine. They moved to Los Angeles when the elder boy was eight. He went to Berkeley in 1955 to read sociology and physics at a time when America was actively recruiting scientists, impelled by a talent for maths but also by his sense of being a misfit. As well as being Jewish, 'foreign', left-wing and from the East Coast, he was afflicted by being intellectually ahead of his contemporaries and younger than his peers. 'While they were developing socially I was still a little kid.' The sociology proved to be a bore, but the physics was 'terrifically exciting.' Berkeley then was the leading centre for particle physics and Schwartz joined the group around Luis Alvarez, later a Nobel prizewinner. 'It was top of the world, just one of those rare experiences. Everybody, no matter what their age, who was involved with Alvarez in that period would call it the high point of their career.' He did a PhD in particle production using high-energy pi mesons in a hydrogen bubble chamber. Did you feel you were adding real knowledge, or was it a kind of game? 'No, it didn't have a game quality for me , nor for other people. It's quite a good question, really because I think physics has become removed from that sense of adding significantly to human knowledge; there is a real malaise in the field, a certain kind of boredom and gimmickry.' Schwartz was a leftwing student activist, not so much a hippy, he said, as an amateur beatnik. Deciding he had had the best of physics, he was drawn to Mississippi and the civil rights protests. It changed his life. Impressed by the sophistication of the black militants and of their 'group psychodynamics', he underwent psychoanalysis himself and landed a research fellowship ('people felt physicists could do anything') in psychiatry at Columbia, New York. Much later he trained as a counseller, met a British psychotherapist and moved with her to London. Are you still a left-winger? 'I would say so. Most people would say so.' Is your critique a product of your early commitment to the Left? 'It sort of is and it sort of isn't' Are you offering a Marxist-driven analysis? 'Well, you know I've been very seriously attacked by Marxists, so there's tremendous disagreement among them about science as well. I mean, I would flatly reject the traditional Marxist interpretation of science which is gee-whizzery, basically. If you wanted to place me politically, I suppose you could say it's New Left. We have to look at what actually has gone on: we have to look at stories like the atomic bomb.' Schwartz gently turned the tables. 'What would you say about journalism? That reporters just go out and get the news and tell us the truth? Well, it doesn't really work that way. Why would a journalist write a book about journalism? What would be the motivation? A critical sensibility, an anti-elitist sensibility, perhaps, an irritation with the bullshit? It's kind of left-wing.' He talked about genetic determinism, theories which he said had been discredited but which refused to die. They were kept alive, a comforting explanation for 'frightened, frightening lower-middle-class professional people who cannot take on the serious problems that our society poses for us. Of course you have to take the claims seriously but they've been wrong for 100 years.' Aren't your views influenced by your own experience, your backgound, a wish to believe that such claims are wrong? 'In a way that's fair comment. But that's exactly where the debate has to get started. What's been missing from the debate about nature versus nurture is why we believe what we do believe. What makes genetic theory so attractive to us?' I asked Schwartz how he would de-mystify science and restore it to its place in the common culture. 'When one is dealing with a deep structural problem good intentions don't go very far - as we have seen ever since Snow enunciated the Two Cultures. 'We believe we ought to know more about science but somehow our interest wears thin: and any subject deprived of a larger audience for a long time tends to grow narrow. Our science at the moment is not in fact very interesting: 'strings' and 'chaos' theory are hyped beyond measure in an attempt to capture the excitement of the 19th century. But it won't wash. 'We need a far more critical, sardonic, humorous science reporting - much more in fact like arts reporting. But will editors buy it?' Better, he said, to forget about high science for a decade or so and go back to talking and writing about technology instead. 'Because if we can get interested in our productive culture, and begin to reclaim it, then our scientists will have more interesting things to work on as well.'</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: SW Water rises 3% to Pounds 93m - Heavy spending programme offsets higher operating profit SOUTH West Water yesterday announced a 3 per cent profits increase, in line with expectations. Mr Ken Hill, finance director, described the 12 months to March 31 as 'an excellent year' and said South West's heavy spending programme, which includes cleaning up 81 beaches, remained on track. Annual pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 92.7m (Pounds 90m). At the interim stage, profits were 3.8 per cent ahead at Pounds 48.9m. Higher operating profits, stemming from price increases, were offset by falling interest income as the net cash position deteriorated in line with the heavy capital investment. Turnover increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 194m (Pounds 167m), mainly helped by average price rises of 17 per cent. Because of the improvements needed in its area, South West has the highest agreed price increases with Ofwat, the water regulator, of inflation plus 11.5 per cent. Operating profits increased by 29 per cent to Pounds 82.8m (Pounds 64.2m), helped by cost cutting and a divisional restructuring. Staff numbers fell by about 100 to just under 3,000. There were redundancy costs of Pounds 2.4m and bad debt amounting to Pounds 1.1m was written off. South West's non-regulated business, which includes Haul-Waste, purchased in February from English China Clays, contributed turnover of Pounds 10.3m and was slightly loss-making after interest. The company also announc-ed the Pounds 14.9m acquisition of Testlink Holdings, a manufacturer of environmental monitoring equipment. Capital expenditure in the period under review increased by 18 per cent to Pounds 203.7m. The company went from net cash of Pounds 150m to net borrowings of Pounds 14m. Interest receivable declined from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 11.9m. Earnings increased to 67.9p (66.1p). The company recommended a final dividend of 15.9p (14.6p) to make an increased total of 23.7p (21.7p). The share price closed 6p down at 514p. COMMENT This should be a revealing year for South West. Its cash pile is exhausted and last year's interest income will be replaced by an interest charge. Meanwhile, its non-core activities are set to grow rapidly at the sales level, thanks to the acquisitions, although their post-interest contribution will be under scrutiny. Overall, pre-tax profits will show a similar increase to last year. Despite dull profits growth, South West has the advantage of having renegotiated a price increase with the regulator already, when it agreed a 'cost pass-through' in 1991. The agreed increases are not sacrosanct after 1995, but they are less at risk of regulatory rigour than some water companies. However, given that the whole sector is under the lengthening shadow of regulatory worries ahead of Ofwat's 1994 interim review, South West is likely to drift with its peers.</p>

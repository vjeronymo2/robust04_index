			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Australia assails US trade barriers Australia's trade deficit with the US is widening because of import barriers Washington has erected to protect its own producers, the Australian government said in a report published yesterday, Reuter reports from Canberra The deficit was now proportionally bigger than the US trade deficit with Japan, according to the report by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 'The fact that a number of major Australian exports are subject to stringent US import controls has contributed to the growing imbalance in trade,' it said. The report said there were long-standing concerns over access to the US market, particularly for such key Australian agricultural products, as beef, dairy products and sugar. It said there were also concerns over the impact of US farm export subsidies on Australian exports to third countries, particularly of wheat, barley, malt and dairy products. In the year to June 30, 1993 Australian exports to the US were worth ADollars 4.92bn (Pounds 2.36bn) while imports from the US were worth ADollars 13.01bn. Australia's resulting trade deficit of ADollars 8.09bn with the US is its highest deficit with any one country. 'It is also larger, proportionally, than the US trade deficit with Japan,' the departmental report said. The implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) had not raised specific barriers against Australian imports, but had increased the potential for trade diversion through origin rules and tariff harmonisation tactics, the report said. The report did not specify what Australia would do to push the US to remove its barriers.</p>

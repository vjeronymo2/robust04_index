			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MASTER PLAN FOR CIVIC CENTER: LET WISDOM PREVAIL  </P> <P> Pasadena has been blessed frequently in the past when, after much labor and  debate, the city Board of Directors did not adopt a proposed plan. This has  enabled us to avoid serious mistakes and gross errors in direction planning.  </P> <P> The Livingston/Blaney study of Colorado Boulevard was such a case where we  would have destroyed the center of town if we had carried out the plan. The  study did provide valuable review and input for later planning consideration,  however, and it was the trigger for revitalization of the central business  area.  </P> <P> The present Civic Center Master Plan is a similar case where the study and  review is of tremendous value for our future, provided we do not take its  pontifical self-important edicts too much to heart and do not bind our future  in a straitjacket of detailed requirements that can only stifle the creativity  that needs to be available in our planning process.  </P> <P> The Pasadena Chamber of Commerce &amp; Civic Assn. would like the city board to  leave this "Plan" as an unadopted legacy of study, containing many useful ideas  and thoughts but not an absolute mandate from anyone.  </P> <P> Unfortunately most of us do not have the gift of long foresight. Because we see  backward much better, we prefer to plan from that vantage point while extolling  the virtues of that time. There is nothing wrong with building on the past, but  we should let our successors have the right to their visions, too.  </P> <P> This is particularly true when changes are all about us. Much of the future of  the Civic Center area is in a state of flux even as the plan is proclaimed.  What is in this plan is a one-person description, in detail, of what will be  permitted in Pasadena's future. And what of the major costs that will be  required to bring it to pass?  </P> <P> We sincerely hope that wisdom and caution will prevail over impetuous  self-service in concluding this study.  </P> <P> ANN T. HIGHT, President  </P> <P> LOUIS RICHARDS, Chairman,  </P> <P> City &amp; County Affairs Committee  </P> <P> BRUCE D. ACKERMAN,  </P> <P> Executive Vice President  </P> <P> Pasadena Chamber of Commerce  </P> <P> &amp; Civic Assn.  </P></p>

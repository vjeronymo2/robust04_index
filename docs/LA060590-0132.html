			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SUPERVISOR DISTRICTS ILLEGAL, JUDGE RULES  </P> <P> A federal judge ruled Monday that the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors  intentionally discriminated against Latinos in 1981 when it drew new district  boundaries.  </P> <P> In a decision that could dramatically alter the county's political landscape,  U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon found that the supervisors violated the  federal Voting Rights Act and must draft a new redistricting plan designed to  help the first Latino win a seat on the powerful board.  </P> <P> The judge said he would wait until a hearing Thursday to decide whether to  throw out the results of balloting today for two supervisorial seats. He also  urged the supervisors to reconsider expanding the five-member board to remedy  discrimination against Latinos.  </P> <P> In a 131-page opinion, Kenyon said, "The Hispanic community has sadly been  denied an equal opportunity to participate in the political process and to  elect candidates of their choice to the Board of Supervisors. . . . "  </P> <P> "During the 1981 redistricting process," the judge wrote, "the supervisors'  primary objective was to protect their incumbencies and that of their allies.  This objective, however, was inescapably linked to the continued fragmentation  of the Hispanic population core."  </P> <P> The historic voting rights lawsuit was filed by the U.S. Justice Department and  civil rights groups in 1988, two years after the Los Angeles City Council  settled a similar suit and created a Latino district.  </P> <P> The suit against the county alleged that the all-Anglo Board of Supervisors met  secretly in 1981 and divided heavily Latino neighborhoods in East Los Angeles  and the San Gabriel Valley into three districts, diluting the voting strength  of Latinos. All five members of the current board participated in the  redistricting.  </P> <P> Latinos account for a third of the county's population, but no Spanish-surnamed  person has ever been elected to the board.  </P> <P> The ruling not only enhances the chances for the first Latino to be elected, it  also may have broader repercussions.  </P> <P> The ruling could end a decade of conservative dominance of the board, which  oversees a $10-billion budget and serves 8 1/2 million residents -- a  population that is greater than those of 42 states. It also could threaten the  political security of some board members.  </P> <P> At the very least, attorneys for both sides said, the district boundaries face  a radical realignment, altering the political representation for hundreds of  thousands of county residents.  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich denied Monday that the board discriminated against  Latinos and called the ruling a "joy ride of judicial activism." He said that  he is certain that the board will appeal the ruling.  </P> <P> Supervisor Kenneth Hahn said he will introduce a motion at today's meeting  asking supervisors to place on the November ballot a measure expanding the  five-member board to seven members.  </P> <P> Supervisor Peter Schabarum called it "unfortunate" that Kenyon would rule on  the eve of the election, "further confusing the election."  </P> <P> "I continue to believe that district lines should not be based on ethnic  factors," said Schabarum, who decided not to run for reelection this year.  Supervisors Ed Edelman, who is seeking reelection today in the 3rd District,  and Deane Dana had no comment.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the county, which spent more than $3 million fighting the voting  rights lawsuit, did not return calls Monday. They had previously asked Kenyon  to allow today's election winners to serve until a special election can be held  under a new redistricting plan. The plaintiffs have asked that today's election  results be thrown out.  </P> <P> One of the top contenders in today's 10-candidate race to succeed Schabarum in  the 1st District is a Latina, Sarah Flores.  </P> <P> "What is this telling (our supporters), that all that work and all that energy  is wasted?" Flores lamented Monday.  </P> <P> But civil rights attorneys have argued that even if a Latino wins, it does not  resolve the issues that prompted the lawsuit -- that Latinos are denied an  opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice to the board.  </P> <P> "We will ask for the results of the election to be set aside," said Mark  Rosenbaum, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, a plaintiff in  the suit. "The judge's decision means the election in Districts 1 and 3 are  illegal."  </P> <P> Rosenbaum said he will "argue for a special election and for an expanded  board."  </P> <P> Attorneys for both sides previously have said that they believe the judge will  give the supervisors time -- Kenyon may decide Thursday how long -- to redraw  their lines for five or more districts. If the judge disapproves of the new  redistricting plan, he can redraw the boundaries. The plaintiffs have said they  will recommend plans to the supervisors.  </P> <P> The suit was brought by the Justice Department, the ACLU and the Mexican  American Legal Defense and Educational Fund to reverse what the plaintiffs said  was a decades-long pattern of discrimination. The suit was filed on behalf of  five Latino voters.  </P> <P> During the trial, the plaintiffs alleged that since the 1950s, the county had  deliberately fashioned district lines to deny Latinos political representation  on the board. Witnesses testified that the discrimination ranged from  restricted access to swimming pools and movie theaters in the early 1900s to  English literacy requirements for voting in the early 1960s.  </P> <P> In a hastily called press conference at the MALDEF office in downtown Los  Angeles, Latino leaders praised the judge's ruling.  </P> <P> "We want a remedy now," said Antonia Hernandez, president and general counsel  of MALDEF. "To be told once again to wait is not acceptable. We will not wait."  </P> <P> Hernandez said MALDEF will seek to have a redistricting plan formulated within  a month.  </P> <P> Rosenbaum said a new election could be held by year's end.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who had earlier said she would  consider running for supervisor, praised the ruling. "It means we have a fair  opportunity to elect our own . . . and finally, finally, get Latino  representation on the Board of Supervisors."  </P> <P> For Yolanda Garza, the East Los Angeles chemical engineer on whose behalf the  ACLU-MALDEF suit was filed, the victory was particularly sweet.  </P> <P> "I knew it was going to happen," she said. "Now I can go back and tell my  community that it made a difference."  </P> <P> In his ruling, Kenyon urged supervisors to reconsider expanding the board,  saying he believes the districts are too large for one person to adequately  represent.  </P> <P> The judge did not recommend a size for an expanded board. But plaintiffs have  talked about increasing the board from five to seven or nine seats. Expansion  has been opposed by the board's conservative majority.  </P> <P> "In this case, the explosive and continuous growth of the Los Angeles County  Hispanic community was evident at the time of the adoption of the 1981  redistricting plan as was the steady decline of the county's non-Hispanic white  population," Kenyon wrote.  </P> <P> During the trial, the county argued that it was not possible for the board to  carve out a district in which a majority of the voters are Latino because many  Latinos are not citizens or old enough to vote. The county also denied that it  engaged in discrimination and said that some supervisors attempted  unsuccessfully to carve out a Latino district.  </P> <P> But Kenyon ruled, "The court finds that Hispanic community is sufficiently  large and geographically compact such that a five-district plan can be drawn in  which Hispanics comprise a majority of the citizen voting-age population in one  of the five districts."  </P> <P> Orange County's last supervisorial redistricting also took place in 1981, but  no legal objections have been raised to it, so Monday's decision is not  expected to have any effect there, said County Counsel Adrian Kupyer.  </P> <P> Kupyer said Orange County officials will review the ruling in preparing for the  county's next redistricting, scheduled for 1991, but added that he does not  expect it alter the government's redistricting practices.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Jim Newton, Sheryl Stolberg and John Kendall contributed to  this story  </P></p>

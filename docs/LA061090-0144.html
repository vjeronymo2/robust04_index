			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAR SHOPPERS MAY GET A BETTER DEAL ON 1991 MODELS  </P> <P> Car shoppers planning to wait for the fall distress sales on leftover models  might be disappointed this year. And they might also find the 1991s are a  better deal because their prices are not expected to be much higher than those  of the '90s.  </P> <P> Some who follow the auto industry professionally doubt that the  end-of-the-model-year deals in August, September and October will be any better  than the discounts available now.  </P> <P> It's a matter of supply and demand: the production of cars versus their sales.  When unsold inventories rise, the deals usually get sweeter.  </P> <P> Inventories of models built by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and  Chrysler Corp. are lower than they were at this time last year and are, on  average, at levels considered normal, thanks to extensive assembly plant  shutdowns earlier in the year.  </P> <P> One Big Three executive, who shared company estimates on the condition that  their source not be disclosed, said there are about 1.4 million Big Three cars  in inventory now, 540,000 fewer than a year ago. There are about 88,000 fewer  Big Three trucks, or about 1.1 million, according to the estimates.  </P> <P> But some industry watchers think that current Big Three production levels and  those planned for June, July and August are higher than is justified by a  market propped up by some of the most generous cash rebates and option  discounts in the industry's history.  </P> <P> "Everything is up and running now," said Cynthia Certo of Integrated Automotive  Resources, a consulting firm in Wayne, Pa. "The problem is sales haven't been  picking up."  </P> <P> She thinks that inventories will rise, and, although many of those additional  cars will be 1991 models, a surplus could increase the pressure on car makers  to get rid of their leftover '90s.  </P> <P> Others think that supply and demand will stay in balance. "Sales are not very  good," said David Healy of Barclays Bank, "but production isn't very high  either." Adds Joseph Phillippi, auto analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.:  "I don't see the likelihood of massive fire sales unless (car) sales weaken  substantially."  </P> <P> Actions last week by Ford and Chrysler seem to support that view. Ford  announced that it planned a special rebate program between Sept. 28 and Dec. 31  for leftover '90s. It said some rebates could be less than those now offered,  although it did not rule out the possibility of some being higher. Chrysler  announced reduced rebates on five of its models, saying stronger sales had  reduced inventories.  </P> <P> Experts are in closer agreement about the outlook for the two biggest-selling  makes of Japanese cars: Toyota's and Honda's inventories are a little higher  than normal, and the companies are offering discounts -- though not cash  rebates. But their sales are strong, and experts don't expect their inventories  or their discounts to change much in coming months.  </P> <P> Experts also say they don't expect inventories -- or discounts to buyers --  will change much if one or more of the Big Three is struck in September when  their contracts with the United Auto Workers union expire. A long strike,  considered unlikely, could cause shortages, however, and drive up prices.  </P> <P> But experts do suggest a few other factors to consider if you're thinking of  buying a car in the next few months:  </P> <P> * Sticker prices for '91 models probably won't be much higher than those on the  '90s -- maybe 2% or 3%, according to analysts. They say the weak market simply  can't support anything higher. Last year, new-car prices rose about 5%.  </P> <P> * A leftover will be worth less as a used car simply because it was a  model-year older than a '91.  </P> <P> * The leftover '90 you're thinking of buying might be replaced by a 1991 model  you would consider worth the extra money and the wait. A few examples: Chrysler  Corp.'s minivans have been restyled for '91. So have the Buick Electra and  Oldsmobile Regency.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng said here today that the economies of China and the  Republic of Korea (ROK) are highly complementary to each other  and that bilateral cooperation in this regard has bright  prospects.    Li made the remarks at a meeting with Yi Man-sop, speaker of  ROK's National Assembly, and his party here this afternoon.    The Chinese premier extended a warm welcome to Yi, who is  the  first speaker of the ROK National Assembly to visit China since  the two countries established diplomatic relations.    He expressed the belief that the visit would play a positive  role in promoting the development of bilateral ties, mutual  understanding and cooperation between the two peoples and two  parliaments.    The satisfactory development of bilateral cooperation and  exchanges in every field was the result of the joint efforts on  both sides, he said, adding that the two parliaments have also  done their bit in this respect.    He noted that ROK's economy has been developing rapidly and  that the country has economic and technological advantages of  its own.    China's economy is also growing vigorously and the prospects  of cooperation between the two countries are bright, he stressed.    The Chinese people are now concentrating on their economic  development at home and pursuing a foreign policy of peace  abroad, Li said. "We attach special importance to developing  friendly ties of cooperation with our neighbors," Li noted.    On domestic affairs, Li said China's economic growth in the  past decade resulted from the reform and opening-up policies  initiated by Deng Xiaoping.    "We are going to put forward a series of reform measures in  the future," he said. These reforms would be active as well as  sustained and the relations between reform, development and  stability would be handled properly, he added.    Speaking of his visit here, Yi said his delegation had  extensive contacts and mutual understanding with China's  National People's Congress (NPC) and other departments.    The ROK's National Assembly would play an active role in  promoting ROK-China ties, Yi noted.    "We admire Mr. Deng Xiaoping very much. We have seen with  our own eyes the great achievements China has made while  maintaining its stability," Yi told the Chinese premier.    Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the NPC's Standing Committee,  took part in the meeting.    This moring, Deng Pufang, president of the China Association  for the Handicapped, met with Yi at the Diaoyutai State  Guesthouse. The two had a cordial talk.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Spices There are indications that the decline in pepper prices may be coming to an end, reports Man-producten. Sarawak has collected most of the harvest and a steadier price trend has emerged, with exporters more reluctant to sell. In Indonesia white pepper exporters have become more cautious by the week since pepper prices have not been so low in decades. Muntok white is offered at about Dollars 1,150 a tonne cif and Sarawak black at about Dollars 825 cif for prompt shipment from origin.</p>

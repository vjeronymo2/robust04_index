			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [``First-Hand'' Interview with Lieutenant General (Reserve) </F> Anatoliy Kuntsevich, former chairman of Russian president's  Committee for Convention Problems of Chemical and Biological  Weapons, by Andrey Vaganov; date, place not given: ``Anatoliy  Kuntsevich: `I Do Not Discuss Orders.' `Chemical' General's  First Interview Since His Dismissal'' -- first four paragraphs  are introduction]    [Text] The closer Russia comes to the point that the air  force calls ``the point of no-return,'' in this case to  ratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the  Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical  Weapons and on their Destruction, the more acute the squabbles  in public and in private over this problem become.    One of the most important manifestations of the internal  struggle within the top echelons of power was President  Yeltsin's 7 April 1994 edict relieving Russian Academy of  Sciences Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich of his post as chairman  of the Russian president's Committee for Convention Problems of  Chemical and Biological Weapons. The edict contained the  following wording -- ``for a single gross breach of professional  duty.'' The president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov  interpreted this as follows: ``The committee agreed to toxins  being transported and stored in a major population center.''  However, it seems that, if this actually did occur, it was more  of an excuse than the real reason. (Suffice it to say that Mr.  Kuntsevich was ill at the time the edict was drafted).    The story linking Anatoliy Kuntsevich's dismissal with a  ``moral victory for the military-chemical dissident'' Vil  Mirzayanov and company is even less plausible.    Strangely enough, Lt. Gen. (Reserve) Kuntsevich does not  seem  to have suited certain structures within the Russian Defense  Ministry. And they are not the only ones. Whatever you say  about Anatoliy Kuntsevich, his status as a top-class  professional and his undoubted international prestige gave him a  many opportunities for candor. It is extremely likely that  someone thought that the committee led by Kuntsevich was too  ``extradepartmental.'' Your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA was told by a  highly-placed official from this department, who asked to remain  anonymous, that ``there are more than enough people who are  unaware of the problem but who want to head up this  organization. Many people are attracted by the chairmanship,  which holds ministerial rank. Moreover, it will be easier for  `competent' organizations to control such an incompetent  person.''    Vaganov: The specific wording of the presidential  edict regarding your dismissal is pretty surprising for an  official of your rank. Do you have any comment to make?    Kuntsevich: I would like to say right away that,  in accordance with the old soldier's custom, I do not discuss  orders from above.    Vaganov: Fine. Could you tell us how much of a  surprise this was to you?    Kuntsevich: This situation can be regarded in  different ways. I do not want to get personal. There is a  Russian presidential edict which I am obliged to implement.    But I must say on the whole that the problem of chemical  disarmament concerns very important and extremely sensitive  aspects of our state's activity. Naturally a whole range of  opinions arise when these matters are being decided. How can  they be resolved so as to accord with national interests above  all? On the other hand we have to act so that Russia does not  ``drop out'' of civilized forms of communication with other  states.    Vaganov: How did the Committee on Convention  Problems begin its activity?    Kuntsevich: The Convention on the Prohibition of  Biological Weapons was formulated way back in 1972. The USSR  subscribed to it in 1975. However, no legal documents were  adopted at the time banning the development of offensive  biological programs in the USSR.    In February 1992 the Committee on Convention Problems of  Chemical and Biological Weapons was set up under the Russian  president, and 11 April that same year a Russian presidential  edict appeared with the committee's direct participation aimed  at ensuring Russia's fulfillment of international convention  commitments in the sphere of biological weapons and banning the  implementation in our country of any offensive biological  programs. The committee was made responsible for supervising  implementation of this edict's provisions. The matter was  finalized in law. In my view, this was the committee's first  major act, and it drew worldwide attention.    It was then necessary to discover forms and means of working  that would make it possible to remove mutual suspicion and  anxiety between Russia, the United States, Britain, and other  countries in the sphere of biological weapons. We proposed  carrying out a series of inspections. This approach of ours was  put into effect in September 1992 in a tripartite --  Russian-U.S.-British -- joint statement, which also made  provision for the principle of carrying out mutual inspections.    These inspections have gone ahead in 1993-1994. A joint  group of U.S. and British experts and inspectors inspected four  facilities in Russia. Russian specialists accordingly visited  three installations in the United States and one in Britain. A  real foundation developed for comparing our countries'  scientific, technical, and industrial potential in this field  with facts and figures in hand. Thus, we brought our relations  to the point of possible quantitative juxtaposition and  comparison. Today, a good working roundtable has formed at  which any problems can be constructively discussed.    Vaganov: And this is the moment when you, one of  the people who set up this roundtable, are unexpectedly removed  from the chairmanship of the Committee on Convention Problems.  It looks as though there is a negative opinion of your work in  this post.    Kuntsevich: That has nothing to do with the  committee's activity. I do not think that this decision was  based on what you have said. The committee is not me alone.  There are 57 people working on it today. By current standards  that is a small collective, but it comprises eminent  specialists. Perhaps that is my main achievement -- that I  succeeded in finding people who are professionally aware of the  full complexity and multifaceted nature of the problems and  really have an idea of the possible ways of resolving them  without harming Russia's national interests and security.    Vaganov: What do you think are the main  difficulties facing Russia in the sphere of chemical disarmament?    Kuntsevich: The most challenging problem is the  problem of what is to be done with the Convention on the  Prohibition of Chemical Weapons which Russia signed in January  1993. It concerns Russia's highest international and national  interests.    No matter how my opponents reproach me for rushing to sign  this convention, I categorically disagree with that. The  negotiating process began back in 1980 or even earlier.  Moreover, as for the history of this problem, Russia came to  the negotiating table back in... 1868. It was then that the  first legal document in the field of chemical weapons appeared  in St. Petersburg -- a declaration banning the use of poisoned  bullets was signed.    Vaganov: To return to today's events....    Kuntsevich: We are in effect talking about one  thing today -- whether or not to ratify the convention.    Vaganov: What do you predict?    Kuntsevich: This is all pretty tricky. I spoke  about it at the State Duma hearings 24 March this year. We have  to square economic, financial, and technological potential with  our commitments under this convention and determine the real  priorities in disarmament. Russia's international political,  moral, and ethical prestige is undoubtedly in the balance.    From the time when the committee was formed I always said  that, for Russia to be able to join this convention, it was  essential to create powerful international support for it,  bearing in mind our current difficult economic and financial  situation. This international support must undoubtedly come  under our intellectual, scientific and technical, and  organizational leadership. I am talking not about obtaining  some kind of financial or technological handout but about  creating a committed pool of support for Russia's chemical  weapons destruction program -- which is particularly important  during the initial phase.  In addition, previously my opponents tried via the mass media  to present me as a rabid supporter of the military-chemical  complex, dreaming of how to drag out the process of chemical  disarmament and ridding Russia of the heavy military-chemical  burden. However, to be fair I must say that of late my  opponents have done a complete turnabout. They are now trying  to persuade the public that Kuntsevich was allegedly in a hurry  and impelled Russia to sign the Convention on the Prohibition of  Chemical Weapons. I categorically refute that opinion and  consider it unprofessional in every respect -- from both the  state, the political, and the general human viewpoints.    It is now being said that the committee chairman was  developing pro-Western sentiments and upholding a Western line.  But, pardon me for saying so, what strategic line should I have  developed in the interests of my taxpayer? Would it really have  been bad for the committee to try to obtain $6 billion in aid  (and the preconditions for that did exist)? I can say that the  preconditions are still there today for us to obtain almost $1  billion in foreign aid. Can that really be bad for Russia?    Vaganov: So, someone in the top ranks of the  Russian leadership has decided that it is bad....    Kuntsevich: I do not think that this decision came  from the top. However, there are obviously politicians and  various currents that are trying to play this card in their own  interests.    Vaganov: Now a very tough question: Where are the  chemical weapons to be destroyed?    Kuntsevich: We have to be realistic about this:  There is not a single component of the Federation today that  would voluntarily accept chemical munitions for destruction on  its territory. And few would even allow them to be transported  across their territory. So we must design a system whereby  these weapons will be destroyed right in the areas where they  are stored. National unity has to be secured on this: All the  other components of the Federation must not simply be left as  detached observers, especially since the timeframes for the safe  storage of chemical weapons are ebbing away before our eyes.    The regions must join forces with industrial and  entrepreneurial structures and set up a system of funds. And  corresponding concessions enshrined in legislation by the State  Duma are needed in order for regions where chemical weapons  destruction facilities are located to obtain the requisite  investment.    Vaganov: Following your dismissal, do you still  have a real chance of influencing the destruction of chemical  weapons?    Kuntsevich: I am a chemist by profession. In the  more specialized sense I am a specialist in the destruction of  toxic substances. I began studying this in 1958 right after  graduating from the Academy of Chemical Protection. I will most  likely now return to the Russian Academy of Sciences, where  before my committee appointment I was working mainly on the  recycling of intermediate products and toxic substances and on  the conversion of production facilities.    In particular, I will do everything in my power to implement  the idea of creating a system of funds to support the program  for the destruction of chemical weapons. There are many people  who are interested in this. But they want guarantees from the  state, they want to be sure that they are involved not in a vain  undertaking but in an important, promising job. And there are  elements that they find very appealing. First, involvement in  what is effectively a global project for the destruction of  chemical weapons. In this connection -- and this is the second  point -- the project has strong political ``protection.'' Any  authority -- I mean any sensible authority -- will do its utmost  to reinforce this political ``protection.'' Consequently,  guarantees of stability -- political and state -- exist that  will ultimately not only enable Russia to meet its international  commitments under the convention but will also make it possible  to rid Russian citizens and all mankind of the threat of one of  the most insidious kinds of mass-destruction weapon.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Clinton gets tips on fine-tuning Nafta - An influential report offers policy signposts AGGRESSIVE enforcement of national labour laws in Mexico and a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2.1bn) environmental clean-up fund are called for in an assessment of the North American Free Trade Agreement released yesterday by the influential Washington-based Institute for International Economics. The recommendations address fierce criticism of Nafta, particularly from US labour and environmental interests which have been lobbying the Clinton administration for amendments to the regional trade agreement. Nafta was signed late last year by President George Bush, Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, and Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister. It is to be put to Congress for ratification later this year. President Bill Clinton has committed the new administration to amendments to the text, taking account of these pressures. The IIE assessment - giving an overall B+ grade to the 2,000-page agreement  -is intended to provide signposts to the policies he could adopt. It gives clear support for the administration's call for supplementary agreements to Nafta on labour and the environment, and recommends a Dollars 3bn 'Nafta fund' in preference to a proposal from Democratic senator Max Baucus for a special Nafta transaction tax. The Nafta fund would finance the environmental clean-up on the US-Mexican border and would help to underwrite work by the Environmental Protection Commission, already suggested by Mr Clinton, in sponsoring broad assessments of environmental conditions in each country. The IIE calls on the three Nafta signatories to earmark for the fund Dollars 300m a year each for five years, from 1994. The Environmental Commission should also set up procedures to encourage harmonisation of environmental standards, and set fines, or 'green fees', for countries distorting trade inside the region because of poor environmental standards. The study predicts that Nafta would create a net 171,000 new jobs in the US, with US surpluses in its trade with Mexico varying between Dollars 7bn and Dollars 9bn a year up to 1995. 'Ross Perot got it wrong,' said Mr Fred Bergsten, director of the IIE. 'There has been a huge sucking sound, as Perot described, but it has been due to US exports and the creation of American jobs.' Mr Perot last year predicted Nafta would create the 'sucking sound' of US jobs lost to Mexico. Mr Bergsten noted a Dollars 13bn swing in favour of the US in trade with Mexico since 1989, a shift which he estimates has already created 200,000-300,000 jobs in the US. While 316,000 jobs would be created by Nafta, the IIE report forecasts that 145,000 jobs would be 'dislocated' - a bare 2 per cent of the 8.9m jobs lost in the US in the five years to 1990 because of plant closures, bankruptcies and lay-offs. It calls for Dollars 335m a year to be spent from existing tariff revenues for adjustment programmes linked with Nafta job losses, but calls for this to be part of a wider national worker training programme. Mr Gary Hufbauer and Mr Jeffrey Schott, the authors of the report, recommend new negotiations to establish Mexican commitment to 'aggressive enforcement of national labour laws and regulations'. They call for a trinational commission to enforce labour standards, and authorise sanctions if governments fail to halt abuses. However, they insist the ultimate value of Nafta is in its boost to the competitiveness of regional industries, rather than in job creation. 'Efficiency benefits and growth stimulus could exceed Dollars 15bn annually. This figure, rather than jobs gained or lost, is the true measure of the economic gain from the Nafta agreement,' which they see as one aspect of a wider US strategy aimed at improving competitiveness and productivity. The assessment confirms, but is more optimistic than, the findings of a study just released by the US International Trade Commission on the potential impact of Nafta. This predicts the trade pact would provide a lift of up to 0.5 per cent of real GNP in Canada and the US, with a potential increase of 11.4 per cent in Mexico. The ITC says US exports to Mexico could be boosted from 5.2 per cent to 27 per cent by the agreement, with Mexico's exports to the US jumping by between 3.4 per cent and 15 per cent. It predicts aggregate employment gains in the US of 'less than 1 per cent' of a workforce that currently totals 117m. The commission says industries which will see greatest benefit will be machine tools, bearings, industrial machinery, steel mill products, pharmaceuticals, textiles, grains and oilseeds, cotton, wood products and motor parts. Industries likely to suffer will be the motor industry, garments, flat glass, glassware, household appliances, shrimps, peanuts, and vegetables. It points to 'an almost discernible effect on US wage rates for both low-skilled and high-skilled workers' - a conclusion shared by the IIE study. The studies coincide with signals from labour groups that they may be poised to moderate claims that Nafta will be a catastrophe for workers and consumers. As leaders of the influential AFL-CIO trade union grouping held their first executive council meeting since the presidential election, they hinted that US workers must come to terms with closer integration in Mexico, pressing for higher minimum wages in Mexico instead of opposing Nafta itself.  ----------------------------------------------- The Nafta scorecard  ----------------------------------------------- Nafta provisions           Grade  ----------------------------------------------- MARKET ACCESS BY SECTOR Energy                       C+ Automobiles                  B Textiles and apparel         B+ Agriculture                  A Financial services           B+ Transportation               A Telecommunications           B+ TRADE RULES Rules of origin              B+ Safeguards                   C Subsidies and dumping        B Dispute settlement           A Government procurement       B+ NEW ISSUES Investment                   A+ Intellectual property        B Environment                  B Labour adjustment            A Maquiladoras*                B AVERAGE GRADE                B+  ----------------------------------------------- * Border factories with tariff advantages  ----------------------------------------------- Source: IIE, Washington DC  -----------------------------------------------</p>

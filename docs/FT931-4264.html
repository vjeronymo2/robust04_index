			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software At Work, Spring 1993 (22): A boon for small businesses - Electrical appliance suppliers are subsidising EDI for their service agents - to both sides' benefit / EDI Joint Venture - Manufacturers and service companies LEADING manufacturers of small electrical appliances have spent thousands of pounds to develop an electronic data interchange software package that they will never use. Yet they are delighted with the system, because it is bringing hundreds of tiny service firms into EDI and eliminating all the paperwork that goes with handling orders and deliveries of components and paying for repairs. The manufacturers - Braun, Dimplex, Moulinex Swan Krupps and Tefal and Rowenta - have worked together through the Small Electrical Manufacturers Association to develop a software package which handles stock control and job-costing for the service firms, as well as links to an EDI network. The software can also connect to popular accounting packages such as Sage and Pegasus. The manufacturers have set up an EDI service called EASAS - Electrical Appliance Service Agents System - which runs on the British Telecom EDI network, but is managed by themselves. The day-to-day running of the service is contracted to a software company, Perwill Group, which also worked on the software, but the appliance manufacturers control the strategy and development of the EDI system and the package. The service agents pay just Pounds 90 for the software package and Pounds 30 a month to use EASAS, plus telephone charges. The price has been kept so low because the industry is made up of hundreds of tiny firms. Some work from market stalls and are sending EDI messages through a personal computer at the back of their pitch - 'for Pounds 90, the service agents get a full-blown business and EDI package,' says Mr Nigel Eastham, who runs EASAS at Perwill. 'This will never cover the development and enhancement costs but the manufacturers nonetheless see their investment as worthwhile because of the efficiency that EDI is bringing.' This is confirmed by Mr Karl Uggerholt, finance director at Braun: 'We receive a mountain of paperwork from the hundreds of agents we deal with. EASAS is drastically reducing that mountain.' Manufacturers have traditionally received orders for parts by post. This means opening and sorting letters and keying information into a computer system. With EDI, information is prepared only once - by the service agent - and can be in a manufacturer's system within minutes of a customer coming through the agent's door with a broken kettle or electric shaver. The spare parts can be sent the same day. 'We can already manage claims much more quickly and efficiently, resulting in better service to our agents, which in turn has a beneficial effect for the customer,' says Mr Uggerholt at Braun. The agents also benefit from other aspects of the software. They can enter a product model number and the system lists all the parts. They can look up prices and give a customer an instant quotation for a repair. Nigel Eastham at Perwill says EASAS is a good example of a commercial community totally controlling EDI in its own sector. 'Every manufacturer has one vote and all development is equally shared, so a big company can't control things,' he says. 'The agents deal with several manufacturers, so their system has to be able to accommodate different companies' payment methods and rates. If one manufacturer ran it, that company could control the development and gear the system to its own way of operating.' The EASAS committee consists only of manufacturers. Mr Eastham says service agents might be represented some time in the future but points out that they talk to Perwill, their system support company, about suggested changes to the software, and the company puts these requests to the committee. 'The manufacturers want to accommodate the agents as much as possible, because they want as many agents as possible on the EDI system,' he says. Individual manufacturers could work on their own with EDI services and insist that their agents join those services, as has happened in other industries. But this would be prohibitively expensive for the very small service firms. Nigel Eastham says the service agents are under no pressure to join EASAS. EASAS running costs are kept down by the community arrangement. British Telecom sends one invoice to EASAS and Perwill sorts out individual invoices for all the companies connected and chases payment when necessary. Perwill also provides support - a considerable task. 'About 90 per cent of the agents are new to computing,' Nigel Eastham says. 'We spend an extreme amount of time answering their questions before they join - and once a firm is on the system we typically get three or four calls a day for the first two or three weeks.' BT's EDI network service was chosen because EASAS felt the company had developed the service well over the last year and was ready to offer 'very good basic terms and very reasonable running costs', says Mr Eastham. EASAS has been running since June 1992 and all the parties now want more companies to join. Eventually, the number of manufacturers could go from the original four to around two-dozen. This would spread the funding burden. There are now 30 service agents connected and the potential is over 400. Agents typically work for between half-a-dozen and 20 manufacturers. Perwill managing director Mr Bill Pugsley concludes: 'EASAS has brought rival companies together to use the business benefits of EDI - not as an individual competitive weapon - but to improve service levels all round.' ***** SUPPLIER DETAILS Perwill Perwill Group, a privately-owned UK company formed in 1974. Based in Alton, Hampshire, it has subsidiaries in the US, Australia and Singapore. Services: Perwill specialised initially in order processing and stock control systems. In the UK, the group now consists of Perwill Business Management Consultants, Perwill Business Solutions and Perwill Support Services. This last company manages EASAS and two other EDI communities: one for amusement machine manufacturers and site owners which have the machines; the other for Glaxo Pharmaceuticals suppliers. Turnover: 1991 Pounds 1.6m; 1992 Pounds 2.4m. How small firms benefit from EDI, Page 20</p>

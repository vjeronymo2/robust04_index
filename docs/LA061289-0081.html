			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASPARTAME HAS AMA SEAL OF APPROVAL  </P> <P> Question: I was out with some friends recently and I used an artificial  sweetener, aspartame, for my tea, and one of the other people at the table  remarked that it was not healthy to use it. I'm usually very careful about what  I eat, and I was surprised by this comment. I've been under the impression that  aspartame is safe to use. Have I been wrong?  </P> <P> Answer: The American Medical Assn. has accepted aspartame as safe to use in  normal amounts. Of course, this does not preclude the possibility that a  particular individual may be sensitive to the product.  </P> <P> Q: My sister just celebrated her 70th birthday, and she mentioned to me that  her doctor told her that her blood glucose level was high but that she did not  have to do anything about it. Shouldn't she be getting some form of treatment?  </P> <P> A: I'm not certain what your sister meant by "high." The safe range for blood  glucose levels increases as a person grows older. Your sister's blood glucose  may be "high" in comparison with that of a younger person, but perfectly normal  for someone her age. If that's the case, there is no need for any treatment.  </P> <P> Q: I tried breaking in a pair of new shoes, but I developed a corn and now  can't wear the shoes. Was it the shoes that caused the corn? What kind of  treatment would you recommend?  </P> <P> A: A corn may form when a spot on the foot is subject to rubbing over a period  of time. Eventually, the skin thickens in an effort to protect the area;  however, the thickened skin also results in greater pressure.  </P> <P> Untreated corns may crack, and this, in turn, may lead to infection. A  podiatrist can safely remove the corns. Over-the-counter preparations are not  recommended.  </P></p>

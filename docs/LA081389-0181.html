			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERIORS: PUTTING FRENCH ACCENT ON HOME DECORATION;  </P> <P> TALL ARMOIRES, WHITEWASHED WALLS, TERRA-COTTA FLOORS PART OF THE COUNTRY STYLE.  </P> <P> You don't need a decorating authority to tell you that a room with whitewashed  walls, unpolished terra-cotta floors, blue-and-white tiles and an antique  walnut armoire is a country-French-style room.  </P> <P> This rustic, traditional style is one of the most popular looks currently.  Consequently, you'll find many reproductions in the marketplace to help you  achieve it, says Pierre Moulin, co-author of "Pierre Deux's French Country."  </P> <P> A principal of Pierre Deux, the New York antiques firm that helped popularize  the style, Moulin says the French-country look is more an overall feeling than  any single specific group of furnishings.  </P> <P> However, he says, some of these elements in antiques or reproductions help to  create a French-country room:  </P> <P>  -- An armoire -- often as tall as 10 feet -- was often part of a bride's dowry  and was passed down from one generation to another. Today, armoires are used to  store a great variety of belongings, such as clothing, linens, home  entertainment equipment, dinnerware and bar ware. Armoires look great in  virtually any room, especially the living area, dining room and bedroom.  </P> <P> French armoires are usually walnut or cherry and often feature carvings of  flowers, wheat or vine leaves. Some of the prettiest armoires, however, have  painted finishes.  </P> <P>  -- Dining chairs in country-French rooms are rustic and simple. Rush seats are  typical, but cane and ladder backs are also used.  </P> <P>  -- Appropriate French-country beds include canopy beds, beds with panel  headboards and day beds. A white-mesh, draped-metal framed bed with a canopy  frame that comes to a center point is a romantic treatment. Most country  bedrooms were quite simple, with a minimum of possessions and accessories on  display.  </P> <P>  -- Country-French fabrics emphasize natural fibers. Good choices include  vividly colored Provencal prints, plaids and tapestries, and toile de Jouy  scenes in white with black, red, green or blue can be used both as upholstery  and to line walls.  </P> <P> If you're stuck for a color scheme or fabric choice, look at the provincial  paintings of Cezanne and Van Gogh to get some ideas.  </P> <P> Here are some additional decorating suggestions from Michael Delgaudio, fashion  director of Henredon Furniture:  </P> <P> Paint the walls white. A stucco finish is ideal because it provides a rustic  feeling.  </P> <P> Terra-cotta tile, bare wood planking or sisal matting are all appropriate  choices for floors. If you like the look of tile, but don't want to install it,  try painting the floor with a blue and white trompe l'oeil tile pattern.  </P> <P> Arrange furniture symmetrically and use pairs of furniture and accessories to  create a strong feeling of balance. For example, place the same model of  console table or chairs at either side of a door or sofa. Place two  candlesticks on a mantel.  </P> <P> Emphasize accessories such as pewter, glazed and unglazed ceramic pieces,  copper pots, straw baskets, dried flowers. For fresh flowers, favor potted  geraniums and bunches of daisies, and hang pictures a little higher than  normal.  </P> <P> Arrange the interior of armoires attractively so you can leave them open. Line  them with French fabric, as housewives did in Provence. Keep window treatments  simple; lace panels are appropriate.  </P></p>

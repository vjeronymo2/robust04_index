			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Betterware makes Pounds 14mbut warns on outlook Betterware, the direct home shopping group, yesterday reported a 3 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits held back by lower interest receipts and the absence of a large exceptional gain which bolstered the previous year's figures. Profits for the year to February 26 increased from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 14.1m on turnover which grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 63.2m (Pounds 56.3m). The growth in turnover was underpinned by a 14 per cent increase in UK sales which rose to Pounds 50.5m and a fourfold increase of sales in France to Pounds 2.8m. The pre-tax result included net interest receipts of Pounds 823,000 (Pounds 1.14m) while the comparable profit figure was inflated by an exceptional Pounds 1.53m VAT credit. Earnings increased to 9.4p (8.4p) helped by a lower tax charge of Pounds 4.39m (Pounds 5.14m). A proposed final dividend of 1.95p makes a 2.6p (2p) total. The shares closed 5p lower at 123p. Mr Walter Goldsmith, chairman, said it had been 'a challenging year' but that Betterware had emerged stronger as a result of a series of steps including the opening of a new Pounds 10m distribution centre near Birmingham, the strengthening of senior management and further expansion in continental Europe. Operating profits increased by 5.5 per cent to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 12.5m). However, excluding the VAT refund underlying operating profits grew by 19 per cent. UK margins were higher, helped by a greater emphasis on product development. The UK average order level held steady at about Pounds 8. That compared with Pounds 13 in the French operations, which were started two years ago and made about Pounds 300,000 in profits last year, and Pounds 10 in Spain where Betterware began door-to-door sales in September. Mr Andrew Cohen, chief executive, said the group plans to begin operations in Germany in the current financial year and will invest about Pounds 1m in the start-up. Commenting on the outlook Mr Goldsmith cautioned that sales in the first quarter had been held back by start-up problems at the new distribution centre, although he said these had now been resolved. He added that sales were also affected by 'the consumer uncertainty' of recent weeks but said sales were now showing 'a distinctly more positive picture'. COMMENT The years of strong growth in the maturing UK market are probably over but the group plans to maintain UK margins by encouraging customers to increase their average spend and by cutting its purchase costs. However, the real engine for future growth should be the new operations in continental Europe. Against this, teething problems at Birmingham and other factors have hit sales and orders at the start of the current year. Overall, pre-tax profits are likely to edge higher to about Pounds 14.5m this year producing earnings of 9.5p. The shares have fallen sharply over the past year and are now trading on a reasonable prospective p/e of 12.9.</p>

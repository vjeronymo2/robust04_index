			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T calls in five debt issues AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Tele-graph is to call in five long-term debt issues totalling Dollars 1.75bn for early redemption, Reuter reports from New York. The US telecommunications group said it expected to use cash reserves and new debt to fund the redemptions. Associated one-time costs are expected to cut first-quarter 1993 earnings by about 4 cents a share. However, interest expense reductions in subsequent quarters will reduce the full-year impact to less than 2 cents a share. AT&amp;T forecast the refunding would increase earnings by as much as 3 cents share annually beginning in 1994.</p>

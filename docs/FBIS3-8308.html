Here is our special  correspondent Klara Stejskalova with a summary of what happened  at the conference.    [Stejskalova] [passage omitted] Czech Foreign Minister Josef  Zieleniec emphasized that the Czech Republic is interested in  deepening cooperation in the area of migration and in  contributing to the shaping of pan-European migration policy.  [passage omitted]    More controversial was, as usual, the question of ethnic  minorities, which was brought to a head mainly by the Hungarian  side. In this connection, Slovak representative Jozef Prokes  emphasized that the Council of Europe session in Vienna did not  reach any agreement on ethnic minorities. He reminded of the  absence of a comparative study of the position of Central  European minorities, something that is needed for an overall  solution to this problem. At the same time, he firmly refused  to accept that this problem is specific to our region.    Josef Zieleniec stated his belief that the minority issue --  and other political problems -- should be dealt with by  appropriate bodies, such as the Council of Europe. The CEI  should rather concentrate on concrete economic cooperation.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Dixon Motors runs ahead of projections with Pounds 642,000 Correction (published 3rd September 1993) appended to this article. DIXON MOTORS, the Hull-based motor retailer which joined the USM via a reversal into Plateau Mining earlier this year, returned pro forma pre-tax profits of Pounds 642,000 for the half year ended June 30. The figure was ahead of the directors' expectations and came on turnover of Pounds 29m, up from Pounds 20.4m. They said the advance reflected an improved performance in all areas of the business, with total car sales for the period ahead by 62 per cent at 3,449 units. The group's year-end has been changed to December 31. Consolidated results for the nine months ended June 30 showed profits at Pounds 77,000. The directors said these figures were not particularly meaningful and comprised nine months contribution from Plateau and five weeks from Dixon. As forecast, an interim dividend of 0.75p is being paid subject to High Court approval of a capital restructuring. The second half of the year had started well, with July and August ahead of management projections. The group is to raise about Pounds 1.69m of additional working capital via an issue of new ordinary shares. Plateau Mining was formerly a natural resources group which had been fighting a hostile bid. CORRECTION Dixon Motors raised Pounds 1.69m in a share placing in May. Yesterday's edition incorrectly reported it was to raise the sum.</p>

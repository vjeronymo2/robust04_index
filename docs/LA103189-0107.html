			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: BEWITCHED, BOTHERED, BEWILDERED  </P> <P> Lots of strange things happened in the White House during the Reagan years. It  has been confirmed that both the President and the First Lady ran the country  by astrology. What is not known is that they also consulted a Halloween witch.  </P> <P> At least, that's the story I heard from a lady who flew into my office on a  broom the other day. She was wearing a mask, a large orange and black pointed  hat and a Bill Blass black cape. She was also chewing a wad of tobacco.  </P> <P> Despite all of this, I was skeptical that she was really the Reagans' witch.  </P> <P> "I was the wicked witch of the upstairs," she cackled. "I only came down on  Halloween, but I was in the house all the time, scaring the hell out of Al  Haig. The Reagans depended on me for every decision."  </P> <P> She threw sand on my desk and waved a cat's paw over my fax machine. "I used to  fly around the Reagan bedroom every night giving them advice. I'm talking now  because Nancy left me out of her book."  </P> <P> "She may have had her reasons for that, but why did Don Regan leave you out of  his book too? He put everyone else in."  </P> <P> She smiled and her black teeth dazzled me. "Regan was not aware of my  existence. He just knew about the stargazer. The rat became suspicious once  when he saw an astronomical White House bill for frogs' gizzards, which I was  using to figure out U.S. defense needs. Fortunately, Nancy told him that they  were part of her dog's diet."  </P> <P> "Why would the Reagans need a witch to run the country when they already had an  astrologer?"  </P> <P> "Mr. Reagan always insisted on a second opinion. That's what made him such a  great President. The astrologer studied the heavens, while I depended on  Valentino scraps."  </P> <P> "Valentino scraps?"  </P> <P> "They came from one of Nancy's dressmakers. Every night Valentino swept the  floor and sent the scraps over to me. I mixed them with Elizabeth Taylor's  perfume and smeared the concoction all over my arms and legs. It was very  helpful when I had to make decisions about the deficit."  </P> <P> "I think this is a put-on," I told her. "I have heard of astrologers who made  vital decisions affecting this country, but I've never heard of a witch being  involved with national policy."  </P> <P> "Who do you think shredded Ollie North's papers?"  </P> <P> "Ollie and Fawn."  </P> <P> "They wanted you to think that. I went over there and dumped all the evidence  into a caldron. Then I added some Paul Newman spaghetti sauce and made a stew."  </P> <P> "The stew was never mentioned at the trial."  </P> <P> "The White House wouldn't allow it," she said. "Are you aware that Reagan asked  me to put a curse on Noriega?"  </P> <P> "No, I'm not. What did you do?"  </P> <P> "I made a potion of Coor's beer, yogurt, Weight Watchers sweet potatoes and  United Airlines macadamia nuts. After all the members of the National Security  Council drank some, they decided that Noriega was dead."  </P> <P> "What was the real reason you came out of the closet at this time?" I asked  her.  </P> <P> "The astrologer was taking all the credit for Grenada, and it was my idea. I  mentioned it to the President on Halloween."  </P> <P> "It's hard to believe that the country would be in the hands of someone  involved in witchcraft. Did anyone apart from the Reagans know?"  </P> <P> "George Bush -- which is why he told everybody that Reagan was hooked on voodoo  economics."  </P></p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Nissan will invest Pounds 20m in car R&amp;D NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, is to invest Pounds 20m to expand its vehicle design and development facilities in the UK, the company announced yesterday. That will bring its total investment in design and development operations in Europe to Pounds 64m. Mr Yutaka Kume, Nissan's president, said the company also hoped to expand production capacity in the UK to 400,000 cars a year by the end of the 1990s. Officially Nissan has disclosed plans to date only for raising UK car capacity to 300,000 a year by 1993. Mr Kume said the company hoped to raise capacity to 400,000 a year without a third model range. It is investing more than Pounds 900m at its Sunderland car plant, where production begins this summer of the Micra small car in addition to the existing Primera. Nissan, the leading Japanese vehicle maker in Europe, is moving fast to expand its European operations to stay ahead of its domestic rivals, chiefly Toyota, the biggest Japanese carmaker, which starts car production in the UK this year. Mr Kume said the company was increasing investment at the Nissan European Technology Centre at Cranfield, Bedfordshire, to Pounds 46m. The first stage of the operation was officially opened yesterday. In total, Nissan is investing Pounds 64m in its European design and development operations, with Pounds 5m spent at Sunderland on a vehicle proving ground and Pounds 13m invested at NETC Brussels. NETC now employs 360 people in the UK. That will rise to 385 by next year. Mr Kume said the expansion at Cranfield would allow vehicle prototype development and assembly work to be moved from Japan to the UK. Engines and chassis component assembly and testing would also move to the UK. The NETC will be able to build and test prototype vehicles for Europe and to test and refine engines for European-built vehicles. Controversially, Mr Kume claimed that Nissan had become 'a fully integrated European manufacturer designing, producing and selling vehicles in Europe for European customers'. Nissan now has design and development centres in the US and in Europe as well as the main facilities in Japan. The expansion at Cranfield includes a road simulator and full climatic test chamber with vehicle endurance testing. It is also building a soundproof chamber for dynamic testing of vehicles at speeds up to 155 mph.</p>

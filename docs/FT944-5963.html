			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Lilley confirms government plans to overcome benefit fraud Mr Lilley yesterday confirmed that the government would be pushing ahead with plans to combat benefit fraud by introducing swipe cards with which welfare payments could be withdrawn. Mr Lilley told MPs in a statement to the Commons that the government would launch a computerised system for benefit payments in 1996. The new system will be partly funded by private-sector capital and will mean strengthening the post office network. Mr Lilley said nine companies had submitted proposals to be prime contractors for the system. He said: 'The card we choose must be easy and acceptable to use, especially for pensioners.' He also announced that the government would press ahead with plans to reduce fraud by improving co-ordination between different local authorities.</p>

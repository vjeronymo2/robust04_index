			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Troops and Dollars"] </F>   [Text] The signals are utterly, maybe disastrously, mixed.  On the one hand -- after last week's meeting of the  Commonwealth of Independent States -- we see the beginnings of a  "defensive union" which edges Russia still further from the  Partnership For Peace that NATO half-heartedly offered. There  is, here, the beginning of a countervailing alliance which, if  the documents as duly signed have reality, will one day put  Russian troops on the borders of Iran, Turkey and Poland.  Meanwhile (the other hand) we're poised tomorrow for final  International Monetary Fund approval of a $1.5 billion loan deal  with Russia -- the breaking of the long log-jam to reform. This  loan -- tiny though it is -- could pave the way for the next  ($4.1 billion) tranche of the $28 billion announced long ago by  the Group of Seven -- but never authorised.    The Russian economy is still in an apocalyptic condition.  The monthly rate of inflation has fallen from 22 per cent in  January to 9 per cent in March as a result of the new-found  stringency of the central bank, but industrial output fell 24  per cent in the year to the first quarter of 1994 after a 21 per  cent contraction in 1992.    These figures may exaggerate the scale of decline. Some of  the lost output may have been worthless and the output of the  fledgling private sector may have been underestimated; but,  after all the excuses, it still leaves a huge hole at the centre  of the economy. The stoicism of the Russian people may be  legendary, but it is not inexhaustible. Economic erosion of  this order can't go on for much longer without extremely serious  social consequences.    Such statistics paint a bleak backdrop to this week's annual  meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  [EBRD] in St Petersburg. The EBRD, set up to help reconstruct  East Europe, has been busily reconstructing itself after the  financial excesses of Jacques Attali. Yet, even now, it has yet  to make a serious impact on the spiralling problems of Russia,  let alone the rest of East Europe.    That is a job which, ultimately, can only be done by Russia.  But the daunting task of economic stabilisation and market  reform can, and must, be assisted by the world's richer nations.  It is no use telling Russia that they will get Western billions  after they have reformed -- for the simple reason they need help  in order to put their house in order. A currency stabilisation  plan of the kind that gave Poland a kick-start could have  short-circuited the vicious devaluation-led spiral of inflation  which is still a constant threat to the economy. It remains to  be seen whether the new Russian parliament approves the austere  budget proposals. If it doesn't, it will clearly make it more  difficult for the IMF to speed up the aid programme. That said,  the Russian government which ditched the Gaydar reformists has  gone much further than anyone could have hoped at the time in  accepting the economic strait-jacket which the IMF, sadly,  expects supplicants to wear. If this opportunity is missed, the  consequences for Russia could be very serious indeed -- which is  precisely where the revival of some of the old Soviet military  reach enters the equation. There are some who already see  historic folly in the West's bolstering of a potential enemy.  And the first flexing of those arthritic muscles -- against the  poisonous background of a rampant Zhirinovskiy -- will  exacerbate such fears. Mixed signals, and motives. But there is  still a central equation. A Russia recovering economically will  be a Russia more at ease with itself and more bound into a world  whose Partnership For Peace needs to go further. The tracks  don't yet diverge.</p>

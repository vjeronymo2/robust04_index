First two paragraphs is LIAOWANG editor's  note.]    [Text] For many people, establishing and developing a  capital market may be a strange concept, but it must be known  and mastered under the conditions of the modern market economy.    In order to enable our readers to understand the operation  and development of this new thing. We invited Zhong Pengrong,  who is reputed by overseas scholars as one of the "four dragons"  among the contemporary mainland economists, to explain the  general information about the capital market, and explain its  functions, developmental conditions, and rules of operation.    [Dong Ruisheng] Recently, the term "capital market"  frequently appeared in the press, and many readers wrote letters  to ask: What is a capital market? What differences are there  between a capital market and a currency market? Could you  please give us some information on this?    [Zhong Pengrong] In simple words, a capital market is a  market for long-term loans or securities. For example, there is  the long-term loan market and the long-term bond market or stock  market as well. The latter two are called securities markets,  which constitute the main body of the capital market. The  currency market is one for short-term working funds, such as the  short-term loan market, the market for discounting commercial  bills, and the inner-trade credit market [tong ye chai jie shi  chang 0681 2814 2135 0234 1579 1034]. Normally, a short-term  financial arrangement is one of less than a year; and a  long-term arrangement lasts a year or more. The two types of  markets are first of all different in the mobility and  credibility of the tools of credit being issued and circulated.  In the currency market, there are various types of short-term  tools of credit, such as commerical bills and short-term  government bonds. At the same time, because of the short terms  of various types of financial arrangements, including short-term  loans, they do not undertake almost any interest-rate risks.  However, financial arrangments in the capital market will have  to undertake much greater interest-rate risks. In particular,  corporate shares will undergo more frequent price fluctuations.    Another major difference between the two markets lies in  their economic functions. The capital market mainly provides a  mechanism for enterprises to raise their own funds and prepare  long-term capital, and the funds raised through this market are  mainly invested in fixed assets, thus forming enterprise  capital. The currency market mainly helps enterprises adjust  working funds, and the funds raised through this market are  mainly used to make up for the short-term shortage of means of  payment.    [Dong] Being one of the markets for production factors, the  capital market has been gradually developed in practice,  although it was not explicitly mentioned in the past. As far as  You know, at present, at what stage of development is the  capital market in our country now?    [Zhong] The main body of the capital market is the  securities market. In my view, it should also include the  market for property rights transfers, because property rights in  a certain enterprise held in the form of shares and property  rights bought directly from that enterprise are not different in  essence. At present, the securities market in our country has  basically taken shape. According to statistics, since the  beginning of the pilot schemes for the adoption of the  joint-stock system, nearly 4,000 enterprises have issued shares  to raise funds in the process of reorganizing themselves  according to the joint-stock system. At present, more than 150  enterprises have their A shares listed on the stock exchanges in  Shenzhen and Shanghai, and their total market value has exceeded  350 billion yuan. There are more than 30 types of B shares  worth totally more than 10 billion Hong Kong dollars. The total  value of other securities also exceeds 100 billion yuan.  Transactions on enterprise property rights have spread from  Shenzhen to other parts of the country. Recently, China's first  property rights exchange was set up in Shenyang. Generally  speaking, however, development of the capital market still  cannot satisfy the needs of the economic structural reforms, and  still needs to be quickened.    [Dong] In our country, where the market economy is still not  developed enough, people have acquired more knowledge about the  functions of the commodity market through reforms over the past  15 years, and commodity markets of all types have spread  everywhere from cities to the countryside. This has given more  convenience to the people in their daily lives, and has promoted  economic development. However, in what way will the capital  market play a positive and significant role in our country's  economic structural reform and economic development? Would you  please tell us your own opinion on this question?    [Zhong] Generally, the development and improvement of the  capital market will be conducive to the highly efficient  utilization and reasonable movement of funds. In any specific  capital market, investors (referring to legal persons and  natural persons who possess idle funds) may decide the use of  their money according to their own wishes. The nature of  capital lies in proliferation, so the trade and enterprises  which yield higher returns will naturally become the targets  pursued by investors. In an economic society with fair  competition, trades yielding high returns are normally trades  whose development is urgently needed in socioeconomic life, and  whose products or services are in short supply; enterprises  yielding high returns are normally enteprises being properly  managed and achieving good economic efficiency. If funds flow  to such trades and enterprises, this signifies the reasonable  distribution and utilization of social funds, and signifies that  the limited funds are flowing through the market mechanism and  the auction mechanism to enterprises of high efficiency and not  the sort of enterprises which remain inefficient.    [Dong] The shortage of funds is a main factor that hinders  the development of developing countries. In our country, the  existing scarce financial resources could not be properly used  and distributed because of the drawbacks of the structure and  were even wasted seriously. In view of this situation, the  establishment and development of the capital market is of  especially great significance for the current economic  structural reform.    [Zhong] The significance mainly finds expression in the  following points:    --The establishment of the capital market is the negation of  the current funds distribution mechanism. At present, the  distribution of investment funds in our country is mainly  conducted in an egalitarian pattern of "cutting a cake." When  the "cake" is being cut, consideration is given not only to the  economic efficiency of various enterprises, but must also to  various social, political, and personnel factors. As a result,  enterprises achieving good economic results cannot obtain any  funds or sufficient funds. With the establishment of the  capital market, the distribution of funds will be regulated by  the market mechanism, and the method of auction will be used.  Thus, the distribution of funds will gradually be rationalized.    --The establishment of the capital market represents the  reform of the current investment system and is a fundamental  measure for preventing ill-planned [mang mu 4159 4158]  investment and reducing waste of investment funds. At present,  funds for capital investment and new projects mainly come from  bank loans, and banks are all run and owned by the state. This  means that investment risks are all undertaken by the state. At  the same time, as state banks bear investment risks, loan users  do not need to exercise self-control when making investments,  and they blindly start new projects in order to contend for a  greater amount of loans from banks. This eventually causes  serious losses. The basic purpose of establishing a capital  market is to create a situation in which enterprises will not  mainly rely on bank loans to achieve funds for their long-term  investment projects, but will raise such funds from the capital  market in the forms of bonds and stocks. When an investor buys  the bonds or stocks of an enterprise or a project, he or she  casts an affirmative vote for the project. The project can be  started only if it achieves sufficient affirmative votes. This  means the project will not be started until it passes the  feasibility tests of thousands of would-be investors. Thus, the  problem of blindly starting projects and causing losses to  investment funds, which has existed for several decades, will be  thoroughly resolved.    --The establishment of the capital market will bring about  profound changes to the enterprise system in our country. At  present, idle social funds are mainly concentrated in the hands  of state banks, and new enterprises are set up with loans  offered by them. This may just lead to the establishment of  state-owned enterprises. Enterprises founded with funds raised  through the capital market will no longer be state-owned  enterprises but joint- stock companies. Thus, such enterprises  will have more flexible operation mechanisms as soon as they are  founded.    --Establishment of a capital market will promote reform of  the banking system. Under the current banking system, banks are  "eating from the same big pot." With the establishment of  capital banks, the function of raising and distributing  long-term investment funds will be shifted from state banks to  the capital market. This will directly reduce the size of funds  in the "big pot" and will also promote commercialization of  funds. This is itself a major purpose of reform of the banking  system.    Another point should be made here. At present, in our  country, the basic system of raising and distributing funds is:  Individual residents (with idle funds)--state-owned  banks--investment-makers. If there is anything wrong with an  investment, the loan may not be retrieved. However, individual  residents' deposits must be guaranteed and retrievable. So the  state has to bear all the losses. In a perfect capital market,  construction funds are raised by people launching a construction  project directly from people who possess funds, and the  investment risks are undertaken jointly by all parties who offer  the funds. It should be stressed here that with the increasing  financial capacity of banks and the increasing size of  investments, if the current investment system is not thoroughly  changed, the state will have to a bear heavier and heavier  burden of investment risk.    [Dong] I believe what you say will enable our readers to  more deeply understand the role of the capital market. However,  in the current circumstances of our country, what should we do  in order to turn a theoretical concept into a reality and to  more quickly establish and perfect the capital market?    [Zhong] At the very least, we should make the following  efforts:    First, price controls should be lifted in order to really  establish the market-determined price mechanism. A major  characteristic of the capital market is that funds are no longer  distributed according to government plan; instead, funds flow  according to the profit principle toward economic sectors that  may yield better returns. If price controls are not lifted,  some economic sectors or trades (such as railways) will not be  able to absorb funds, although their products or services remain  in short supply; on the other hand, some economic sectors will  continue to be attractive to investment funds because of  attractive prices and the handsome profits they can make,  although their products or services are not in short supply. If  such situation continues for a long time, this will be extremely  unfavorable to the rationalization of the property rights  structure. In addition, the currently existing and still  widening gaps between localities are extremely unfavorable to  the reasonable distribution of funds. A major factor causing  such gaps is the serious distortion of prices of elementary  products and of manufactured and processed products. Under the  present situation, in a richer area with a better investment  environment, investment funds naturally yield better returns and  such an area is naturally more attractive to funds. On the  contrary, it is very difficult for a poor area to keep local  funds, and it is even more difficult to absorb external funds.  The widening gap between rich and poor areas is not the aim of  our reform and opening. Therefore, when establishing and  developing a capital market, we must adopt proper measures to  reduce the misleading effects of the differences between  localities on the movement of funds. While the local  governments should make efforts to increase their local economic  strength, the central government must also formulate  corresponding policies and measures to help localities improve  their investment environments and raise their capacity to  attracting funds.    Second, it is necessary to gradually perfect corresponding  laws and regulations and strengthen management. At present,  investors in our country do not have a keen sense of investment  risks, and their investment knowledge remains limited. So their  ability to make correct judgments is weak, and they are apt to  be cheated. Over a long time in the past, when enterprises  launched new projects, they had to submit plans to higher  authorities for examination and approval. In recent years, when  enterprises planned to adopt the joint-stock system and issue  shares, they still had to submit their plans to the government  departments in charge of examination and approval. So many  investors feel that an investment in an enterprises is in  essence an investment in the government. Therefore, laws and  regulations must be perfected in order to prevent that some  people practice fraud by taking advantage of investor ignorance.  On the other hand, through more effective propaganda, investors  should be helped to understand that the government is only  responsible for managing enterprises and does not bear  responsibility for financial losses incurred by investors so  that they will increase the sense of risk and become more alert  in making judgments.    Third, interest rate controls should be lifted so that the  movement of funds can be adjusted through market mechanisms.  This is an important condition for the formation of a capital  market, and is also a major characteristic of it. Only after  interest rate controls are lifted will trades and enterprises of  good economic efficiency be able to attract funds by offering  higher prices. In a developing nation, in a certain sense,  funds are scarcer than other resources. So more efficient and  more economical use of funds is of great significance for the  nation's economic development. The establishment and  improvement of the capital market has proven a successful way to  achieve this purpose.</p>

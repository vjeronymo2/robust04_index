			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Revived Militarist Ghost" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- In a recent  interpellation at Diet, Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said whether the past war was a war of aggression, or not, will  be known after the lapse of one hundred years.    Commenting on this NODONG SINMUN today says: The remarks of  Hata who had reprimanded the former justice minister, Nagano,  for describing the Pacific War as "a liberation war" shows his  double- dealing tactics.    The analyst continues:    The outcries of Japanese cabinet ministers distorting  history  show once again the aggressive quality of the Hata cabinet.    The Japanese militarists who regard the restoration of the  past policy of aggression as the strategy of the state set it as  an important objective to restore the old colonial empire in  Asia.    Having completed political, economic and military  preparations for overseas aggression through the efforts to turn  Japan into a military power and step up her nuclear armament,  enact an "emergency case law" and a "wartime mobilization law",  the Japanese ruling quarters are intensifying propaganda to  mobilize the people in a war. The key point here is to obscure  the character of the past war of aggression and whitewash and  justify it.    The Japanese authorities reveal their intention to repeat  the  history of aggression when they affirmatively assess the past  war of aggression and avoid the liquidation of the crimes of the  blood- stained past.    Japan schemes to realise its dominationist ambition  worldwide  with strength by securing the permanent membership of the U.N.  Security Council and accelerating her nuclear armament.    Japan must act with discretion, mindful that overseas  aggression and war will lead her to her grave.</p>

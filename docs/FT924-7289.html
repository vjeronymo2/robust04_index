			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuban nickel output well below target CUBA'S OUTPUT of nickel is expected to total just 35,000 tonnes this year, well short of an original target of 50,000 tonnes, because of production problems caused by the country's changed relationship with the former Soviet Union and the countries of eastern Europe. Spot sales of Cuban nickel will be halted immediately, but all contract sales will be fulfilled at the agreed time, according to Nickel Refining and Trading (Niref), the Rotterdam-based agent of Cubaniquel, the state-owned nickel producer. Niref said it was too early to predict the outlook for 1993 production. Cubaniquel has been hurt by the drying up of vitally-important supplies of capital goods, oil and raw materials such as ammonia and sulphur from the former Soviet Union and the rest of the former Soviet bloc. Most of Cuba's refineries were built by former allies in eastern European and the former Sovuet Union, which once accounted for 80 per cent of Cuban foreign trade. The radical change in economic and political relations since the collapse of communism in eastern Europe has made it difficult for Cuba to gain access to spare parts and other equipment needed to maintain its nickel output. 'Although support has been received from western countries and technical improvements have recently been commissioned for one of the three refineries, production problems could not avoid, however, that the production target of 50,000 tonnes of nickel content forecast by Cubaniquel in February will not be reached this year,' Niref said.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Kenya may seek fresh deal on debt MR MUSALIA MUDAVADI, Kenya's finance minister, warned yesterday that Kenya might have to reschedule part of its Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.7bn) external debt because of an accumulation of Dollars 700m in arrears resulting from the suspension of foreign aid. Mr Mudavadi raised the probability of debt renegotiations as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund announced their support for a three-year programme of economic reforms designed to mend Kenya's estranged relations with the international donor community. A policy framework paper, to be presented to donors, outlines Kenya's commitment to cutting the budget deficit, curbing inflation from its present 50 per cent a year, and rooting out corruption in the state sector. The IMF's endorsement of Kenya's new economic policies is critical for the success of a donors' conference in Paris this month which will discuss the renewal of financial aid. However, there were no immediate signs that the IMF was preparing to resume financial assistance to Kenya. It would be the first time Kenya has sought to refinance its foreign obligations with the Paris Club of creditor nations. Kenya took pride in its repayment record until donors, irked by corruption and economic mismanagement, suspended balance-of-payments aid in November 1991, worth about Dollars 40m a month. 'The arrears component of our foreign debt may require rescheduling,' Mr Mudavadi said in an interview. Kenya also faces a large balance of payments gap due to its trade deficit and heavy debt servicing obligations. With foreign exchange reserves of just Dollars 260m, private-sector economists believe Kenya is heading for a balance of payments crisis unless donor governments are prepared to resume a measure of financial support.</p>

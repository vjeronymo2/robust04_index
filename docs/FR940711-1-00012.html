			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In summary, as a result of the transition to a competitive wholesale power market, we must be concerned with three ways in which stranded costs are most likely to occur:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Scenario 1: A wholesale requirements customer ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a wholesale purchaser of bundled generation and transmission services) may obtain unbundled transmission services from its existing supplier in order to reach an alternative generation supplier. It may obtain wholesale transmission services either through a voluntary bilateral agreement or voluntary open-access tariff filed by a utility under FPA section 205, or by obtaining a Commission order under FPA section 211;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Scenario 2: A retail franchise customer (or a group of retail franchise customers) may, through State or local government action, become a wholesale customer who obtains from its existing supplier either voluntary unbundled wholesale transmission services under section 205 agreements or tariffs as described above, or obtains such services pursuant to a Commission order under section 211;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Scenario 3: A retail franchise customer may obtain unbundled retail transmission services from its existing supplier in order to reach a new generation supplier, either through voluntary unbundled retail transmission services or as a result of a State or local action requiring the existing supplier to provide such retail transmission services. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission takes no position in this proceeding regarding the legal issue of whether States have the authority to order retail wheeling in interstate commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Below we discuss the Commission's precedent for each of these scenarios, and how we propose to deal with such stranded costs in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

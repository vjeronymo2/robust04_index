			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Savings grace The sharp upward revision of the second-quarter savings rate in yesterday's UK GDP is good news for those worried about the economy's ability to withstand tax increases next year. Since the previous second-quarter estimate of 10.1 has been replaced with one of 11.7, the government's expectations that it will fall in 1994, which were factored into its budget forecasts, look more plausible. Moreover, the higher ratio has come about not because consumers were spending less than previously thought, but more because estimates of personal income have risen. Admittedly, the scale of the revisions, which have also seen a jump in the first-quarter savings ratio, mean it is risky to set too much store by its absolute level. The encouraging fall of the ratio to 10.6 per cent in the third quarter may prove illusory if that figure too is revised in due course. But the ratio does now have room to fall by the 1.5 percentage points or so needed to offset next year's tax increases without hitting levels unprecedented even in the low inflationary 1960s. Higher employment levels, at least in the service sector, may help boost personal incomes next year. That in turn could boost consumer confidence, even though job worries are still a dampener at present. There are also incipient signs that lower interest rates are encouraging consumers to borrow more on credit cards. If that continues, fiscal tightening may not be too painful after all.</p>

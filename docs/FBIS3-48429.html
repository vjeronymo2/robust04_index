In attendence were Comrade Pham The Duyet, member of the  Political Bureau and secretary of the Hanoi Municipal Party  Committee; Comrade Cao Sy Kiem, member of the party Central  Committee and governor of the Vietnam State Bank; and  representatives of over 30 banks now operating in Hanoi.    By using various means of mobilizing capital in 1993, the  banks in Hanoi acquired a total capital which was 39.7 percent  of the country's total. The total amount of money they had lent  out as of the end of 1993 amounted to 13,878 billion dong,  accounting for 58.3 percent of the country's total loans and  representing a 10-fold increase over those in 1991 and 1992.  Banks in Hanoi have expanded their credit operations in various  economic components. In particular, their medium- and long-term  loans offered to various business firms to carry out technical  innovation during 1993 increased 13 fold over 1992. The cash  shortage situation is over. Formerly, it took eight days to  resolve a banking transaction, but now it takes only one day.  Banks have made active contributions to the economic growth of  Hanoi.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts slide as Lamont fails to provide much support UK GOVERNMENT bonds closed as much as a quarter point lower on the day, as the Chancellor's Autumn Statement and base rate cut failed to provide much support for the gilt market. The one percentage point cut in the base rate, from 8 per cent to 7 per cent, which comes into effect today, had already been priced into the short end of the market, dealers said, and left short-dated issues little changed on the day. Earlier this week, the market had hoped for an interest rate cut of 1.5 to 2 percentage points in conjunction with the statement. Dealers said yesterday's smaller-than-expected cut was welcomed by the long end of the market, given the view that the government might have problems keeping inflation down with a two-point cut. Overall, long-dated issues ended the day lower, as the post-Statement rally was insufficient to overcome the earlier weakness in the gilt market. Mr Lamont's comments on the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) received mixed reviews. The Chancellor's forecast of a Pounds 37bn PSBR for 1992-1993 came as little surprise, as analysts calculate that the government need only raise a further Pounds 4bn in the gilt market in the remainder of the financial year. However, the forecast PSBR of Pounds 44bn for 1993-1994 came as a shock to the market as it implies gilt issuance of around Pounds 50bn for the year. THE Bank of France cut its key interest rates yesterday morning by a quarter point, prompting a rally in the French government bond market. Mr Michel Sapin, economics minister, said the latest cuts reflected the strength of the franc. The Bank of France cut the intervention rate from 9.35 per cent to 9.1 per cent and its five-to-10 day securities repurchase rate from 10.25 per cent to 10 per cent. The central bank last cut the key rates - also by a quarter point - on November 2. The December bond future on the Matif exchange traded in a range of 110.86 to 111.20, but profit-taking wiped out some of the gains and the market ended slightly higher on the day. THE GERMAN government bond market ended little changed as any positive impact of the French cut in interest rates was cancelled out by statements from the Bundesbank denying the need for lower German rates, dealers said. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 91.48 and traded at around 91.47 by late afternoon. Dealers noted stronger interest in the two to three-year area, while the long end closed slightly weaker. Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank board member, told German radio that the Bundesbank saw no need for a cut in key interest rates. The Bundesbank's Lombard lending rate is currently 9.50 per cent and the discount rate is 8.25 per cent. US TREASURY prices firmed along the length of the yield curve yesterday afternoon following a successful 30-year bond auction. In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond jumped  13/16 to 95 29/32 , yielding 7.592 per cent, while the two-year note was up 5/32 for a yield of 4.400 per cent. The long bond recovered after easing slightly in morning trading on news of an unanticipated decline in jobless claims by 5,000 to 355,000 for the last week of October. JAPANESE government bonds continued to rally, taking their cue from the stock market fall and speculation that the Bank of Japan will be forced to ease interest rates. The March futures contract rose from 107.58 at the opening to a high of 107.70, as the Nikkei index fell sharply. However, as the stock market recovered its losses later in the day to close higher, the bond market fell on profit-taking. The yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB moved from 4.62 per cent at the opening to 4.615 per cent but ended the day at 4.635 per cent.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (7): The odd one out mounts a strong challenge - The fortunes of Apple Apple, almost always the odd one out in personal computers, is mounting a strong challenge in both notebooks and personal organisers with idiosyncratic products. Somehow, it has made a virtue out of being non-standard, where many other computer firms have run into a wave of criticism for it. Alone among leading PC makers, Apple adopted Motorola rather than Intel chips and on them built a strong brand loyalty to its machines. Mr Chris Herbert, senior research analyst at PC market monitoring firm Romtec, says: 'Apple has extremely strong support among its users.' It retains a 10 per cent share of the total UK market for PC, which is still rapidly growing, and has taken third place in the UK notebook market behind Toshiba with around 45 per cent and Compaq with 22 per cent. But Compaq and Toshiba increased their joint share in 1993 to 67 per cent from around 55 per cent the previous year, with Toshiba's sales almost doubling. Competition will be equally severe in most other countries. Apple is struggling to win acceptance in the corporate market, where Compaq is often the official alternative hardware supplier to IBM. Apple's supporters claim that, if it were left to users, a large proportion would choose Apple, but many companies have a purchasing policy which will not let them do so. Two shrewd decisions by Apple in the past couple of years have helped it to stay among the leaders. The first was the diversification of its previously too rigid sales channels. Instead of marketing entirely through dealers, it appointed Frontline and Ingram as master distributors and started selling through high street shops such as Dixons and John Lewis. Secondly, it tore up its recommended retail prices, going further than some of its competitors in declining even to suggest prices. This was generally welcomed by its resellers. Price-cutting followed, which enabled Apple to regain some lost market share. Its Macintosh PowerBook notebooks, introduced in 1991, had sold over 1m in the UK by the end of last year. Although they have had very good reviews, the company has not had quite the same success with them as it had with its desktop machines. Its market share of notebooks in the UK is around 7 per cent, whereas in the desktop market it has 11-12 per cent. The PowerBook runs on a Motorola 68030 chip and copies the intuitive, what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) software environment of the desktop Macintosh, rather than using industry standard Microsoft DOS and Windows. Its built-in trackball in the centre of the keyboard instead of a mouse is said to be easier to handle for the mobile user. Compaq also has such a device on some models, but few others do. PowerBooks have been praised for the clarity of their active-matrix screens in varying light conditions and for giving clear advance warnings of battery rundown. Tests have shown that Intel 486 machines have greater power than PowerBooks when running standard applications software such as spreadsheets, but few users seem to find this an issue. The Duo docking system allows a PowerBook loaded with the latest versions of files to be released from the desktop machine after the parent files have been closed. Mr Tim Clark, marketing director of KRCS, Apple's largest UK reseller, says this allows users to take work home in the evening without the risk of confusion over file versions. File confusion has been a problem for users of some other systems. Apple generated heavy publicity for its Newton 'messagepad', or personal digital assistant, launched in the UK in September. Reviews and comments have been mixed for the pen-based machines, which combine the functions of personal organiser, information source and games player. Applications software from other developers for the Newton remains scarce. Only 12 programs have been offered so far. Opinion is divided over how well it can recognise handwriting. Even the occasional word misinterpreted can lose it credibility among perfectionists. The sector is very price-sensitive. Sales are likely to come mainly through high street stores, where plenty of other makes will be on offer. According to Mr Craig Sears-Black, Apple's director of personal interactive electronics, 50,000 Newtons were sold in the first six weeks up to mid-September in the US and UK. However, UK resellers say that at the original price of about Pounds 600 they did not sell well, though recently on special offer at about Pounds 400 sales have begun to pick up. Mr Clark of KRCS says there is still a lot to be done to explain to users the communications facilities. These are still far from complete and will be essential for Apple to persuade big companies to use Newton as a data collection tool which can save time and money spent in rekeying.</p>

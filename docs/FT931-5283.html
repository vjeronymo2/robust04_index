			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rate cut hopes return to boost shares THE LONDON stock market had no hesitation in assessing the implications of the Bundesbank's move to reduce repurchase rates yesterday; 'this points the way to a rate cut in the UK', was the view expressed by London market strategists. The stock market took the hint and closed last night at a new all-time high of 2,922.1 on the FT-SE Index. Caught out by the timing of the move in Germany, UK shares rose sharply following the news to touch a new trading high of 2,925 on the Footsie scale. This initial gain was then swiftly eroded as a Pounds 200m plus trading programme switched attention to the non-Footsie stocks and traders in the blue chips shied away ahead of the announcement of economic data from on the US. But a favourable response on Wall Street to strong US employment figures put 12 points on the Dow in early trading and helped set London back on the upward track. At the close, the FT-SE Index showed a net gain of 17.3 points. The buy programme in non-Footsie stocks revealed itself when Seaq volume jumped nearly threefold at mid-morning. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index had another strong session, gaining 20 points to a new peak of 3,107.9. Trading in non-Footsie stocks jumped to around 68 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 860.1m shares. The total included nearly 200m shares involved in two specific deals in investment group Rutland Trust. On Thursday, non-Footsie business made up about 57 per cent of Seaq volume of 660.3m shares, which was worth Pounds 1.43bn at retail level. London investors are now focusing on Budget week in the UK. Budget day, on Tuesday March 16, will be followed two days later by the meeting of the Bundesbank policy council and then, on the Friday by the latest UK Retail Price Index. Strategists see this as a likely timetable for a cut of at least half a point in UK base rates. Yesterday's move by the Bundesbank was seen as a clear step towards a cut of perhaps half a point in the Lombard rate, and perhaps of a  1/4 in the discount rate, shortly. The FT-SE Index has risen by nearly 2 per cent this week and is expected to extend its gain into the second week of the equity account. Buyers were out in force yesterday in the interest-related sectors. The shock delivered on Thursday by Barclays Bank's dividend cut still kept enthusiasm in check, however. Long-dated government bonds gained around three quarters of a point as yields fell back to reflect the likelihood of another move towards lower interest rates in the UK.</p>

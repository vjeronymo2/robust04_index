There is an example that demonstrates what  happens if one does not take words seriously -- Hitler!"    Wolfgang Schaeuble, head of the Bundestag group of the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, stated: "It  would be terrible if we had to take him seriously. Yet it would  also be terrible is a man in his position were not taken  seriously."    The director of the ZDF television station, Dieter Stolte,  thinks that "it is his irrationality that is so dangerous. His  spontaneous, emotional, and sometimes aggressive statements are  a cause for extreme concern in Europe and the world."    Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of  Germany) stated: "The behavior of this man is absolutely  inappropriate and unacceptable! Denying him a visa was a  difficult decision, but it was justified. He wanted to start a  propaganda tour here. We could not accept that."    Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in  Germany, pointed out: "I believe Zhirinovskiy is a man  controlled by the KGB; four years ago, he wanted to found the  Jewish community as an agent under orders to the KGB!  Fortunately we quickly discovered that."    Cardinal Georg Sterzinsky stated: "I think he is more  dangerous than people generally believe him to be. I was in  Russia in November, where I heard the name for the first time --  from people who stressed that the strongest should get the  votes. He is a populist, a demagogue, and he is attractive for  politically naive people who want a strong hand."    Annemarie Renger (Social Democratic Party of Germany)  believes that "the man is very dangerous. He is trying to find  fascist alliance partners in Europe."</p>

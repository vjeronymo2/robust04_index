			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sedgwick subsidiary launches Lloyd's fund CLM Advisers, a subsidiary of Sedgwick Group, the insurance broker, yesterday announced the formal launch of its CLM Insurance Fund, an incorporated Name at the Lloyd's insurance market. The launch comes ahead of the expected announcement on Monday of new Lloyd's rules outlining the accounting, regulatory and legal treatment of corporate investors. Other investment and merchant banks have also announced their intention to launch similar vehicles but the sponsors of the CLM fund, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, are the first to issue an information memorandum. Mr Michael Wade, chief executive of CLM Advisers, said he expected 'considerable interest from both private and institutional investors' in the fund which will be managed so as to qualify as an investment trust for UK tax purposes. It is understood that BZW will seek to raise more than Pounds 100m when it floats the fund later this year. A prospectus inviting investors to subscribe to the fund will be published during October so that the fund can participate in Lloyd's for the 1994 year of account. The fund's board will be chaired by Lord Rees, a former chief secretary to the treasury. Like existing individual Names, new corporate Names will be able to 'use their capital twice'. Capital used to support insurance activities will also be invested in other assets. The CLM fund will participate in a range of Lloyd's syndicates, via six subsidiary incorporated names, investing mainly in a portfolio of UK equities. Investment managers BZW Investment will aim to track the FT-A All Share index.</p>

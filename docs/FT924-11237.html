			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Ending the fragmentation  -Charles Batchelor and Lisa Wood examine British plans to establish a business support network British politicians and businesses have often cast envious eyes at the way the continental Europeans organise business support - through generously funded chambers of commerce with which businesses are obliged to register. Starting in April, if the plans of Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, are realised, Britain will start to put in place a business support network which will be at least the equal of its continental partners. It would also end the fragmentation of business support initiatives which have confused and irritated small firms in the past. What the department of trade and industry (DTI) proposes is a national network of about 200 business centres which would provide a combination of advice from experienced business counsellors and a referral service with more specialised help if this is needed. Lead role in establishing the new network will go to the 82 English and Welsh Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs), but they will be expected to call on the expertise of their local chamber of commerce, enterprise agency and, in rural areas, business support organisations such as the Rural Development Commission. The centres have been provisionally labelled 'one-stop shops' but the DTI is keen to remove the impression of a low-grade, drop-in service on every high street. One name which has been considered for the new centres is 'Business Point,' followed by the name of the town in which they are based. They are more likely to be set up on business parks or in the offices of existing business support organisations. 'We are not tinkering about at the edges,' commented one person closely involved in the project. 'This is not a case of getting the existing services to work better but of achieving a step-change in performance. Business people don't have the time or the inclination to be shuffled around at the inclination of bureaucrats. A simple sign-posting service is not on.' The key staff in the centres will be the 'personal business advisers', people with a background in either the commercial sector or public sector business agencies, who will help businessmen and women diagnose their problems. If necessary they will refer their clients to specialist consultancy help, to business databases and to sources of public or private funding. The business advisers will be trained to a uniformly high standard and the centres will be expected to obtain accreditation to the BS5750 quality assurance standard. The target market will be established small and medium sized businesses with growth prospects rather than the new start-up. The one-stop shop proposals are still under discussion in a steering group which includes Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, and representatives of the TECs, the chambers, local authorities and Business in the Community - so their final form is still undecided. But the DTI plans to publish a prospectus by the end of November and wants bids in from the TEC-led business groups by January. Between 10 and 15 of the new business centres are expected to be operating from April 1 and the national network is planned to be completed within about two years. This is an ambitious timetable. The DTI says there is a wave of enthusiasm for the idea but implementation will affect many members of the existing business support network. The chambers of commerce, in particular, are giving them a somewhat nervous welcome. 'If a small business can go along to a one stop shop for help why should it then join a chamber?' asks Ronnie Jacobson, public affairs and marketing manager at the London Chamber of Commerce. 'This puts us in a very odd position of helping to put ourselves out of business. Why wasn't funding put into the chambers to let them provide a better range of services?' Graham Ashmore, a director of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, is concerned that the one-stop shop programme cuts across the chambers' own Effective Business Support programme to create a core network of 50 chambers meeting a common quality standard. Even the TECs, which will lead the local partnerships, have their worries. Many have already begun working closely with their local chamber of commerce, enterprise agency and other business organisations and they are keen that the one-stop shop programme should be seen as emerging naturally from these activities rather than as a revolutionary new idea imposed from on high. Birmingham formally launched its own First Step Shop earlier this month in an initiative involving the TEC, chamber, city council and the DTI. 'We were working on this long before the government announced its plans,' says Christine Parker, the manager. Not that the DTI programme is the first time that anyone has thought of one-stop shops. The present government launched a pilot network of six 'business shops' to provide start-up advice and help with tax and social security problems in 1989. In 1990 the Labour party outlined plans for a 'one-stop business service'. Crucial to the success of the new venture is funding. The TECs already face pressure on their budgets and additional demands will be made by the one-stop shop network. The DTI says it is unable to provide a detailed costing of the new centres, although it estimates the start-up costs over the first two years of each of the pilots could be Pounds 500,000, of which Pounds 300,000 might need to come from the government. Some of the running costs may be met by the local authorities and from EC funds, while the centres will also charge for services where appropriate. But it is likely that the TECs will also be expected to commit a substantial part of their budgets to running the one-stop shops. This could be as much as half of the TEC's Pounds 80m annual enterprise budget, according to some estimates. Even if this money can be prised from already stretched budgets, is there strong demand for a new network of advice centres? The DTI view is that small business owners are frequently too busy solving immediate problems - particularly in the middle of a recession - to realise their own long-term needs. Others disagree. Some specialists believe that small businesses would rather be relieved of the burdens placed on them by government - red tape, tax administration - than have these forms of assistance. Stan Mendham, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, queries whether small business needs what he sees as yet another level of business support on top the existing organisations. 'When will the government learn to use what is there?' he asks. There is certainly a case for asking why the government should now be seeking to create a uniform, national network of business support so soon after abolishing another centrally organised and nationally known agency, the Small Firms Service. This was taken over by the TECs, each of which adopted a new label for the service and a new method of working. The DTI acknowledges that it is being prescriptive in setting a general framework for the new network but says that local business organisations will determine the detail. It believes that the new network will provide a quality of business support equal to or better than that available from the continental chambers of commerce - without adopting the continental model of compulsory registration for all businesses. A network which avoided compulsion, deeply repugnant to government and most business organisations, could create a new, much needed British model of small business support.</p>

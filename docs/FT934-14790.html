			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Kohl urges EC to resist protectionism GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl told the French Senate yesterday that Europeans should 'resist the temptation of protectionism', in a speech clearly designed to influence France's position in world trade talks. His call won swift praise from Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, who was holding negotiations with the EC in Brussels on the Uruguay Round. Mr Kantor said he was pleased Mr Kohl was 'seized with the importance of restoring growth in Europe' and emphasised that 'increased competition rather than building a wall around the EC is an absolute necessity'. Mr Kantor was firm on French demands that the US-EC Blair House agreement on cutting Europe's subsidised farm exports be amended: 'We are not going to reopen or renegotiate the Blair House agreement,' he said. Meanwhile in Paris, in a speech to the National Assembly, prime minister Edouard Balladur yesterday gave little sign of conceding on the substance of France's demands in the Gatt talks. Calling for government and opposition parties to unite to defend 'our country's national interests', he cited unfulfilled demands on steel, aerospace, transport and market access, and warned that France would not allow itself to be 'forced to take one extra hectare of land out of production' when countries such as the US were putting set-aside land back into production. Mr Balladur said France would settle for a Gatt accord in the form of 'a progress report' by the December 15 negotiating deadline 'if certain partners were to propose this'. He thus appeared to back away from the campaign that his ministers have been waging for an 'interim Gatt' deal this year, leaving the contentious issues of agriculture and broadcasting for later. On audio-visual services, the EC and US appeared to make progress towards a compromise in the Brussels talks. It now appears the EC is proposing the sector should remain in the Uruguay Round, but with the focus on abolition of EC quota restrictions on imported films and television programmes. This would allow European governments to continue subsidising their entertainment industries. Stressing the need for freer trade, particularly with east Europe, Mr Kohl said 'West Europeans would be committing a fatal error if they thought that in removing competition by closing their markets they could benefit in any way whatsoever'. Using his Senate speech to try to give new impetus to the battered French-German alliance as well as to the EC, Mr Kohl said it was inevitable that the Bonn-Paris axis was sometimes prone to 'disillusions and doubts'. But the two countries shared a common fate and must form 'the heart of the European Union', created by the Maastricht treaty. After Tuesday's German court approval of Maastricht - which gives the French government the green light to put the Bank of France's independent status into effect - Mr Kohl called for strict observance of the treaty's 'timetable and conditions to ensure monetary stability'.</p>

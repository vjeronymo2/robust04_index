The appeal noted that Comrade Kim Chong-il is an illustrious  leader who enjoys boundless respect and reverence not only of  the Korean people but also of the revolutionary people of the  world for the immortal exploits and contributions he made for  the times and mankind.    The boundless reverence for Comrade Kim Chong-il can be seen  in the fact that many units and objects of different countries  were named after his august name.    In recent years alone, streets, libraries, classes at  schools  of different levels and other objects and units in India,  Pakistan, Mongolia, Lebanon, Palestine, Madagascar, Zambia,  Uganda, Peru, Ecuador, Guyana and other countries have been  given his name.    Functions for naming them after Comrade Kim Chong-il were  held grandly in those countries.    Members of the State Council of Guyana including the  minister  of health took part in the function for naming the Guaber Street  in Corriverton City Kim Chong-il Street.    The minister of health at the naming ceremony said to have a  street named after Comrade Kim Chong-il in Corriverton City was  a highest honor for the Guyanese Government and people.    There is the "Dear Leader Kim Chong-il Library" at the Asian  Regional Institute of the Chuche Idea in New Delhi, India.    The library is crowded everyday with Indian people of all  strata who come to learn from the dear leader.    The Ali Ali School in Karachi, Pakistan, the Onike Primary  School of Nigeria, the Kuds School of Palestine and many other  schools have classes called by the august name of Comrade Kim  Chong-il.    The boundless feelings of reverence for the dear leader are  associated with "Kimchongilia", an immortal flower.    "Kimchongilia" is a rare flower which was bred by Mototeru  Kamo, a famous botanist of Japan, through his hard work for more  than 20 years.    The flower named after the illustrious leader is now in full  bloom in more than 50 countries.    Some time ago, the Mozambican president, praising the  immortal flower "Kimchongilia", said the fact that a Japanese  botanist bred and presented this flower to dear Comrade Kim  Chong-il well shows how deep the respect and reverence of the  world people for him is.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 12/04/1994 -- The leaders of  the Liberal Party '93 (PL '93) have made their intention known  to the press by issuing an "Appeal to All Romanians for  Conciliation and Concord," which also runs as an "invitation"  extended to the former sovereign of Romania, Mihai I. The  appeal is signed by 84 members of parliament representing PL  '93, the Peasant Party (PNTCD), the Civic Alliance Party (PAC),  the Hungarians' Union (UDMR), the Social Democrats (PSDR), the  Democrats (PD-FSN), and two independent parliamentarians. It  shows that on the religious holiday of Easter (Orthodox, 1 May)  "King Mihai of Romania must be together with all Romanians, in  the ancestral land, as a citizen of this country, observant of  its constitutional order."    The former sovereign expressed his wish to celebrate Easter  in Romania, at Timisoara.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour MPs to face donation rise LABOUR MPs are to be asked to raise their personal contributions to the party from 1 per cent of their annual Pounds 30,000 salaries to 2 per cent - a Pounds 300 earnings cut. The proposal came yesterday at the national executive committee, where party leaders failed to conclude talks on a package aimed at slashing spending by about Pounds 4m a year. Some savings were agreed when the NEC accepted a plan to put most annual conferences on a biennial basis to save administration costs. An exemption was granted to the local government conference. But there was no resolution in the dispute over the plan to cut the party's regional offices from 11 to six.</p>

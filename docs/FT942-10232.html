			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (5): Bank at head of the pack - Santander Banco Santander's acquisition of Banesto at the end of last month has changed the land - scape of Spanish banking. In the past, most of the estate belonged to four, roughly equal, landowners. After San- tander's Dollars 2.05bn purchase, there is one very sizeable domain and a trio of compar- atively smaller holdings. Before the auction, Santander was the most international and most profitable of the big Spanish banks. It had more funds under management than its rivals. But Argentaria, the state-controlled bank, had a bigger loan portfolio, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) had more assets and Banco Central Hispano Americano had more bank branches. With Banesto under its belt, Santander outstrips the rest across the board of financial services to become the unquestioned leader of domestic banking. The assets of the combined banking group, according to San- tander's calculations, rank number 22 in Europe and 45 in the world. The second consequence of the Banesto saga - its inter- vention by the authorities, its rescue and its subsequent sale - is the fillip it has provided to the whole domestic banking sector. In the space of four months, and at a cost of some Dollars 3.7bn, the sector has cleaned up the mess caused by the collapse of one its largest and most traditional members. The Bank of Spain, which stage-managed the auction through the Deposit Guarantee Fund, and the private banks which provided a high proportion of the funds required to cover Banesto's losses, proved themselves well up to the task of coping with the crisis. The reputation and solidity of Spain's financial system emerge enhanced as a result. In the aftermath of the auction, a third lesson is taking shape. This is linked to Santander's extraordinarily strong bid - well over what others had valued Banesto - to gain what Mr Emilio Botin, the bank's chairman, called 'a unique opportunity'. The oddest feature of Santander's determination to obtain Banesto is that Mr Botin's strategy had in past years focused on building up the bank's network in Latin America and by further boosting its international business through equity holdings in First Fidelity of the US and the Royal Bank of Scotland. In contrast, Santander had sold three banking subsidiaries in Spain, two of them to Credit Lyonnais. Spain, and specifically retail banking on the home front, appeared to come low on Mr Botin's list of priorities. In past years he had also allocated resources and time to developing the merchant banking activities of the group through Banco Santander de Negocios, the unit run by his daughter, Ms Ana Patricia Botin, which has now been renamed Santander Investment. Now Santander's chairman seems to have turned this strategy on its head by acquiring Banesto, a bank that is emphatically Spanish and has historically been involved in the country's major industries, and whose main asset is an extensive branch network that reaches deep into the rural nooks and crannies of la Espana profunda. The lesson therefore has to do with what Mr Botin, whose family name is a by-word in Spain for conservatism and banking professionalism, feels about the future of the domestic economy. A working assumption is that Mr Botin is betting on domestic growth and that he is certain that there are a lot of pesetas to be made in Spain's small towns and pueblos.</p>

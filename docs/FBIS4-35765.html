			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul, followed by </F> remarks in answer to questions by unidentified correspondents,  at the Presidential Palace in B'abda on 2 June--recorded]    [Text] Following the sinful Israeli assault against Lebanon  at dawn today, the Higher Defense Council [HDC] held a meeting  under the chairmanship of his excellency the president in the  presence of his excellency the prime minister and the other  ministers who are members of the HDC.    Army Commander General Lahhud briefed the HDC on the details  of the Israeli assault. He said that the Army, immediately  after monitoring the hostile planes, informed all the concerned  departments and confronted the enemy with all available weapons  in all operational areas.    After discussing the issue, the HDC expressed satisfaction  with the Army's prompt response.    His excellency the foreign minister was again instructed to  lodge a complaint with the UN Security Council and ask it to  hold a session to discuss this barbaric assault.    The HDC instructed his excellency the health minister to let  the hospitals admit and give treatment to all people injured in  the attack at the Health Ministry's expense.    Lebanon emphasizes its legitimate right to resist the  occupation and confront its assaults with all available means.  It asserts that these Israeli assaults and pressure, regardless  of how intense they become, will not make it submit or back down  from its firm patriotic stance.    [Correspondent] Minister, we notice that Israel has recently  escalated its assaults in more than one area in the south. Do  you expect the situation to escalate further and expand?    [Dallul] We expect Israel to perpetrate every possible  abomination with the aim of undermining domestic conditions in  Lebanon. After it failed to achieve anything via its agents, it  personally intervened in Lebanese affairs to confuse matters and  drive a wedge between Lebanon and those who confront the Israeli  occupation. We wish to stress that this Israeli policy, no  matter how assiduously pursued, will not make us submit or  cooperate with Israel. We are cooperating with our people to  end the occupation. We back those who confront Israel because  the people of any occupied country have the right to resist the  occupation with all available means.    [Correspondent] Minister, one can see that the lack of  international sympathy with Lebanon's complaint about the  Israeli act of piracy [abduction of Believers Resistance  official Mustafa al-Dirani] gave a green light to Israel to  carry out the current major assault. What does Lebanon plan to  do in connection with the complaint?    [Dallul] We will ask the international community to bear its  full responsibility. Either there will be an international  community response to countries' needs to protect their  citizens, sovereignty, and independence or the international  community will become a stooge for Israeli objectives and the  objectives of those who back Israel. We will lodge a new  complaint so that the international community, particularly the  UN Security Council, will shoulder its responsibility regarding  the Israeli assaults.    [Correspondent] Minister, the press corps doyen cited the  president as saying today that Lebanon is no longer surprised  [words indistinct] if Beirut is attacked using the usual Israeli  pretexts. What are the limits of the Israeli aggression at this  stage?    [Dallul] It is not important to predict whether Israeli  attacks will occur or not. Israel is a state founded on  aggression. The Israeli entity is based on aggression.  Accordingly, Israel will carry out attacks. It is, therefore,  important for us to maintain our solidarity and accord to  prevent Israel from achieving its objectives or goals through  such attacks.    [Correspondent] Will Lebanon adopt an official stand on the  issue of the Arab-Israeli negotiations if the Israeli attacks  continue?    [Dallul] This depends on the Council of Ministers and the  Chamber of Deputies. We joined the negotiations after a  decision by the Chamber of Deputies. However, I believe that if  Israel continues its attacks we will hear voices calling for  withdrawal from these negotiations because they will be  impotent. We will not accept negotiations used as pretexts to  strike at our people, sons, and areas. You will be surprised to  learn that young girls were victims of the Israeli attack early  today. Children of 12 or 13 years old were killed.    [Correspondent] Do you believe that [words indistinct]?    [Dallul] Nobody will forget anything. Every Israeli act of  piracy will be remembered. These are acts demonstrating  Israel's barbarism and bestiality. The Lebanese people are  victims of such Israeli acts. Israel, which speaks about  Hitlerism and Nazism, is itself carrying out this method, a  method not even used by the Nazi regime with such barbarism and  bestiality.    [Correspondent] In your opinion, do you believe that the  cabinet's meeting on Tuesday [7 June] will adopt a decision  concerning the negotiations?    [Dallul] This, as I said, all depends on the Council  Ministers and the Chamber of Deputies. We have allies in the  negotiations. Together we joined the negotiations. We will not  adopt unilateral decisions. But every one of us wonders about  the usefulness of such negotiations when Israel is bombing us  and destroying the sources of livelihood of our people.    [Correspondent] Minister, [words indistinct] to avoid  extensive fighting in the south as happened in the past?    [Dallul] We do not interfere in the actions of our sons, who  are confronting the Israeli occupation. We often said that as  long as Israel continues to occupy our land, it is the right of  everyone to resist and liberate this land with all available  means. When the land is liberated, there will be no weapons  except those that belong to the legitimate authority [words  indistinct]. But at present Israel is bombarding us deep inside  our country. Therefore, I believe we are not the police to  defend the occupation forces. Defending the occupation troops is  treason. We are a state which cooperates with its people and  citizens. Our state is responsible for the sovereignty and  independence of the homeland.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct].    [Dallul] Our coordination with Syria is continuing, whether  there are attacks or not. We coordinate with fraternal Syria on  all issues and in all fields. We have a common fate. Together  we joined the negotiations and we will continue together. This  is because we do not bite the hand that helps us. We will  continue to coordinate efforts with the states that entered the  negotiations with us, foremost among them being fraternal Syria.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Indebtedness owned by beneficial owner who becomes a 5-percent shareholder or 5-percent entity. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the beneficial owner of indebtedness immediately before the ownership change is a 5-percent shareholder or 5-percent entity immediately after the ownership change, the general rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply to determine whether the indebtedness has been owned for the requisite period by the beneficial owner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The following example illustrates paragraph (d)(3) of this section.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (A)(1) L is a loss corporation in a title 11 case. The plan of reorganization of L approved by the bankruptcy court provides for the satisfaction of claims by the issuance of new L common stock to its creditors as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> A_2 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B_7.5 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C_2.5 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> P1_3 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> P2_10 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> P3_4.9 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> P4_4.9 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> P5_4.9 percent  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (2) P2 is owned by Public P2. B owns 10 percent of the stock of P1 and L has no actual knowledge of this ownership. L has actual knowledge that D owns P3, P4 and P5. In addition, L has actual knowledge, immediately after the ownership change, that C owns an option to acquire newly-issued stock of L that, if exercised, would increase C's percentage ownership of L stock from 2.5 percent to 8 percent. An ownership change of L occurs on the date the plan becomes effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, L may treat the indebtedness owned by A and P1 immediately before the ownership change as always having been owned by A and P1. Neither A nor P1 is a 5-percent shareholder immediately after the ownership change. Further, because P1 owns less than 5 percent of the L stock (and L has no actual knowledge of B's ownership interest in P1), P1 is treated as an individual, and the L stock owned by P1 is not attributed to any other person, including B. See &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(h)(2)(iii). Therefore, P1 is not a 5-percent entity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to the indebtedness owned by B, C, P2, P3, P4, or P5. B is a 5-percent shareholder immediately after the ownership change. L has actual knowledge immediately after the ownership change that the exercise of C's option would cause C to be a 5-percent shareholder immediately after the ownership change. (L does not take into account the effect of the exercise of the option, however, in determining the percentage stock ownership of any person other than C because the deemed exercise would not cause any other person to be a 5-percent shareholder or a 5-percent entity after the ownership change.) P2 is a 5-percent entity, because Public P2, a 5-percent shareholder, owns an indirect ownership interest in L through P2. P3, P4, and P5 are 5-percent entities because D, a 5-percent shareholder, owns an indirect ownership interest in L through P3, P4, and P5. Because L has actual knowledge that D would be a 5-percent shareholder but for the application of &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(h)(2)(iii), that section does not apply to P3, P4, or P5. See &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(k)(2). Thus, under &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(h)(2)(i), the L stock owned by P3, P4, and P5 is attributed to D, and D is a 5-percent shareholder. Because paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to the indebtedness owned by B, C, P2, P3, P4, and P5, L may treat as qualified indebtedness only indebtedness that it determines had been owned by such persons for the requisite period. See paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Special rule if indebtedness is a large portion of creditor's assets <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and  foreign minister, has sent a letter to UN Security Council  Chairman Colin Keating expressing concern over artillery attacks  on Zupanja and the Zupanja Posavina area. Granic warns that the  attack came after the adoption of the resolution extending the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mandate and granting it greater  authority, and after the recent cease-fire agreement signed  between representatives of the Croatian authorities and Serb  rebels from the occupied areas under UN protection.    Citing media reports and statements by senior UNHCR [UN High  Commissioner for Refugees] and ICRC [International Committee of  the Red Cross] officials on crimes committed against Muslims and  Croats in the Prijedor region over the past few days, and on the  inability of international humanitarian organizations to protect  a large non-Serb population in northern Bosnia, which has been  under pressure to leave, Minister Granic said that these  criminal actions must be urgently stopped. The Republic of  Croatia will otherwise be faced with a new wave of refugees, a  burden with which it will not be able to cope given that it is  already caring for about 500,000 refugees, Granic said. He  calls on the UN Security Council to do everything in its power  to halt these crimes.    The latest attacks on Zupanja Posavina indicate that the  Croatian request to UNPROFOR to ensure firm control of the  borders of the Republic of Croatia -- outlined in the 16 March  letter from Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of  Croatia, to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali -- is fully  justified, Minister Granic says at the end of his letter.</p>

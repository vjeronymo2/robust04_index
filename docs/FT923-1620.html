			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Two crucial questions ahead for the EMS - Can order be restored to Europe's currency markets MORE THAN ever, the future of the European Monetary System (EMS) lies in the hands of the German Bundesbank. After the devaluations of the past fortnight and the indecisive French referendum result, currency markets face two crucial questions. Does the German central bank care enough about the short-term stability of the system to make life easier for the 'hard core' of currencies which remain linked to the D-Mark? And will this month's devaluations by Italy, Britain and Spain  - whose combined gross national product makes up 43 per cent of overall EC output  - lead inevitably to further pressure on weaker currencies to follow suit? To the first question, the Bundesbank yesterday responded with a polite but firm No. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, a veteran of the tortuous discussions at the end of the 1970s on how the system would affect the Bundesbank's freedom of manoeuvre, ruled out EMS reforms. Speaking in Washington, he warned that EMS partners could not expect Germany to cut interest rates in the interests of the weaker members of the system. To the second question, currency dealers came up with their own answer: Yes. By driving down the French franc, as well as other softer currencies such as the Irish punt, against the D-Mark, the foreign exchanges are signalling the risk of more devaluations to come. After the narrow vote in favour of Maastricht, France remains hopeful that the Bundesbank can be persuaded to take a more conciliatory monetary stance, as part of further development of the EMS. Mr Jean-Paul Betbeze, chief economist at Credit Lyonnais in Paris, said the system needed to evolve into 'a more political and less technocratic' arrangement. He was confident that further cuts in German interest rates in coming months would be accompanied by a narrowing of the interest rate differential between the D-Mark and the French franc. A less sanguine view was taken by Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. He said the ambivalent French result and the departure of sterling and the Italian lira from the Exchange Rate Mechanism may spell the death of the EMS. 'For five years, fund managers and currency investors have assumed that there will be a single European currency and that they could invest in Spanish equities, Irish gilts and Danish mortgage bonds with impunity,' he said. 'That view has been damaged by the French vote.' The Bundesbank will clearly be taking time to ponder the opportunity for interest rate cuts  - even though these may become necessary for the good of Germany's own sluggish economy. The Bundesbank and other central banks have carried out an unprecedented DM60bn of intervention to prop up weak European currencies during the last few weeks. As a result, the Bundesbank is withdrawing liquidity from the German money markets to 'sterilise' the effect of the intervention on domestic liquidity  - a factor adding to the strength of the D-Mark. Another area of concern on the exchange markets is that countries with currencies which have not yet devalued, but which carry out significant trade with 'softer currency' nations, may be forced into devaluation to maintain competitiveness. This has undermined confidence in the weaker currencies in the EMS, including the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo and the Irish punt. Investors had bought them in the belief that their respective countries would abide by the stringent convergence criteria set out in the Maastricht treaty. Market attention yesterday was focused on the French franc. The franc appreciated to FFr3.39 against the D-Mark in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, but later came under renewed pressure and fell to within a centime of its ERM floor of FFr3.4320, despite intervention by the Bank of France. Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London, said that he did not expect to see the franc come under the kind of speculative attack that afflicted the lira and sterling. 'There is no obvious case for a franc devaluation, and the strength of the French economy makes me think that there is even some reason to expect a revaluation,' he said. However, the departure of sterling and the lira has made dealers question whether other EMS parities can be kept unchanged. 'If the market builds up a head of steam against the French franc it could still blow the Bank of France off course,' Mr Chertkow said. The franc could be undermined if the August figure for M3 money supply in Germany, due out this week, turns out higher than expected. Even if the franc manages to stay above its floor, the weaker ERM currencies could still be tested. The Irish punt is particularly vulnerable because of the recent devaluation of sterling. The UK accounts for nearly 40 per cent of Irish trade, and some analysts believe that sterling's devaluation will upset the country's trading position unless the Bank of Ireland carries out a similar move. The Danish krone is suspect, because of the high risk that the Swedish krona will be devalued. Among Denmark's main trading partners are Sweden, Finland and the UK, all of whose currencies are among Europe's softest. The future of the system may ultimately depend on whether political leaders are prepared to refashion it. After the turmoil of the last week, foreign exchange analysts believe that, at best, the EMS will develop into a two-speed system, in which the currencies of France and the Benelux countries are linked closely to the D-Mark and the remainder, including sterling and the lira, float within very broad parameters. However, last night currency dealers were not in the mood to take wagers on whether even a two-speed system would prove durable.</p>

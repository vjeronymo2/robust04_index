			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Pension restarts to be made easier The government is to make it easier for employers to take back into occupational pension funds former employees who have chosen to opt out and buy personal pensions. Legislation which precludes the transfer of so-called 'protected rights' into occupational schemes, where the member is not employed by the contributing employer, is to be amended, Mr William Hague, a junior social security minister, told parliament in a written answer on Friday. The changes should allow some people who were badly advised to transfer to a personal pension, to transfer back into their occupational scheme. Protected rights are benefits prescribed by law and financed by rebates of employee and employer national insurance contributions. Reinstatement will remain at the discretion of the scheme's trustees in the light of the scheme's rules, Mr Hague said.</p>

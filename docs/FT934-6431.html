			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Rightwing Tory MPs set to retain their influence The rightwing Conservative 92 Group is set to retain a substantial role in running the party in spite of efforts by the newly formed Mainstream group to reduce its influence. Mainstream, based on the pro-European Union Positive Europe group and the leftwing Lollards, has decided to try to widen its appeal by backing four of the nine rightwingers on the executive of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers in today's elections. The decision is in line with attempts by Mainstream organisers to portray the group as a coalition representing a range of opinion, rather than a centre-left faction. Mainstream was formed to combat the success of the 92 Group, led by Sir George Gardiner, the Thatcherite MP for Reigate, which took nine of the 12 executive seats last year. Mainstream's leaders, who include Mr Cranley Onslow, a former 1922 committee chairman, say they hope to prompt a display of loyalty to Mr John Major, the prime minister. They accuse the right of disloyalty over Europe, and of misrepresenting backbench opinion about the balance between public-spending cuts and tax increases in next week's Budget. However, Mainstream has included three 92 group members - Mrs Marion Roe, Mr Bob Dunn, and Mr Michael Neubert - and one former member - Sir Anthony Durant - in its slate of candidates. The line-up also includes two sitting members with links to the right - Sir Anthony Grant and Sir Terence Higgins. All except Sir Anthony Durant also appear on the 92 group slate, virtually guaranteeing their election. Sir Anthony is replaced by Mr David Evans, the rightwinger. Both groups are backing Sir Donald Thompson, an unaligned former junior minister. The crucial battle will be for the remaining five seats, for which the 92 group is putting up Sir George Gardiner, Sir Ivan Lawrence, Mr James Pawsey, Mr John Townend, and Sir Rhodes Boyson - all sitting members regarded by Mainstream as hard line rightwingers. Mainstream has made these MPs its main targets, and will regard the election as a defeat if it fails to unseat most of them. The Mainstream slate includes Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, Mr David Sumberg, Mr Peter Butler and Mr Nigel Forman. In a separate election, Sir Geoffrey is being challenged by Mr Dunn for one of the committee's two vice-chairmanships. The Labour left suffered a blow last night when Mr Peter Hain, the MP for Neath, lost his position as secretary of the soft-left Tribune Group. Mr Hain, who has used the secretaryship to try and restore Tribune's reputation as a forum for vigorous policy debate, was edged out by Ms Janet Anderson, the Labour MP for Rossendale and Darwen.</p>

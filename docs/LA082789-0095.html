			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF;  </P> <P> ARIZONA STATE NEXT STOP FOR JUNIOR CHAMPION BRANDIE BURTON  </P> <P> Brandie Burton won all there was to win in national junior girls' golf this  summer and very nearly did the same on the women's tour. Now she is turning her  attention to college golf.  </P> <P> The Rialto girl, the Junior World and United States Junior Girls' champion,  will enroll Monday at Arizona State but she won't have to wait long before  resuming her golfing career. The Sun Devils open the collegiate season Sept. 25  in the University of Oregon Invitational.  </P> <P> Burton, who won't be 18 until January, also reached the finals of the U.S.  Women's Amateur and the Women's Trans-National tournaments.  </P> <P> "She came about as close to a grand slam as she could get without getting it,"  said her mother, Barbara. "Every year she seems to outdo herself."  </P> <P> She certainly outdid not only herself but everyone else on the junior circuit  when it came to driving the ball. In all of her matches Brandie, who stands  5-feet-7 and weighs 165 pounds, out-drove her opponents by at least 50 yards.  </P> <P> "When I really crank one, I hit it about 260 yards," she said. "I used to take  distance seriously, but now I'm more concerned with hitting it in the fairway  than I am with how far it goes."  </P> <P> Her strength, Burton believes, comes from her early training as a swimmer.  </P> <P> "I swam the breaststroke for seven years, from the time I was 4 until I was 11,  and that really built up my legs and shoulders, and that's what you need to hit  the ball a long way," she said.  </P> <P> An all-around athlete, Burton was a Junior Olympian in swimming, an all-star  catcher in softball and turned down an opportunity to train for a career in  tennis to concentrate on golf.  </P> <P> "She was a natural in every sport she tried," her mother says. "She loved every  one of them and the best thing about it is that she got good grades, too."  </P> <P> Burton graduated from Eisenhower High with a 3.6 grade-point average.  </P> <P> She started her final season of junior golf by winning a third Optimist Junior  World title by seven strokes over Nicole Horner of Hawaii with a near-record  291 over the 6,272-yard north course at Torrey Pines. She won the 13-14 age  division in 1986 and the 15-17 in 1987.  </P> <P> "It's nice to go out on top," Brandie said after repeating as champion.  </P> <P> Next was the U.S. Junior, where she became the first girl to win the medal  three years in a row. Her 69-69 -- 138 at the Pine Needles course in Southern  Pines, N.C., broke the tournament record by two strokes.  </P> <P> Although she defeated Camie Hoshino of Hawaii, 1 up, in the final, Burton  scored her big win in the semifinals when she defeated her longtime rival,  Vickie Goetze of Hull, Ga., 1 up. The pair first met in the 1986 U.S. Junior,  where Goetze won in a third-round match.  </P> <P> Their match was so tense this year that Burton was three under par after five  holes -- and was one down before asserting herself on the back nine.  </P> <P> "I really wanted that title so my name would be on the trophy with some of the  players who had great careers later," Burton said, referring to champions such  as Marlene Bauer Hagge, Mickey Wright, JoAnne Gunderson Carner, Hollis Stacy,  Amy Alcott and Nancy Lopez.  </P> <P> Dick Taylor, editor of Golf World magazine, called Burton "a combination of  Gunderson and Lopez" after watching her in the tournament.  </P> <P> Goetze got her revenge eight days later, however, when she turned the tables on  Burton in the Amateur final at Pinehurst, N.C., winning, 4 and 3.  </P> <P> The loss prevented Burton from becoming the first female to win the U.S. Junior  and U.S. Amateur championships in the same year. Gunderson is the only one to  have won them both and she accomplished it over two years. As did Burton,  Gunderson also lost in the amateur final the year she won the junior title.  </P> <P> Then came the Trans-Nationals in Columbia, S.C., where Burton dominated play  before losing to Karen Noble of Brookside, N.J., in the final, 5 and 3.  </P> <P> "I think it was a pretty good month altogether," Brandie said.  </P> <P> At Arizona State, she will move into the spot left by Pearl Sinn, who turned  professional after four years of college. Sinn, who lives in Bellflower, won  both the U.S. Amateur and the U.S. Women's Public Links championships last year  and repeated this year in the Public Links.  </P> <P> "I chose Arizona State because it's a fabulous facility, it has a great  tradition of golf and the team has a great coach in Linda Vollstedt," Burton  said.  </P> <P> Until now, her instructors have been her father, Roger, a Sunday golfer; Tim  Miskell, professional at the Arrowhead Country Club in San Bernardino; and  Cheryl Thomas, pro at the San Bernardino municipal course.  </P> <P> She started playing while tagging along with her brother, Troy, when she was 8.  Troy, 24, is an assistant pro at Arrowhead.  </P> <P> She was hitting balls at Walt Duda's driving range in Redlands when she caught  the attention of Katie Castator, former golf writer for the San Bernardino Sun.  When the Southern California Golf Assn. held a junior clinic at Fairmount Park  in Riverside, Castator suggested that Burton, then 13, demonstrate how to hit  the driver.  </P> <P> "That was the first time I ever saw her and I was amazed," Miskell said. "It  was obvious that she was oozing with talent. She was hitting it well over 200  yards, remarkable for a little girl. I told her that if she needed any help, to  call on me."  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> Finding it more and more difficult to get a starting time? The National Golf  Foundation reports that the nation's golf population increased by 7.8% -- from  21.7 to 23.4 million -- last year. The figures indicate that women are the  biggest contributors to the increase. They make up about 22% of the golfers in  the United States, yet 41% of all new golfers are women. . . . Women  professionals of the LPGA will show their talents Sept. 21-24 at Los Coyotes CC  in the $300,000 Nippon Travel-MBC (for Mainichi Broadcasting Systems)  tournament. Openings are available for a women-only pro-am Sept. 18, and a  celebrity pro-am Sept. 20. The charity events will help fund the Cystic  Fibrosis Foundation and Childhelp U.S.A. Among the favorites will be Amy  Alcott, who won a Lee Hamill Memorial junior tournament on the same course when  she was 13. That was 20 years ago.  </P> <P> Two old favorites, Riviera and Los Angeles North, are included in Golf  magazine's choice of the 100 best courses in the world. Riviera is ranked No.  30 and L.A. North No. 35. In for the first time are two PGA West courses in La  Quinta, the original Stadium monster, ranked No. 77, and the Jack Nicklaus  private course, No. 90. As usual, two of the top four are the Monterey  peninsula neighbors, Pebble Beach and Cypress Point. Pine Valley, N.J., is  ranked No. 1. . . . The California Handicapped Skiers Foundation will be  recipients of proceeds from the Arcadia Tournament of Roses celebrity  tournament Monday at Santa Anita. Participants include Adrian Zmed, Jason  Bateman, David Graf, Ellie Daniel and Judy Norton-Taylor. . . . Stan Funk  defeated Dick Park, 1-up, for the championship of the Penmar men's club. . . .  Leanne Ulmer of Shandin Hills shot 233 in winning the Southern California  women's public links' 54-hole tournament at Rio Hondo. Dona Kogan of Knollwood  finished second at 247. . . . Southland sectional qualifying for the U.S.  Senior Amateur will be held Thursday at Horse Thief.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE INDOOR GARDEN;  </P> <P> HERBS GO FROM FLOWER POT TO KITCHEN POT;  </P> <P> PLANTS: NOT ONLY ARE HERBS BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT, BUT USING THEM IN COOKING WILL  ADD SPECIAL FLAVOR TO YOUR MEALS.  </P> <P> One of the greatest joys of indoor gardening is growing herb plants.  </P> <P> Not only are herbs beautiful to look at and fun to grow, but as both .ey go  froma professional gardener and an amateur cook I can assure you there's  nothing more rewarding than seasoning your favorite dish with a bit of oregano,  thyme or sage that you grew yourself in your very own kitchen windowsill.  </P> <P> The difference between herbs and spices?  </P> <P> Well, most herbs are fleshy, succulent plants that grow in relatively temperate  climates and whose leaves and stems can be used for culinary purposes, for  giving off delightful fragrances, have proven curative powers or can be used as  natural cosmetics or dyes.  </P> <P> Herbs can also be dried to make beautiful wreaths or breath-taking potpourri.  </P> <P> A spice, on the other hand, is generally a very aromatic part of an herb plant,  ground from the root, fruit, flower or bark.  </P> <P> For instance, the plant coriander is an herb, generally known as cilantro or  Chinese parsley, while the ground seeds of coriander are classified as a spice.  The same with ginger -- the plant itself is an herb; the root is a spice.  </P> <P> And spices prefer a more tropical environment than herbs.  </P> <P> The culinary herbs, those used for flavoring food, include savory, rosemary,  basil, dill, parsley, mint, anise, bay, chervil, chives, fennel, mustard and  many, many more.  </P> <P> They can be used either fresh or dried. Just remember that dried herbs are  stronger than fresh herbs -- one tablespoon of fresh herbs equals one teaspoon  of dry herbs.  </P> <P> Also, you should add fresh herbs relatively late in the cooking process so that  you don't cook out all the subtle, delicate flavor.  </P> <P> Although almost all herbs are scented, the most fragrant include bay, lavender,  scented geraniums, lemon verbena, patchouli and tansy. Among herbs used for dye  and color are indigo (for blue), agrimony (for yellow) and madder root (for  red). And people have been using herbs for medicinal purposes since the  beginning of time, such as chamomile for tea and aloe vera, applied topically,  for rashes and burns.  </P> <P> The most rewarding route toward growing your own herbs is to start them from  seeds. You'll find a large variety of packeted herb seeds in nurseries, garden  centers and discount stores.  </P> <P> Follow the directions on the seed packet, which will read something like this:  Fill a pan or a low, wide pot with one-half commercial potting mix, one-quarter  vermiculite and one-quarter perlite. Plant the seeds in rows about four inches  apart and about half an inch under the soil. Keep the soil moist and in a  bright, warm spot.  </P> <P> The seeds should sprout within two weeks. As the individual plantlets reach  heights of 3 to 4 inches, weed out the smallest, scrawniest seedlings and plant  the strongest into individual small pots about 2 inches in diameter.  </P> <P> Keep them in bright sunlight and keep the soil moist (this usually means daily  watering). Within a few weeks you should have flourishing plantlets that are  anywhere from six inches to a foot tall and ready to be transplanted into and  cultivated in four-inch pots.  </P> <P> As fresh herbs become more and more popular in cooking, people are also buying  established herb plants, usually in 3- or 4-inch pots. You can find  high-quality plants in better nurseries and garden centers in our area almost  all year long.  </P> <P> Although you can buy perennial herb plants during the fall and winter, the best  time to buy is now, during the summer, so that they can get a good root hold in  your house or apartment. When buying herb plants, make sure they're healthy: A  good plant is full, bushy and free of drying leaves.  </P> <P> The general rules for growing herbs indoors, to keep them thriving even during  the winter months, are:  </P> <P> Light: Herb plants need at least five hours of good sunlight a day, although  they should be protected from direct sunlight during the hot summer months. If  you can't provide enough natural sunlight, herbs will do very well under  artificial lights.  </P> <P> Water: Most herbs should be kept moist at all times, although some need to be  drier than others. (See specific care instructions.)  </P> <P> Soil: A regular commercial potting mix is fine, but I suggest you add a bit of  perlite to create a lighter soil and ensure extra good drainage.  </P> <P> Food: Herb plants need very little food -- a once-a-month feeding with an 8-7-6  liquid houseplant food is plenty.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Harvesting  </P> <P> Whether you're growing your herbs for cooking, fragrance or medicinal use,  you'll want to harvest them frequently. I'd suggest cutting a couple of inches  off the tops every time your herb plants grow that much. This will not only  keep you well-supplied with herbs but will help encourage bushy new growth as  well. You can harvest herbs using scissors or by just pinching off the tops any  time you like.  </P> <P> I've tried lots of herbs indoors, but I've had the best luck with these five,  all perennials, ensuring growth year-round:  </P> <P> </P> <P> Oregano  </P> <P> Almost interchangeable with another delicious perennial, sweet marjoram,  oregano (Origanum varieties) has a slightly sharper flavor and makes a  wonderful container plant. It grows into a shrub about two feet tall with dark,  green, oval leaves. Oregano should be grown in full sun, kept moist, and can be  propagated from seeds, cuttings or root division.  </P> <P> Oregano is an especially good addition to dishes such as pasta, soups, salads  and tomato-based dishes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Thyme  </P> <P> Thyme, Thymus varieties, (pronounced "time") is a perennial that will thrive in  full sun when kept lightly moist in a well-drained soil. All varieties do well  indoors, but you should clip (or harvest) your thyme plant frequently so it  won't develop woody stems. Propagate by seed or stem cuttings. Thyme can be  used effectively with meats, poultry, stews, sauces and soups. (I make a mean  zucchini loaf flavored with thyme.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Savory  </P> <P> Among the many varieties of savory (Saturega varieties) the two most common are  winter savory (S. montana) and summer savory (S. hortensis.) Winter savory is a  hardy perennial that will grow almost two feet tall and will do very well on a  bright, sunny windowsill. Summer savory is an annual that has a slightly more  delicate flavor than winter savory but which I don't recommend you try to grow  indoors. Both varieties have small, needle-like leaves and produce tiny,  pinkish-white flowers. Winter savory prefers a more sandy soil than its summer  brother and is propagated by division or root cuttings. Savory is delicious is  salads, soups and stews.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sage  </P> <P> Another hardy perennial, sage (Salvia varieties) is a member of the mint  family. Besides its culinary value, sage has long been used as a medicinal herb  for everything from upset stomachs to baldness. In medieval times, sage was  even thought to improve the memory. Among the many varieties of sage you'll  find at your nursery or garden center, the showiest is the variegated s.  "tricolor" and the most interesting (if you can find it) is s. elegans, or  pineapple sage, whose light-green leaves have a strong pineapple aroma. Sage  can be propagated by seed or stem cuttings and goes well with sausage, pork  chops, vegetables or pasta sauce. The most traditional use for sage is at  Thanksgiving, in turkey stuffing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rosemary  </P> <P> Rosemary (Rosmarinas varieties) is more woody than the average herb plant, thus  we often see it designed as a topiary or a bonsai plant. Rosemary is said to  alleviate headaches, heal wounds and induce sleep, but it's most prized as a  flavorful addition to meats, soups and vegetables. And for a summer treat I  sprinkle rosemary leaves on my homemade fruit salad. Rosemary should be kept  away from cold drafts during the winter, and although it needs full sun, it  should only be watered when the soil is dry.  </P> <P> Using fresh herbs as flavoring can often turn a very good dish into a gourmet  delight. But, even if you choose to dry some of the herbs you grow and harvest,  you'll get a great deal more satisfaction from sprinkling home-grown rosemary  into a recipe than adding the same herb from a store-bought jar.  </P> <P> If you want to know more about growing herbs, there are lots of excellent books  available on the subject, ranging from "Herbs" by Emelie Tolley and Chris Mead  (Potter: $35.00), a beautiful coffee-table tome, to the bargain of the batch,  "Herbs -- An Illustrated Guide" (Sunset: $6.95).  </P> <P> So there you have it. It's time for you to join the ranks of those of us who  have discovered the pleasure of growing our own herbs.  </P> <P> Whether you start your herbs from seeds, cuttings, or buy the plants already  under way in 3- or 4-inch pots, good luck, happy growing, and bon appetit!  </P></p>

Li Peng said: Guangdong is at the  forefront of reform and opening up, having made rapid progress  in all fields of work since the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee. It is hoped that the people of  Guangdong Province will achieve new and even greater success in  the new year under the inspiration of the guidelines of the 14th  CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee.    Li Peng had toured Huizhou in February 1990. Under the  guidance of the party's basic line, Huizhou City has made rapid  progress in economic construction over the past four years, and  it is now a thriving city.    On the morning of 7 February, Premier Li Peng and Ding  Guangen, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau,  eagerly viewed an exhibition of Huizhou City's industrial goods.  Color televisions, videocassette recorders, high-quality stereo  equipment, facsimile printers, and telephones on display in the  exhibition hall demonstrated Huizhou City's achievements in  electronic industrial development in recent years. It is  reported that the output value of Huizhou City's electronic  industry currently totals 5.162 billion yuan annually, making  this industry the mainstay of the city's industrial sector. Li  Peng was very delighted to see the exhibits. As he viewed the  exhibits, he questioned workers at the exhibition hall in detail  about the products' functions, prices, and sales. He urged  local cadres to build on their leading products, to develop more  new products, and to tap foreign and domestic markets in light  of their own special conditions.    Aside from developing its economy in recent years, Huizhou  city has paid attention to investment in educational services,  which totaled 359 million yuan last year after increasing at an  average annual rate of 31.9 percent. After visiting the  exhibition, Li Peng also made a special trip to the No. 8  Huizhou City Middle School to visit the teachers and students  there. When the teachers and students saw the premier, they  swarmed around him to shake his hand. For his part, Li Peng  warmly greeted them and offered season's greetings to the  teachers who worked hard on the educational front.    Huizhou city was heavily decorated and shrouded in a joyous  atmosphere prior to the Spring Festival. Pots of kumquat,  chrysanthemums, gladioli, daffodils, and tulips lined the  streets, adding a spring touch to the winter of this southern  city. Amid the hustle and bustle, Li Peng had cordial  conversations and exchanged season's greetings with flower  growers and city residents.    Before his tour of Huizhou, Li Peng had inspected  infrastructure and some new and high technology projects in  Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, and Shenzhen from 28 January-5  February. He had held informal discussions with local leading  party and government comrades. Li Peng said: The more we  develop the economy, the more we should bear in mind the need to  show concern for and help with the well-being of people in  impoverished areas. The more we reform and open up, the more we  should strengthen spiritual civilization and create a fine  social environment for reform and development.    Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau  and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee;  Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin; and responsible comrades from  relevant State Council departments accompanied Li Peng on his  tour.</p>

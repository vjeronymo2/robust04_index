			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Outsider in a risky business - Campaign Profile A FAVOURITE story of Mr Des Wilson, Liberal Democrat campaign director, is of the night in wartime New Zealand when his father fired a gun mounted in case of Japanese invasion near the family's seaside home. Alas, the suspicious ship his father was aiming at was not Japanese and the town was deprived of vital supplies as the frightened captain fled. Mr Wilson, who came to England more than 30 years ago, is hoping this week to launch an onslaught of equal ferocity and panache on the British political system. Liberal Democrats pray his targeting is a little more successful. Extrovert, enthusiastic and excitable, Mr Wilson is not always trusted by his Liberal Democrat colleagues. He is not elected to parliament or party and is accountable only to Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader. If the campaign is judged a success, Mr Wilson will take the plaudits. If it fails, he will be the fall-guy. With his youthful toothy smile looking ever more misplaced on his ruddy middle-aged face, the fast-talking 51-year-old Mr Wilson almost goes out of his way to court controversy, flashing his independence within a party more used to procedural propriety. 'I never read constitutions in a party. I never go on any committees,' he says. 'To people who have devoted their lives to constitutions, this is extremely frustrating.' He is sociable and generous, a tease with a distinctive antipodean twang, perhaps happiest at a restaurant table after a hard day's politicking, struggling with his glasses to examine the label on a New Zealand Chardonnay. But he insists on remaining the outsider, refusing to conform to 'club rules'. Addressing the Liberal Democrats' spring conference at Glasgow on Saturday, the electricity generated came almost as much from notoriety as from familiarity or warmth. 'He has a lot of the lovable rogue about him,' one Liberal Democrat prospective parliamentary candidate says. Mr Wilson knows he has yet to recover from the flak he received for his handling of the Alliance parties' campaign in the 1987 election - particularly his failure to stop the public and private clashes between the leaders of the two parties, Dr David Owen and Mr David Steel. His infamy was exacerbated by his book on the inside story of the election. Liberal Democrat MPs, most of whom will be seen far less on television during the campaign than Mr Wilson, are curiously circumspect. 'He is an excellent campaign director - and you can quote me as saying that,' one said tersely before changing the subject. Mr Wilson's greatest asset is his instinctive campaigning zeal. His eclectic style dates from school days in Oamaru, New Zealand, when he read through almost the entire stock of the town's public library, picking up an encyclopaedic knowledge of cricket and rugby and a scratch briefing on history and politics. One of six children, his father ran a house-painting company, and his mother was a nurse. After leaving school, he became a journalist and arrived in England at 19, lured by the lights of Fleet Street. The move to professional campaigning was inspired by a 1960s Kennedy-esque 'ask what you can do for your country' righteousness. He set up Shelter, the charity for the homeless, taking housing to the top of the political agenda. Subsequently he has campaigned - with notable victories - for lead-free petrol, against tobacco sales to children, for freedom of information, and against pollution. The breathless dynamism with which he throws himself into his work is legendary. But there is no career plan or sense of direction. Until recently he spent weekday nights searching for a cheap London hotel to sleep, returning to his wife in the country only at weekends. He has written a low-brow novel, Costa del Sol, aimed at airport bookshelves, to satisfy his impulsiveness. Another novel is in the pipeline. Most comfortable when in total charge, he refuses to be paid in his current post. That means he cannot become a party servant - and also saves expense for a cash-strapped political party. But taking on such responsibility makes personal unpopularity inevitable, he believes, given his job of targeting the most winnable seats. 'Every time you say 'no', there is someone else who thinks you are a dictator beyond belief,' he says. He refuses to admit to a temper and dismisses suggestions that he is prickly under pressure, but to say the least he does not suffer fools gladly. In spite of his impeccable sense of public duty, Mr Wilson is not a detailed policy man and is far from an intellectual. He is on safest ground with party representatives when - as on Saturday  - he makes rabble-rousing speeches with negligible policy content. Colleagues fear that if he goes much further under the heat of television lights, carefully prepared policy positions may be wrecked. So far, however, he has focused on countering charges that a Liberal Democrat vote is a wasted vote, and on claiming a moral ground for the party above the negative Labour and Tory clashes, by calling for an overhaul of the political system. Mr Wilson has made no predictions of how well his party will fare. Realistically he can expect little advance on the current total of 22 MPs - and possibly some losses  - but with a share of the vote of, perhaps, around 20 per cent. If the outcome is much worse, and Liberal Democrats blame the national campaign, Mr Wilson will find the retaliation targeted at him.</p>

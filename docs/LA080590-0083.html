			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: SACRIFICIAL SMOKE BY JAN FRIDEGARD TRANSLATED BY ROBERT E.  BJORK (UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA PRESS: $9.95)  </P> <P> This volume completes Robert Bjork's translation of Swedish novelist Jan  Fridegard's critically acclaimed "Holme" trilogy.  </P> <P> "Sacrificial Smoke" focuses on the escalating conflict between Christianity and  native Scandinavian paganism in 9th-Century Uppsala. As he seeks to free the  thralls and limit the spread of Christianity in the small Viking kingdom, Holme  represents a threat to both the established economic order and the nascent  religious orthodoxy. The local chieftain and foreign missionaries plot his  murder, but the dark, brooding smith is not an easy man to kill. "Sacrifical  Smoke" recaptures the strength and tension that made the first book, "The Land  of Wooden Gods," so compelling -- and was sadly lacking in the second, "People  of the Dawn."  </P></p>

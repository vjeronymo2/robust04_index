			<p>BFN     [Text] Professor Hubert de Ronceray, leader of the  Mobilization for National Development, MDN, reacting to the  cancellation of a conference with the presidents of the  political blocs in the lower chamber, still believes it is up to  the legislators to fill the institutional vacuum. The MDN  leader, member of the Coordinating Committee, invites the  legislators to cooperate in the installation of a new power.    [Begin recording] [De Ronceray] I believe that the joint  resolution is very clear. It says very clearly that we support a  constitutional solution with application of Article 149 of the  Constitution. But in case parliament refuses to follow up this  constitutional demand, then parliament will be responsible for  all favorable or unfavorable reactions that result from this  refusal. We are therefore very sorry to see that those who are  in charge of the defense of this country's Constitution, those  who are mandated by the people to defend their rights, are  threatening to drop the Constitution as they did so many times,  but are also threatening to hasten the chaos. We hope that good  sense will finally prevail. We invite all those in parliament,  in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate, who still have  minimal respect for this country, to accept their  responsibilities and defend, tooth-and-nail, what is left of law  and duty for senators and deputies.    [Francois] If the situation persists, are you going to give  up, or are you going to pursue the fight by developing new  strategies?    [De Ronceray] The fight must continue until a solution is  found to the crisis. Because right now, I think that we are  facing a national tragedy. There are seven million men and women  who can no longer resist. There are seven million men and women  who are asking the political authorities to show that they are  still real men and women. I think it is our duty to continue the  fight until the truth is respected and implemented. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Walls do not a penitent make: As the UK prepares to send more offenders to jail, Alan Pike asks whether prisons work If Mr Michael Howard, the UK home secretary, needs any hints on how to make prisons more austere as part of his forthcoming crackdown on crime, he can obtain a handy booklet from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. Last year, OPCS published the results of the first national survey of prisoners in Britain's jails. Top of the list of improvements sought by inmates was better food. All Mr Howard need do is to serve lumpy potatoes, as well as restrict the other facilities that prisoners particularly value - phonecards, television sets in cells and more frequent visits by their families. But Mr Howard's opponents hope that he will study the survey in more detail before he tries to increase austerity, or to implement other measures from his 27-point programme against crime that would increase the prison population. It shows that only 30 per cent of prisoners believe prison is a deterrent, compared with 93 per cent who regard it as an occupational hazard of criminal activity, and 86 per cent who say inmates learn more about crime while there. Evidence of this sort, say critics, demonstrates that a crackdown on crime spearheaded by a crackdown on the minority of offenders who happen to be caught is doomed to failure. This week, as Prime Minister John Major backed Mr Howard, the band of critics was joined by Lord Woolf - from the government's point of view, an embarrassing opponent. Lord Woolf, who dismissed the policy of imprisoning greater numbers of people as having a 'miserable record of failure', is the senior judge who led the 1990 public inquiry into the riots at Strangeways and other prisons. Only two years ago, the government was among his report's admirers. A prisons white paper in September 1991 acknowledged its debt to Woolf. Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary at the time, said the government accepted the central proposition of the report that 'security and control must be balanced with justice and humanity'. Ministers were motivated not only by a desire to reduce prison overcrowding, one of the flashpoints of the 1990 riots. They had concluded that prison was an expensive failure for some offenders. But this week Mr Major and Mr Howard defended the use of prisons by arguing that offenders were prevented from committing further crimes while detained, and that it deterred others. Such views are not only disputed by Lord Woolf, penal reformers, probation officers, social workers and some senior police officers and prison staff. They overturn the government's own arguments advanced in a green paper leading to the 1991 Criminal Justice Act, which legislated for greater use of non-custodial sentences. The government maintained then that imprisonment reduced crime 'only by restricting opportunities for a limited period'. People sent to prison were also 'less likely to acquire the self-discipline and self-reliance' needed to avoid reoffending in the future, while even a short period of custody was likely to confirm young offenders as criminals. Prison is certainly not cost-effective compared with alternative penalties. The cost of an average prison sentence is 20 times greater than non-custodial alternatives. And the Association of Chief Probation Officers says official figures show that 69 per cent of men under 21 released from young offenders' institutions reoffend within two years, compared with 56 per cent who are put on probation and 58 per cent serving community penalties. Mr Howard's critics complain that non-custodial penalties, such as service in the community, have not been tried long enough, or financed adequately, to demonstrate their full worth. They are also alarmed that the government wants conditions in prison to be deliberately austere. Mr Howard has said Butlins, the holiday camp operator, will not be bidding for the contract to run six proposed new privately managed prisons - the critics even question the need for these extra prisons, saying the government should invest the money in improved crime prevention. Order in prison depends on strict maintenance of discipline, but few governors would welcome instructions to bring in harsher conditions as part of what one describes as a 'government public relations exercise to show that it is giving criminals what it thinks they deserve'. The view, heavily influenced by the Woolf report, that prison must offer positive options is shared by the government's private sector partners, which are taking over prison management. Mr Jim Harrower, chief executive of security company Group 4, says he believes the private sector can gradually contribute to crime reduction by breaking new ground in providing prisoners with better work, education and training opportunities. 'The prison population includes some very tough, difficult characters, and they must be held in conditions that ensure they cannot disrupt things for everyone else. But I do not wish to be in the business of simply warehousing prisoners.' The Woolf report was not starry-eyed about the extent to which prison might reform offenders. But it argued that the best hope was to avoid unnecessary use of custody and make the damaging experience of imprisonment as positive as possible. Liberal-minded concern for the offender need not be the motivation for such policies. Even though Mr Major and Mr Howard are stressing that prison takes criminals out of circulation, few people stay there for life. As a memorable passage of the Woolf report commented: 'The prison service has to live with these prisoners during their time in prison. The rest of the country lives with them afterwards.'</p>

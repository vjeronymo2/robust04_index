			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / BT faces flood of payoff applicants BT, THE telecommunications group, which is spending nearly Pounds 1bn to persuade 20,000 employees to leave the company, may be left in the embarrassing position of attracting too many applicants. According to initial calculations, about half the 200,000 workforce is interested in taking a closer look at how the generous redundancy terms of BT's Release 92 would work for them. Mr David Scott, BT industrial relations manager, agreed that the figure was a sign of poor morale. The company has been facing a slowdown in business and increased competition in recent years. It has speeded up its redundancy programme in the hope of reaching productivity levels comparable with those of US telephone companies. Payments for people volunteering to leave may be as high as Pounds 100,000 plus pension entitlement, although the average payoff is likely to be closer to Pounds 30,000. The BT workforce remained static for six years after privatisation in 1984. Since 1990, 30,000 jobs have gone - mainly in clerical, telephone operator and managerial posts. The target for 1992-93 is a total reduction of 24,000. BT insists it is firmly committed to avoiding compulsory redundancies. See Lex</p>

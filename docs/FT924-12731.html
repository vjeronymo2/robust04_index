			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of Locating in North America (1): Investment continues - BMW is just the latest example of a remarkable surge in foreign direct investment in North America, partly with the establishment of greenfield operations but most dramatically through the takeover of US companies THERE is no more dramatic example in recent years of a European company locating in North America than BMW's announcement this summer that it would be building a new plant in South Carolina, its first outside West Germany. BMW had spent three years scouring the world for a manufacturing site after deciding that it needed new capacity outside Germany. Its decision to plump for the US - and South Carolina - tells a great deal about the factors driving European and Japanese companies in general to locate in North America. BMW wanted to be close to the already large American market for its vehicles and to be within the proposed North American Free Trade Area, which promises a big increase in intra-American trade over the next decade. It was lured to South Carolina by factors which included generous state financing and worker training programmes; easy access to ports for exporting and importing; and an Eastern time zone, making communications with Germany easier. BMW is just the latest example of a remarkable surge in foreign direct investment in North America which developed in the 1980s, partly through the establishment of greenfield operations, but most dramatically through the takeover of US companies. Direct foreign investment in the US rose from Dollars 83bn in 1980 to Dollars 403.7bn in 1990, according to the Commerce Department. The surge has slowed somewhat over the past two years as the takeover wave of the 1980s has died away. However the region continues to enjoy a steady stream of new greenfield investment and the overall volume is likely to gather momentum again when the western world eventually moves out of recession. For the past two years European companies have tended to focus their energies on matters nearer home: the problems of operating in an economic recession and the opportunities supposedly opened by the European Community's 1992 initiative and the collapse of the Soviet empire. Japanese companies have domestic economic concerns as well and several have been stung by paying excessively high prices for US assets in the 1980s. However, the recent political and economic turmoil in Europe, as well as the realisation that it will take years before the former Soviet bloc provides meaningful profits, may help refocus attention on North America. After all, the US remains by far the world's largest market speaking a single language. And the creation of a North American Free Trade Area (Nafta), including Canada and Mexico, will make the market even larger, presenting companies with some 365m potential consumers. The Nafta pact, on which broad agreement was reached over the summer, now awaits final wording and legislative approval. That said, foreign companies already in the US, and prospective investors, must be extremely concerned about the outline proposals of Mr Bill Clinton, the democratic presidential nominee, to increase the taxes of foreign multinationals operating in the country. A similar proposal has recently been circulating in Congress. Moreover, entering the North American market presents many pitfalls for the unwary. BMW is only too well aware of the unfortunate precedent of fellow German motor company Volkswagen, which invested in a US plant in the late 1970s only to pull out in 1988 after suffering heavy losses. Reasons for VW's defeat included a reputation for poor quality at its Pennsylvanian plant, insufficient productivity there, and a failure to market successfully to the US consumer. Yet the US car market can be conquered by foreign entrants, as Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Honda demonstrated during the 1980s with immensely successful greenfield plants. Japanese companies now account for about 30 per cent of the US car market. That said, not even the Japanese have been infallible in North America: Nissan, one of Japan's leading car companies, has struggled for years to raise its share of the US market. Multinational companies such as these devote great attention to picking the right site for North American operations. But evidence suggests that too many other companies pay only scant attention to this, often simply locating a new facility next to an existing one, or merely considering a single state. This may save time in the short run but over the longer term it may prove costly. Experts in the field say key factors which should be considered by any company include: Geographical and communications factors. How close does a company need to be to the market it is serving? And how good are the road, rail, air and telecommunications links between the proposed location and both the market and head office? Many European companies prefer to be on the eastern seaboard, closest to home in terms of both time and distance, while many Japanese companies prefer the Pacific coast for the same reason. However, some consultants argue that too many companies simply pick the largest city as a base in their preferred geographical region, ignoring the advantages of so-called second cities. These are smaller cities, often a short commuter flight from the main centre, with good academic facilities and which may offer the company cheaper costs, a more qualified labour force, better infrastructure and a more pleasant way of life. Relative costs of land, labour and property. These costs vary greatly around the US and within individual regions. A big factor encouraging United Parcels Service to relocate from the New England state of Connecticut to Atlanta, Georgia, was the high cost of housing in Connecticut, which made it hard for the company to persuade good regional managers to relocate to headquarters. Connecticut, for its part, has spent several decades picking up companies relocating from expensive New York City. Local education standards. Educational achievement levels vary widely around the US, but most states now recognise that raising the country's relatively poor standards is vital to attracting new investors who demand sophisticated workforces. Companies which only require unskilled labour will tend to look to Third World countries, lacking minimum wage legislation, rather than to the US. State and local government aid. US states and counties, scarred by recession and unemployment, are bidding vigorously against one another for new investment through generous tax rebates and other incentives. Very attractive packages can also often be negotiated with some local electricity utilities. Training assistance. This is a new form of state aid which is likely to play an increasingly important role in greenfield site selection in future. Several states, such as South Carolina and Georgia, have agreed to pay for the pre-job training of companies locating there. South Carolina's willingness to shoulder these costs was one of the most important factors attracting BMW to the state. The training involves not just the technical skills needed to work in the plant but softer issues, such as teamwork and how factory floor employees can assume greater responsibility. Mr Robert Ady, president of PHH Fantus, an international business location consulting firm which advised BMW on its new plant, says this focus on pre-employment training is a relatively new and important trend. New manufacturing techniques mean more responsibility is being pushed down to the factory floor, but workers are reluctant to accept this new 'empowerment.' Mr Ady says that roughly 50 per cent of necessary pre-job training may now consist of such 'soft' management issues. However, he adds that it is often hard for state legislatures to see the benefits of voting money for training in 'how to have more fun on the job.' Choosing a location acceptable to relocating staff. There is a danger that a company will fix on an area which makes sense from a cost viewpoint but then find difficulty in getting its best people to move to the area. Many foreigners, for example, would feel more comfortable in the cosmopolitan environment of a big city such as New York than in some of the more insular towns of the American interior. Relocation advisers say that 40 per cent or more of corporate transferees often refuse to relocate. Managements which have not accurately gauged in advance the acceptability of their plans may find business seriously disrupted while they train fresh staff at their new location.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: IBM and National Semi agree LAN partnership INTERNATIONAL Business Machines has announced a partnership with National Semiconductor focused on the technology for local area networks (LANs), which link personal computers and workstations in offices and factories. IBM said it would work with National, a leading manufacturer of LAN semiconductor chips, to develop products that make networking easier. The new relationship brings together the strongest proponents of rival LAN technologies. IBM is the dominant supplier of Token-Ring networking products, while National is the leader in chips used in Ethernet LAN products. In Token-Ring, LANs users exchange information packets through a 'token' that acts as a courier travelling around the network loop from computer to computer. In Ethernet LANs, information is exchanged along a network 'highway'. The two approaches together represent about 60 per cent of the Dollars 2bn networking equipment market, according to market analysts, with Ethernet claiming about 35 per cent and Token-Ring about 25 per cent. Both are growing at a rate of about 30 per cent a year. With their new relationship, IBM and National are putting aside past debates over the merits of each technology and stressing that both approaches must co-exist. As a first step IBM has licensed National to sell an IBM-built single-chip controller device for Token-Ring networks. For IBM, the agreement represents an opportunity to expand sales of the controller chip without having to build up a sales and marketing organisation for the devices. The agreement with National also enables IBM to establish its technology as an alternative industry standard. National hopes to increase its sales of networking chips by about Dollars 30m over the next 18 months.</p>

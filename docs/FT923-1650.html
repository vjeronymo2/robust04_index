			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Support for Harmony board The board of Harmony Leisure Group, the loss-making pub and restaurant group, has received expressions of support in its fight to prevent being ousted, according to Mr Stanley Lever, managing director. He added that there was recognition that as he and his family controlled about 24 per cent of the company the present board had 'every desire' to take the company through the present difficulties. An 'alternative board' led by Mr Andrew Martyr, a former hotel executive, is trying to requisition an extraordinary meeting to outline proposals for returning the USM-quoted group to profit.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Debate with Presidents Thomas Klestil of Austria, Vaclav </F> Havel of the Czech Republic, Richard von Weizsaecker of Germany,  Arpad Goncz of Hungary, Lech Walesa of Poland, Michal Kovac of  Slovakia, and Milan Kucan of Slovenia in Litomysl, Czech  Republic; moderated by political analyst Jacques Rupnik -- live]    [Excerpts] [Rupnik] As far as supranational cooperation is  concerned, we see that it does not work everywhere. States are  disappearing or are being created, and it leads in some cases,  particularly in the Balkans, to a very dangerous situation. For  the first time since 1945, we have a war in Europe. What does  it mean to divide states along ethnic criteria, change borders  by force, and create national states based on ethnic  homogeneity? President Kucan, this is a question addressed  straight to you. How did you live through that period of time  in Yugoslavia? Three years ago did you have an inkling of the  closeness between the desire for freedom and the possibility of  war?    [Kucan, in Slovene with simultaneous translation into Czech]  I think it was not difficult at that time to think of these two  realities as being close to each other. Initially, it seemed the  conflict was limited by Yugoslavia itself. It must be forcefully  declared that what happened in Yugoslavia and what is now  happening in the Balkans is a defeat of (?Roehmer's) principles.  I am sure that the defeat in this specific case can become a  lesson for the whole of Europe. Many mistakes were committed  here and three of them are exceptionally important.    The first is the misunderstanding and the unwillingness to  understand that Yugoslavia had to disintegrate. It functioned  only temporarily in the form of a multinational state.  Yugoslavia could exist only while centralism existed.  Disintegration was inevitable the moment this ceased.    The second mistake was linked to the incorrect  interpretation  of this war, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as an internal  war between ethnic groups, because this does not correspond to  the basis of this war.    The third mistake, connected with the first one, is that  there was never a real interest in looking into the real essence  of instability in the Balkans -- and in consequence -- of  instability in former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted] It is  necessary to seek the reason for this instability. The reason  lies in Serbia's very complicated ethnic and especially national  problem. I suppose the Serbs wish to resolve the national  question which is, of course, as legitimate as in the case of  other nations. However, there is a question mark over the forms  and methods used to solve this question. From the point of view  of the Paris (?meeting) and [word indistinct] principles this  method of ethnic cleansing and of forceful border changing is in  effect a genocidal matter. This is all absolutely inhuman.    Everything which is done to solve a problem in isolation, in  isolation from the basic internal problem of the Balkan region  -- by which I mean resolving the ethnic questions -- creates an  acute danger of war. An attempt must be made to stabilize the  Balkan region on a more permanent basis. [passage omitted on  past conflicts]    I think that what is happening now, as a result of direct  pressure from Washington and Moscow, is the most important way  towards a halt to the war. This is enormously important, but  there is something even more important here, and that is the  talks with the right partners, which means talks with Belgrade,  Sarajevo, and Zagreb. This would represent a recognition of the  real nature of this war.    Two years ago, when the war started, it was possible to  delineate the framework of this war. [passage indistinct] Then,  of course, Croatia was not involved in this war in Bosnia in the  way it is today. If the diagnosis was made correctly at that  time, the price would not have been so high, there would not  have been 100,000 people dead, 600,000 people expelled, and a  huge number of people wounded, incapacitated, and damaged by  other means. This all could happen, but now a real solution of  the Balkan crisis is at stake. [passage omitted on Klestil  discussing unacceptability of ethnic cleansing and suggesting  that agreement between the West and Russia might lead to  pressure on Belgrade]    [Rupnik] Russia is not returning only to the Balkans, but  also to the near abroad [blizke zahranici]. How do you assess  this development in Russian policy and what does it mean for  Central Europe? President Walesa?    [Walesa, in Polish with simultaneous translation into Czech]  Of course after the period of division into two poles, Russia  and Europe are seeking solutions by means of evolution. The  time is coming when we should define certain principles and  points where our minds meet. If we do not do this, then  Yugoslavia must be considered as a challenge and as a warning.  Let us imagine the countries of the post-Soviet Union. And  there [words indistinct] for example, in Latvia, 40 percent  support Russia's Boris Yeltsin. If something similar happened  elsewhere, then we would be confronted with a total catastrophe.  So, it is necessary to mark the danger [bodovat], it is  necessary to discuss interests and (?human) categories.    If we fail to reach such agreements as have been reached in  Central Europe and Europe overall, if we fail to submit these  problems jointly and of course assess them, then of course it  will be an incentive for Russia to settle things in the old way.  We need here the democratic principles recognized by Europe.  And in this sense, we have to help Russia in this direction.    However, the Russia that puts forth conditions, wanting to  be a partner, but not a real partner; the meaning of which they  do not understand.... [pauses] If one is a partner, the same  principles and conditions should apply and not [word  indistinct], not a policeman or something undefined. This all  has to be discussed jointly and certain values have to be  defended jointly. Then we will avoid the Yugoslav example and  [word indistinct] with part of Russia. This will be the right  thing for Russia and a blessing for us all. If we fail to do  it, certain groups in Russia will take advantage of the  indecision in parts of Europe.    [Rupnik] Mr. President, do you think the Partnership for  Peace program is the right solution for the security of Central  Europe and, among other things, its relationship with Russia?    [Havel] I think Russia is and always will be, or will be for  rather a long time, a great Eurasian superpower, a superpower  which even possesses nuclear weapons. I cannot imagine peace in  Europe, or in the world, without some kind of relationship based  on partnership between the West and Russia. Perhaps the  Partnership for Peace program can serve as a starting point for  creating that kind of partnership.    There is, however, a difference between this and the  position  of our states which feel they belong to the West and, because  they are small, they need certain security guarantees and ties.  We understand Partnership for Peace both as an opportunity and  as the beginning of the path towards NATO membership. We cannot  be merely NATO's partners, we want, indeed we must, be a part of  it.    We are in a completely different position from Russia. I  think that some of the ideas now emerging in Russian politics  should be really sharply criticized and denounced. I mean ideas  to the effect that, somehow, just because Russia is such a big  state, it kind of owns us and automatically enjoys the right to  advise us, its closer or more distant neighbors, and tell us  whom we are or are not allowed to join. This must be rejected  quite unequivocally. Our countries are particularly sensitive  to this sort of thing and, simply, we want to be a part of  something we feel we belong to in the first place.    This does not mean that we are against anybody or that we do  not wish to have a good relationship with Russia. On the  contrary, let me reiterate that good relations between the West  and Russia are the necessary prerequisites for virtually  everything else, for any European integration processes. Don't  you think that Russia ought not claim superpower status on the  one hand, while at the same time enjoying the same rights as the  small Central European countries? Russia really cannot keep  saying -- Why can you be NATO members but we cannot? Well, this  is quite absurd, isn't it? [passage omitted on von Weizsaecker  on the European Union's political and security dimension,  Partnership for Peace]    [Rupnik] President Kucan.    [Kucan, in Slovene with simultaneous translation into Czech]  I think that what we heard from President Havel was very  important. The point is that we want more than just a  partnership. I believe it must be recognized that where we live  in the world must be taken into account. We want more than just  a partnership -- namely NATO membership and participation in the  system of collective security in Europe. From this point of  view, it is very important that the Partnership for Peace  program is not concerned with security alone.    All participating states are obliged to attain a high level  of democracy and this gives rise to the question -- How do we  tackle the issues of the political neutrality of the army, the  transparency of the armed forces' numbers, and the question of  the joint functioning of the army and society in the sense that  there is adequate control over the armed forces. It is indeed  necessary to ensure complete control over the armed forces. The  danger, the possibility, that certain armed forces or certain  countries can be drawn into solving issues concerning all  citizens still exists.    At the time of gaining its independence, Slovenia, too, went  through a complicated stage. It was necessary to wage a war,  albeit a short one, and now a rather complicated situation has  come into being. With all respect for the army, it is necessary  to establish adequate control over it so democracy can fully  develop and it is absolutely clear that we respect all the  values of all citizens, including the issue of the armed forces.    [Rupnik] President Goncz, if you please. President Kovac to  follow.    [Goncz, in Hungarian with simultaneous translation into  Czech] I absolutely agree with Presidents Havel and Kucan. The  Partnership for Peace program alone is not enough. It is a  certain step towards peace, it is an important step which makes  open cooperation, even military, possible. But we perceive the  issue of peace and partnership in a different way.    Apart from the military sphere, there is also the sphere of  human rights and environment as mentioned by President Walesa a  while ago. There is also the issue of nuclear power stations. I  would also like to bring up the issue of security in terms of  the society. Our country is wrestling with difficult economic  problems. Headway should be made on the path of modernization  and if this headway is not made, then we cannot guarantee the  security of society. To this end it is necessary to understand  the Partnership in a broader context of European politics. We  shall be unable to develop our own markets until markets are  opened to us. On the contrary, our markets will contract and  while they are contracting, we ourselves will not represent a  good market either. We want market for market. Europe is  economically intertwined. So far, Europe has been an  impenetrable market for us.    [Kovac, in Slovak] I think the issue of Central European  security involves two important processes. These processes  should run concurrently. One of them has already begun and was  generated by our interest in NATO membership and by our joining  the Partnership for Peace program. But what is of equal  importance is that NATO, Western Europe, and the United States  of America should cooperate as closely as possible with Russia.  We realize that overrating some of these processes and  underrating others might not necessarily result in a feeling of  security in Central European countries. It might possibly yield  potential hotbeds for a certain destabilization of the situation  in Europe.    From this point of view we realize that nowadays, to  consolidate democracy in Russia, it is very important to help  Russia tackle her economic problems. The other thing I have in  mind is closely linked to this issue, and that is Ukraine should  be helped to preserve its sovereignty.    All these factors are very important, because apart from our  gradual rapprochement to NATO, they could give us -- the  countries stuck in the middle of this region -- a fuller and  more lasting feeling of security.    [Rupnik] Thank you. President Klestil.    [Klestil, in German with simultaneous translation into  Czech]  It is difficult to answer questions to which we do not have  specific answers. In 1996, the European Union [EU] is supposed  to discuss the future of common security and foreign policy. On  the other hand, we are seeing developments in Russia, Belarus,  Ukraine, and we do not know in what direction they are going to  continue. Therefore, it is important to take small steps in the  West, but we must think about Russia and Ukraine being nuclear  powers and we must involve them in the process of all European  security considerations. If we talk about security, about the  danger people fear, then it concerns nuclear power stations. We  should set ourselves a long-term aim of creating a nuclear free  zone in Central Europe. As it is impossible to attain this aim  from one day to the next, it would be necessary to make a list  of security measures, measures to deepen trust. They should be  similar to those on which we agreed yesterday with President  Havel regarding the Czech Republic and Austria; for example, on  opening nuclear power stations for inspections, introducing a  telephone hotline, early warning systems. All this would, in my  opinion, help to reduce public fear of danger.    [Rupnik] The fall of communism presented a challenge to  Europe as a whole. Some of you have already mentioned security  integration, or in other words NATO and Partnership for Peace.  Integration into the EU is also linked to it. How do you see  this process? Can European integration be enlarged eastward, or  is there not a danger that the disintegration processes from the  East might spread westward? After all, this is a game for time.  How do you see current prospects of economic integration? Does  the EU meet your expectations? [passage omitted on Walesa  comparing European integration to the movement of a car;  Weizsaecker comparing integration of former East Germany into  West Germany with integration of Central Europe into Western  Europe; Klestil on the need to show solidarity and patience with  post-communist countries]    [Rupnik] President Kovac, if you please.    [Kovac, in Slovak] When expressing our desire to become  integrated into Europe, we realize this should not be an  integration that would weaken existing European structures and  the objective of every integration should be to consolidate  these structures. In this respect, I think that as far as  integration into the EU is concerned, the EU has been taking  positive and accommodating steps. [passage omitted]    But from this point of view, it seems to me that the issue  of  incorporating into the EU -- in particular into its economic  part -- is one thing, while incorporating Central European  countries into the political and security structures is yet  another. At the same time, the process of economic incorporation  is a more difficult and more long-term affair. Most of us  realize that it is not a question of two or three years. But  during the in-between period, we do not wish to be in some kind  of vacuum regarding the precise definition of our incorporation.  That is why I think certain measures should be reassessed in  this respect.    Naturally, the Partnership for Peace amounts to a certain  testing of our abilities. However, as long as we do not possess  straightforward criteria and positions on this issue, we will  still have a very strong feeling of being in danger. That is  not good, I think, because this process could, in effect, bring  certain disillusionment among our citizens. At the same time,  we know the citizens of Central European countries are  displaying an almost spontaneous will to be incorporated into  both political and security structures. [passage omitted]    [Walesa, in Polish with simultaneous translation into Czech]  I think we should try to answer another question: Whether the  integration should be continuous or whether it should be an  integration in leaps. It has become clear that at present  continuous integration is probably more suitable. [passage  omitted]    I think we have to consider continuous integration with its  strategic points outlined. This will be wise and it will  provide an option of future development for all of us.    [Kucan, in Slovene with simultaneous translation into Czech]  I perceive the question, our dilemma, as a question of whether  every extension of EU membership -- and that is something  necessary -- is strengthening its internal qualities. The fact  is that until the Maastricht Treaty, this was a difficult  process and now it will be even more difficult. However,  despite everything, this is the only way to progress. [passage  omitted]    To halt the integration would in practice put an end to the  existence of the West. However, it is necessary to respect the  fact that Europe is still divided, to a certain degree. [passage  omitted]</p>

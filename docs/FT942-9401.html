			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / International Company News: Competition hits profits at Singapore Airlines Singapore Airlines (SIA), consistently one of the world's most profitable carriers, said intense competition and the continuing strength of the Singapore dollar caused profits last year to decline. For the year ended March, pre-tax profits dipped to SDollars 871m (USDollars 555m), a 7.7 per cent reduction over 1992-93. It is paying an unchanged total dividend of 22.5 Singapore cents. Group revenues rose 10.4 per cent to SDollars 6.24bn and the airline's overall load factor - seen in the industry as an important barometer of performance - improved by 1.7 per cent to 69.5 per cent, in spite of a significant growth in capacity. Passenger revenues rose by 7.2 per cent and cargo revenues by 14.5 per cent. However, price competition, particularly on European routes, and the strength of the Singapore dollar pushed yields down by 6.5 per cent. Analysts estimate that nearly 50 per cent of SIA's overall revenues come from its European and transatlantic routes. In the past, SIA has benefitted from significantly lower staff costs compared with carriers in the industrialised countries. However, increased wage costs are chipping away at SIA's competitive advantage: staff costs in the last 12 months went up by more than 21 per cent. To reduce operational costs SIA has opened a computer software development and maintenance facility in India, where wages are considerably lower than in Singapore. The airline is also considering transferring its reservations service to India. SIA's performance improved in the second half of 1993-94. Mr Cheong Choong Kong, SIA's managing director, said there was some indication that the worst was over, and described 1994-95 as a year of transition. The carrier claims the most modern fleet among main carriers, with its 64 aircraft having an average age of five years. It has forecast annual growth of 8 to 9 per cent until the end of the decade, and is negotiating an order for up to 52 wide-body airliners worth more than Dollars 6bn.</p>

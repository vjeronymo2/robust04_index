			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUPLE PLEAD INNOCENT IN ALLEGED INVESTMENT SCAM  </P> <P> A Lancaster couple accused of bilking about 5,000 investors out of as much as  $30 million pleaded innocent Monday to grand theft, forgery and securities  violations.  </P> <P> David and Karen Missman, owners of Missman-Kaplan Associates Ltd., a bankrupt  real estate investment company in the San Fernando Valley, turned themselves in  to authorities for arraignment Monday.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Milton set a preliminary hearing date of  Dec. 12 for the couple, who face a 118-count criminal complaint. The couple  were released on $25,000 bail.  </P> <P> The Missmans are accused of working a "Ponzi" scheme starting in 1979 by  offering a high rate of return on investments in two companies they owned, MKA  Ltd. and S.C.S. Co., and then using money from new investors to pay off earlier  ones.  </P> <P> Many of the investors were schoolteachers, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Youngdahl  said. Much of the business was generated through endorsements by satisfied  investors who told friends and colleagues that dealings with the companies had  proven to be prudent, he said. The Missmans also used former teachers as sales  representatives or company officers.  </P> <P> One of them, Henry Springer, a former president of United Teachers-Los Angeles,  provided authorities with sworn statements alleging that the Missmans used  investor funds for extensive travel and to purchase a $1.3-million Chatsworth  home and expensive cars, investigators said.  </P> <P> Because the couple's companies were forced by creditors into involuntary  bankruptcy proceedings, most of the recovered assests will go to creditors,  Youngdahl said. Although the loss suffered by investors may reach $30 million,  only $300,000 of the couple's assets will be left for the victims, he said.  </P></p>

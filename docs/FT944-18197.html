			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Taiwan's deputy premier adds to Tokyo discomfort The Japanese government was yesterday suffering diplomatic discomfiture over the activities of a visiting senior Taiwanese official at the Asian games in Hiroshima. Five members of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party plan to meet Mr Hsu Li Teh, Taiwan's deputy premier, in Tokyo today in defiance of party instructions to shun all contact with him. The government wants to avoid offending China, a powerful ally, market and investment destination. The meeting, while deliberately smaller than the grand dinner the pro-Taiwanese LDP politicians had originally planned, will anger China despite the Japanese government's attempts to prevent sports and politics from becoming entangled. Japan cut official ties with Taiwan and opened relations with Beijing in 1972, implying acceptance of China's belief that Taiwan is still a Chinese-owned province. But a significant pro-Taiwan movement remains in Japanese national politics, making it uncomfortable for the government to take clear sides between Taiwan and China. In an attempt to prove to China that Japan does not condone official contacts with Taiwan, Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP's president and Japanese foreign minister, yesterday cancelled a trip to the Hiroshima games scheduled for next weekend. Chinese government objections to a planned visit to the games by Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui led to his last-minute withdrawal and replacement by the deputy prime minister, who it was hoped would take a low profile. Mr Hsu rekindled the dispute over Japan's ambivalent attitude to Taiwan yesterday by claiming in a newspaper interview his visit had 'a political meaning'. A Japanese official accused him of a 'breach of promise'. Also, China has objected to a social meeting between Mr Hsu and Japan's education minister.</p>

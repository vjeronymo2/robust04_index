			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: 'Balladur bond' may exceed FFr40bn THE French government yesterday unveiled the final details of the 'Balladur bond', named after the prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur, with which it plans to finance its job creation plans. It confirmed that the issue would be open-ended and be allowed to exceed the FFr40bn (Dollars 7.18bn) target. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said it was 'not impossible' that the issue would attract more than FFr40bn. The four-year bonds will have a face value of FFr1,000 and yield annual interest of 6 per cent, just below the 6.15 per cent yield on four-year government paper. The government has devised the issue to appeal to individual rather than institutional investors, in the hope of encouraging French savers to withdraw money from SICAV money market funds to buy bonds as a precursor to participating in the forthcoming privatisation programme. It is offering tax breaks for people buying bonds through equity savings plans and switching cash from SICAVs into bonds or equity plans. Individuals will be able to convert the bonds into the shares of privatised companies. They will also be entitled to preferential investment rights when the privatisations start in early September. The government is spending FFr25bn to advertise the issue in a campaign which starts today. The bonds will be sold through banks and post offices. The minimum investment is FFr1,000 and there is no upper limit. The issue is led by Credit Agricole, the co-operative bank, and Banque Nationale de Paris, the state-controlled bank which is a candidate for privatisation, together with Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the public-sector financial institution. Mr Alphandery said that he expected recent falls in French interest rates to make the bonds more appealing to investors. The government also hopes the issue will benefit from the buoyancy of the French bond market. 'The timing is good as the market is definitely on an upward trend,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, French economist at Salomon Brothers. 'The only problem is that if the 'Balladur bond' is a success it suggests the French are still more interested in saving money than spending it.'</p>

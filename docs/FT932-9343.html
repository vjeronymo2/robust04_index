			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Union urges workers not to abandon hope: Plea to carry on working IN A day of bizarre events, it was one of the most extraordinary scenes: 2,000 people, last survivors of a north-east industry which was once supreme in the world, standing in the driving rain to hear their union leaders urge them not to give up hope, but to resume work. Mr Tommy Brennan, regional organiser of the GMB general union, addressed the workforce beside an empty slipway. 'The membership have given us their full commitment to continue to work normally in the hope the receiver can attract a buyer, an interested party, to take on the running of the company,' he said later. The workforce, he said, was angry. 'But there's a realisation today, most important of all, that we must keep it going,' he added. In the Commons Mr John Major, the prime minister, said Swan's tender for a vital contract was rejected because it was 'many tens of millions of pounds' above the rival bid. He expressed regret at the result, but pointed to the measures announced on Wednesday, including a new enterprise zone. 'It is precisely because we are concerned about the employment prospects at Tyneside that we announced the range of measures yesterday,' he said. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the government had been warned for six months of what was going to happen. By failing to allow Swan access to European intervention funds to help it move into merchant shipbuilding, it had denied the yard a future, he said. Mr Neville Trotter, Tynemouth MP and the only local Tory MP, concentrated on prospects for new jobs. 'What we have got to do now is co-ordinate our efforts to ensure that everything possible is done to provide alternative employment.' Mr Stephen Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend, said Swan was condemned to closure. 'It's come about because of a deliberate decision made by the government. When they talk about the market you should remember the government is the market because they place the orders,' he said. Mr Byers said the opposition would lead a half-day debate next Wednesday on redundancies in the defence industry.</p>

Precisely what happened to the funds is not known because  national treasury funds are channeled, irrespective of their  source, into the government's fiscal plan, the officials said.    The BAI looked into whether Chon's donation was placed in  the  national treasury at the request of the opposition Democratic  Party during the recent parliamentary session.</p>

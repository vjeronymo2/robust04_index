			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Leading Article: A house for arts and sport THE CREATION of a Ministry for the National Heritage is in many ways a natural extension of Mr John Major's desire to preside over a country 'at ease with itself'. As the nation spends more time at leisure, it is reasonable that the activities of the central government, so far as they are necessary, should be brought together under one roof. Until now, the approach of successive British governments has been piecemeal: a ministry for the arts, occasionally upgraded, a minister for sport, sometimes more visible than at others, and broadcasting kept with the Home Office. Other departments had a say, including education, environment and even defence, as well as the Scottish and Welsh offices. When it came to the saving of a national treasure, it was not always clear who was in command or indeed who defined what a national treasure was. Mr David Mellor's new office should help to produce clarity. It should be remembered, however, that the establishment of a new department of state has not always proved easy. It can lead to inter-departmental rivalries and does not always attract the best civil servants. The department of economic affairs was set up with great fanfare by Harold Wilson in the mid-1960s, but quickly faded away. Showpiece department Mr Mellor's first task, therefore, with the prime minister behind him, is to show that the new ministry is here to stay. It will need to be properly housed and properly staffed and not reserved, say, for civil servants unlikely to make it to the top of the Treasury. It should set out in time to become one of the showpieces of any competent British government, for - however indirectly - its activities will affect the lives of the people quite as much as do those of any other department. Precisely because it is new, the ministry has the opportunity to get its priorities right from the start. Despite the understandable complaints from those directly involved in writing and performing, the state of the arts in Britain is not all that bad. The two leading subsidised theatres in London frequently perform to packed houses, and there is a wealth of talent in the regions. British sport may not be the best in the world, but usually manages to be represented in international competitions, if not to win. British broadcasting (not only the BBC) is often envied from abroad. Fragile financing The problem is that so much of the financing is touch and go. Commercial sponsorship of the arts, as an additional source of revenue, may have reached its peak even before the current recession set in. Standards of English cricket may have declined because there is less of it in schools and the local authorities lack the funds to provide the facilities while teachers have become less willing to stay behind after school hours. Meanwhile, there are repeated arguments about how far resources should come from national or regional bodies. The Arts Council is still in the throes of such a dispute. There is also the valid point that if funds are spread widely, they are spread too thin - perhaps to the detriment of the great national companies. No one has yet found the perfect solution. Mr Mellor and his ministry have the chance to look at all these questions anew. They should be in no hurry to reach conclusions. One principle, however, should be paramount. The ministry is there to provide a framework for the support of cultural and sporting activities in Britain. It is not there to run them. The system of using arms length bodies, such as the Arts Council, to make the detailed allocations should be kept. Equally, on broadcasting Mr Mellor has time to examine all the possibilities for the future well ahead of the expiry of the BBC's charter in 1996 and to do so without prejudice. For the arts and sports in general he may even provide more money. Government funding of the arts has risen under the Conservatives, but only from 0.15 per cent of general government spending in 1978-79 to 0.19 per cent in 1988-89. That is not enough for the kind of society Mr Major obviously wants.</p>

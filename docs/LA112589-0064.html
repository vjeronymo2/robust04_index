			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND TV;  </P> <P> 'COLUMBO' RETURNS AND SAMMY DAVIS LEADS SUNDAY'S 'HOLLYWOOD CHRISTMAS PARADE'  </P> <P> Peter Falk, Sammy Davis Jr., Walter Cronkite and winners and losers from the  1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul strut their stuff on the small screen as the long  holiday weekend winds down.  </P> <P> Falk returns, trench coat and all, tonight at 9 on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and  42) as America's favorite rumpled detective in the season premiere of  "Columbo." Falk will reappear periodically this season in rotation with Burt  Reynolds, Jaclyn Smith and Telly Savalas in the "ABC Saturday Mystery."  </P> <P> On Sunday, local viewers can avoid the traffic snarls by staying home and  watching the 58th annual "Hollywood Christmas Parade" at 6 p.m. on Channel 5.  Sammy Davis Jr. is this year's grand marshal. Bob Eubanks and Leeza Gibbons  will host the live telecast.  </P> <P> Sunday night at 9, CBS (Channels 2 and 8) looks back at "Fifty Years of  Television," with clips and highlights from the small screen's first half  century. Walter Cronkite, Carl Reiner, Jane Seymour and Kermit the Frog serve  as emcees for this stroll down memory lane.  </P> <P> Also Sunday at 9 p.m., the Disney Channel offers a series of compelling  memories from the last Summer Games in Bud Greenspan's documentary, "Seoul '88:  16 Days of Glory."  </P> <P> Greenspan's deft ability to capture the moving human stories behind the  magnificent accomplishments of such athletes as Christa Rothenburger, Vladimir  Salnikov, Louise Ritter and Calvin Smith put to shame the commercial-saturated  and superficial live network Olympic coverage to which Americans are  accustomed.  </P> <P> Other weekend shows include:  </P> <P> TODAY: "Youth &amp; the Issues" looks at the rights of crime victims, 7 a.m.  (9). . . .  </P> <P> Lasting impressions is the topic on "Teen Talk," 7:30 a.m. (9). . . .  </P> <P> Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, is interviewed  on "Evans &amp; Novak," 9:30 a.m. and 9:30 p.m. (CNN). . . .  </P> <P> Rep.

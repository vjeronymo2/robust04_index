			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STREET CLOSURE WILL BE STUDIED  </P> <P> Torrance city officials have hired a consultant to complete an environmental  impact report on the proposed closure of Via Valmonte at Torrance's border with  Palos Verdes Estates.  </P> <P> Envicom Corp. will be paid nearly $30,000 to complete the report over the next  five months, said Jeffery Gibson, senior principal planner for Torrance.  </P> <P> Residents of narrow, winding Via Valmonte have complained for years that  commuters cutting through to and from the Palos Verdes Peninsula have turned  their street into a speedway because it is the only residential route that  crosses the border between the two cities.  </P> <P> Similar streets in the neighborhood, which is west of Hawthorne Boulevard, end  in cul-de-sacs, forcing drivers to use either Hawthorne Boulevard or Crenshaw  Boulevard for access to the rest of the South Bay.  </P> <P> City Council members ultimately will vote on whether to close the street once  the environmental report has been completed.  </P></p>

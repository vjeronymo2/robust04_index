			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Lincoln university land deal near The company set up to found Lincolnshire University is about to buy 40 acres of derelict land in central Lincoln from British Rail Property Board. The purchase of land beside the old Roman harbour will be the first big capital expenditure for the first new university to be built in the UK for 25 years. 'We hope to purchase the site within the next month or so,' said Mr David Cook, chief executive of Lincolnshire University Company. Finance to buy a campus site for the university is coming from a grant of Pounds 10m by Lincolnshire County Council and a further grant of Pounds 1m by Lincoln City Council. The two councils are the first subscribers of funds for the university which will open in October 1996. The total cost of setting up the new university is put at Pounds 32m. Mr Paul Hodgkinson, chairman of Simons, the Lincoln-based construction group, who is leading a committee to raise finance, said he hopes to obtain contributions of about Pounds 15m from the private sector. 'We are getting a good response, but we've not yet gone out to a mass audience,' he said. 'We expect to do a lot of work over the Christmas period.' Mr Cook said: 'Fundraising is a discreet dinner party exercise at the moment.' Lincolnshire University Company is preparing an application to the European Commission for financial support. Mr Cook said approaches for derelict land grant are being made to English Partnerships, the new government regeneration agency headed by Lord Walker. The idea for the university came from the Confederation of British Industry which in the late 1980s argued that lack of a university at Lincoln hindered economic development in the county. Plans for a private university along the lines of Buckingham have been abandoned in favour of a joint public-private sector approach. After a beauty contest of educational institutions, Nottingham Trent University was selected to guide the initial academic progress of the new university. Mr Cook said student numbers would grow from 500 in October 1996 to 2,000 in 1998 and 5,000 in the year 2000. The university will draw on US experience where, said Mr Cook, the message is that universities have to be integrated into the community.</p>

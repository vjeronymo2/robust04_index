			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Japan's SDP opposes Korean sanctions Japanese government preparations for possible sanctions against North Korea have provoked strong resistance from the Social Democratic party, the second largest opposition group. Opposition to action against North Korea, voiced over the weekend by Mr Wataru Kubo, the SDP's secretary general, suggests that a United Nations call for sanctions might produce a slow response from Japan, given the unstable state of the minority coalition government. 'The Socialists. . . are against this idea,' he said. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom strategist, has repeatedly warned that Japan will lose international credibility if it fails to make a contribution, commensurate with its economic clout, to solving international crises. The SDP, whose left wing supports the Pyongyang regime, was responding to Japanese press reports that the government offered a 10-point sanctions package to curb cash transfers and stop official visits. The package resulted from a meeting between US and South Korean officials in Washington on Saturday, according to the reports. Government officials in Tokyo refused to comment on details but confirmed that a draft plan had been discussed, following the International Atomic Energy Agency's decision to refer North Korea to the UN Security Council for continuing to frustrate its attempts to inspect nuclear reactors. Japanese government policy, as explained by Mr Koji Kakizawa, the foreign minister, is for a two-stage strategy: a UN resolution warning North Korea, followed by a decision on sanctions. According to Japanese newspapers, the draft includes a complete ban on bilateral trade - including any through third countries - on flights, financial transfers and travel between Japan and North Korea by officials of each side. Stricter immigration controls are also said to be proposed. Japan's stance will be an important influence on the weight of any threat to take sanctions - or the effectiveness of actual measures - because it is North Korea's second largest trade partner after China. Officials believe Beijing is likely to veto any UN sanctions, leaving the US to act outside the aegis of the UN, with Japan and South Korea. But some Japanese commentators as well as politicians said the proposed sanctions would be difficult to implement, illegal and ineffective. Japanese exports to North Korea were Dollars 219.7m (Pounds 146.4m) last year, while imports were Dollars 252.3m, according to the Japan External Trade Organisation. On top of this, North Koreans living in Japan carry an estimated Dollars 600m annually back to their home country. For this reason, the package also includes curbs on cash that North Korean immigrants may carry with them on home visits.</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SLIDE CLOSES OLD COAST HIGHWAY  </P> <P> A landslide this morning toppled 150 cubic yards of dirt onto the two  northbound lanes of Old Coast Highway in Capistrano Beach, closing both lanes  to traffic.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol said no one was injured in the 8:40 a.m. slide at  Palisades Road, but the dirt covered the 24-foot width of the two lanes and  some of the shoulder road.  </P> <P> A CHP officer in San Juan Capistrano said landslides at that site are not  uncommon. "It's not a very solid hillside. It's mostly clay and loosely packed  dirt that can give at any time," he said. "There are railroad tracks down  there, and they're always vibrating that area."  </P> <P> CHP and San Clemente police officers diverted drivers along a two-mile stretch  of the highway from Palisades Road to Camino Capistrano. Workers were expected  to have the dirt removed by the afternoon.  </P></p>

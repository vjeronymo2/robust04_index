			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Chirac Takes Seat on Defense </F> Committee"]    [Text] Jacques Chirac returned to his seat on the  Parliamentary Defense Committee, which he has belonged to since  the start of this legislative term but which he recently left to  join the Cultural, Social, and Family Affairs Committee. The  return of the Rally for the Republic [RPR] deputy for the  Correze region to the Defense Committee -- which is chaired by  Jacques Boyon (RPR, Ain) -- comes at a time when Parliament is  getting ready to examine the draft military planning law for  1995-2000.    After being submitted to the president of the Republic at  the  last meeting of the Defense Council on Wednesday 6 April, the  document is currently at the State Council stage. It will then  be presented to cabinet on 20 April before being publicly  debated in the National Assembly in mid-May. Mr. Chirac is to  be the RPR spokesman in this debate in which the opinion of the  majority may be split along several different lines.    Another notable change was the April 2 departure of Pierre  Lellouche (RPR, Val de l'Oise) for the Judiciary Committee,  after having bid in vain for chairmanship of the Defense  Committee.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Labour attacks BR 'anomalies' The first few weeks since the breakup of British Rail have brought higher ticket prices, cuts in services and a reduction in the amount of information available to travellers, Labour said yesterday. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said that a round-up of complaints by passengers to regional rail users' consultative committees revealed evidence that companies were pricing some lines out of existence, reducing passengers' choice of journey routes and ceasing to recognise each others' tickets. BR said there had been some 'anomalies' following the introduction of the new timetables last month, but that these had been put right. Some train operators had published maps which did not show services provided by competitors but this had been rectified. Labour also published a copy of a leaked letter from Mr John Welsby, BR chief executive, to Mr Roger Salmon, the railway franchising director. It stated that the draft franchise agreement drawn up by Mr Salmon, which will set the general framework for agreements between Mr Salmon and the train operators, was unduly rigid and would create problems for operators. The letter, written in March and confirmed as genuine by BR, claimed that the draft agreement left little room for commercial innovation. It also called for greater flexibility for train operators in altering their timetables. The rail regulator's office said the letter was only a first draft.</p>

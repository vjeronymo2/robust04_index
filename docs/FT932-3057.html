			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / People: C and W veterans prolong their stay Two Cable and Wireless directors, 54-year-old Brian Pemberton and 57-year-old Tom Chellew, who between them have clocked up 58 years at the telecommunications group chaired by Lord Young, are retiring in July, but both will retain consultancy roles on a renewable annual basis. Their continuing association with C and W contrasts with the departure in early 1992 of Peter van Cuylenburg who saw his hopes of becoming chief executive dashed when James Ross was brought in from BP. Pemberton, who joined the company in 1957, was responsible for restructuring the Hong Kong business during the 1980's. He had seemed a possible successor to Sir Eric Sharp as chief executive, but was eclipsed by Gordon Owen, who then resigned after a power struggle on the arrival of Lord Young. There is no suggestion of any continuing rankle, however, and after the arrival of Ross, Pemberton had been made international director, encompassing C and W's international network and the marine division as well as North America and Australia. The regional responsibilities of Chellew, meanwhile, tended to prompt the question from envious colleagues as to what he did for his holidays. On joining C and W in 1971, his expertise was the Caribbean; after the Ross reshuffle he looked after the Indian Ocean, Africa and the Middle East, and the Pacific Islands in addition to the Caribbean. As Pemberton and Chellew will not be replaced, the top management team will now consist of five executive and five non-executive directors in addition to the executive chairman Lord Young. C and W was unable to specify how much time each departing director would continue to devote to the company. However, both remain on a number of subsidiary boards in their areas of expertise - Pemberton for the Asia Pacific region and Chellew for the Caribbean. Nor are they quite the last of the old C and W hands, despite the considerable changes in management wrought since the arrival of Lord Young. Mike Gale joined the company in 1959.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: German bonds recover from early setback GERMAN government bond prices fell following the release of disappointing German money supply figures for July, but the market later picked up as the Bundesbank Council decided to leave interest rates unchanged at its meeting. The eagerly-awaited figures showed that M3 money supply grew by 8.6 per cent in July, down from 8.7 per cent in June. The bund market had hoped for a more marked slowdown in money supply growth. Dealers reported good demand for long-dated bunds later in the day, with some outright buying and lengthening trades leading to a further inversion of the yield curve. The Liffe bund futures contract broke through the 87.88 support level to close at around 87.92. The bund market ended up about a quarter of a point, with the French-German 10-year bond spread widening from 104 basis points to 109 basis points. French government bonds ended flat or slightly lower as Wednesday's opinion poll results on the Maastricht Treaty cast some gloom over the market. Recent polls have shown a deterioration in the 'yes' vote while a substantial proportion of voters remain undecided. The French Treasury held its monthly auction yesterday, selling FFr5.05bn of two-year notes and FFr6.6bn of five-year notes. CANADIAN government bonds rallied strongly after progress on constitutional reform prompted a wave of buying interest. By the end of European trading, Canadian bonds were  1/2 point up on Wednesday's close in Canada, having come off earlier highs in volatile trading. A stronger Canadian dollar encouraged foreign investors, who led the rally, according to dealers. The agreement in principle between the provinces, including Quebec, and the government on the formation of a representative Canadian senate sparked hopes that constitutional reform is at last under way. The 8 1/2 per cent Government of Canada bonds due 2002 were quoted at 109.15, to yield 7.16 per cent, at the end of European trading, up from 108.64 at the previous close. The spread between Canadian bonds and US Treasuries tightened by 11 basis points to 69 basis points. US TREASURY prices were little changed at both ends of the market yesterday as dealers and investors traded cautiously before President Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican convention. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/32 at 99 7/32 , yielding 7.309 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 100 7/16 , to carry a yield of 3.996 per cent. For the past week the market has been unsettled by rumours that the President would unveil tax cuts in his acceptance speech. Bond investors fear tax cuts because, if they are not accompanied by big spending cuts, they widen the budget deficit, and possibly revive inflationary pressures. JAPANESE government bonds closed lower as a rebound in the Tokyo stock market prompted a wave of profit-taking. The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 4.705 per cent and reached 4.66 per cent on hopes of a cut in interest rates. However, investors took profits and the No 129 closed with a yield of 4.73 per cent in Tokyo, moving to 4.74 per cent in London trading. The Nikkei stock index ended 617.02 points higher at 15,267.76, closing above the psychologically important 15,000 level for the first time in eight sessions. The bond market has rallied strongly in recent weeks as the drop in stock prices raised hopes of a further easing in monetary policy. UK government bonds ended an active trading session only slightly firmer as sterling weakness limited the market's gains. The 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 edged up from 115 19/32 at the opening to 115 by late afternoon to yield 9.35 per cent while short-dated gilts ended little changed. Volumes in the futures market were relatively high with about 35,000 contracts traded. The Liffe gilt futures contract slipped from 97.24 to 97.20 by late afternoon.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Fokus Bank in profit and plans to raise NKr1bn Fokus Bank, Norway's third biggest commercial bank, has returned to the black with net profits of NKr260m (Dollars 35m) in 1993 against losses of NKr937.2m in the previous year. The bank also disclosed plans to raise up to NKr1bn in fresh equity capital. Crippled by massive losses, Fokus collapsed into the hands of the state in 1991 during Norway's biggest banking crisis since world war two which also saw Den norske Bank and Christiania Bank, the country's two biggest commercial banks, also forced to rely on state cash-injections to avoid insolvency. Fokus said that 1993 was the first year it had achieved a full-year profit since 1989 when net profits were NKr165m. Mr Leif Klevan, group managing director, said he had presented a capital expansion plan to the bank's board in which Fokus would seek to raise up to NKr500m through the issue of new shares and another NKr500m in the form of subordinated loans in domestic and foreign capital markets.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIXON'S BIG DAY: 'IT'S ONE . . . WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER'  </P> <P> The text of Richard M. Nixon's speech at the dedication of his library and  birthplace:  </P> <P> Thank you. Well, Mr. President (Bush), may I express my deep appreciation for  that much too generous introduction. Over the past 44 years since I've been in  public life, I have been introduced to literally thousands of audiences all  over the world. This is the first time I've ever been introduced by the  President of the United States. May I express my appreciation to my other  colleagues, former Presidents, for their gracious comments, not only about me,  but particularly about my wife, Pat. This is a very special day for us.  </P> <P> And I think I speak for all of those in this great audience today in expressing  appreciation not only to President Bush and Barbara Bush, but also to President  Ford and President Reagan and their ladies, that they are here today. This is a  very special occasion because there are four Presidents here. But what makes it  even more special is that for the first time in the inauguration of a library,  four First Ladies are here.  </P> <P> I think all of my colleagues would agree that there is no more important a  position or a career that a woman could have than to be a First Lady, the wife  of the President of the United States. Or as First Lady Barbara Bush might put  it, in the future, there could be no more important career for a man than to be  a husband of the President of the United States.  </P> <P> And I want to express appreciation to all of you who have made this facility  possible, and to all of you who have come on this day to participate in this  ceremony with us. It's been a great day for us, and it's one that we will  always remember.  </P> <P> Over the past years, Pat and I have had the opportunity to visit some wonderful  places. We've been to Versailles, we've been to Westminster, to the Kremlin, to  the Great Wall of China, to Angkor Wat in Cambodia. I must say that many of  them were memorable experiences, all of them were, in fact. But nothing we have  ever seen matches this moment, to be welcomed home again so warmly on this day  by our friends in California.  </P> <P> I hope all of you will have an opportunity to take a tour of the library, and I  hope that you will share some of the things that my colleagues, the former  Presidents and President Bush, have referred to. What you will see, among other  things, is a personal life: the influence of a strong family, of inspirational  ministers, of great teachers. You will see a political life, running for  Congress, running for the Senate, running for governor, running for President  -- three times. Won some, lost some, all interesting.  </P> <P> And you will see also, the life of a great nation, 77 years of it, a period in  which we had unprecedented progress for the United States. And you will see  great leaders, leaders who changed the world, who helped to make the world what  we have today.  </P> <P> Seeing those things will certainly be interesting, but let me remind you that  when you go through this library, I hope you will remember that while the past  is interesting, it is important only insofar as it points the way to a better  future. And that is why we are here today, to talk about that better future.  </P> <P> As I look back over life, I can think what has happened in the years since I  was born in this little house, 71 years ago. I have many memories, some of them  good, some of them not so good. But I do know that as far as that life is  concerned, I am glad that I had the opportunity to come from here and go as far  as I have.  </P> <P> Let me say that as far as the past is concerned, though, remember, what is  important is what it tells us about the future. My friend, Paul McCracken, from  the University of Michigan, sent me a little poem that graphically makes that  point. He said, "The lightning bug is brilliant, but it doesn't have a mind. It  travels through creation with its headlight on behind." And so as far as we're  concerned, let us learn from the past, but let us always keep our headlight on  the road ahead.  </P> <P> Looking back over the years, when I think of what has happened in those 70  years, those 77 years, I remember that 70 years ago in that little house, I  used to lie in bed. I'd hear a train whistle in the middle of the night, and I  would dream of places far away that I'd hoped to visit someday. I never dreamed  that I would ever have the opportunity to visit over 80 countries during the  period of my lifetime.  </P> <P> And I must say that as far as those visits are concerned, they taught me  something. You will hear sometimes, these days, that the United States is in  decline, that we've seen our best days. You will hear that the United States no  longer has the means or the will to play a great role in the world. Don't you  believe it. I can tell you what I have found in my travels. In my travels to  other countries, I have found some people who like us. I have found some people  who envy us. I have found some people who hate us. But most of the people in  the world know in their hearts that without the leadership of the United States  of America, peace and freedom would not survive in the world.  </P> <P> And it is our privilege to provide that leadership. And that is why I would  trust that all of you here, and all of you listening on television and radio,  would give President Bush your wholehearted support as he works for that kind  of leadership for the United States of America.  </P> <P> This is not a burden to be borne grimly, but it's a great challenge. Look at  what the challenge is. I was born a year before World War I began, and in my  lifetime, more people were killed in wars than in all the wars fought in the  history of civilization before the 20th Century began. Our challenge today is  looking ahead to deal with that problem. The 20th Century will be remembered as  a century of war. Our challenge is to help make the 21st Century a century of  peace.  </P> <P> But peace is not our only goal. Our goal also is to remember why we are here,  what America really means to the world. And so as we consider our challenges  beyond peace, let history record that we just did not save the world from  communism, but that we helped to make the world safe for freedom. That is the  great challenge for Americans today.  </P> <P> Let our goal be that all people in the world can enjoy what most Americans  enjoy, the blessings of freedom, of justice, of progress. That was a dream that  was impossible in times past, but because of recent developments, it is a dream  that can now come true. And so with this challenge in mind, let us look also to  where we have been, and where we are going.  </P> <P> As I look back on those years, 77 in all, and I remember that in the period of  that time, that I have seen many things happen in the world. And I know that as  I stand here, that we are very fortunate as Americans, to have played a role in  what has happened.  </P> <P> In 1971, after a White House state dinner, a splendid musical group from  California entertained the audience. At the conclusion of the program, the  chairman, or I should say, the leader of the group, asked to say a few words.  He expressed appreciation for being invited to appear at the White House. And  then he concluded by saying, "You know, it's a long way from Watts to the White  House." He was right, but let me tell you, it's a long way from Yorba Linda to  the White House too.  </P> <P> I have made that journey, and I want to see a country in which every young  American can have the opportunity to make that journey. It doesn't mean that  all will make it. We all can't be President. We all can't be congressmen, or  senators, or governors -- I found that out. But on the other hand, let us  always make sure for the young Americans that the road ahead is never blocked  by prejudice, or ignorance, or poverty. And that he or she can go as hard as  his or her talents will take them. That is the goal we want for young Americans  today.  </P> <P> And because there are so many young people here today, may I add a word to you.  I believe in the American Dream because I have seen it come true in my own  life. And I want you to know that as far as you're concerned, I want your  dreams to come true as well. You will suffer disappointments in life, and  sometimes you will be very discouraged. It is sad to lose, but the greatest  sadness is to travel through life without knowing either victory or defeat.  Always remember that only when during your lifetime you are involved in a cause  greater than yourself, can you be truly true to yourself.  </P> <P> And so with those points in mind, may I leave also this final thought. Remember  that there couldn't be a better time to be alive than now. There couldn't be a  better country in which to be born and in which to live, than now, because you  hold the future in your hands.  </P></p>

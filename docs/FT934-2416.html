			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities The new rules allowing a five-day delay in publicising large UK equity trades, introduced yesterday, are the stock exchange's latest effort to balance the interests of market makers with the overriding need for transparency. Publication of all bargains within five minutes, introduced after Big Bang, was considered too tight and discouraged market makers from dealing in large blocks of shares. Yet the 24-hour delay in publication of large trades, allowed after 1989, fell foul of the Office of Fair Trading. The 90-minute delay allowed until yesterday satisfied the regulators, but still left the market makers unhappy. It is a fair bet that the new rules will not last long. The maximum five-day delay is generous, but the stock exchange has defined a large trade more narrowly than before. On average, less than 100 bargains a day meet the new criteria, of which only a handful typically involve FT-SE 100 stocks. Even so, any erosion of transparency creates problems of its own. Equity options traders might feel themselves at a disadvantage to market makers in the cash stock. The proof of the pudding will be whether the rules increase the number of block trades and thus improve liquidity, especially in smaller company shares. Still, the criteria for judging success has been left worryingly vague. The regulators would do well to make sure that marginal improvements in liquidity are not being bought with significant losses of transparency.</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACE FOR THE EXITS  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is accelerating the withdrawal of the last 20,000 troops that  it still has in Afghanistan, raising the possibility that its pullout could be  completed before the deadline set for Feb. 15. The Russians, though, aren't the  only foreigners running for the exits. The United States, the major Western  European countries and Japan have told their diplomats and other nationals to  go, and quickly. Afghan officials profess to see in these departures a plot to  destabilize the Communist regime that will be left to fend for itself after the  last Soviet soldier has gone home. It is not sinister political design that  motivates this exodus, however, but the well-founded fear that anarchy and  civil war are about to descend on the country, leaving everyone -- Afghan or  foreigner -- exposed and at risk.  </P> <P> The rebellion mounted by the Afghans against Soviet occupation eight years ago  and now apparently about to be turned in full fury against the Soviet-backed  regime in Kabul is unlike any in recent memory. It is a rebellion without a  unifying and centralized leadership, lacking in common goals (except a virulent  opposition to Marxism), torn by competing personal ambitions and bitter tribal  feuds. There are a half-dozen major resistance groups operating out of  Pakistan, where several million Afghans live as refugees. There are other,  lesser-known armed units that draw their support from Iran, where hundreds of  thousands of Afghans have also found haven. Still other bands that are little  more than criminal gangs are believed ready to emerge from mountain valleys and  urban alleyways to seize their part of the spoils.  </P> <P> An Afghan historian was asked the other day why Soviet forces so clearly on  their way out of the country continue to be attacked, inviting terrible  retribution in return. Ours, he said simply, is a culture of vengeance. That  driving compulsion to settle scores and satisfy honor may be as old as the  habitation of Afghanistan itself. Darius the Great and his Persian conquerors  probably felt it 2,500 years ago; a lot of Afghans, and not just those who  cooperated with the Soviets, probably are about to feel it now. If the great  political fear in Lebanon is that irreconcilable religious animosities have led  to the de facto cantonization of the country, the great political fear in  Afghanistan must be that what is about to happen there could make Lebanon look  like a picnic.  </P> <P> In these conditions it is only prudent for foreigners to get out of the way, at  least until clear signs emerge that some degree of order and security exists.  Millions of Afghans, unhappily, do not have that same chance.  </P></p>

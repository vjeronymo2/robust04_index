			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Observer: A minor omission When John Tusa, the new president of Wolfson College, Cambridge, stepped down after six years running the BBC World Service, there was mild surprise in some quarters that he did not get even a minor mention in the Queen's birthday honours list. After all he left the World Service in better shape than he inherited it. However, this oversight is nothing compared with his latest humiliation in the BBC annual report. Four retiring governors are thanked for their 'distinguished' service and there is a decent mention for Johnny Beerling, the former controller of Radio One. But Tusa, who introduced some pretty radical changes at the World Service, is relegated to a footnote listing the outgoing members of the board of management. Yesterday BBC chairman Marmaduke Hussey tried to make amends. He sent his chauffeur to deliver a note to Tusa, who had been presenting the BBC TV lunchtime news, apologising for 'the regrettable oversight'. Surely the 'oversight' could not have had anything to do with the fact that Tusa had let it be known that he was never given the chance to apply for the director general's job at the BBC? He was a firm favourite of the staff, which possibly explains why the chairman didn't love him.</p>

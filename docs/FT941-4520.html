			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control Systems (13): Choosing from a privileged position - Financial consolidation at ICL ICL, the UK-based computer company in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake, had inside knowledge of the software market when looking for ways of improving its worldwide financial control, but it didn't have all the answers. Now its directors do - and within five days of business completion The international computer company, ICL, is still involved in a continuing evaluation of the packages it is using for financial control, writes Claire Gooding. Even before its acquisition by Fujitsu, ICL was changing its direction and becoming a supplier of computer services rather than hardware. Even so, its restructuring into 26 businesses worldwide brought exactly the kind of problem it seeks to solve for its own clients: a move away from proprietary software to something less costly to maintain, and more flexible to use, which would be a single, integrated worldwide solution. 'We were trying to resolve the problem of creating separate autonomous businesses,' explains Cornel Wight, the strategist and manager of financial systems whose job it was to assess ICL's financial and commercial infrastructure across the world. ICL wanted tools its various national offices could use to develop local systems in their own language. 'As well as reporting to the headquarters on a monthly basis, the right tools had to meet fiscal requirements,' says Mr Wight. 'With 80 sites around the world, each has its own culture. We wanted a solution that would suit their own local needs, timetable, and structure, and minimum requirements for management reporting.' The computer company already had its own proprietary software, but it didn't meet the 'time zone' problems, and because it was centrally-driven, people were deserting in droves to use spreadsheets. ICL was in a privileged position in having inside knowledge of some well-established packages, including executive information systems from Planning Sciences and Comshare, and accounting packages with 'EIS-like' extensions, such as Tetra's Chameleon. But although ICL spread its net wide, the choice was limited by two factors: First, the data had to be 'dynamic,' and not contained in a separate database, so that businesses could report to the managing director on the same day. Secondly, the software had to work with many different 'inherited' packages in use in various businesses and acquisitions, such as Nokia. The choice was narrowed to two of the best-known consolidation packages, from IMRS and Comshare. 'The key was that the IMRS packages were friendly for the account managers and had a neat separation of the consolidation and the reporting functions. There was also a high 'comfort factor' in working with the company, and the user-endorsements were very convincing,' adds Mr Wight. ICL implemented the IMRS Micro Control consolidation and reporting system with Hyperion, its Windows-based companion, and the OnTrack graphical reporting module. The initial contract was worth around Pounds 1m, with installation taking place across local area networks and PCs in ICL companies worldwide. An in-house 'hit team' implemented the software to ICL standards and culture at each site. Mr Wight's team had been working for some time to reduce the completion time for accounts - 'now, without fail, we are meeting our five-day requirement between closing the books and reporting to group. It also facilitates budgeting and forecasting, because people are familiar with the spreadsheet format. 'We wanted to capitalise on the all the various models and techniques that people had built up, without any re-keying of data. Their data is automatically imported into Micro Control.' It is the product's ability to present different faces to different groups of users that most appeals to Cornel Wight's users - 'friendliness is at appropriate levels: 'point and shoot' for managers, ledger-like for accountants. Early users report that they are halving their costs: that's significant when spending around Pounds 1m annually on reporting.' Micro Control This product, currently on release 3.5, was launched in 1987 as a DOS-based data collection, data collection, consolidation and reporting system. Other IMRS products are OnTrack, launched 1991, described as visual information access, (EIS reporting), and Hyperion, launched 1993, claimed to be the the world's first Microsoft Windows-based enterprise-wide financial control tool. Users: there are 1,300 corporate headquarters, with thousands of reporting-locations worldwide. Supplier: IMRS, founded in the US in 1981; UK operations launched in 1987. IMRS common stock is traded in the NASDAQ National Market System under the symbol IMRS. Price: a corporate site licence starts at Pounds 60,000; maintenance is charged at 15 per cent of initial sale after one year. User views include: 'Stable, robust software, auto-link with Lotus and Excel; integration of IMRS databases; computer-based training; easy to install.'

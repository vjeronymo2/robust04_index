			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Fee commissions help lift BBV 6.4% at half-time BANCO BILBAO Vizcaya, the Spanish retail bank which has a large industrial portfolio, yesterday reported first-half net profits of Pta44.6bn (Dollars 327m), a 6.4 per cent increase on the first six months of last year. The result was achieved despite a 26.5 per cent drop in extraordinary income through disposals. The strong performance was based on a sharp increase in fee commissions, which included income earned in currency operations and trading in Spanish government debt, a market in which BBV is a large participant. The BBV group, which has aggressively recovered non-performing loans, pushed its operating profits, based on financial products, up by 16.4 per cent to Pta53.9 per cent. The bank raised its net provisions by 28.7 per cent to Pta25.5bn. Banco de Santander, the Spanish banking group, yesterday launched a Pta13.5bn mortgage securitisation bond, the first of its kind in Spain. The instrument, which will have an average life of 5.6 years, carries a 10.25 per cent coupon, paid every six months, and is open to both institutional investors and the retail market. In May Santander, which has a low mortgage market quota, broke into the sector when it offered sharp rate cuts to home buyers with an offer of 12-year mortgages at 11.50 per cent.</p>

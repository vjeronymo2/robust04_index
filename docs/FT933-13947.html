			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Rank pays year's dividend at interim THE Rank Organisation, which includes Odeon cinemas, bingo clubs and Hard Rock Cafes, yesterday reported a near fivefold increase in first-half profits. The pre-tax figure rose from a restated Pounds 19.8m to Pounds 95.7m. Rank said it would pay the full-year dividend at the interim stage, with an enhanced share alternative. The proposed interim dividend of 31p was equal to last year's total payout and equivalent to what it would have recommended for the whole of this year. Shareholders have the alternative of receiving new shares to a value of 46.5p per existing ordinary share. BZW has offered a cash alternative of 46.035p. If all shareholders take up the share alternative, Rank will save Pounds 96m on dividends and a further Pounds 27.8m of advance corporation tax. Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, said that while trading in the US had improved, there were now signs that recovery there was slowing. He said that UK consumers divided into three groups. Those unmarried and under 25 were spending more in the group's discotheques and cinemas. Those in the 25 to 50 age group with children had benefited from reduced mortgage payments and were prepared to spend more. This group had become increasingly price conscious, however, looking for bargains and being prepared occasionally to accept lower quality. Pensioners, the third group, had seen income from savings fall as interest rates dropped, and were spending less. This had adversely affected Shearings coach holidays. Mr Gifford indicated that there was no early prospect of the group disposing of its stake in the Rank Xerox copying business, but the matter was under constant review. Rank Xerox's contribution to Rank's pre-tax profit fell to Pounds 68.5m, from Pounds 71.7m. Mr Gifford said: 'There's almost nothing we haven't considered. Of course we've considered what would happen were we and Xerox to reach a deal on our stake, but I wouldn't get excited.' He said the group had sold the White House Hotel in London for just under Pounds 26m to Alvin Consultants, a UK-based company. Lex, Page 16; Details, Page 18</p>

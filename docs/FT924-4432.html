			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Write-downs leave Trafalgar below City expectations MR ALLAN GORMLY, the new chief executive of Trafalgar House, said there was an element of clearing the decks before reporting yesterday's full-year results. 'We have properly taken a somewhat more conservative view of the accounts as a result of recent management changes. It would have been surprising if we had not looked at this in a different way.' However, while the City expected poor results, the pre-tax loss of Pounds 30.3m for the year ended September 30 was worse than most analysts predicted. Exceptional property write-downs of Pounds 138m were also bigger than expected. Of the total write-down, Pounds 70.7m was charged at operating level, Pounds 46m was reflected in results of associated companies and Pounds 21.3m was included in the interest charge. The loss after taxation rose to Pounds 80.6m because of the substantial advance corporation tax write off of Pounds 40.3m. The group has not been able to make sufficient profits to offset against its ACT. Of the company's gross ACT surplus of Pounds 183.8m to be offset against future UK corporation tax liabilities, Pounds 31.8m has been offset against deferred taxation. Some Pounds 2.7m, arising from the final dividend, is carried as a debtor in the balance sheet and the rest has been written over to the profit and loss account over the past few years. Exceptional write-downs and the ACT write-off reduced shareholders' funds from Pounds 684.6m to Pounds 542.2m. Engineering was the one bright spot. The division's operating profits rose from Pounds 56.9m to Pounds 89.4m on increased sales of Pounds 2.4bn (Pounds 1.5bn). Davy corporation, which Trafalgar took over last year after it ran into severe financial difficulties converting the Emerald producer oil rig, contributed Pounds 30m. Midland and Scottish Resources, the original customer for the rig, is leasing it from Trafalgar for Dollars 65,000 (Pounds 43,000) per day. But MSR had failed to meet purchase conditions for Trafalgar to pay former shareholders in Davy their second takeover payment, totalling Pounds 54m. Overseas orders account for more than 60 per cent of the engineering division's Pounds 2bn order book. The construction division suffered a fall in profits from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 10.1m on reduced sales of Pounds 785.8m (Pounds 928.4m). Profits from shipping and hotels fell from Pounds 36.9m to Pounds 25.3m. The group is still looking for a partner to help it restructure the shipping fleet. Trafalgar said the results should be considered in light of last year's restated pre-tax loss of Pounds 38.5m. See Lex</p>

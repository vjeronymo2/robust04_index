			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER A SEASON OF IMPROVEMENT, THE SUNS ARE SET IN THEIR WEST;  </P> <P> NBA PLAYOFFS: CENTER NOW STAYS CLOSE TO THE BASKET -- AND LEADS THE LEAGUE IN  SHOOTING.  </P> <P> The surname is appropriate, because Mark West knows how important direction and  location have been to his career.  </P> <P> The Phoenix Suns are the fourth team he has played for in the seven years since  he left Old Dominion University. In his first 4 1/2 seasons, he was with Dallas  (34 games), then Milwaukee (11 days) and then Cleveland (until Feb. 25, 1988).  </P> <P> A 6-foot-10 center, he went to Phoenix from Cleveland in a trade that also  brought Kevin Johnson to the Suns.  </P> <P> The trade, along with the signing of free agent Tom Chambers, helped put the  Suns among the NBA elite. Except that West was not the centerpiece.  </P> <P> Johnson has developed, but West has improved beyond expectation. No one  mentions his name among the best big men of the game, but certainly he makes a  difference inside. The Suns' first-round series victory over Utah bears that  out.  </P> <P> Game 1: Seven rebounds, four points.  </P> <P> Game 2: 14 points, 21 rebounds to tie a club record for a playoff game.  </P> <P> Game 3: 18 points, 10 rebounds.  </P> <P> Game 4: Six points, 11 rebounds, five blocked shots.  </P> <P> Game 5: Six points, 11 rebounds, five blocked shots.  </P> <P> "Obviously he made a difference in this series," said Utah's Karl Malone, who  spent much of the time battling West. "He's one of those guys who just keeps  working and working. You can say what you want to, but he was probably the key  to their series."  </P> <P> The Suns, who open a best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series against  the Lakers at the Forum tonight, have more prominent players, such as Chambers,  Johnson and Jeff Hornacek. Why doesn't West receive more acclaim?  </P> <P> "I get a pay check," West said. "That's credit enough."  </P> <P> Phoenix Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons won't leave it at that.  </P> <P> "Everyone talks about Hornacek being our most improved player, but he is the  most underrated. The most improved player is Mark West, because he had so far  to come. Mark West wasn't a basketball player before. Now he is.  </P> <P> "He has made strides every year. A year ago, we never would have thought about  getting him to the basket this much. Now, we go to him as much as possible."  </P> <P> The key is location -- never more than five feet away from the basket. The  simple strategy of knowing his range is unspectacular -- but successful beyond  what anyone could have imagined.  </P> <P> Check out the league leaders in field goal percentage: Charles Barkley, Robert  Parish, Malone -- all behind Mark West. His mark of 62.5% is the best since  Steve Johnson shot 63.2% for San Antonio in 1985-86.  </P> <P> "I don't think that's something I'm concerned with a lot, how far I've come,"  said West, who began the season as a 56.5% career shooter. "I always just try  to be better than the year before and better than the day before. The biggest  thing is that I'm helping the team now on offense, not hurting them."  </P> <P> The only Sun to play all 82 games, West also finished eighth in the league in  blocked shots, averaging 2.24, and 17th in rebounding at 8.9. But the numbers  he would rather talk about are his worst.  </P> <P> His 69.1% free-throw accuracy, atrocious by some standards, was his career  high.  </P> <P> "When you improve to 69%, you know you had to be bad," West said, shaking his  head and smiling. "If that's improvement, you know the depths where I've come  from."  </P> <P> In his 34 games as a rookie with the Bucks, he shot 31.8%. The next season, in  66 games with Milwaukee and Cleveland, 49.4%. For the next five seasons, he  remained in the 50% range.  </P> <P> West credits Johnson, a close friend, for helping him with free throws. The two  shot for hours a day during the most recent off-season in Phoenix, but Johnson  would only count as good the shots that had enough arc. Johnson was the judge  on that, too.  </P> <P> As a result, West's free-throw shooting has improved. As has his entire game.  </P></p>

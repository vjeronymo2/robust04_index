			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Leading Article: The challenge for legal reformers THE WEARING of wigs in court is, according to Lord Hailsham, the former Lord Chancellor, a matter of the utmost unimportance. More fairly, it might be said that in deciding to consult judges on the matter, Lord Taylor, the new Lord Chief Justice, has made a symbolic gesture towards more open and user-friendly justice. But it is no more than that. Lord Taylor will need to go much further. A series of damaging miscarriages of justice has shaken public confidence in the courts and the judiciary. A great deal is expected of him in restoring that confidence, but the task will not be easy. First, he is unable to wipe the slate clean and start afresh. One of his first tasks will be to hear the appeal of Miss Judith Ward, whose conviction for the 1974 M62 coach bombing is now widely regarded as unsafe. There are other alleged miscarriages of justice in the pipeline, all likely to reinforce disquiet with the system. Second, there is a limit to what the Lord Chief Justice can achieve on his own. Ranked second to the Lord Chancellor in the judicial hierarchy, his primary responsibilities are to run the criminal courts and communicate with judges and magistrates. Most of his time will be spent presiding over the Criminal Division of the Appeal Court, but he also sits occasionally as a trial judge. His main sphere of influence lies in formulating sentencing guidelines. Britain imprisons more people per capita than any other western European state. Radical sentencing reform is needed to reduce pressure on the UK's old and decaying prison system. Lord Taylor must convince judges and magistrates of the wisdom of avoiding custodial sentences in most cases where the offender poses no threat to the public. Out of touch There are other areas where he can have an influence. If he is serious about accessible justice he could persuade judges to provide short summaries of their judgments in language which can readily be understood by the public. If he senses judges are out of touch, he could initiate research to find out why. He should stand up for the jury system and the defendant's right to silence. In other areas, Lord Taylor will need to co-operate more closely with government than his predecessor did. As one of the Lord Chancellor's closest advisers on judicial appointments he could actively promote the appointment of more women and ethnic minority judges. And he could encourage the Home Office to set up a sentencing council to establish a more consistent approach. Unfortunately he appears unwilling to use his position in this way  -at a press conference on the day of his appointment he mounted a strong defence of the status quo. Already there are signs that, like his predecessor, he is in danger of distancing himself from the politicians in the superficial belief that this will bolster judicial independence. Public confidence Further changes at the top of the judiciary may strengthen the hand of the reformers. Lord Donaldson, Master of the Rolls and Britain's senior civil court judge, is expected to retire in July. Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor may also step down in the autumn. Their replacement by judges as committed to restoring public confidence in the system as Lord Taylor professes to be could provide the climate for more radical change. Changes of this sort are essential if the ground is to be well prepared for next year's report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, which will also cover matters such as legal aid, the police and the prison service which lie outside the control of the judiciary. The government, which has a disappointing record on law and order, will also need to give a strong lead. The new home secretary, Mr Kenneth Clarke, has demonstrated his ability to take on the vested interests of teachers and the health professionals, and may now repeat the exercise with the police and prison service. If he were to use his influence to promote reform of the judiciary and courts, the newly appointed leaders of the judiciary would be hard pressed to oppose it in the way the old-guard turned their face against Lord Mackay's reforms of the legal profession.</p>

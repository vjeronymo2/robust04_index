The usual tolerance of the people of Vesterbro toward the  numerous drug addicts with whom they share their streets,  alleys, and even their stairways and back yards, is beginning to  fall apart. As a result, the people are demanding more places of  asylum for drug addicts, more outreach, more treatment centers,  and more recreational facilities for the area's children, so  that they do not turn to drugs.    But the people of Vesterbro are also tired of having their  neighborhood be a magnet for drug addicts from all other parts  of town. The other sections of Copenhagen and the rest of the  country must be obligated to make their own effort to stop  exporting their drug addicts to Vesterbro, many people said.    Although snow wrapped the neighborhood in a dense white  haze,  many people attended the hearing at the Vesterbro House of  Culture.    Leo Lorke from the police stressed the need for better  cooperation among the many entities that are working with drug  addicts. Ole Hansgaard and Niels Christense, representing the  drug addicts of Vesterbro, called for greater tolerance. ``Even  though we have a serious problem, we are not second-class  people,'' they said.    Physician Karsten Chr. Hansen called for better treatment  for  drug addicts. ``All too often, drug addicts have been singled  out and given special treatment in a negative sense. If we are  to make progress, drug addicts must be seen as people like us,  with individual needs.''    The goal of the hearing was to create a dialog among the  various sides, which it did. Now their demands are being sent to  the politicians at Christiansborg [parliament building].</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Maddox auditors express doubt about sale proceeds DOUBT HAS been cast on the value of Pounds 15.1m in bonds received by Maddox Group, the computer maintenance company, when it sold two cable businesses earlier this year. Ernst &amp; Young, the company's auditors, said there was a 'fundamental uncertainty' over being able to recover the Pounds 15.1m in full. However, Mr Hugo Biermann, Maddox chairman, was confident of converting Pounds 2m of bonds into equity each year after the cable companies are floated in New York later this year. The auditors added that a Pounds 680,000 paper profit from the sale be included in the accounts as deferred income. Mr Biermann hoped the amount would be written back into the p&amp;l account once it was established that there were no problems with the business.</p>

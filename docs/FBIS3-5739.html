He urged Watanabe to use his political  influence to help Cambodia get SDF assistance, Japanese  officials said.    Watanabe, however, said it would be difficult to realize  such  a project as the Japanese Constitution allows SDF dispatch  abroad only for United Nations peacekeeping operations.    Hun Sen suggested the experts could also be retired SDF  personnel, the officials added.    Hun Sen and his co-premier Norodom Ranariddh, who are  currently in Japan to attend an international conference on  assistance for Cambodia's reconstruction, met Watanabe at a  Tokyo hotel.</p>

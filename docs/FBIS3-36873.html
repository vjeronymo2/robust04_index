			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 27] </F>   [Text] Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich said his  Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin "will arrive in Minsk no  later than next week." Kebich pointed out that "there should be  no question of the exchange rate of the Belarusian and Russian  currencies until the interstate agreement is signed."    The rate of exchange of Belarusian rubles and the timeliness  of the changeover are the main issues for the two countries'  expert groups to solve, according to the Belarusian prime  minister.    The forthcoming signing of the Russo-Belarusian agreement to  merge the two countries' monetary systems "is of no threat to  the sovereignty of Belarus," Kebich told a meeting of  industrialists in Minsk on Tuesday.    Speaking on the launch of an indefinite political strike in  Belarus, which independent unions scheduled for February 15, the  prime minister described this action as "an attempt to disrupt  the signing of the vital documents on the unification of the  monetary systems of Russia and Belarus."    Meanwhile, according to Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr  Shokhin, the development of the mechanisms aimed at unifying the  two countries' monetary systems is likely to be completed by the  end of February. After this we shall be able to develop our own  approach to the problem, said Shokhin. He believes that the  unification of the monetary systems is only possible if the two  countries' national interests are taken into account.    Sources close to the Russian Cabinet have told Interfax that  Moscow links the possibility of the arrival in Minsk of a  Russian delegation to finalize the monetary-union talks to the  completion of the work by experts on the problem.    A representative of the Russian delegation which recently  returned from Minsk has told Interfax that the Russian side  suggested at the talks the exchange of rubles for belarusian  national coupons in line with the non-cash rate of 1:3, and in  cash 1:1. Belarus insists on the exchange of both cash and  non-cash money at a rate of 1:1.    The chairman of the Duma subcommittee for credit and  monetary  policies, former Russian finance minister Boris Fedorov believes  that Russia's benefits from the two systems unification are  doubtful. If there are any, these are political benefits, he  said.    In an interview with Interfax, Fedorov said that Belarus,  which practically had yet to carry out any free market reforms  and which is now in an energy crisis with an inflation rate of  45% over the past two months, is, no doubt, interested in  receiving the more stable Russian currency. But what is  Russia's benefit, I do not understand, he said.    Fedorov believes that after he stepped down, Yegor Gaydar  left and the speaker of the Belarusian parliament Stanislav  Shushkevich resigned, there are no longer any forces capable of  preventing the hasty unification of the two countries' monetary  systems. He also believes it necessary to investigate the  possible consequences of the unification for Russia and to  discuss the problem at the Duma's planning and budgetary  committee.</p>

Today, considerably more Kaliningrad-bound foreign  ships have started passing through the main base of the Baltic  Fleet, which has made the problem of ensuring safety even more  complex. The Russian Maritime Transportation Department has  recently certified the fact of the creation in Baltiysk of the  oblast's first coastal system of shipping movements. Its base  is the "Okean-SP" coastal radar complex which can automatically  track 55 targets at once.</p>

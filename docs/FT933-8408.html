			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Arts: Armida and Maometto II - Rossini Opera Festival at Pesaro The programmes of the Rossini Opera Festival, though never crammed (like Spoleto, for example), can be counted on to provide welcome variety, usually with an element of surprise. The two operas featured in this year's festival  -which opened this past week and continues until August 22 - represent a relative rarity, Armida, followed by the revival of a successful Pesaro production of some eight years ago, Maometto II, designed and staged by Pier Luigi Pizzi. These productions are complemented by other events: concerts, recitals, lectures, exhibitions, and a two-week course for young artists, sponsored by the Peter Moores Foundation. But, inevitably, attention focuses on the two operas; and this year Armida was awaited with special anticipation. Long neglected, the work was revived in Florence in 1952 for Maria Callas, at the height of her powers, and those unforgotten performances, in the opinion of many music historians, mark the true beginning of the Rossini renaissance, which Pesaro has so intelligently and successfully institutionalised. Armida is one of Rossini's Naples operas, composed for the great soprano (his future wife) Isabella Colbran; and while not merely a star-vehicle, the work certainly requires the presence of a supreme interpreter in the title role. The American singer Rene Fleming is an attractive and gifted artist, but she does not possess star dimensions. In other contexts her lack of vocal sensuality can even be a merit; but in Armida she remained always this side of a full embodiment of the towering part, the only female character. She was more than adequately supported, though her Rinaldo, the tenor Gregory Kunde, was more bouncy than heroic, and his occasional high notes blasted forth, true but unappealing. Of the six tenors in the cast, the most enjoyable were perhaps Jorio Zennaro and Bruce Fowler, whose charming duet opens the last act. The orchestra and chorus from the Teatro Comunale, Bologna, were not in their best form. The winds were especially aberrant; the chorus lacked impact. Daniele Gatti conducted accurately and soberly, though without bite, occasionally indulging the singers more than advisable. But even Callas, even Colbran would have had a hard time overcoming the handicap of the Luca Ronconi production (indeed, it is doubtful whether either of those firm-minded women would have tolerated it). Ronconi evidently decided that, despite its definition as a dramma, and despite the fact that it was written for a great tragedienne, Armida is full of laughs. In the first act, the stage of the Teatro Rossini was turned into a Middle Eastern desert complete with ruins and the male chorus in Beau Geste, Foreign Legion costumes. There was a good deal of clowning, indicating that the sorceress Armida's magic lay entirely in her sex-appeal. To underline the pin-up characterisation, Miss Fleming was made to wear a dress worthy of Adrian or Edith Head and a ridiculous blond ziggurat of hair that even Mae West would have thought vulgar. The last two acts of the opera, in which Armida gives free rein to her sorcery (and Rossini to his), comprise some of the composer's most sensitive and imaginative pages. With Ronconi's tacky staging - Tasso's garden of delights was a black backdrop with the seductive houris turned into cheap whores from a Berlin brothel of the 1920s - you had to make a huge effort of will to hear the musical treasures against the anti-musical production. Even when one likes a Ronconi production, one always has the lurking suspicion that the producer hates music. Even when one has reservations about a Pizzi production, there is never any question about his genuine, insightful feeling for opera. And his Maometto II inspires no reservations: it is elegantly conceived, tellingly executed, of unerring taste. Originally designed for the Teatro Rossini, it has been moved to the Palafestival (the barn-like reconverted basketball stadium) with a slight loss of intimacy but a gain in grandeur. The work was first performed in 1820 (just three years after Armida and, like it, at the San Carlo in Naples), again with the great Colbran. Cecilia Gasdia has gradually gained remarkable power and authority, and now as Anna  -the protagonist - she is touchingly vulnerable and, at the same time, defiantly heroic, loving and brave. In the long second act, she is almost always on stage; and in the final hour of the opera, she sings a succession of astonishing numbers, including a great extended trio and a complex finale. Her performance is a triumph, at every moment supported by Pizzi's sensitive direction, and by the excellent performances of the other singers, notably the mezzo-soprano Gloria Scalchi (a tasteful, understated Calbo),the young Mexican tenor Ramon Vargas, whose voice is clean, clear, pleasing, and the bass Michele Pertusi, the Maometto, a young artist who made a deep impression in Semiramide during last year's festival. The Radio-Sinfonieorchester of Stuttgart, conducted by Gianluigi Gelmetti with accurate attention but with little flair, is an improvement over the Bologna of the previous night, and the Prague Chamber Chorus trained by Lubomir Matl is first-rate. Pertusi, Scalchi - and now Vargas - are to some extent Pesaro discoveries, a sign that the festival is now developing its own stable of stylistically appropriate Rossini singers. The not always idiomatic superstars of the early days have pretty much vanished from the programme; Pesaro's next job surely is to develop some new conductors and - vain hope, no doubt - a few more sensitive producers.</p>

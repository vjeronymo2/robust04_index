Weinberger was the target of protesters'  eggs and tomatoes today during an appearance with the Duchess of Kent, the  former Sarah Ferguson, at Leeds University in England.  </P> <P> Neither Weinberger nor Fergie was hit, but a bag of flour landed near the  duchess.  </P> <P> The 1,500 protesters denounced Weinberger as a warmonger because of U.S.  support for the Contras in Nicaragua, but Weinberger said the reception didn't  bother him. In fact, he said it made him feel like he was back in the United  States.  </P></p>

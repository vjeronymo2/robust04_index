			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: CONSUMING VISIONS: ACCUMULATION AND DISPLAY OF GOODS IN  AMERICA 1880-1920 EDITED BY SIMON J. BRONNER (WINTERTHUR/W. W. NORTON: $29.95;  391 PP.)  </P> <P> Two ideas dominate this collection of essays, and between them they express the  ambivalence Americans historically have shown toward worldly goods. On one side  of the scale is Thorstein Veblen, who coined the term "conspicuous consumption"  in his 1899 classic, "Theory of the Leisure Class"; on the other is John  Wanamaker, the Philadelphia department-store magnate, who described commerce as  "the great civilizer" and the United States (in a 1906 advertisement) as the  "Land of Desire." The ideas are not of equal weight in this book, however, for  "Consuming Visions" chronicles the triumph of Wanamaker's point of view.  </P> <P> "Consuming Visions" consists of 13 essays by social historians examining, among  other things, interior decoration, commercial window display, the rise of  museum collections and the Boy Scouts. It's a hodgepodge, to be sure, but that  characterization shouldn't be taken too negatively; the multiplicity of  subjects illuminates the extent to which Americans absorbed the consumer frame  of mind. Materialism always has existed, of course, but in the late 19th  Century mass materialism was a new concept. The Pilgrim Fathers would have been  shocked to hear the minister Russell Conwell (an appropriate name) preach: "It  is your duty to get rich." Nor would they have approved of the maxim inscribed  on the University of Chicago's social- science building: "When you cannot  measure, your knowledge is meager and unsatisfactory." The modern age's  obsession with magnitude already had begun.  </P> <P> The book is full of such interesting arcana -- which makes up for the fact that  it resembles an incomplete jigsaw puzzle, never giving a clear, reliable  picture. Who knew, to give more arcana, that in the same year L. Frank Baum  wrote "The Wizard of Oz" -- 1900 -- he also published "The Art of Decorating  Show Windows and Dry Goods Interiors," the first book of its kind? That one of  the earliest interior decorators, Elsie de Wolfe, upon first seeing the  Parthenon, exclaimed: "It's beige -- my color!"? In "Consuming Visions," we  meet the enemy, and the mirror the book holds up reflects an indefatigable  shopper. Chris Goodrich  </P></p>

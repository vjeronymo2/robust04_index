			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Discussion by Professor Toshiyuku Munekata of Teikei </F> University, Professor Tadashi Nishihara of the National Defense  Academy, and Councilor Yoshiji Nogami of the Foreign Ministry's  Foreign Policy Bureau; presided over by Takashi Kawauchi, chief  of the MAINICHI SHIMBUN Foreign News Department; from the  "Verification of North Korea's Suspected Nuclear Development"  series; part one in a two-part series: "How Is Japan Going To  Respond to `Sanctions'?"]    [Text] [Kawauchi] While formulating the basic policies of  the new coalition government, the ruling coalition parties have  confirmed a basic policy for dealing with North Korea's  suspected development of nuclear weapons. The policy states:  "Japan will prepare for a future emergency in line with a  policy to be adopted by the United Nations." A series of  discussions carried by MAINICHI SHIMBUN on 5 and 6 April focused  on North Korea's suspected nuclear development and on analyzing  how the issue will develop in the future. This time, we would  like to discuss what implications the issue has for Japan and  how Japan should deal with it.    First, I would like to ask whether the UN Security Council  will impose economic sanctions against North Korea.    [Munekata] I believe the UN Security Council will impose  economic sanctions on North Korea. In that event, the UN  Security Council is expected to undertake three stages of  sanctions against that country: surveillance in accordance with  Articles 39 and 40 of the UN Charter, economic sanctions in  accordance with Article 41, and military sanctions in accordance  with Article 42. There is a high possibility that, in  accordance with Article 42, the UN Security Council will impose  military sanctions, including interception of vessels. There is  also the possibility a naval blockade will be imposed against  North Korea, thus threatening the potential use of force. Japan  should prepare for these sanctions by revamping its laws and  ordinances.    [Nishihara] Japan should prepare itself in anticipation of  economic sanctions being imposed against North Korea, but I do  not think the United States will go that far. The foundation of  the coalition government in Japan remains fragile, and it is  still uncertain how far China will go along with sanctions.  Given these facts, it is possible that, even if the United  States takes the lead in imposing economic sanctions against  North Korea, the sanctions would not generate the desired  effect, slapping the United States in its own face.    [Nogami] What concerns me is that public opinion in Japan  may be divided over the handling of the issue. In reality,  there is no way to resolve the issue but through moderate means.  Radical sanctions are costly. The term "sanctions" was not in  the presidential statement of the UN Security Council. Even if  the possibility of imposing economic sanctions emerges in the  future, Japan should seek a diplomatic solution. No matter what  the international community says, Japan should seek a phased  solution of the issue while leaving room for North Korea to  alter its policy.    The issue is problematic and is related to two  aspects--nuclear nonproliferation and stability in the Far East,  including on the Korean peninsula. From the viewpoint of  nuclear nonproliferation, it is necessary to take severe  measures to punish North Korea. Yet what is important for both  Japan and South Korea is stability in the Far East, including on  the Korean peninsula. Attaching importance to the two, the  United States is trying to maintain a balance between them. In  that case, it would be good for the international community to  express strong concern over North Korea's suspected development  of nuclear weapons instead of imposing economic sanctions.    [Munekata] There are two types of economic sanctions.  First, economic sanctions are imposed against North Korea, with  prior knowledge that it will not generate the desired effect.  Second, an economic blockade is imposed to physically prevent  goods from flowing into North Korea. Economic sanctions can be  imposed with the knowledge they are full of loopholes, then  steps can be taken to make a blockade effective. It is  important to make sure North Korea receives our signal; it is  necessary to make diplomatic efforts to correctly catch mutual  signals. Japan should prepare for economic sanctions while  taking this process into account. It required about one year  for Japan to draft a bill on the Peacekeeping Cooperation Law.  If Japan fails to prepare in a timely manner for economic  sanctions, it will have to improperly deal with a catastrophic  situation.    [Nogami] The UN Security Council issued a presidential  statement instead of a binding resolution, with the primary aim  of getting China to heed international opinion. The council  issued the presidential statement as a message that the  international community wants North Korea to take the  fulfillment of its obligations laid down by the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) seriously. In a bid to send a  strong message to North Korea, the UN Security Council has the  option of imposing loose sanctions against that country. Yet  Japan cannot take the lead in imposing such sanctions, and  American public opinion will not tolerate Japan's attitude.    [Kawauchi] What should the international community ask North  Korea to do for the time being?    [Nogami] For the time being, North Korea will be asked to  allow international inspections of a radiation chemical  laboratory from among its seven declared nuclear facilities, the  inspections having been agreed upon between the IAEA  [International Atomic Energy Agency] and North Korea. The next  problem is to inspect undeclared nuclear facilities in North  Korea. There is a possibility the declared nuclear facilities  have greatly changed from when North Korea first declared them  to the IAEA. If the declared facilities have greatly changed,  they will be subject to special inspections. For the time  being, efforts will be made to return the situation back to the  time when North Korea announced its plan to pull out of the NPT.  As for checking undeclared nuclear facilities, U.S.-North Korea  high-level talks will discuss how to conduct the checks. In  that sense, there is a framework to resolve the issue  diplomatically.    [Nishihara] North Korea is suspected of operating other  nuclear facilities; the IAEA will attempt to check these  suspected facilities. Japan may have to consider how it should  live with a North Korea which possesses nuclear weapons.    [Kawauchi] If North Korea really wants to have nuclear  weapons, it will have to pull out of the NPT. However, North  Korea is trying to obtain some goal by playing the nuclear card  instead of pulling out of the NPT. How long should the United  States and other nations continue their diplomatic game with  North Korea with no prospect of resolution in sight?    [Munekata] It is a struggle with time. To explain to what  extent North Korea has developed nuclear weapons, the prevailing  view is that North Korea has extracted enough plutonium to build  one or two warheads, and has almost manufactured a detonation  device. It will take one or two years before North Korea can  test the warheads and build nuclear weapons. The United States  and other nations are expected to refrain from taking any  hardline measures that could undermine the NPT until April 1995  when the NPT is extended. The United States and other nations  will begin sending strong messages to North Korea once the NPT  is extended. However, even if diplomatic signals are sent to  North Korean leaders, it is doubtful whether they will take the  signals seriously.    [Kawauchi] Japan learned a lessen from the Gulf war. I  believe the Japanese people feel that "at the time Japan was  unable to properly respond to the war, and thus Japan should not  repeat that experience." How should Japan use that lesson in  dealing with North Korea's suspected development of nuclear  weapons? What is the government studying now?    [Nogami] During and after the Gulf war, economic sanctions  were imposed against Iraq to keep goods from flowing into that  country. It is legally possible for Japan to prevent goods from  flowing into North Korea. Approximately 50-60 billion yen has  been remitted to North Korea every year, with the money being  used to pay for imports from Japan. The remittance of the money  will naturally be halted once trade between Japan and North  Korea is embargoed. The government can stop the remittance to  North Korea of more than 5 million yen by pro-North Korean  organizations in Japan in accordance with the Foreign Exchange  Law. Ethnic Koreans residing in Japan have carried yen when  they travel to North Korea, and I think the amount of yen they  have carried has been somewhat exaggerated.    [Kawauchi] Nogami, do you mean that the Foreign Ministry  thinks Japan can deal with economic sanctions against North  Korea under laws currently in force, and that it does not need  to amend any laws to deal with sanctions?    [Nogami] If the UN Security Council imposes the same  economic sanctions against North Korea as against Iraq, there  will be no problems with dealing with such sanctions. However,  Japan will be unable to regulate travel to North Korea by ethnic  Koreans residing in Japan. Approximately 250,000 pro-DPRK  Koreans currently reside in Japan, and the government cannot ban  their travel to North Korea.    [Nishihara] Will they not be prohibited from reentering  Japan?    [Nogami] The government must treat pro-DPRK Koreans and  pro-ROK Koreans equally. They have all been granted permanent  residence. From a humanitarian point of view, the government  cannot prohibit pro-DPRK Koreans from reentering Japan while  allowing pro-ROK Koreans to do the same.    [Kawauchi] As a means to deal with a crisis on the Korean  peninsula, the government should study ways to airlift the  Japanese residing in South Korea back to Japan. What do you  think?    [Nogami] The airlifting to Japan of its citizens residing in  South Korea would require amending the Self-Defense Forces [SDF]  Law, and that is a delicate issue. If the government openly  discusses an airlift, it will create useless apprehension among  those Japanese residing in South Korea. Recently the government  has been calmly studying ways to evacuate them. The government  must study such means while making it clear to the Japanese  residing in South Korea that the situation on the Korean  peninsula is not serious at the moment.    [Munekata] Speaking from the military standpoint, the  current SDF Law limits naval interception action to Japanese  territorial waters. The law permits naval interception only  when legitimate self-defense and emergency evacuations are  required on the high seas. The law also permits SDF ships to  rescue other Japanese warships on the open sea. By law, SDF  vessels capable of sweeping mines can do nothing for South  Korean ships in danger of being hit by mines. This indifferent  action cannot be tolerated internationally. It will be  necessary to pass legislation within a limited time frame. The  government should consider how to deal with refugees fleeing  from North Korea to Japan when economic sanctions are imposed.    [Kawauchi] Munekata, do you mean the Diet needs to revamp  relevant laws?    [Munekata] Yes, the Diet needs to do so in order to put the  SDF under civilian control. The worst situation will occur if  and when procedures are not set to deal with an emergency  situation, and the handling of the emergency is left to the  judgment of SDF members. If politics does not make clear what  to do to deal with such situations, Japan will run into trouble.    [Nishihara] The SDF has no service regulation allowing it to  participate in UN-endorsed naval interception. If Article 9 of  the Constitution is interpreted as permitting the SDF to  participate in collective self-defense, the SDF can participate  in UN-endorsed naval interception. It goes without saying that  the SDF can only provide lateral support for naval interceptions.    [Nogami] If ships in question do not enter or leave Japanese  ports, there will be no need for naval interception. The  Maritime Safety Agency will deal with stowaways.    [Munekata] It will take time for North Korea to shift its  nuclear card from a political into a military instrument. There  is no need to stir up public opinion right now. It is important  to study ways to revamp laws currently in force to ready Japan  for an emergency situation.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Heathrow's fifth terminal Failure to build a fifth terminal at London Heathrow would cost 14,000 jobs, BAA, which operates the airport, said yesterday, Daniel Green writes. A decision to proceed with the Pounds 900m terminal would create 6,000 jobs and protect 8,000 others, the company said in a lobbying document it submitted to the government. A public inquiry is expected to begin in 1995. If planning permission were granted in 1997, the first stage of the terminal would open in the year 2002 and work would be finished by 2013, BAA said. The new terminal would handle 30m passengers a year. 'Terminal 5 will ensure that Heathrow retains its position in the face of increasingly fierce competition from Europe,' said Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive.</p>

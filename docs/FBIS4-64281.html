			<p>BFN     [Text] "At 1500 on Monday [2 May] meetings will start, and  beginning Tuesday evening we will start to discuss the names of  ministers." This was said by newly appointed Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi, who also said that the new government's  program is ready: "This is the final draft, but of course it can  be enriched through the meetings."    Berlusconi said that as well as members of Forza Italia, the  Northern League, and the National Alliance, "members of other  political forces, technocrats, professionals, and public  managers" with the right qualifications will be able to join the  executive.</p>

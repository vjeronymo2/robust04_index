			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARABS ABSENT FROM SARATOGA YEARLING SALE  </P> <P> Events in the Persian Gulf have kept an "enormous force" in the thoroughbred  racing world from attending Saratoga Spring's 70th annual yearling sales.  </P> <P> The three-day auction began Tuesday night without Sheik Hamdan al Maktoum and  his brothers Maktoum and Mohammed, members of the royal family of the United  Arab Emirates.  </P> <P> Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has kept the sheiks home.  </P> <P> "They're an enormous force at the sale," said Cot Campbell, owner of Preakness  winner Summer Squall.  </P> <P> The Maktoums spent $14.8 million on the first day of last month's yearling  sales at Keeneland, Ky.  </P> <P> In Saratoga Springs last year, Hamdan al Maktoum bought 16 yearlings for $7.8  million, nearly one quarter of the $31.8 million taken in by Fasig-Tipton Co.,  auctioneer for the Saratoga sales.  </P> <P> While the Maktoums have agents at the sale, Campbell said the sheiks'  representatives are less likely to bid past preset limits.  </P> <P> After two nights, 105 head have been sold at an average price of $229,362 and a  gross of $24,083,000. Last year, 84 head had been sold for $22,357,000, or an  average of $266,155.  </P> <P> The average per head after two nights of selling was down 14% from 1989.  </P> <P> A bay filly by Danzig from Family Style sold by Brushwood Stable topped the  sales list Wednesday. Dr. David Richardson, acting as agent for an unnamed  purchaser, paid $1.2 million for her.  </P></p>

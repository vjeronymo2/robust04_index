			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- An economics professor  appealed for a better understanding of the positive significance  of China's massive movement of rural labor and offered advices  for its solution.    "For the surging tide of migrating rural labor," he said,  "we  should not take a blocking method. Rather, we should provide  guidance over the direction of its flow by way of market  principles."    The suggestion was made by Gu Shengzu, a member of the  national committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference (CPPCC) and an economics professor of Wuhan  University, in a speech he made here today at a general session  of the CPPCC National Committee members.    Professor Gu first dealt with statistics.    He said: China at present has over 400 million rural  laborers. With 100 million absorbed by rural enterprises, there  are still more than 200 million surplus laborers in rural areas.  Among the surplus laborers, 50-60 million have left their  villages to form what is known as a tide of migrating rural  labor. That means, at least, over 100 million laborers in rural  China need job placement. Moreover, surplus rural laborers will  increase by more than 10 million each year.    In the 1990s, he said, the issue will become increasingly  serious. A markdown of the comparative benefits of farming will  drive a great number of rural laborers to move in search of  jobs. By the turn of the century, he said, China will have an  army of about 100 million migrating rural laborers.    Gu said, rural labor has promoted the economic development  of  regions where they work. They have contributed to construction  projects for the 1990 Asian games, expressway construction in  Beijing, development of Shanghai's Pudong, the Chang Jiang Three  Gorges project, and the economic takeoff of the Pearl River  Delta area in Guangdong.    At the same time, he said, the labor tide is having an  adverse impact on urban traffic and social order.    Gu suggested that urbanization of rural areas be taken as a  main channel for the absorption of surplus rural laborers to  slow down the pace of their flow into big cities and avoid a  waste of resources caused by scattered industrialization.    His urbanization program calls for letting 300 small cities  absorb 30 million surplus rural laborers, each taking 100,000;  letting 2,000 county towns soak up 100 million, each taking  50,000; and selecting 2,000 towns and building them into small  cities to absorb 100 million.    "We need an innovative way to solve the problem," Gu said.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Arts: The Life of Galileo - Theatre Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956) died while rehearsing the model production of his Life of Galileo. It remains one of his most lucid plays, written in November 1938; now it has a new gloss in David Hare's version at the Almeida Theatre, which makes absorbing, engaging drama. The play starts with the battle between Ptolemy's crystal spheres view of the universe centred on the earth, and Copernicus's sun-centred model. John Donne caught the feeling of the time: 'The sun is lost, and the earth, and no man's wit can well direct him where to look for it.' The two dates in Galileo's life (1564-1642), which form the axis of the play are 1610, when he published The Starry Messenger about his discoveries in astronomy, and 1633 when he recanted at Rome the Copernican theories he had held. As Galileo and Rome take a collision course, the play's broader issues evolve: the uses of scepticism and the uses of science; the merits of science and religion for the uneducated; the worth of knowledge; and the possession of truth, 'the child of time and not the prisoner of authority'. Behind, Brecht - but not Hare - is the great debate between the Baconian and Aristotelian views of science. The equivalent debates now can be found in genetic engineering and computer information. Rome's attitude then is like political correctness now: think but don't say. Brecht wrote an accessible play about ideas, staging them and making discovery exciting. Hare has stayed in that tradition, trimming down the play and updating its feel while still keeping the action in 17th-century Italy. Both offer, as Brecht wanted, 'a workable picture of the world'. At the Almeida, the cast is strong and centred on a very fine performance by Richard Griffiths as Galileo. He ages Galileo 30 years from the discontented 46 year old of the opening to the disillusioned man under house arrest at the close. Griffiths has the ability to find voices within Galileo, throwaway lines or comments which are still part of the character; he finds broad gestures for Galileo, almost vulgar, as befits Brecht's portrayal of a man taking the easy course and applying his learning indiscriminately. Around him, Michael Gough and Alfred Burke are pillars of Roman cynicism and prejudice, while Edward de Souza and Jerome Willis are a brace of clubbable cardinals. Jonathan Kent's direction keeps the action cerebral and finds images of light and dark in the excellent set (Tobias Hoheisel) without recourse to laboratory paraphernalia. Behind the wooden screens that become the courts, houses and lecture rooms of Galileo's life, the curved wall of the Almeida Theatre is a celestial blue dappled with golden stars. Jonathan Dove's ambient music creates a sense of distance and perspective. Hare - and Brecht - know that Galileo recanted his theories in order to stay alive to write more. Griffiths' quiet defence of Galileo's decision draws the play together at the end; he was a man unable to resist an old wine or a new idea. At the Almeida Theatre (071 359 4404) until March 31</p>

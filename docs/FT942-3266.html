			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Weak sales deepen loss at Valmet Weaker sales of large paper machines led to deeper losses at Valmet, the Finnish engineering group, in the first four months of this year. The group, which recently raised FM671.3m (Dollars 122.3m) through an international share offering, said its deficit after financial items amounted to FM243m for the period, more than three times the previous year's FM72m loss, and followed a 20 per cent drop in net sales, to FM2.65bn. The group said several large paper machines were delivered in early 1993, whereas most of this year's contracts would not be booked until the end of the year. Valmet warned that its full-year result would be affected by the recently-completed FM1.62bn sale of its transport equipment and tractor operations to Sisu-Auto.</p>

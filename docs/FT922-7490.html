			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Lloyd's to look at Names aid plan MEMBERS of Lloyd's Council are this week expected to consider a scheme to help Names - the individuals whose assets provide the Lloyd's capital base - suffering badly through the insurance market's recent losses. Lloyd's confirmed yesterday that it had appointed a merchant bank to advise on the details of any scheme. It is understood that a council sub-committee will consider a scheme presented by the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party, which contains representatives of groups involved in legal proceedings against Lloyd's agents. The working party was formed in April and is headed by Mr Peter Nutting. Its proposals include: Limiting the losses of Names to no more than 30 per cent of premium limit - the amount of premiums a Name can trade - in any one underwriting year. A fund of Pounds 1.25bn might be needed with half financed by a premium levy. The scheme would be retrospective to cover losses made since 1987. A Pounds 1bn loan facility for Names whose losses amount to more than 10 per cent of their premium limit for 1988 to 1990, which would allow Names to pay losses from future profits. An end to litigation within Lloyd's, with all disputes transferred to an independent and acceptable mediation or arbitration process. An end to self-regulation. Modification of the so-called hardship arrangements - the relief provided by Lloyd's to individual Names as an alternative to bankruptcy. Measures to deal with difficulties created by agencies that specialised in placing Names on catastrophe reinsurance or LMX syndicates, which insure other syndicates against unexpectedly high losses.</p>

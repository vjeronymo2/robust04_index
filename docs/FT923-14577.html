			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Japanese polite but firm over Kuriles WHILE THE participants at the summit are desperately scratching around to find something meaningful and positive to say about the world economy, Japan is pursuing its own, very specific national agenda for tomorrow's meeting between the seven and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia. Well aware that they have rarely been in a stronger position to exert financial and economic pressure on the Russians, the Japanese intend to use the occasion of Mr Yeltsin's appearance at the forum of the world's richest nations to press for an early settlement of the long-running issue of the 'Northern Territories', four Japanese islands occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945. The language is diplomatic: 'Japan fervently hopes to provide a firm legal basis for mutual trust between the Japanese and Russian peoples by resolving the territorial issue and concluding a peace treaty', in the words of the official brochure on the subject. Given that, 40 years after the second world war, no peace treaty has been concluded between the two countries, that can hardly be considered an excessive demand. No one listening to Japanese spokesmen here, however, can doubt that Japan's full weight will not be put behind international efforts to bail out Russia's economy until Moscow agrees at least on the principle of Japanese sovereignty over the islands at the southern end of the Kurile chain. It is not that Japan refuses to participate point blank in these efforts. On the contrary, officials underline the substantial assistance Japan has already given to the former Soviet Union, notably its contribution of Dollars 2.7bn to the Dollars 24bn aid package promised by the western industrialised nations. But, with infinite regret, they find themselves obliged to point out to journalists covering the summit that the issue of the Northern Territories is both a question of justice and a matter of national pride. 'There is a national consensus that, unless there is a solid political basis for relations between our two countries in the form of a peace treaty, we cannot envisage the granting of massive economic assistance at the cost of the Japanese taxpayer,' an official said. One of the areas in which they have demonstrated their reluctance to go much further is that of the proposed Dollars 700m multilateral fund to finance safety measures at the 57 Soviet-built nuclear reactors in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. They have made clear that they expect the former Soviet and east European states to bear a substantial share of the costs before they will agree to contribute.</p>

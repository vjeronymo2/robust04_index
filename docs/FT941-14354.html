			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank sets sights on Asia-Pacific Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, is targeting the Asia-Pacific region for the next decade after concentrating expansion plans on North America during recent years. The bank's Asia-Pacific operations had the potential to substantially boost profits during the next 10 years, said Mr Ulrich Cartellieri, the board member responsible for that region. The region generated profits of about DM500m (Dollars 286m) last financial year, compared with group profits of nearly DM6bn. Mr Cartellieri said. 'This is the world's fastest growing region and will require huge investments in infrastructure. The most conservative estimate puts the requirements at Dollars 500bn over the next four years. We want to help fund that expansion.' The bank employs more than 3,000 people in the Asia-Pacific region, of which slightly less than 400 are based in Japan. Most of the bank's growth in the region would be in south-east Asia with little from Japan, he said. The speed of growth would depend upon how quickly governments deregulated their financial markets. 'Most are advancing in leaps and bounds. Some are having to move from the Stone Age to derivatives in only a few months,' he explained. The bank would concentrate on commercial banking, trade finance, capital market operations, brokerage and private investment banking. The Morgan Grenfell subsidiary, would focus its efforts in capital markets. Singapore is the only centre where Morgan Grenfell has depth, he added. Deutsche Bank had asked the Vietnamese authorities for permission to upgrade its representative offices in Hanoi and Saigon to full branches. India is also a priority for the commercial banking operations. A licence had just been received for Bangalore, and new offices were planned in other Indian cities including Calcutta.</p>

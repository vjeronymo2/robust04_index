			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 9 May (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  today confirmed the government's decision to transform the Falda  del Carmen facilities into "Argentina's space activities center."    Menem thus stressed that the facilities where the  controversial Condor-2 missile was developed and built will be  used for "the production of civilian goods and services alone."    The president made these remarks in opening this morning the  2d Euro-Latin American Space Forum [II Jornadas  Euro-Latinoamericanas del Espacio] at the Libertador Hotel in  Buenos Aires. Representatives from European and American space  agencies, research institutes, universities, and companies are  attending this forum.    Representatives from Argentina, Chile, Brazil, and Mexico  will lecture on the development of their space programs.  Teledialing [telediccion] -- the remote gathering of data,  using satellites -- especially for the exploitation of natural  resources and environment conservation, will be among the main  issues for discussion.    During the opening ceremony Menem was joined by Conrado  Varotto, the National Commission for Space Activities [CNAE]  chairman; European Space Agency Chairman Michael Lefevre; and  Senator Jose Figueroa.    In his speech, the president emphasized "the peaceful" goals  of the space projects, and noted that an Institute for Higher  Space Studies [Instituto de Altos Estudios Espaciales] would be  operating in Falda del Carmen, in Cordoba Province.    After emphasizing the importance of science and technology,  Menem noted: "Historically, and especially over the past  decades, Argentina has not been using its gray matter, and given  the reduced possibilities for development existing here we,  incredibly enough, became exporters of brains."    The president said: "We are proud to say that this trend has  been reversed now." He then noted that space activities have  been enhanced.    Menem pointed out: "The CNAE was legally established in  1991. A National Space Program [Plan Espacial Nacional] is  being drawn up now, and must be completed in September. This  program will establish long-term strategic planning. This  planning is now possible thanks to the economic stability."    Menem noted: "In a breach of trust, I can say that one of  the  program's key points involves using the so-called light  satellites [satelites livianos] that are able to supply a number  of scientific and practical services to our territory and to  third countries."    Menem said: "The Satellites SAC-B and SAC-C must be  described as pioneer." He noted: "Argentina is gaining  experience, and has great potential in the field of space  activities."    Before delivering his speech, Menem met European Space  Agency  astronaut Claude Nicolier, a member of an expedition that spent  11 days in space to service the Hubble space telescope.</p>

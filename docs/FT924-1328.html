			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Barcom back in black with Pounds 0.7m In a year of change and development, Barcom, the civil engineering and plant hire concern, maintained its recovery to finish the 12 months to September 30 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 702,000, against a restated Pounds 4.82m loss. Sales totalled Pounds 11.5m (restated Pounds 6.34m) and earnings per share were 9.2p (235.5p losses). A dividend of 1.25p (nil) is recommended. Exceptional credits came to Pounds 204,000 (Pounds 1.71m debits) comprising profits on sale of freehold properties. Last year's figures were restated to account for the disposal of Venture Plant (Scotland) as an extraordinary charge instead of an exceptional item.</p>

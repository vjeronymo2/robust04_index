			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radio Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Text] Despite significant progress in Russian-U.S. trade  and economic relations, they are not yet free from the legacy of  the Cold War, Oleg Davydov, Russia's minister for foreign  economic relations, told Itar-Tass in Moscow.    He recalled that United States has not yet canceled the  Jackson-Venik amendment which discriminates against Russia. The  solution of a number of financial and commercial issues is tied  to various political conditions and to progress in the  implementation of market reforms in Russia.    The minister added that the policy of strict quantitative  regulation of Russian imports is still in force. Russia, in the  opinion of Oleg Davydov, should first and foremost seek the  lifting of restrictions on the export of its goods to the United  States and develop a mechanism for bilateral consultations.</p>

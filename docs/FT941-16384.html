			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Vietnam and US continue thaw Vietnam is expected to begin talks with the US on human rights abuses, in the latest tentative step towards normal relations between the two countries. Preliminary talks between the Vietnamese ambassador at the UN in New York and senior State Department officials could take place this month, and might help eliminate one more stumbling block to a US decision to lift its economic embargo on Vietnam. Eight US military teams are now engaged in a search for the remains of US servicemen listed as missing in action during the US-Vietnam war, an issue which remains the biggest obstacle to any US decision to normalise relations. But the pace of official visits by US military and political chiefs has accelerated in recent weeks, and a delegation of senior senators from both parties this weekend called for the embargo to be lifted. Although President Bill Clinton announced last year that the US would no longer oppose loans from the international financial institutions to Vietnam, and allowed US companies to bid for such projects, US law still forbids normal commercial operations in Vietnam.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Sliva, chairman of the State Duma </F> Committee for Issues of Local Self-Government, by Yuriy Kozlov,  under the rubric "From the Horse's Mouth"; place and date not  given: "The Devil's Little Ones"]    [Text] [Kozlov] Anatoliy Yakovlevich, is it possible to  consider that a full-fledged system of local self-government has  evolved and is in operation in Russia at present?    [Sliva] This year Russia will celebrate the 130th  anniversary  of the movement toward local self-government. In 1864, three  years after the abolition of serfdom, the Zemstvo Reform was  implemented, and subsequently the City Reform also began in  Russia, that is to say, two branches of local self-government  began to develop. Later came October 1917 and Soviet power. Only  in 1989 did the train of local self-government, which, shall we  say, had been shunted onto the "side track," begin to move  further with friction. We traveled through a few "stations": the  Union and Russian laws on local self-government, and edicts of  the president on reform of local self-government which put an  end to the operation of soviets. At present, local  self-government in Russia is in a unique situation: In the  Constitution the rights of the local organs of power have been  worded and codified at the level of the most exacting world  standards, whereas legislation in effect, edicts, various  decisions, and executive acts have come to clearly contradict  the Constitution.    [Kozlov] What are these standards according to the  Constitution?    [Sliva] The power of communities of citizens of urban and  rural localities is recognized to be natural. Local  self-government exercises full rights in resolving issues of  local significance. Ownership, use, and management of municipal  property by local self-government are guaranteed. Local  self-government should have its own budget; its right to  municipal land is also proclaimed. The structure of the organs  of local self-government is determined by the population itself.  Residents themselves will resolve whether the mayor, town  governor, or settlement administrator is to be or not to be. The  Constitution says: Self-government shall be performed through  elected organs. Representative organs are at issue, but heads of  local self-government may also be elected.    [Kozlov] In this case, what is the reason for the  continuously developing conflicts between the executive  authorities of components of the Federation and urban  self-government? Let us look, for example, at the scandal in  Nizhniy Novgorod. Mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod Dmitriy Bednyakov  stated live on the air that oblast Governor Boris Nemtsov  intends to find a way to have him removed from his position by  an edict of the president.    [Sliva] The Constitution says clearly that the organs of  local self-government do not belong to the system of state  power. They may not belong to the system, but state functions  are assigned to them through dozens of laws, edicts, and  executive acts. Conflicts frequently develop over local budgets.  Continuous redistribution of financial funds is underway.  Decisions are made at the level of components of the Federation,  including those on finance, which the local organs are  instructed to carry out immediately. This is not just  unconstitutional; this results in social tensions locally.    [Kozlov] And what if the local authorities do not intend to  obey the dictate?    [Sliva] There is the tiny town of Shlisselburg in Leningrad  Oblast. Last Sunday mayoral elections were held there. There  were six candidates. A worthy candidate, Svetlana Yurkova, who  got 42 percent of the votes of those turning out for the  elections, came in first in a most stubborn struggle. The  nearest competitor trailed her by 20 points. What did the  electoral commission do the following day? It did not qualify  Yurkova for the next round! Their motives? They said that on the  same day she was elected a deputy of the Legislative Assembly of  Leningrad Oblast. This, allegedly, was incompatible. This  decision was completely unlawful. Incidentally, in Shlisselburg  50 percent turned out for the elections, whereas in the oblast  on the average--29 percent of voters. So, the struggle over  local self-government is unfolding not only in Nizhniy Novgorod.  Budgets have been taken away from many cities, including oblast  seats. The head of an oblast or kray administration  single-handedly deprives the population of a city of the status  of local self-government. Local self-government has been  liquidated in cities dating back 500 to 700 years! The  Constitutional Court is not in operation; the procuracy organs  are silent, while "telephone law" continues to apply just as it  did.... Meanwhile, this should provide grounds for notorious  court proceedings to resonate throughout Russia! All of this is  happening notwithstanding the constitutional requirement to  structure local self-government with historic traditions taken  into account. Is this supposed to be a new historic tradition?  Cities are demanding the natural rights that are  constitutionally codified as theirs. Governors and heads of  oblast and kray administrations treat the local organs of power  far more sternly than the center treated components of the  Federation at one time. There is a paraphrased saying: "The  devil is not as horrible as his...little ones." Somehow, these  "little ones," who are ensconced in lofty seats, have suddenly  forgotten that local self-government is the root system of  democracy. By restricting local self-government, the "little  ones" are signing their own death warrant as politicians. If  there is no local self-government, there will be no real  democracy; moreover, there will be no real federalism and real  rights of components of the Federation. Today they turn the  screw on those who are under them; tomorrow, those who are above  them will turn the screw on them. I repeat tirelessly that a  dictatorship--regardless of its specific form--is a social  system for beggars; self-government is one for affluent people  owning property, those who are responsible and law-abiding. Only  with such people may reform be advanced. Failing to understand  this means failing to understand why reforms are actually being  carried out in the country. After all, this is not for the sake  of the personal power of some heads of oblast administrations or  governors.    [Kozlov] As you see it, what is to be done, after all, about  mayors or, as the edict of the president calls them, "heads of  local self-governments?" Are they to be elected or appointed  along the vertical chain of command?    [Sliva] The Constitution specifically disallows appointment  practices. Although it is not fashionable at present, I will  recall this: The fundamentals of democracy are violated by the  bid of the center to appoint or confirm local authorities. Lenin  said this in June 1917 at the First All-Russian Congress of  Soviets. The correct answer to the simple problem of whether "to  elect or not to elect the head of the local administration" is  not to appoint. Incidentally, the Constitution does not allow  for appointing governors, either. At present, we are at a  transitional stage: There are both elected and appointed heads.  In the event a vacancy occurs, the issue should either be  resolved by way of a direct election or the head should be  elected by the local representative organ. It is at the very  least unwise to frustrate elections, to interfere with them, or  to strive to appoint the person needed at any price.    [Kozlov] Does the State Duma Committee for Issues of Local  Self-Government have an opportunity to influence the situation  at least somewhat?    [Sliva] I believe it does. The president has instructed the  government, the State-Law Directorate, and his Administration to  bring all previously issued edicts, decisions of the government,  and so on into compliance with the Constitution within one  month. Instructions have been given. Let us hope that they will  be carried out.</p>

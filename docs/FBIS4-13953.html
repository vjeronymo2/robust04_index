			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Clarification From Kurdistan </F> Democratic Party: No Barzani Conditions for Visiting Damascus"]    [Excerpt] London, AL-HAYAH -- The Kurdistan Democratic  Party [KDP] has hailed the "strong" relations between its leader  Mas'ud Barzani and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad.    AL-HAYAH has received a clarification from the party in  Salah-al-Din in northern Iraq, which said:    "In your 20 April 1994 edition, you published a report under  the headline "Barzani Sets Three Conditions for Acceptance of  Damascus Invitation." In the interest of the truth, we wish to  make the following clarification:    "1. Our party's relations with Syria are strong and based on  mutual respect and understanding, and we attach much importance  to these relations.    "2. President Hafiz al-Asad received Barzani on all his  previous visits. Barzani's relations with President al-Asad are  strong and warm.    "3. We wish to point out that Barzani would never visit  Syria on preconditions. Syria is his own country and the gates  of Damascus were and are still open. There is no need for  preconditons between brothers." [passage omitted]</p>

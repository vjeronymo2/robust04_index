			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ingrid Steiner: "The Package Must Be Improved </F> After Two Years"]    [Text] "Privately a gentlemen, politically a pure-blooded  fascist": This is how opponents describe Pietro Mitolo, the  head of the neofascists (MSI -- Movimento Sociale Italiano) in  South Tirol. As a result of the neofascists' entering the  Government in Rome, Mitolo sees his opportunity to push through  longstanding demands. In an interview with KURIER, he  said:     -  About autonomy: "I do not want to abolish autonomy.  However, two years after the conclusion of the `package' the  results must be analyzed and improved accordingly. We demand  more flexibility in particular regarding the implementation of  proportional representation in line with ethnic groups for  official functions and in the application of  bilingualism."    -  About the economic advantages of South Tirol's  autonomy: "We have all benefited. But the Germans have  benefited most. The subsidies for agriculture, trade, and  tourism mostly benefited the Germans. A balance must be  established here."    -  About the Treaty of Osimo: "It was concluded  between Italy and Yugoslavia. However, Yugoslavia does not  exist any longer. From the legal point of view, Slovenia and  Croatia did not sign the Treaty. Therefore, the situation must  be reexamined and one must insist that the Italian minority  there is treated better."    -  About the border at Brenner: "Here  the situation is quite different. The Treaty of Osimo is a  product of the Cold War. But the border at Brenner was set down  after World War I in the Treaties of Saint Germain. And Austria  said in these treaties that it forever renounces territorial  claims south of the Brenner [Pass]. No compromise on this  matter is possible for us. It has been concluded once and for  all."    -  About a "Europe of regions": "We do not want a European  region of Tirol (with the inclusion of North Tirol--KURIER  editor's note). The European region of Trentino-South Tirol  already exists, and it must be strengthened. But if one desires  a common region within a larger framework, that is, with North  Tirol, then this is possible only together with Lombardy and  Veneto."</p>

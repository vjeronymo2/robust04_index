			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Gardening: Coping with that seven-year itch NEW YEAR is a gardener's time for plans, reflections and memories. My plans are obvious: do better; kill more weeds; spray earlier against black spot and replant that supreme luxury, a wide, newly-manured border, emptied of its previous jungle and creeping buttercups. It looks as though single white Japanese anemones will have a large part to play. They have been one of my plants of 1992, refuting the notion that they prefer a dry year in dry soil. They will grow almost anywhere, but sometimes they need a few years to establish themselves. During the 1990s, they will have their chance to spread beneath a background of holly and a light canopy of sycamores on the problematic fringes of my garden. As for reflections, mine run in a particular direction. I keep thinking of the principle which we all cite, but never fully obey: whenever you start a new garden or a new design, plant the permanencies and big features first. Time races by, until the seven-year wait for the first flowers on a Winter Sweet or the white buds on a Magnolia Grandiflora seem like a tiny interruption in the long road of a gardener's lifetime. But whatever your time of life, the principle still applies. Think long term and do not make the inevitable mistake of being half-hearted. I never succeed in thinking out the long-lasting framework for an entire garden as a first move and I am always diverted in places by an anxious wish for immediate colour. Although seven years seem an eternity when we first set out, ignore the prospect and always choose the best for the future, a Magnolia Wilsonii, not a Ribes, a hedge of clipped box rather than laurel. Always begin by planting as many of the trees, large shrubs and hedges as you can. As for the memories, they are less grandiose - 1992 turned out to be a remarkable year. The spring was very dry and early and, by mid-June, it seemed that everything in the garden would be over at once. After a mad acceleration of the season, it began to rain, gaining momentum in July and starting a welcome overture which has led up to the recent torrential winter, unparalleled in my memory. At the same time, the air remained unusually mild, giving us a vintage year for winter jasmine, magnolias and winter-flowering cherry, until these recent frosts. If I could plant only one tree for the longer term, it would still be a winter cherry, of which the best form is the best-known, Prunus Subhirtella Autumnalis. Between the early drought and the later floods, evergreens and trees grew heroically. In the recent dry summers, survivors have been putting down deep roots: this year, they confirmed the old wisdom, that plants puzzle beginners by growing downwards for the first two or three years and then race upwards thereafter. Never single out a shrub as a slow performer on the sole evidence of early height. In 1992, young yews, box and the admirable evergreen Osmanthus started to grow rapidly upwards, after four years of sending deep roots down for water. As a postscript, berries then appeared by the thousand on all sorts of trees, making one of the best autumns for fruiting in my memory. Since September, it has been the year of the Sorbus and I doubt if the Far Eastern forms have ever been finer in Britain. Readers with Plantfinders might share my enthusiasm for Adenophora Tashiroi, which comes from Japan and covers itself in pale grey-blue flowers like small lampshades. It is only a foot-high when in flower and, despite the books, appears to be completely happy in full sun and a stony soil. Beside it, I had a group of the various Parahebes in white and pale milk-blue flowers. Again, these small evergreen shrubs make marvellous edging for any low border and seem to flower throughout the summer. The frost has not hurt them and I cannot imagine why gardeners grow them so seldom. Before the black spot, roses had an admirable fling in that extraordinary June where everything was running at least two weeks early. I have started to notice the qualities of some of the more delicate roses which were bred in the early 1950s and are now beginning to seem old-fashioned: I strongly recommend a quiet evening's research in Peter Beales' admirable reference book Classic Roses, in which he does proper justice to forgotten roses, bred in this era and kept in the trade by his nursery list, and often by no other. Elsewhere, many climbers were magnificent, although they flowered absurdly early. For the first time, maturity showed me the full loveliness of climbing Madame Paul Lede. It flowers only once, but the huge double heads are a unique shade of dusky apricot pink, like the silk of a fine Edwardian dress. My most lasting memory is not a rose nor, indeed, a flower of any kind: rather, 1992 was the Year of the Slug. In the wet weather, these non-human companions became fat, bloated and abominably slimy. They played hell with the hostas, but I am also pleased to be armed with an excellent modern antidote. Called Growing Success, it is pet-friendly, plant-friendly and slug-hostile. Slugs, I suppose, cannot help it, but they do have atrocious appetites: Growing Success removes them by the dozen, efficiently, cleanly and as victors can always afford to be magnanimous, I hope that the dozens who died in 1992 died, in their non-linguistic world, without any real pain.</p>

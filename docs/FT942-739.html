			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Technology: Death of a craft - Epoch-making changes are afoot in the pre-press stage of printing Few aspects of modern life are so crucial and yet so taken for granted as words on the printed page. Since the early days of printing, the technology used to transfer ideas and images to paper has been fundamental to advances in civilisation. From the development of wood-block printing by the Chinese and various forms of wooden and metal type by the Koreans and Japanese, to the movable type pioneered in Europe by Johannes Gutenberg and William Caxton, the printed word has stimulated culture, education and entertainment. Today, in the multimedia age based on the enormous growth in computing power, the printing industry is undergoing an upheaval comparable with any of these epoch-making changes. Now that sound, text and pictures (from film or photo-CD) can be handled digitally, printing companies are having to make radical changes in the way they work. Not only is the equipment changing rapidly, but the demands of customers have also become tougher. 'I think another very dramatic structural change is about to occur,' says Erwin Konigs, head of Linotype-Hell, the German maker of equipment for the pre-press (text and picture preparation) stages of printing. With the price of printing continuing to fall - he says it has been cut by half in the past two or so years - and the tremendous pressure for work to be done faster, 'the printing industry really has to rationalise'. Konigs foresees the full computerisation of pre-press activity from the creation of designs to the scanning of images, the manipulation of text and pictures before they are put on film, and the making of pages ready for printing. Those at the industry's sharp end are feeling both the benefits and the pressures of this surge of electronic innovation. 'We're at the beginning of a new dawn of on-demand colour printing,' believes Joe Brim, head of LaserBureau, a London printing company packed with the latest electronic equipment. 'There's no mystique anymore.' Traditionally, much of the skilled work involved in turning designs into printed pages has been handed to specialists. This was, and still is to some extent, especially true in the case of colour pictures and graphics. Today, however, advanced software enables sophisticated artwork to be carried out from desktop computers such as the Apple Macintosh. For really high-grade products such as glossy advertising brochures, a wide range of outside skills is still needed. But increasingly, superior quality products can be produced from a range of electronic equipment - used to scan, process, store and display images - integrated by special software such as the PostScript system of California-based Adobe and available to those printing companies willing to invest. This is what Brim means by 'a new dawn'. With the advent of new printing technology, products do not always have to be printed in large quantities to be economically worthwhile. Also, because the information is in digital form, each short print-run can be changed if necessary, or customised for individual readers such as those being targeted by marketing companies. 'The world is going to short-run, on-demand colour printing,' says Brim. Customers can now order a few hundred copies of any item they want printed instead of having to take a thousand or more, as previously. 'These days,' says Tony Jarvis, head of Jarvis Field Press, 'things happen so fast that it's frightening - with digital cameras, even more will change.' This is because the images from these cameras, gradually coming on to the market, will be able to go straight into the computerised network without having to be scanned. Jarvis, also in London, has not gone so far down the digital road as LaserBureau. The company waited until last year, when prices had eased, before buying its electronic scanning and image-setting equipment. When finished, its investment will total around Pounds 500,000. For the makers of equipment - especially that used in the pre-press stages where Linotype, Agfa and Scitex of Israel are prominent - the digital age has brought huge changes and opportunities. 'The software is now driving the hardware,' says Alexander van Meeuwen, business group director for graphic systems at the UK office of Agfa, owned by Germany's Bayer. 'The speed of change in the graphic arts industry is phenomenal.' As well as providing huge opportunities for printing companies, it also poses a considerable threat. As the latest computer-based equipment allows them to do more, or all, of the pre-press and printing work on their own systems - many customers now send in jobs by disk or along ISDN (integrated services digital network) lines - fewer companies will be needed. 'It has been a craft-based industry,' says Michael Austin, graphic systems marketing director for Agfa in the UK. 'Everyone was specialised in a very narrow field, so there are lots of very small businesses.' Thus he foresees a concentration in the highly fragmented printing sector, with only those companies able to invest in new equipment likely to survive. But while he expects pre-press stages to disappear eventually as computers control more of the stages up to the making of metal plates for final printing, 'I believe we have a long way to go before heavy-duty printing presses are replaced'. Konigs reckons the pre-press industry will go in five to 10 years. 'The prerequisite is technology that offloads those pretty complicated steps of the human brain to the computer.' The brainpower has come from the specialists; the technology is now advancing to a level where their colour preparation and layout skills will increasingly become redundant. He quotes the example of a printer on the US west coast who has two groups of operators making up colour pages: those using traditional reprographic skills earn Dollars 25 a hour, but a new employee doing everything by computer earns Dollars 16. Such 'de-skilling' is painful for those whose skills are being replaced electronically but is an inevitable and already visible trend in a fiercely competitive industry.</p>

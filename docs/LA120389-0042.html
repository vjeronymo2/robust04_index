			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOKS: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> BASKETRY: THE SHAKER TRADITION, BY JOHN MCGUIRE (LARK BOOKS; 1988)  </P> <P> THE SIMPLICITY OF Shaker design, the dedication to well-made everyday objects,  the sect's neatness and awesome organizational abilities (not just a place for  everything but a number-letter code to make sure it got there), the appeal of  self-sufficiency -- all combine to make the Shakers a compelling example of  American beauty and practicality. Their baskets were used for toting everything  totable: laundry, seeds, pies, produce and cheese; they were also used as ox  muzzles, storage containers, colanders and bushel baskets. McGuire gives  detailed instructions, with photos, for making the cat-head basket -- so named  because when it is turned upside down the basket's 'feet" resemble cat's ears  -- and several other types of baskets.  </P> <P> But McGuire also writes on Shaker history, compares antique tools with their  modern counterparts and offers page after beautiful page of authentic Shaker  baskets plus a few others frequently mistaken for Shaker works. For anyone who  has ever admired the absolutely plain and forever useful Shaker baskets, this  book is both a collector's guide and a crafter's inspiration. (Hard cover  $24.95.)

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Bridge club bids for the big time SIXTY YEARS ago this year, in a recessionary climate just as bad as the current one, Ely Culbertson opened a new bridge club in New York. He called it Crockford's, after the famous London gaming club. Culbertson was by far the most flamboyant, as well as the most commercially minded, bridge player of his day. More than anyone else, he was responsible for popularising a game which is now played by millions worldwide. His dream was to start a new club where players could play high-stake rubber bridge in surroundings as elegant as those of the gaming clubs. He hoped not only to make some money, but to establish bridge as an accepted - even prestigious - part of New York social life. These are qualities which the game of bridge lacked then - and lacks still, some would argue. Sixty years on from Culbertson's new business venture, something similar is afoot in London. February saw the opening of a new bridge club, TGRs, in Hyde Park Place, just off Marble Arch. Its owners share several of the same objectives as Culbertson. Their aim, which they have backed with an investment of Pounds 500,000, is to establish a commercially-run club where bridge of a high standard can be played in comfortable surroundings. For anyone accustomed to playing golf or tennis in a competitive way, this may sound like a modest objective. But as those who have gone in search of some bridge 'action' in London can testify, it is not easy to find the right combination of high-calibre play and high-quality surroundings. There are 20 or so bridge clubs dotted around the capital. All have their own distinctive character and their own band of dedicated aficionados. However, many are united by their somewhat shabby surroundings, smoky basements and dingy rooms. Where food and drink are available, quality and service are often rudimentary. And while those who belong to the clubs are enthusiasts for the game, they are not, alas, always enthusiasts for their fellow human beings - one of the paradoxes of a game which depends on partnership rather than individual skill. That is one reason why the best high-stake bridge games in London have always tended to take place in the more sociable surroundings of Clubland rather than in bridge clubs. The most famous bridge-playing club in town is not a bridge club at all but a private club, the Portland, sometimes known as the MCC of bridge. In the bridge world it is renowned for two things. By tradition, it lays down the rules of the game, and it bans the use of any bidding conventions. It is also rather difficult to get into. The new club, named for its manager, Irving Ross, a well-known former international player, therefore marks something of a breakthrough in the development of the game in London. It may also be an early move towards the further commercialisation of a game which, while it boasts some 2m players in the UK, remains notably under-exploited compared with other popular indoor pastimes, including chess. Rose, who admits to having fallen for the lure of the green baize table at an early age, has spent most of his life playing cards and running bridge clubs. While a student at Glasgow University he entered tournaments under an assumed name to avoid the displeasure of his accountant father (himself an accomplished bridge player). For a while, he says, he led a Dostoievskian existence as a full-time gambler. Now, at the age of 53, he has decided that it is time to see if he cannot turn his long experience of bridge into a successful business. Like Culbertson before him, Rose has long harboured the idea of setting up an upmarket bridge club on a proper commercial footing. His aim, he says, is to combine the ambience and facilities of a good club with the best bridge game in town. The initial membership target - already nearly met - is 400 members and may be expanded later. The capital and the premises have been provided by two bridge-playing businessmen with property interests, Bernard Teltscher and Howard Cohen. Many of those who have already joined were previously members of the former St James' Bridge Club, where Rose was the secretary. Unlike most other clubs in London, TGRs plays rubber bridge and Chicago (an American version of rubber bridge) only. No duplicate bridge is played. It is open seven days a week. The annual membership fee is Pounds 150, with table money - the bridge players' equivalent of a green fee - on top. The club occupies two floors of a town house overlooking Hyde Park and boasts a bar, a dining room and three card-rooms. Among the things the new club has inherited is what Ross claims is the highest-stake game in London. This takes place two or three nights a week and is played for stakes of Pounds 100 a hundred - sufficient to ensure that several thousand pounds can change hands of an evening - still less, in real terms, Rose observes, than newspaper proprietors and others used to play for in the uninhibited 1960s. However, most games at TGRs are however played for more modest stakes of between Pounds 1 and Pounds 10 a hundred. The membership covers a broad cross-section of abilities, from international players to enthusiastic amateurs. A number of well-known international players take part in the Pounds 100 game. Among them, when I watched, was Zia Mahmood, a flamboyant and brilliant Pakistani who some believe is the world's best player. In a recent book, Mahmood describes how he learnt the game in London's bridge clubs after tiring of his life as a qualified accountant, 'the only profession', he declares, 'with a more boring image than bridge.' The hope of Rose and his backers is that the presence of such charismatic players will act as a magnet to visitors to London. 'What we are offering' says Rose, 'is a high class and fair game played for fun. A lot of our members love their bridge and are happy to pay to play with good players in pleasant surroundings. What we are hoping to prove is that there is a market for providing them with the kind of club that they want.' The shade of Culbertson, at least, will be nodding in approval.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Rao shifts focus to economy MR PV Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, who has been beset by the problems of inter-religious violence for the past two months, yesterday pledged to put economic reform back at the top of his agenda. There had been a 'temporary slow-down' in reform as the government's attention had been diverted by the unrest, the prime minister in a BBC television phone-in programme. But India was now making up for lost time. 'We have been concentrating even more during the last fortnight on the economic agenda. This programme has been taken up again with as much vigour as before. I have no doubt it will come back with its original speed and urgency,' Mr Rao declared. Mr Rao's remarks could raise hopes that the government's 1993-94 budget, due at the end of this month, will contain further moves to deregulate the economy and stimulate growth. The budget is widely expected to contain further moves to liberalise foreign trade, including cuts in import duties. Indian business is also lobbying for tax cuts. Mr Rao embarked on an aggressive liberalisation programme in mid-1991, but has been accused of allowing the reforms to slow down because of political difficulties last summer. During the television broadcast, the prime minister was repeatedly asked about last year's destruction of the Ayodhya mosque by Hindu militants and the violence which followed. He declared that the worst was over but there was still tension in some places, but they were 'few and far between'.</p>

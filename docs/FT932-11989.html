			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: BR lease plan for rolling stock MR ROGER Freeman, the public transport minister, said last night that British Rail is to set up new companies to take over responsibility for all its passenger rolling stock by April 1 next year. The BR passenger fleet consists of 11,000 vehicles worth about Pounds 2bn and the firms will lease vehicles to the new operators after privatisation. Mr Freeman said: 'Our provisional view is that there should be three rolling-stock companies. 'Wherever reasonably practicable franchisees should have more than one potential source of supply for rolling stock in any particular market segment,' he said.</p>

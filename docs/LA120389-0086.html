			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UGLY PAYOFF FOR PENNY-PINCHING  </P> <P> The appalling effects of state cuts in family planning clinics have become  clearer in a legislative hearing that should give Sacramento a sense of urgency  about restoring funds next month.  </P> <P> The state Department of Health Services has no count on clinic closures, but  legislative experts estimate that 36 have been forced to close, including 13 in  Los Angeles County. This is just the beginning. The $36-million family planning  appropriation that was part of the budget approved by the Legislature was cut  to $12 million by Gov. George Deukmejian. Efforts to restore the funds  foundered in September despite grave warnings about the consequences.  Legislators accused the governor of trying to bargain prison labor legislation  as part of a compromise; the governor's staff insisted that the problem was an  internal disagreement on family planning programs among members of the  Legislature.  </P> <P> The impact of the cuts on basic family programs is obvious. The result can only  be an increase in unwanted pregnancies and increased demand for abortions. In  one largely rural county, two of three clinics have closed, leaving most women  with no services. But the devastating impact extends beyond family planning  services, according to testimony Thursday before the health and welfare  subcommittee of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. The clinics play a vital  role in curtailing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS. Their  services are being crippled at a time of mounting rates of infection, including  epidemic levels of venereal diseases. The penny-pinching merely postpones costs  of caring for sickly infants that will be much higher.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the subcommittee,  has promised to introduce bipartisan legislation in January to restore the  funding. There is no alternative. A spokesman for the governor said that he is  prepared to sign any consensus agreement that emerges from the Legislature.  That is promising.  </P></p>

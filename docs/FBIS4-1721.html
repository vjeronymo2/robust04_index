			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Yang Hua (2799 5478): "A Major Accident </F> Occurs in Yangshan County, Guangdong, in Which a Truck Carrying  Arsenic Sinks Into a River"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 3 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--On the  morning of 30 March, a truck carrying poisonous arsenic suddenly  fell into Chengjia River in Yangshan County, causing a major  accident in which two metric tons of arsenic were submerged in  the river. So far it has not caused severe pollution.    The truck was owned by a company from Lianxian County. At  about 0900 on that day, the truck, which had loaded 6.2 metric  tons of arsenic in Jiangxi, headed for Lianxian County, but it  suddenly fell into the river while going through Yangshan  County. The two drivers were rescued from the river, but  approximately two metric tons of arsenic sank in the river and  disappeared.    The local government and departments concerned quickly took  resolute measures to promptly deal with the aftermath of the  accident. The public security bureaus of Yangshan County and  Qingyuan City immediately informed the departments concerned in  various localities along the river to prevent people and animals  from directly drinking water from the river. After receiving a  message from the Qingyuan City environmental protection  department, the provincial environmental protection  administration immediately informed its subordinate departments  in localities along the Lian Jiang and the Bei Jiang, including  the four cities of Qingyuan, Zhaoqing, Foshan, and Guangzhou,  urging them to more intensively monitor water quality in the two  rivers. On 1 April, experts sent by the administration were  driven to the scene and helped the local authorities deal with  the aftermath of the accident. Sanitation and disease control  departments in Yangshan, Yingde, Sanshui, Foshan, and Guangzhou  were immediately asked to more intensively measure the arsenic  content in the source of the water supplying waterworks and tap  water in various localities. Moreover, medical units in the  above-mentioned localities were asked to prepare the appropriate  antidotes.    Yesterday, almost 100 personnel salvaged the two metric tons  of arsenic for more than six hours straight, but nothing was  found. The arsenic was packed in a waterproof covering  consisting of an inner layer of plastic film and an outer layer  of a plastic mesh bag. According to experts in this field, the  type of arsenic that sank in the river does not easily dissolve  in water and hence would not cause severe pollution. The work  of salvaging the arsenic is still in progress.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Observer: Fare recompense It's not only the big shots who have been brought to book by Japan's anti-crime drive. Brief fame has just been won by a run of the mill commuter, identified only as a 39-year-old office worker from Tokyo, who achieved a national record for rail ticket fraud. For five years he travelled back and forth flashing an out-of-date rail pass, successfully trusting to the ticket collectors' inability to imagine that a worker warrior would ever do anything so uncharacteristically Japanese. When one finally challenged him, however, he made a full confession and has agreed to make reparation to Japan Railways as well as paying a fine. In all, it is costing him about Pounds 80,000.</p>

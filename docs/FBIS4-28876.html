			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- A solidarity letter  came from Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez hoping  that the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula will be resolved  peacefully through negotiations, not by pressure and strong-arm  action.    Charging that the United States of America is getting  overheated in further arming South Korea, while increasing  international pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea, he reaffirmed the opinion that a reasonable solution in  face of the explosive situation of the Korean peninsula is not a  military option but negotiation.    He, on behalf of the Cuban Government and people, expressed  the belief that the strain will surely be eased and the most  reasonable way be opened for the DPRK Government and people in  the solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula.</p>

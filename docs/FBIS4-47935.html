			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reyort by David Greybe] </F>   [Text] Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] chairman  Judge Johann Kriegler yesterday said he expected the election  results to be manipulated to resolve political disputes and  election irregularities. There was nothing wrong with this, he  said. In fact he welcomed it. "Let's not get overly squeamish  about it. They (parties) are in a power game with one another,  and if they want to settle on the basis that they withdraw  objections there's nothing wrong with it, ethically or legally,"  he said. The IEC would "certainly not stand in the way" and, if  asked, would assist.    He wanted to make one thing clear: "We (IEC) have never been  asked to certify that the result is accurate. We have been  asked to certify that the particular political process is  substantially free and fair." There would be "verneukery"  (crookery), but what mattered was its effect on the outcome of  the elections. "You can't work in a brothel and remain chaste."    With only 10 days in which to certify the elections, and  mindful that the presidential inauguration was scheduled for  Tuesday, the ordinary process for hearing complaints was "quite  clearly not available." "We have to make an assessment on  available data," Kriegler said.    IEC commissioner Dikgang Moseneke said if complaints were  not  resolved between parties, the IEC would make the final judgment.  "We have vast powers ... to make some adjustments."    The political horse trading to save the elections -- to  ensure they could be declared free and fair -- began last  Friday. A source in the President's office said that at a  crisis meeting attended by President F.W. de Klerk and ANC  president Nelson Mandela, Kriegler was offered access to state  resources to help the IEC complete its task.    Kriegler than met TEC [Transitional Executive Committee]  management committee members Cyril Ramaphosa, Roelf Meyer and  Joe Slovo. Slovo said this week that in the end it had been  decided not to assist the IEC "because it may have been  construed as the TEC taking over the IEC."    At Friday's meeting, De Klerk and Mandela initially accused  the judge of not doing his job properly, the source said. But  they decided to do everything possible to rescue the process.  "The judge admitted that the elections were a shambles," the  source said. "The meeting ended up as an exercise in damage  control."    A government source said: "They decided free and fair  elections had to be declared, come hell or high water." De  Klerk said he was worried Inkatha Freedom Party president  Mangosuthu Buthelezi would feel left out, and asked Kriegler to  call the KwaZulu leader to reassure him that the meeting had  been part of the process to keep various leaders informed.    After the meeting, Kriegler said there was no reason to  doubt  that the elections would not be free and fair. De Klerk acted  swiftly too, when, at a news conference two hours later and  broadcast live to the nation, he put beyond question any doubts  that the elections would be anything but free and fair.    Ramaphosa also poured oil on trouble waters, telling a news  conference on Saturday: "Despite all the problems that were  experienced during the election campaign we believe that the  election itself has been run on a free and fair basis, and we  would like to applaud the IEC which was charged with Mission  Impossible."</p>

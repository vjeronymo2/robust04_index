			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator of EPA with respect to those aspects of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and the Clean Air Act, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 7401  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). EPA gave its written concurrence with the proposed amendment by letter dated February 17, 1993 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;826). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Director's Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above findings, the Director approves Utah's proposed amendment as submitted on September 17, 1992, and revised on March 24, 1993. As discussed in finding No. III.C.1., the Director approves Utah's proposed amendment to the term ``affected area.'' As discussed in finding No. III.C.2., the Director approves Utah's proposed amendment to the term ``road,'' accepts Utah's withdrawal of the supplemental policy statement, and removes the required program amendments codified at 30 CFR 944.16(n) (1) and (2). As discussed in finding No. III.C.3., the Director approves Utah's proposed amendment to the term ``public road'' and removes the required program amendment at 30 CFR 944.16(o). The Director is approving these proposed rules with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(f)(1), the Director is also taking this opportunity to clarify in the required amendment section at 30 CFR 944.16 that, within 60 days of the publishing of this notice, Utah would have to either submit a proposed written amendment, or a description of an amendment to be proposed that meets the requirements of SMCRA and 30 CFR chapter VII and a timetable for enactment that is consistent with Utah's established administrative or legislative procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 944, which codify decisions concerning the Utah program, are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Procedural Determinations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Executive Order 12778 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

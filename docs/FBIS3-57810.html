			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou before a </F> Cabinet meeting in the Chamber of Deputies in Athens--live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] We are facing various  possibilities and dangers internationally, but I will not expand  on this. I will only stress: Despite secondary  imperfections--some of which concern the interests that we keep  pursuing--the GATT agreement found the international economy  taking a big step forward. The danger of the world being divided  into opposing military fronts has passed. International trade,  one of the driving forces of post- war economic progress, has  opened. But this is a long-term concern.    Now, the industrially developed areas continue to suffer  deep  economic recession. Europe, in particular, is suffering the  worst economic crisis since 1930. Production has slowed  dangerously. Some 20 million unemployed represents a social  danger that even the most conservative governments realize.    The crisis is not merely a European problem. It is also a  challenge. The European Union [EU] attempts to deal with it in  three ways: By technologically upgrading the productive  mechanism, by financing large inter-European networks, and by  creating new conditions in the workplace. We have already  rejected the third measure if it contradicts social achievements  or the employees' living conditions. The other two measures are  in the Greek and European interest. The first aims to increase  economic productivity and competitiveness. The second aims to  combat unemployment. Both measures fall within the basic  direction of our own economic policy.    There must be public discipline to deal with the  particularly  acute problems of our own economy. The solution--getting out of  the impasse--requires increased productivity and employment.  This development process offers these. These are the  development goals that we, along with our European partners,  pursue. The country's image in the region will be judged by its  success in achieving its economic goals.    Despite the difficulties, Greece today has the healthiest  economy in the Balkans. If we maintain and strengthen this  advantage, we will be in a position to offset any foreign  threat. Our side threatens no one. When we reinforce our  economy, we will be more able to play a more active role in  restoring peace and security in the area.    Greece is not only a Balkan and Mediterranean country. It is  a member of Europe with knowledge of its European mission. The  Greek Presidency will try to strengthen the EU both in the  institutional and socioeconomic sectors. In the institutional  sector, the Greek president will promote the accession of the  four new EU candidate members and cultivate the ground for  Cyprus and Malta's accession. In the socioeconomic sector, the  Presidency will try to make the GATT agreement more specific and  implement the white paper's development goals. It will do so  with some variations, but now is not the right time to expand on  these.    The Greek Presidency will raise the employment issue, trying  to place it alongside the creation of 15 million new jobs by  2000 and on the same level as monetary unification. This is our  major European goal. We proceed with a difficult but productive  period in the country's life. The horizons of 1994 for the  Greek people are: Economic development in Greece, restoring  peace and cooperation in the Balkans, and participating in the  great plan that opens the gates of the 21st century in Europe.    With the beginning of the new year, I will begin to  systematically cooperate with each ministry to formulate and  implement basic choices in various sectors of government  responsibility. With these few words, I would like to wish you  a happy new year. Thank you.</p>

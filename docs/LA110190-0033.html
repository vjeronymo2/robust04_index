			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> Stikkitty, a hard rock band from Fullerton, has won the $20,000 first prize in  an international contest for unsigned bands that was decided Sunday with a live  "battle of the bands" in Tokyo. The 16 finalists, representing 15 countries,  were alloted six minutes each to play for a panel of judges in the "Band  Explosion" festival at the Budokan Theatre, Stikkitty's manager, Jeff Gurzi,  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The panel included Bon Jovi's producer, Bruce Fairbairn, as well as David Paich  and Steve Lukather of Toto and Spike, singer for the British band London  Quireboys. The victory brings Stikkitty's winnings for the contest to $30,000  (the band won $10,000 and a free recording session with a major producer  earlier this month when it was named the U.S. champion). Stikkitty will play  Nov. 25 at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, opening for Sweet.  </P></p>

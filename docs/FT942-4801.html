			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Recruitment: Peer pressure for jobs in the City - Proving that it is not only the Names who are suffering from the continuing fall-out at Lloyd's There he was, a fully fledged peer of the realm, monogramed cufflinks, tortoise-shell spectacles, navy tie with pink spots, sitting behind a desk in an outplacement centre looking for a job. Rather like finding the Queen Mother in Ladbroke's, it just didn't seem right that a paid up member of the aristocracy should be reduced to the ranks of the unemployed. Lord Strathalmond thought differently. Out of a job at the RW Sturge Syndicate in Lloyd's, he is undergoing an outplacement course tailored to executives at KPMG Career Consultancy Services. He is better off than most. Financially, the wolf is still some way from the door. He has a network of old friends and contacts that should, in theory, be able to provide a safety net of sorts. But Strathalmond is reluctant to rely on the old school tie. He was managing director of the members agency at Sturge before it was reorganised in line with Lloyd's recommendations for members to have greater independence from their managing agents, something which Strathalmond himself supported. Now, at the age of 46, he has found himself for the first time in his life standing back and taking a long hard look at his future. The experience, he admits, is not free from fear or worry. But he is far from downhearted. 'I have always believed that change is the best sort of challenge,' he says. The outplacement was included as an optional part of his severance package. It gives him the use of an office and secretary and access to training sessions and techniques aimed at improving his chances of finding employment. As a qualified chartered accountant, Strathalmond should not find opportunities wanting, but he is concerned to find the right kind of job and has set himself a nine-month target to find a suitable position. What this may be is not yet clear but he says he is seeking a job that will best utilise his skills. 'I want something to which I can add value. I know that when it feels right I will be able to tell.' Strathalmond's position demonstrates that unemployment is no longer the preserve of the unskilled or unqualified. He is, however, obtaining the kind of help with job search not normally provided for the laid-off production worker. The executive programme at KPMG provides private offices and secretaries on a separate floor of the consultancy. The idea is to provide a more sophisticated outplacement service, partly to sooth the bruised pride of losing a top job, and partly in recognition that the shock of losing the trappings of position can often be as severe as that of losing the job itself. Other job-seeking managers and staff work in an open plan office environment where all have access to telephones, a research department and various classes, such as programmes on telephone technique or negotiating skills. One obvious benefit of this arrangement is that all also have access to each other to share their experiences. One of the most striking impressions of outplacement is that it helps restore morale and gives people time to think about their future careers. Roger Shipton, a consultancy partner, said: 'Getting another job is not as difficult as some people suggest but it is critical that people take the time to assess what they particularly want to do. That way they are more likely to find the right job.' Opting for change Worried about your executive share options? There is nothing to fear, according to a new survey which shows they are alive and kicking in spite of shareholder criticisms of executives cashing in on huge share price multiples that tended to flatter their individual performance record. There is evidence that some companies are dithering about what scheme to offer next after the institutional backlash last year that led the two big institutional bodies, the National Association of Pension Funds and the Association of British Insurers, to lay down criteria for performance conditions on the exercise of options. The vast majority of those renewing schemes, however, are now including performance conditions. An analysis of shareholder documents issued since mid-July and the end of May found that 39 of the top 350 UK-listed companies have asked shareholders to renew their 10-year-old schemes. Only three of the companies said they were not imposing performance conditions on the options. Surprisingly 11 companies asked for and obtained approvals from shareholders for unspecific schemes although the boards gave assurances that they would include conditions. New Bridge Consultants, which carried out the survey, ventured that most of these were probably waiting to see what other companies were doing before committing themselves. Of the 25 companies which have stated their condition, most - 64 per cent of them - have chosen Earnings Per Share as a performance measure. Some 16 per cent of the companies are using share price and 20 per cent have opted for the concept of total shareholder return (growth in share price plus dividends). The study also looked at the targets chosen by companies and although the information was unclear in 13 per cent of companies using EPS, the vast majority - 87 per cent - are measuring its growth against the Retail Prices Index. Of those companies, 71 per cent use a formula of RPI plus 2 per cent per annum over a three-year period. Among them are Coats Viyella, Forte and Cadbury Schweppes. Companies using share price or total shareholder return measure against various indicators. The most popular is one of the main FT indexes (45 per cent), used by Inchcape, Tarmac and Guinness among others. Of the rest, 11 per cent compare performance against a sector, 11 per cent against RPI and 22 per cent against a mixture of an FT Index and RPI. David Tankel, New Bridge Street Consultants director, said: 'It may surprise some people that earnings per share has come top of the heap. A lot of people have been expecting other measures to take over but it is not dead yet.' Information about the report can be obtained from the consultancy, tel 071 236 1086. For motivation A comment that emerged time and again among veterans at the D-Day commemorations was that 'We felt we were doing something worthwhile.' Imagine if it were possible to replicate in peacetime the human effort and ingenuity arising out of necessity in wartime. Unfortunately too few managements today appear to consider motivation beyond different pay arrangements. A survey carried out by the MSF technical union among employees of insurance companies found that less than a sixth of them believed that their managements motivated them to perform well. Only 18 per cent thought their performance assessment system was fair and fewer still - 15 per cent - thought promotion was carried out fairly and three-quarters of them thought training was inadequate. Only 21 per cent believed their company treated employees with respect, while only 18.2 per cent considered that management information could be trusted. If this is reflected in other sectors it is perhaps understandable why the veterans remember not just those who died but their achievements with pride. There is little to match their endeavours today.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Abrosimov] </F>   [Text] Sofia April 28 TASS -- "We had meetings with  representatives of all sides involved in the Bosnian conflict  and, judging by their stands, now it is difficult to expect any  definite solution to the dramatic situation", Deputy Chairman of  the Duma's Defence Committee, Head of the Russian State Duma  delegation Nikolay Bezborodov told in an interview with  ITAR-TASS. The delegation made a brief stopover in the  Bulgarian capital on its way from Belgrade to Moscow.    According to Bezborodov, "a way out" might be found at a  summit meeting between representatives of the international  community, the possibility of which is now being discussed.  However, such a meeting must not be reduced to "dictate from  the position of force", he said.    Commenting on mass media reports on manifistations of "great  Serbian chauvinism", Bezborodov said that such reports are often  of a propagandist character. "We have seen no such  manifistations", he said. On the contrary, we can speak of  biased coverage of the situation in former Yugoslavia, when all  the blame is put on one side only, the lawmaker stressed. Other  deputies also share this point of view saying it is necessary to  assess the situation in former Yugoslavia on the basis of a just  and objective approach.    The Russian lawmakers believe that now another problem is  becoming more acute, i.e. lifting of U.N. sanctions against  the Republic of Yugoslavia which affect not only Yugoslavia but  other Balkan countries as well.</p>

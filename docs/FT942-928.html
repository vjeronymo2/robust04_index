			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Work and benefits The greatest challenge facing the member states of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is to expand employment opportunities. In most OECD countries, unemployment has become entrenched at unacceptable levels which waste human resources and strain the social fabric. Rolling it back should be the top priority for governments. Welfare states need to be 're-engineered' so that they do not block the creation of jobs. Much of the growth in the labour market is in low-paid, part-time and casual work. Yet welfare states continue to reflect the less flexible working patterns of earlier decades. They are largely designed to support male breadwinners during periods of temporary unemployment. As a result, benefits are often so high that they discourage the unemployed from taking low-paid work. Any income earned by wives is deducted from the benefits paid to their husbands. And the rates at which benefits are withdrawn as income rises leaves those who take part-time work little or no better off. Welfare benefits thus trap their recipients outside today's more flexible labour markets, rather than helping them back into work. The OECD Jobs Study, published earlier this month, set out a menu of options for reforming welfare states to promote employment. These included widening the gap between benefit levels and after-tax earnings, linking benefits to participation in programmes for getting people back into work and earnings supplements for low-paid jobs. The UK is among the OECD members that have gone furthest in adopting such policies. But much more needs to be done, as a recent study from the Labour party's Commission on Social Justice showed. The bureaucracy involved in the social security system discourages the unemployed from taking up the jobs on offer. Those who take low-paid jobs must endure weeks of financial insecurity before they receive family credit, the in-work income supplement. And the partners of unemployed men cannot take any sort of work without losing most of their earnings in reduced benefits. Better administration of benefits would help reduce these disincentives. But the benefits system needs to be radically shaken up to support people through periods of partial employment and low-paid work as well as during unemployment. The aim should be to ensure that those who take any form of work enjoy higher incomes. The UK government's decision to introduce a new jobseeker's allowance for the unemployed from 1996 provides an opportunity for such re-engineering. Yet as a result of a turf war between ministers, responsibility for the new allowance is to be divided between two government agencies. This classic Whitehall compromise - complemented by the existing three-way split of training responsibilities - is a missed opportunity for which the unemployed will pay the price.</p>

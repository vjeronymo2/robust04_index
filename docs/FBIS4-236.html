			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Craig Doonan and Clive Govender] </F>   [Excerpts] Durban April 5 SAPA -- At least 88 people have  been confirmed killed in six days as violence continues to sweep  the politically charged Natal/kwaZulu region despite last  Thursday's declaration of a state of emergency. The toll could  climb as reports from far-flung rural settlements only reach  police liaison officials days later.    Natal unrest monitor and academic Mary de Haas on Tuesday  reported 16 additional weekend deaths in northern Natal  townships and rural areas which police have not yet confirmed.    Police reports put the toll at 88 since last Thursday -- a  staggering average of 14 killings a day under emergency rule.    Violence in Natal has reached unprecedented levels with 300  deaths reported in March -- the highest in the province in  several years. [passage omitted]    The confirmed death toll following violence in kwaMashu near  Durban on Sunday night has risen to 12, the KZP [kwaZulu Police]  reported on Tuesday, adding seven to the earlier report of five  hostel dwellers killed. Capt Zakwe said the latest killings  were linked to the ongoing political feud which erupted in the  township after "Zulu royalists" occupied the venue of an African  National Congress rally three weeks ago.    In other recent reports, kwaMashu police said another person  was shot dead in the township on Monday night.    Four youths were gunned down at Folweni south of Durban,  also  on Monday night.    The badly decomposed body of a man was found in Esikhawini  on  the north coast on Sunday night. [passage omitted]    Pietermaritzburg police spokesman Maj Henry Budhram said two  people were killed after a "kangaroo court" hearing on Saturday.  He said both men were tied to a chair and set alight at  Maphumulo near Greytown.    The KZP also reported the killing of a man in Mpumalanga  near  Durban at the weekend. He was shot.</p>

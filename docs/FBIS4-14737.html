			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk cancelled the  resolution of Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov on military  service of conscripts -- citizens of the Crimea dated March 15.    Kravchuk's decree made public on Saturday said that  Meshkov's  order contradicts to Ukraine's Constitution and to the decrees  on the division of authorities between the state power bodies of  Ukraine and Crimea, on Ukraine's defense and military service.    The document points out that "the determination of the arms  of the service stationed on the republic's territory, training  and distribution of military personnel "is the competence of  Ukraine's Armed Forces."    The same day Kravchuk appointed Nikolay Hlushko his envoy in  Sevastopol, having released him from the post of the first  deputy head of the Sevastopol city administration.    Some time earlier Kravchuk submitted Hlushko's candidacy to  the city council's session for consideration, however, half of  the permanent commissions of the Sevastopol city council was  against his appointment.</p>

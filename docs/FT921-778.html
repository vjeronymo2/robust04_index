			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Aerospatiale moves into black AEROSPATIALE, the French state-owned aircraft and missile group, yesterday reported a sharp swing into profit, but warned that the outlook was worrying. The group made a FFr213m (Dollars 37.7m) net profit last year, against a FFr396m loss in 1990, on sales up 16 per cent to FFr48.6bn. The rise was led by an increase in deliveries by Airbus, the European aircraft consortium of which Aerospatiale is a leading partner. However, the French group's orders had fallen 50 per cent to FFr35bn, said Mr Henri Martre, the chairman. Orders now stand at just over two-and-a-half-years' work. Orders were affected 'by the atmosphere of crisis which has dominated the market all year, the fall in air traffic, company losses, the general economic slowdown and budgetary restrictions which have brought about the greatest caution among buyers,' he said. Aerospatiale's experience is in line with the gloomy outlook for rest of the French aerospace industry. According to Gifas, the industry's trade body, the French aerospace industry's overall order book fell 30 per cent to FFr235bn last year, reflecting a decline in both military and commercial orders. Gifas expects sales to fall 25 per cent in real terms by 1995, with heavy reductions in the number of people working in the sector, currently 118,300. Mr Martre said Aerospatiale had aircraft orders for three to four years, depending on whether clients confirmed options, but the outlook was 'more worrying' for the helicopter and missiles divisions. Aerospatiale last year pooled its helicopter business with MBB of Germany.</p>

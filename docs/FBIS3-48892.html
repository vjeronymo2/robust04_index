Sanjaasuren  has notified the chairman and the vice chairman of the  parliament and the prime minister that in case these high  officials not made clear conclusions he is ready to make public  new facts telling about their involvement in corruption and  contacts with secret services of some foreign states. In this  way the former chief of the counterintelligence who has been  removed recently from the office expressed his readiness to  complete "the case." L. Sanjaasuren started from fact than at  the end of the last year he has held a press conference at which  he informed that there are materials documents in his department  telling about possible contacts of the above mentioned high  officials with foreign secret services. The parliament working  group on investigation of this information has not revealed any  signs telling about liquidation of these materials as L.  Sanjaasuren supposed in this connection. Colonel L. Sanjaasuren  had to announce that a special system of concealing improper  deeds of state high officials is already formed in the country.  As far as the parliament speaker N. Bagadandi, vice speaker J.  Gombojav, and the Prime Minister P. Jasray are concerned they  are resolutely rejecting the charges of L. Sanjaasuren and the  press.</p>

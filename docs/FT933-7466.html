			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Estate agents turn a profit on property-chain deals: A look at surveyors' success in riding the housing cycle THIS WEEK marked a turning point in the British high street. The traditional estate agent is making a comeback. Six years after many chartered surveyors sold businesses to mortgage lenders and life assurance companies, they are buying them back at a fraction of those inflated prices. The two biggest winners of the economic cycle in housing emerged this week when Mr Bill McClintock and Mr Tony Snarey bought the 347-branch Cornerstone chain for Pounds 8m from Abbey National, the bank. That is a tenth of the price per branch that Royal Life paid for Mr Snarey's previous chain in 1986. There is more to come. Bristol &amp; West, the building society, is trying to sell 147 branches and is finding the only buyers in the market are the chartered surveyors who sold at the top of the cycle. Like the new owners of Cornerstone, many are seeking financial backing from life insurers in return for product ties. Mr McClintock and Mr Snarey epitomise the traditional agents who rely on working long hours to make the maximum number of sales. Mr Snarey started his career with Harrods 35 years ago before joining the William H Brown chain in the 1960s, helping build it to 250 offices. Although Cornerstone lost Pounds 2m in the first half of this year, Mr Snarey thinks a spot of traditional management should return it to profit. He said: 'The way that estate agents work does not fit too kindly with corporate ownership. It clashes with the entrepreneurial spirit that they need.' After the millions - perhaps more than Pounds 1bn - lost by the corporate owners of estate agents in the past six years, Mr Snarey's assertion does not raise too much controversy. Mr Tony FitzSimons, Bristol &amp; West's chief executive, said that the management methods of building societies were alien to agencies. He added: 'The traditional agent makes all his money from sales, from piling it high and selling it cheap. He will work 14 hours a day and under-price his own time. A corporation cannot do that.' Mr FitzSimons said that Bristol &amp; West was negotiating with other chartered surveyors for its own branches. Mr Snarey said there were more secrets to estate agency than simply working long hours. One was that it was wrong to impose a single culture. He added: 'A chain should be a sort of confederation of independent people who can work together under the same name but use their own styles.' He insisted that the quality which consumers found irritating - estate agents' persistence - was the thing which achieved sales. He said: 'You have to give people their head and let them develop. As soon as people are put in a bureaucracy and told to report to the centre, they become number counters and not sellers.' Mr Snarey and Mr McClintock managed to ride the housing cycle cleverly. They sold the independent chains in which they were partners amid the hysteria of corporate buying in the late 1980s. The buyers in that market later found that they had bought far less than they imagined. Most estate agency chains amount to little more than a set of shop leases, and a brand. Abbey National has written off Pounds 141m of accounting 'goodwill' on Cornerstone - the amount it paid on top of the value of the physical assets. It has lost Pounds 90m in operating Cornerstone over six years. Meanwhile, Mr Snarey and Mr McClintock sat out the period of loss-making corporate ownership of estate agents as the joint chief executives of Royal Life Estates, the chain that was formed from their two businesses. With hindsight, perhaps the large corporations should have seen it coming. If there was one transaction on which an estate agent might have been expected to turn a profit, it was in selling property. And as they re-emerge it is logical to believe that the market is turning once more. Mr Snarey is confident that he and his partner have not paid too much. He said: 'It may be that we are at the bottom of the cycle now, and we may even see some upturn.' The years away from his own estate agency have not dimmed his faith in the value of owning your own property.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Arts: Varady in 'Otello' - Vienna Opera On Saturday Julia Varady sang her first Desdemona at the Vienna State Opera, which provided her with with a well-worn production by Peter Wood, and a seasoned Otello and Iago. Or rather, perhaps, over-seasoned in the case of Vladimir Atlantov, and under-seasoned in that of Renato Bruson. Neither of them seemed remotely inclined to adjust his standard performance to his colleagues. Atlantov bawled at unstinting volume - sometimes effectively, but sometimes pitched wild - and hammed in a manner one had thought long gone; Bruson stamped gruffly through his role, a solid character without subtlety. In the circumstances Miss Varady made a brave but qualified impression. Her keenly focused voice made her partners sound rough, and passages in the mezzo range told more strongly than lighter-voiced sopranos can make them do. Her musical intentions were admirably precise, her dignity impeccable. In the other hand, she cannot pass for Italian; her timbre does not float, and the curves in her line never suggested lyrical innocence - at some cost to the essential pathos. Her brimming vitality and self-possession do not make an ideal Desdemona. As Emilia, Roderigo and Montano, Margarita Lilova, Wilfried Gahmlich and Claudio Otelli were all more than competent. Benedikt Kobel, singing his first Cassio here, cut an unusually personable young figure  - a plausible ladies'-man, for once - though his tenor began to display some colour and ring only in Act 3. The Vienna chorus stood in lines and walked through their well-trodden moves without excitement; the Vienna Philharmonic offered moments of beautiful playing, though Adam Fischer's conducting was unequal to the full range of Verdi's great score. He and Bruson wrong-footed one another throughout the evening.</p>

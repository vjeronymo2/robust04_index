			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CHRONOLOGY OF THE SUPREME COURT'S MAJOR ABORTION DECISIONS  </P> <P> Jan. 22, 1973 -- In Roe vs. Wade, the court for the first time legalized  abortion nationwide. The opinion, written by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, was  based on a 7-2 ruling on a woman's constitutional right to privacy.  </P> <P> A woman's decision to have an abortion during the first three months of  pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor.  </P> <P> States may interfere in the abortion decision during the second trimester only  to protect the woman's health, and may take steps only to protect fetal life in  the third trimester.  </P> <P> State authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester was not made  absolute, however.  </P> <P> Jan. 22, 1973 -- In Roe vs. Bolton the court that same day struck down, by a  7-2 vote, restrictions on facilities that could be used to perform abortions.  </P> <P> The decision gave rise to a new kind of medical facility, the abortion clinic.  </P> <P> July 1, 1976 -- In Planned Parenthood vs. Danforth, the court, by a 6-3 vote,  limited rights of husbands and by a 5-4 vote limited rights of parents of  pregnant minors  </P> <P> States cannot give husbands veto power over their pregnant wives' decision to  abort their pregnancies.  </P> <P> Neither can parents of minor, unwed girls be given an absolute veto.  </P> <P> June 20, 1977 -- In Maher vs. Roe, the court voting 6-3, ruled that states have  no legal obligation to pay for "non-therapeutic" abortions.  </P> <P> Jan. 9, 1979 -- In Colautti vs. Franklin, reached by a 6-3 vote, the court  reaffirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion in determining the  timing of "fetal viability" -- when a fetus can live outside the mother's womb.  </P> <P> States may seek to protect a fetus that has reached viability but that  determination is up to doctors, not courts or legislatures.  </P> <P> July 2, 1979 -- In Bellotti vs. Baird, the court by an 8-1 vote elaborated on  its parental consent decision of 1976.  </P> <P> It implied that states may be able to require a pregnant, unmarried minor to  obtain parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides an  alternative procedure to parental approval, such as letting the minor seek a  state judge's approval instead.  </P> <P> June 30, 1980 -- In Harris vs. McRae, the so-called Hyde Amendment was upheld  by a 5-4 vote.  </P> <P> The ruling held that the federal government and individual states are under no  legal obligation to pay for even medically necessary abortions sought by women  on welfare.  </P> <P> March 23, 1981 -- In H.L. vs. Matheson, the court ruled by a 6-3 vote that  states may require doctors consulted by some young girls -- those still  dependent on their parents and too "immature" to decide for themselves -- to  try to inform parents before performing an abortion.  </P> <P> June 15, 1983 -- In three decisions called City of Akron vs. Akron Center for  Reproductive Health, Planned Parenthood of Kansas City vs. Ashcroft and  Simopolous vs. Virginia, the court, 6-3, ruled states and local communities may  not require all abortions for women more than three months pregnant to be  performed in a hospital.  </P> <P> The court also struck down regulations that imposed a 24-hour waiting period  between the signing of an abortion consent form and the medical procedure and  required doctors to tell women seeking an abortion that a fetus is a "human  life."  </P> <P> June 11, 1986 -- In Thornburgh vs. American College of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists, the court, by 5-4, struck down Pennsylvania abortion rules  similar to those rejected in 1983.  </P> <P> It also struck down requirements that doctors performing third-trimester  abortions, which are rare, use procedures least risky to a fetus capable of  surviving outside the womb, and that two doctors attend abortions performed in  the third trimester.  </P> <P> Invalidated a regulation requiring doctors to make a record, which could become  available to the public, of every abortion they perform.  </P> <P> Ruled states may not require doctors to inform women seeking abortions about  potential risks and about available medical assistance benefits for prenatal  care and childbirth.  </P> <P> Dec. 14, 1987 -- In Hartigan vs. Zbaraz, the court split 4-4. The effect was to  invalidate an Illinois law that could have made abortions more difficult to  obtain for some teen-agers.  </P> <P> 1988 Right to Life advocates parade outside Supreme Court, at left.  </P> <P> June 11, 1986 -- In Thornburgh vs. American College of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists, the court voted 5-4 to strike down Pennsylvania abortion  regulations somewhat similar to those it invalidated in 1983.  </P> <P> The court also struck down requirements that doctors performing third-trimester  abortions, which are rare, use procedures least risky to a fetus capable of  surviving outside the womb, and that two doctors always be present for  abortions performed in the third trimester.  </P> <P> Invalidated a regulation requiring doctors to make a record, which could become  available to the public, of every abortion they perform.  </P> <P> Ruled states may not require doctors to inform women seeking abortions about  potential risks and about available medical assistance benefits for prenatal  care and childbirth.  </P> <P> Dec. 14, 1987 -- In Hartigan vs. Zbaraz, the court split 4-4. The effect was to  invalidate an Illinois law that could have made abortions more difficult to  obtain for some teen-agers.  </P> <P> July 3, 1989: The court upholds a Missouri law requiring doctors to determine,  when possible, whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is "viable," or capable of  surviving outside the womb. Missouri law bans abortions of viable fetuses.  </P> <P> The court also says Missouri may ban public health care providers from  assisting abortions not necessary to save women's lives, and it may ban public  hospitals and other taxpayer-supported facilities from providing abortions not  necessary to save women's lives.  </P> <P> Finally, the court upholds Missouri's right to ban the use of tax money for  "encouraging or counseling" women to have abortions not necessary to save their  lives.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SCORECARD: HOW THE JUSTICES VOTED  </P> <P> On the narrow issues posed by Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, the  court split 5 to 4 in upholding most controversial provisions of a Missouri law  regulating abortion. More generally, most of the justices addressed whether  they would overturn or modify Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized  abortion.  </P> <P> Here is how the court divided:  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.11IN:3.43IN:3.76IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Should the Missouri  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Should Roe vs. Wade  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> abortion restrictions  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> be overturned or  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Justices  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> be upheld?  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> narrowed?  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Scalia  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Yes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Overturned  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Rehnquist  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Yes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Narrowed, but previously  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> had said overturned  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> White  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Yes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Narrowed, but previously  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> had said overturned  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Kennedy  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Yes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Narrowed  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> O'Connor  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Yes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> No comment  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Blackmun  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> No  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> No  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Brennan  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> No  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> No  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Marshall  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> No  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> No  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Stevens  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> No  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> No  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

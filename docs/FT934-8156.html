			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Minister commends Welsh results MORE PUPILS in Wales achieved five or more GCSE passes with A to C grades this year than in 1992, with the proportion rising from a third to 37 per cent. Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, yesterday described this performance as a 'marked improvement'. He said there had also been an increase in the proportion of 15-year-olds entering an examination at the GCSE or CoE level, with the numbers rising to more than 19 in 20. Of these pupils 94 per cent, a rise of 1 percentage point, passed at least one examination. The examination results for Wales, which are published today, show that the proportion of pupils attaining five or more GCSE passes with A to C grades was lowest in Mid Glamorgan. The county, which includes the towns of Merthyr Tydfil and Bridgend, scored only 29 per cent compared with the highest score of 44 per cent in the south-western rural county of Dyfed. The second highest score, of 40 per cent, was returned by another rural county, Powys. At A and AS level, Mid Glamorgan was also bottom on a new measure of achievement converting grades into points, while Powys came top of this category. Overall, 14 per cent of Welsh pupils achieved points equivalent to gaining A level passes with A to C grades, and 6 per cent achieved the equivalent of at least three grade A results. Students at all Wales' further education and sixth form colleges achieved no more points on average than the schools in Mid Glamorgan. Among independent schools, pupils at St Michael's School in Dyfed scored 100 per cent in achieving at least five GCSE passes with A to C grades, but only 26 pupils at the school entered. In the principality as a whole the most successful independent schools at this level included Howell's School in South Glamorgan (95 per cent from a total of 79 pupils) and Monmouth School in Gwent (95 per cent, 93 pupils). The most successful state schools at GCSE level were Cardiff High School (72 per cent, 160 pupils); Gyfun Bro Hyrddin at Carmarthen (71 per cent, 83 pupils); and Bishopston Comprehensive, Swansea (67 per cent, 184 pupils). At A level the average points score for all Welsh schools was 14. Among independent schools results were highly variable. The highest point scores were achieved by Haberdashers Monmouth School for Girls, Gwent (23); St Michael's School, Dyfed (22); and St Gerards School Trust, Gwynedd (22). The grant-maintained Stanwell Comprehensive School in South Glamorgan scored 21. Among state schools at A level the most successful were Caereinion High School at Llanfair Caereinion, Powys (22); Denbigh High School in Clwyd (20); and Croesyceiliog Comprehensive at Cwmbran (19). Of colleges, the best A level results on the points basis were scored by Gorseinon College in West Glamorgan, with 306 students achieving an average score of 16 points.</p>

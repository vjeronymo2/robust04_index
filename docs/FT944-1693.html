			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Gangs move into bootleg beer business: Protection rackets put pressure on pub landlords to allow illegal sales Criminal gangs that run pub protection rackets are reported to be muscling in on Britain's booming business in cross-Channel bootlegging by intimidating inner-city pub landlords. Bootleggers have told some Sunderland and Newcastle licensees to co-operate in making it easier to distribute illegally imported beer, according to Mr Frank Nicholson, managing director of Vaux, the Sunderland-based brewer and pub owner. The government has refused to cut import duties on alcoholic drinks and tobacco to make imports from France less lucrative. And it has played down reports that organised crime has infiltrated beer bootlegging, although it recognises the problem exists with tobacco imports. However, Mr Nicholson says, there is clear evidence that some bootlegging is being organised by the criminals who run pub protection rackets. 'I am alarmed because it is a new element to an old vice, and the avenues to do it are very easy to exploit. It is a neat extension of their business,' he said. Bootleggers have 'suggested' actions to some Vaux licensees. The most popular include: selling smuggled beer in their bars; turning a blind eye to it being sold in their car parks; and opening their pubs later than usual to ensure more people are at home when the bootleggers take a sales trip around the neighbourhood. 'I have seen myself bootleggers selling beer from a van outside one of our Sunderland pubs,' said Mr Nicholson. 'The pub car park is a good meeting point.' Protection racketeers often threaten landlords with violence or damage to their property, although Mr Nicholson said he was not yet aware of any bootleg-related violence. Typical consequences of failure to comply with protection rackets are damage to property and starting fights in bars. Rumours of intimidation by bootleggers began to circulate in the trade earlier this year, but Mr Nicholson is the first brewer to go on the record about the problems his landlords face. A London brewer told Mr Nicholson of a similar experience in Croydon, south London, when they met at the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association earlier this week. Mr Nicholson, who said the problem was confined to tough, inner-city neighbourhoods, has also had direct reports of intimidation in Manchester. 'Organised gangs and intimidation are an inevitable part of bootlegging,' the association said. The brewing industry estimates that some 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent of beer sold in Britain - or some 15 per cent of beer consumed at home - is imported from France. Vaux encourages its landlords to tell it about cases of intimidation, bootlegging and protection rackets so it can work with the police to stamp them out. But Mr Nicholson said he was sympathetic to those who did not want to talk to the brewery because of the dangers. He says the solution is two-fold: the government must reduce the financial attractions of bootlegging, while brewers and publicans must work with the police to combat crime.</p>

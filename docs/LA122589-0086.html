In  the first announced reduction of its flight schedule since Eastern began  rebuilding from a crippling strike, the carrier said it will reduce daily  flights to 803 from 830 on Jan. 31. That will reduce Eastern's departures from  its Miami home base to 51 from 78. In a message to employees, Eastern said:  "Some furloughs may be necessary as we reduce operations."  </P></p>

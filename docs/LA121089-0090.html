			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREEWAY PROJECT  </P> <P> On behalf of the District 7 office of Caltrans and, in particular our field  personnel assigned to the Ventura Freeway rehabilitation project, I want to  express our sincere thanks to Rick Schutt of Camarillo for his letter "Ventura  Freeway," Nov. 24.  </P> <P> As regular users of Route 101 probably realize, before a shovel was lifted to  begin work last year, a lot of pre-planning went into our effort to keep  motorists moving while construction was in progress.  </P> <P> We accomplished that goal through our eight-point traffic management plan which  was a first-ever for Caltrans and the state of California.  </P> <P> One of the key elements of that plan concerned providing a frontage road for  those traveling eastbound on Route 101 from the Conejo Valley to Warner Center.  This road -- which connected with Ventura Boulevard -- allowed thousands of  motorists to bypass the construction zone on the freeway.  </P> <P> Another area where motorists helped make our job easier was through the  voluntary use of van/car-pools which also reduced congestion. I know many  commuters thought they would be caught in a waking "nightmare" while  construction was under way. Instead -- the opposite occurred. Not only did  traffic move through the work site, but motorists were able to experience more  free-flow as compared to pre-construction weekday, stop-and-go driving.  </P> <P> The success of Phase I has been very gratifying for us. I know we have the  community and elected officials to thank and many others -- their cooperation  made our success possible.  </P> <P> After the first of January, Phase II will get under way to add a lane in each  direction of Route 101 from Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood to Wilbur  Avenue in Tarzana. This $40-million 15-mile project will also include bridge  work and asphalt concrete paving.  </P> <P> JERRY B. BAXTER  </P> <P> District 7 Director  </P> <P> Caltrans, Los Angeles  </P></p>

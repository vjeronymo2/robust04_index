			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV'S SUCCESS IS IN U.S. INTEREST  </P> <P> The reaction of the Bush Administration to the Gorbachev revolution has  vacillated between stunned disbelief and grudging approval. The most repeated  expression is "prudent caution." This is astounding, because Mikhail S.  Gorbachev has already fulfilled the Cold War goals of the United States and  gives promise of moving to levels of freedom and democracy beyond our wildest  expectations. It is contrary to U.S. interests that Gorbachev should fail or be  replaced, yet President George Bush has not made the decision to assist him  actively.  </P> <P> The Grand Tetons subsummit meeting may have ended the foot-dragging on  disarmament, because the agreement to hold the first Bush-Gorbachev summit in  mid-1990 will provide incentive for action in both conventional and strategic  force negotiations. Yet a strange reluctance persists -- to acknowledge that  mutual verified disarmament is as much in U.S. interests as the Soviets'.  </P> <P> Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger's recent speech (Opinion,  Sept. 24) -- crafted with White House approval -- reflects the confusion within  the Administration. Eagleburger said we should stick to the policies of the  past 40 years until the Gorbachev reforms become irreversible. He said U.S.  policies should be devised to serve our interests, whether Gorbachev succeeds  or fails. This boggling conclusion demonstrates that the Bush Administration  has not made up its collective mind -- unlike Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  of Britain and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, who are both  enthusiastic supporters of Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Such timidity in lending support represents the counsel of disaster. Gorbachev  is leader of democratic reform in the East and if he is toppled the chances for  those reforms probably will be lost.  </P> <P> Now it may be that some of the Bush Administration's caution is inspired by the  right wing of the Republican Party. There are politicians and pundits who hope  Gorbachev will be overthrown and the Soviet system replaced by capitalism. Some  would like to see a civil war between the various nationalities because that  might hasten the collapse of the Soviet government. Others believe the Soviet  economy is so weak that the United States should pursue a policy of unrelenting  pressure for ever more concessions.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the Bush Administration recognizes that these positions are naive,  because the alternative to Gorbachev -- rather than democracy and capitalism --  is likely to be totalitarians of the right or left. The Bush Administration has  been careful not to undermine Gorbachev. In fact, during Boris N. Yeltsin's  recent visit, the White House decided not to grant photo opportunities for fear  of offending Gorbachev. Bush says he wants to end the Cold War and move beyond  containment. He says he wishes Gorbachev well and hopes his perestroika will  succeed. But he goes on to say that there is little the United States can do to  help. Either the President is badly briefed or he is less than candid. For the  United States can help Gorbachev enormously while also helping itself.  </P> <P> Gorbachev wants to disarm rapidly. He wants to cut his defense budget 50% by  1995, and another 50% by the end of the decade. He wants to demilitarize  competition with the West to eliminate the possibility of war, and he also  needs the resources that would become available for consumer production. Since  he is already in the process of a 14% cut in defense, why doesn't he make the  full 50% reduction by unilateral action? The answer to that is key to  understanding the process of the Gorbachev revolution.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has been performing an amazing political balancing act. His goal has  been to restructure Soviet society while eliminating the totalitarian forces of  Stalinism and neo-Stalinism. Given the entrenched bureaucracy, the odds against  Gorbachev were immense. But after only 4 1/2 years we see almost unbelievable  progress. All the neo-Stalinists and most of the orthodox Marxist-Leninists  have been eliminated from the Politburo and the Communist Party secretariat.  The remaining hard-liners in the Central Committee are expected to be removed  at next year's party congress. In February or March of 1990, elections for  local soviets -- bodies to run day-to-day affairs -- will be held with multiple  candidates and secret ballots. Observers anticipate that most of the rascals --  meaning the party hacks -- will be thrown out.  </P> <P> The new Congress of Peoples Deputies and its operating arm, the new Supreme  Soviet, includes among its elected members the greatest dissident, Andrei D.  Sakharov, and Yeltsin, who was fired from the Politburo by Gorbachev. Both  Sakharov and Yeltsin, though supporters of Gorbachev, have made private trips  to the United States where they criticized Gorbachev for holding too much power  and moving too slowly with reforms. This summer, five deputies from the Supreme  Soviet spent a month with members of the U.S. Congress and their staffs,  learning about legislative procedures -- especially voting processes, the Ways  and Means Committee, the Intelligence Oversight Committees and the General  Accounting Office. A minority block of the Soviet Peoples Deputies is  supporting pluralism in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The removal of Stalinist repression on non-Russian nationalities has uncovered  smoldering ethnic hostility and demands for national autonomy. In the Baltic  states, the demands are for national independence. The nationalities problem is  certain to join production of consumer goods as Gorbachev's greatest challenge.  He will very likely move to a federal system, granting wide autonomy to the  national republics.  </P> <P> In foreign policy, Gorbachev has withdrawn from Afghanistan, rejecting further  expansionism plus renouncing the theories of class struggle and military  support for liberation movements. He has removed Marxist-Leninist ideology from  Soviet foreign policy -- tolerating the formation of a non-communist government  in Poland and the emergence of political pluralism in Hungary. He has been  critical of neo-Stalinism in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Cuba.  </P> <P> All this has been accomplished while facing the risk of losing his balance.  Some say Gorbachev has moved too fast, others too slow. Some say Gorbachev is  the greatest politician-statesman since World War II. Certainly what has  happened so far is clearly in the interest of the United States. But Gorbachev  cannot go much further with unilateral disarmament and remain in power. Even  his supporters in the military and KGB would oppose such action. No Western  power would disarm unilaterally. There has to be reciprocity; disarmament that  can be reliably verified is just as much in the interest of the United States  as the Soviet Union. The savings will do wonders for the U.S. deficit, and our  security will be enhanced.  </P> <P> A major benefit will accrue to both the United States and the Soviet Union from  disarmament: the freeing of scientific and technological brainpower. The  Pentagon and the Department of Energy have employed many of the best U.S.  scientists for military research and development. From 1981 to 1988, the  Pentagon more than doubled its spending in universities and research  laboratories. An important reason the Japanese have acquired such an advantage  in certain consumer areas has been the diversion of so much U.S. technology to  defense programs.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has suggested joint talks between leaders of the military-industrial  complexes of both nations about the details of converting military plants to  civilian production. This is an important area where the United States can  provide advice. The process of conversion will be more difficult for the  Soviets because their military plants don't have experience with civilian  production, compared with large U.S. military producers such as General  Electric and Boeing.  </P> <P> The major assistance the United States can provide for Gorbachev will result  from increasing the pace of disarmament, but the Soviet Union also needs U.S.  technical assistance and technology in everything from agricultural to tourism.  Further, the United States should liberalize its export-licensing policy,  limiting controls only to goods and technology with clear military application.  Restrictions on immigration from the Soviet Union have been removed, so the  President should use his authority to grant most favored nations tariff status.  Bush should act now to help Gorbachev survive and succeed.  </P></p>

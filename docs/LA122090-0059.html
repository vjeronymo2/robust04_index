			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Royals Go Gulfing: Soldiers in Saudi Arabia may have wanted to see Brooke  Shields, but will have to settle for Prince Charles, who will be jetting in  this weekend to visit British troops. The trip was Charles' idea, a spokesman  for Buckingham Palace said.  </P> <P> Women's Work: The Saudi kingdom's newly named guardian of virtue said Saudi  women are neglecting their families even though cheap foreign labor has freed  them from the burdens of a job and housework. "The woman here does not do any  of her duties," said Abdul Aziz Bin Abdul Rahman Al-Said, the general president  of the Organization for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. Al-Said  was not in office last month when women protested rules that allow only men to  drive. They took the wheels in a 40-car caravan through the capital.  </P> <P> Holiday Spirit?: Greenland says rival countries are grabbing too much of the  Christmas trade and enough is enough. The island is building in Nuuk, the  capital, a $2-million Santa Claus complex with Eskimo arts and sleigh-rides. A  chilly mood is in the air because Sweden, Norway and Finland have their own  major Father Christmas industries.  </P> <P> Wasp's Sting: D.C. is buzzing about former George Bush speech writer Richard  Brookhiser's new tongue-in-cheek book, "The Way of the Wasp," which offers a  list of likes of the maligned majority: the "white Anglo-Saxon Protestant"  sandwich -- turkey roll on white bread; worst WASP sins -- debt and losing your  temper. Do WASPs eat bagels, pizza and egg rolls? Of course, says Brookhiser,  but only with a knife and fork.  </P></p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Guinness judge demands reforms THE present bias in fraud trials towards defendants should be changed to simplify issues and shorten the time cases spend in court, the judge in the final Guinness trial said yesterday, John Mason writes. Mr Justice Turner criticised the present procedure under which the prosecution has to outline all details of its case at the start of a trial while defence lawyers can withhold material to set up 'ambushes'. In the final Guinness trial, which ended with Mr Thomas Ward being acquitted on Monday, much time had been spent pursuing matters that were never live issues, he said. The single real issue before the jury had been whether Mr Ward's Pounds 5.2m fee had been dishonestly obtained. 'Why should this issue have taken five weeks to resolve?' he asked. His comments were welcomed by Mr George Staple, director of the Serious Fraud Office.</p>

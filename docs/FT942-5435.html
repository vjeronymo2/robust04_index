			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar climbs The dollar climbed yesterday, buoyed by data showing a sharp drop in the unemployment rate in May and by comments from US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, writes Graham Bowley. Labour department figures showed that the US unemployment rate dropped to 6 per cent in May from 6.4 per cent in April. There was also an upward revision to April's non-farm payroll number from 267,000 to 358,000. Analysts said this was further evidence that the US economy is growing strongly. 'This spells inflation,' said Mr Avinash Persaud of JP Morgan. 'The US authorities will have to raise interest rates again soon to restore the credibility of monetary policy.' 'Growth is above its long-run trend rate and, significantly, unemployment is now below 6.3 per cent, the rate usually associated with full employment,' said Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS. 'Interest rates will soon have to move to a more neutral stance of around 5 per cent but even that may not be enough,' Mr Chertkow said. But the rise in the non-farm payrolls in May of 191,000 was below expectations. 'This was disappointing and suggests that the US economy is beginning to lose momentum,' said Mr Brian Martin, senior economist at Citibank. 'This gave heart to the Treasury market and it is the rally in the bond market which has caused the dollar to climb.' Analysts also pointed to remarks made by White House chief economist Laura Tyson who cautioned against reading too much into the sharp drop in the rate of unemployment. Mr Bentsen, who was speaking after a Confederation of British Industry lunch in London, said: 'I must say that the underlying fundamentals for the dollar are excellent.' Mr Chertkow said: 'This is further confirmation that the dollar debasement has ended. One of the key factors in the recent dollar decline was the belief in the markets that Bentsen and his colleagues were using the dollar as a weapon against Japan.' The dollar firmed in early trading ahead of the labour market data on short-covering and because the US currency acted as a safe haven because of concerns over North Korea. 'The dollar has tested critical levels today but the key levels remain further away,' said Mr Chertkow. 'Further large gains are unlikely until the US authorities act decisively on interest rates.' The dollar closed yesterday at DM1.6665, up 1 1/2 pfennigs from DM1.6515 on Thursday and higher at Y105.245 against Y104.93. The pound gained ground, largely on the back of the strength of the dollar. But analysts said that the Halifax house price index, published yesterday, which showed a large fall in house prices in May, also helped sterling. However, further gains would be difficult ahead of next week's European elections. The pound finished the day at DM2.5074, up almost one pfennig against the D-Mark. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 455m. The central bank had earlier provided Pounds 26m of liquidity after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 750m, revised upwards from Pounds 600m. Overnight money traded between 4 5/8 per cent and 7 1/2 per cent.</p>

Cho Yong-kil,  director of the Strategic Planning Bureau at the Joint Chiefs of  Staff (JCS) headquarters, denied reports Monday that the Defense  Ministry plans to bring in Patriot missiles from 1997 as part of  Korea's next-generation anti-air defense project.    Defense authorities have looked into replacing aging Nike  Hercules and Hawk (homing all-the-way killer) missiles with more  advanced surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems because parts will  be difficult to get after 2000, Cho said. But no decision has  been made on introducing Patriot missiles from 1997 and  including them in the long-term weapons procurement blueprint,  joint strategic objectives plan (J-SOP), he said. "We will be  able to decide on the next-generation anti-aircraft missile  project in four to five years, after sufficient testing of  similar weapons from all over the world," he said.    Rep. Yim Pok-chin of the opposition Democratic Party (DP)  claimed that the Defense Ministry had included introduction of  Patriot missiles in the SAM-X project starting in 1997 in  Monday's interpellation.</p>

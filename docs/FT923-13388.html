			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa prices slip back from 2 1/2 -month highs PROFIT-TAKING halted the London cocoa futures market's bull run yesterday after speculative and trade buying had pushed prices to fresh 2 1/2 -month highs. Early dealings saw a continuation of the almost uninterrupted uptrend that had lifted the September position from the 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 509 a tonne reached on June 25. But the profit-taking began when the Pounds 632-a-tonne level was reached and by the close the September position was just Pounds 2 up on the day at Pounds 616 a tonne. There were also unconfirmed reports of modest sales by producers, whose resolute absence from the market over the past few weeks had helped to sustain the upward move. However, just as they had been reluctant to write off the preceding downtrend when prices began rising in late June, dealers were unready yesterday to administer the last rites to the recent bull run. Chart patterns still looked constructive, they said, following the breach during the morning rise of last week's September position high of Pounds 622 a tonne. The coffee market followed a similar pattern, with London's September robusta futures position climbing to a 2-month high of Dollars 791 in the morning. But volume was very thin and when selling began the market quickly moved into the red. By the close, September coffee had slipped back to Dollars 760 a tonne, down Dollars 16 on the day.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LAGUNA CANYON;  </P> <P> BUILDING PLAN DRAWS 2,000 PROTESTERS  </P> <P> About 2,000 people marched through Laguna Canyon to protest a proposed project  that would bring 3,000 new homes and a golf course to the rustic area. The  Irvine Co.'s Laguna Laurel project -- a proposed 3,000-home residential  community and golf course surrounding three lakes -- "would forever change this  pristine site," endangering unique plant and animal habitats, said Henry  Huggins, a march coordinator. The project has been approved by county  supervisors but construction has not begun.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> NEW QUARTERS FOR HOMELESS TO OPEN  </P> <P> Two more homeless families in Orange County will have a place to stay today  with the opening of a building at the New Vista Shelter.  </P> <P> The building will open this morning after a ceremony expected to be attended by  volunteers who made the addition possible, as well as Orange County Supervisor  Gaddi H. Vasquez and Fullerton City Councilman Don Bankhead.  </P> <P> Expansion of the shelter came via an all-volunteer effort by the Building  Industry Assn. of Southern California and area contractors and suppliers. The  added living area, built over a new garage, will allow the shelter to house  eight families at a time instead of the current six.  </P> <P> Volunteers donated all the building materials and labor and furnished the two  new bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchen, said Barbara Johnson, executive director  of Fullerton Interfaith Emergency Services, which operates the shelter.  </P> <P> "They've really gone first class," Johnson said. "They've gone all-out to make  it really nice."  </P> <P> The donated value of the labor and materials for New Vista Shelter is about  $105,000. The largest contributor was Superior Framing Systems Inc. of Yorba  Linda, which donated $15,000 worth of labor.  </P> <P> New Vista provides shelter to temporarily homeless families, allowing them to  save money for an apartment.  </P> <P> Expanding the shelter is the third of five projects by the Building Industry  Assn. in Orange County to increase the number of beds for the temporarily  homeless.TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

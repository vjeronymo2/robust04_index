			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Picking up the pieces of an emerging market: The secondary market for the debt of less developed countries was profitable and popular. But just as it was on the verge of joining the mainstream, it collapsed The contrast between last year's bull run in the financial markets and this year's bearish conditions is nowhere more striking than in the secondary market for emerging country debt. The market consists of the restructured and impaired loans made by banks to countries in Latin America, Africa, the former Soviet bloc and Asia, many of which ran into problems in the 1980s. Since then, the value of these loans in the secondary market has staged a strong recovery, as the creditworthiness of their emerging economies has improved. So far this year, Salomon Brothers' Brady bond index, which tracks the restructured commercial bank debt of countries such as Argentina, Mexico and the Philippines, has declined by about 20 per cent, after last year's impressive return of 43.87 per cent. The commercial loans of countries that have yet to restructure their debt have fared even worse. Poland's debt has dropped from 52 cents on the dollar in early January to 31 cents, while Sudan's debt is trading at 6 cents on the dollar, down from 11 cents. Few traders had doubted that the market was heading for a correction, but the scale of the collapse has shocked many participants. Many were convinced the market was in the process of entering the mainstream. Trading volume last year trebled to an estimated Dollars 1,000bn-Dollars 1,500bn (Pounds 685bn-Pounds 1,027bn), according to a recent market survey by Risk magazine. That compares with estimated market turnover of around Dollars 200bn for 1991, and reflects the broadening of interest in the market. The market's roots go back to the early 1980s. When Latin American countries began to default on their commercial bank debt, some banks started to sell off some of the impaired debt. Gradually they set up small teams to adjust their own books, and a secondary market in what was then known as LDC (less developed country) debt developed. Later, seeing the profits to be made from the LDC debt market, investment banks began to set up trading teams. But they were stillproprietary traders who were charged with making money by using the banks' own capital to take positions, rather than dealing on behalf of clients. The market slowly started to be viewed as a genuine investment medium, often for so-called 'flight capital' - money held offshore by wealthy Latin American nationals - and then by specialist country funds. In recent years, large returns attracted mainstream institutional investors as bond markets rallied and the credit ratings of Latin American countries improved. Last year, there was a wave of money from hedge funds (highly leveraged, mainly offshore funds). 'Unfortunately, about half-way through the process (of institutionalisation), the market has gone into decline,' said one investment banker. One reason for the severity of the decline may be the nature of trading: many participants are themselves still natural holders of the debt. 'Our market is different from the gilts or US Treasury market,' said Mr Paul Luke, head of emerging market debt research at Morgan Grenfell. 'In those markets, the path of interest rates is an issue over which honourable men can differ. In our market you don't get anyone who says it's overvalued.' The sharp decline has come just as participants are pouring fresh resources into the market. Not only have new entrants recently set up teams - in some cases poached from other houses for hefty packages - but the advent of the institutional investor has increased the demands on both investment and commercial banks. Already, most of the top 10 houses have between 15 and 25 traders. Salomon Brothers estimates that the number of trading and sales professionals involved in the market worldwide has grown from 750 in 1991-92 to between 1,000 and 1,500. In addition, institutional investors also want expensive research facilities at their disposal. 'It's very costly to run a full sales, trading and research operation, but that's what the major institutions demand,' said one emerging market debt trader. As a result, the return on capital for this business is set to decline, albeit from levels as high as 40 per cent, according to some traders. In spite of its problems - heavy losses, long positions, no sign of investors returning - the outlook for the market is not as bleak as it may seem. 'Obviously it's not a pleasant thing to go through, but it's not entirely unhealthy. Towards the end of last year there was a lot of froth in the market,' said Ms Alex McLeod, managing director, secondary asset trading at Continental Bank. After a spate of bad news - including the collapse of Banco Latino, Venezuela's second-largest bank, the rebel uprising in Mexico, and the assassination of the country's leading presidential candidate - there is some good news on the horizon. Brazil, Poland and Bulgaria are all close to finalising Brady deals. For all but the most recent entrants to the market, the hefty profits of the past few years have provided a cushion that will enable them to wait for the market's fortunes to pick up again.</p>

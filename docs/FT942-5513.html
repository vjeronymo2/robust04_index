			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Airbus seeks orders for new jumbo The European Airbus consortium is to start marketing a new jumbo aircraft with 500-600 seats to challenge the Boeing 747's monopoly of the large airliner market. Airbus will start serious discussions with a selected group of airlines on its proposed A3XX large aircraft project soon after Britain's Farnborough Air Show in early September, Mr Jean Pierson, chief executive, said yesterday. Although he did not expect airlines to rush in immediately with orders, he believed there was likely to be demand for a new jumbo by about 2002. 'Our supervisory board last week decided we are now ready to be serious about this project,' he added. He estimated development costs for A3XX at around Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.3bn). The aircraft would have two decks running the full length of the fuselage, powered by four engines and would have a range of 7,000-8,000 nautical miles. Its cost to airlines would be below Dollars 200m (Pounds 132m) and it would have 20 per cent lower operating costs than the current Boeing 747-400, he said. The 747-400 can seat between 450 and 500. British Airways and Singapore Airlines have already expressed interest in super jumbos. Mr Pierson said Airbus was 'in regular contact' with BA on its new project. Before launching a new jumbo development, Airbus would have to get a significant number of firm commitments from airlines. The four Airbus partners (Aerospatiale of France, Germany's Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain) have been jointly studying with Boeing for the past two years the development of an even larger 880-seat airliner. But these studies did not prevent both Airbus and Boeing pursuing independent studies to develop new jumbo aircraft, Mr Pierson stressed. He noted that Boeing had recently stepped up studies on a larger version of its 747-400 jumbo with a new wing. This has increased suspicion among Airbus partners over Boeing's motives for collaborating with the Europeans on a joint super jumbo project. The Airbus partners are worried Boeing is trying to use the joint studies to delay Airbus's entry into the jumbo market while the US manufacturer prepares the next generation 747 to consolidate its hold of the very large aircraft market. Mr Pierson also said Airbus wanted to match Boeing's latest productivity targets aimed at driving down production costs by 25 per cent and reducing production cycle times. For Airbus narrow-body aircraft, the target was to reduce production cycles from 12 months to nine months next year and six months by 1996. For larger widebody aircraft, Airbus wants to reduce the cycle time of 15 months to nine months by 1996.</p>

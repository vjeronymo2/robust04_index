			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Falls trimmed by US interest rate cut LONDON equities slipped lower yesterday in lacklustre trading, taking only marginal comfort from an unexpected cut in US interest rates. A survey from the Confederation of British Industry served to remind fund managers that it is still too soon to call the bottom of the recession. Investors saw no reason to commit themselves ahead of the UK local government elections being held tomorrow. The overnight fall on Wall Street led to an uninspired start to trading in London. The dollar reversed its trend of recent days, falling a steep five cents against sterling by the end of the session. This had the predictable effect of weakening international stocks, whose strength had been behind much of the previous day's market rise. Since the sector includes some of the highest capitalisation issues in the market, the falls had a large effect on the Footsie index. Traders looking for a guide to sentiment found little help in the latest Confederation of British Industry monthly survey of industrial trends. On the one hand, the CBI confirmed that fewer UK manufacturers see output declining in the coming months. Mr Richard Kersley at BZW said that in previous recessions such a turning point in output forecasts indicated that company earnings would begin to recover about six months later. But investment plans continued to be delayed. This suggests that engineering and capital goods companies might be left out of any third quarter earnings recovery. Mr Kersley said that this again was to be expected; capital goods earnings tended to be a lagging indicator in the economic cycle. He warned that investors should be wary of optimistic interpretations of the CBI survey, saying that new orders in the last few months had been so weak that some hopes for recovery were based on the view that 'things cannot continue this badly'. The expiry of the April future contract yesterday failed to lift prices, in spite of the efforts of at least one securities house to support the Footsie index. In this atmosphere of uncertainty the Footsie index reached its low point for the day of 2,475.6 just before Wall Street opened. The half percentage point cut in the US discount rate, to 5 1/2 per cent, coincided with the start of trading in New York. 'There seems to have been a tacit deal with the Bundesbank (at last weekend's G7 meeting),' said Mr Robin Gilbert at Schroders. He thought that as a result it was now unlikely that the Bundesbank would increase its interest rates at its fortnightly meeting tomorrow. The consequent sharp opening rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, produced only a muted response in London. The Footsie recovered to 2,486.2, still a fall of 12 on the day. Turnover, at 413.9m shares, was only a little higher than the previous day's dismal levels of business. Mr Richard Lake, a chartist at Hoare Govett, said the London stock market would continued to languish. His trigger for a rally is a level on the Footsie of 2,450. Among individual stocks. Coats Viyella's increased offer for Tootal had been well signalled in the press. The steady stream of rights issues continued. Clothing and engineering group William Baird called for Pounds 39m in a one-for-five issue. As if to underscore the CBI survey, and the market's mood, Baird accompanied its cash call with a warning that trading conditions would remain difficult in the short term.</p>

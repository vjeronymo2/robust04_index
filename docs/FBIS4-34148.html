			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Michel Francois has  reacted to the statement made by his brother Evans Francois on a  sister radio station. Lt. Col. Joseph Michel Francois informs  the public in general and the members of the Haitian Armed  Forces [FADH] in particular that his brother's stand does not  bind him in any way. Fear or any other emotions engendered by  some foreign threat do not exist and will not exist in him, Lt.  Col. Joseph Michel Francois points out. This is why he reproves  the unpleasant and untimely statements made about his chief,  statements that reflect on the institution to which Lt. Col.  Francois belongs and on his country, which need the solidarity  and unity of all its sons in these stormy times. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Letter: Sponsorship that is often irrelevant to the arts Sir, Antony Thorncroft's article on business sponsorship of the arts ('Identity crisis - Sponsorship', January 3) is a useful sample of the perilous state of the arts and the irrelevance of such sponsorship to the arts if advertising is all the sponsors want out of it. It always seems that they get far too much in terms of 'hospitality rooms', special dispensation for delaying the start of concerts while the sponsor's guests dawdle to their seats and superfluous labelling on posters, programmes and the like. For them to claim media coverage in the review as well is tantamount to requiring Frances Barber in the National Theatre's Night of the Iguana to have the sponsor's name emblazoned across her bosom. The deficiencies of arts sponsorship can be exemplified by the current state of the Parthenon - a building designed by sponsors, a column each and the odd pediment but not the roof or heart of the building, and certainly not the soul. The current deplorable state of our sporting contests, cricket and football leagues and no doubt everything else shows how these have become degraded precisely because of the embrace of business sponsorship for the wrong reasons. It is the quality of the play that justifies the sponsor and not the other way about. S W Massil, 138 Lane, Crouch End, London N8 7JP</p>

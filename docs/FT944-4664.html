			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Eldridge Pope ahead 50% despite fall in sales In spite of a fall in turnover from Pounds 42.7m to Pounds 42.1m, Eldridge Pope, the USM-quoted brewer and wine merchant, reported annual pre-tax profits ahead 50 per cent at Pounds 2.64m, against Pounds 1.76m. The result for the year to September 30 was helped by lower finance charges of Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 1.63m) the result of lower borrowings and interest rates. The fall in turnover was the result of selling its beer wholesaling business in July last year. The Hovetop pubs, acquired in the summer, contributed operating profits of Pounds 164,000 to a total of Pounds 3.95m from turnover of Pounds 1.54m. Earnings per share came out at 11.6p (8.6p) and the proposed final dividend is raised to 2.6p for a total of 4.1p (3.55p).</p>

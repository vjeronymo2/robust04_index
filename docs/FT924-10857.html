			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Coach and 56 minibuses drive through MoD books THE MINISTRY of Defence was at a loss to explain yesterday who was responsible for buying a coach and 56 minibuses without authorisation. The Pounds 682,000 paid for the fleet of vehicles came out of funds awarded to MoD branches for meeting or exceeding their efficiency targets. Other items of 'irregular expenditure' identified by the National Audit Office, the watchdog that reports to parliament on the use of public funds, included out-of-hours entertaining and recreational facilities. The audit office originally estimated that Pounds 210,000 of the efficiency award money in the 1990-91 financial year was spent without going through standard financial controls. An NAO report today by Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, says subsequent investigations reveal the total to have been Pounds 1.2m, or 13 per cent of expenditure under the scheme. The parliamentary public accounts committee has called a special meeting on December 9 to question the ministry about the irregularities. The audit office also found that the MoD's accounting systems were 'overwhelmed' by the volume of supplies sent to the Gulf in advance of the allied ground offensive against Iraq last year. Following the recovery of unused supplies 87 containers, possibly containing stores and equipment, could not be accounted for. More than 7,000 containers were sent to the Gulf. Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Appropriation Accounts 1991-92 (HC 197-1), HMSO, Pounds 9.35.</p>

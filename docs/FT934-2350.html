			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Finnish technology to clean up Russian smelter's emissions Pollution from the Kandalaksha aluminium smelter in Russia will be substantially reduced by an upgrading to be carried out by Kumera Corporation, a Finnish engineering company, using technology from Reynolds Metals of the US. The project, which is to cost less than USDollars 50m, will also boost Kandalaksha's capacity from 62,000 to 70,000 tonnes a year. Kumera suggests that this is the first environmental modernisation project for a complete aluminium smelter in Russia since privatisation of the industry started there. The Finnish government will give some financial support to the project because Kandalaksha is on the Kola Peninsula and some of its fluoride emissions are blown across the border into Finland. Reynolds has well-tried technology to improve the performance of outdated Soderberg smelters and Mr Vesa Kumpulainen, Kumera's chief executive, says this technology not only cuts pollution substantially but also saves energy. Once the project has received Russian government approval, the work is expected to be completed in 30 months. The Russian government is recommending that its aluminium industry should make across-the-board production cuts of 10 per cent, Mr Alexander Deineko, deputy head of the Russian industry department, said, Reuter reports from Moscow. He admitted, however, that he did not know how the newly-independent producers - most of the smelters are now joint-stock companies - would react to this official recommendation, which follows meetings with officials from other aluminium-producing countries in Washington. Another official, Mr Ruben Petrosyan, head of Raznoimport, Russia's aluminium export organisation, said all the countries were considering a 10 per cent production cut and an accord might be reached at talks in Brussels on January 18. The New York Mercantile Exchange, the big energy futures market, is planning to revive a failed aluminium futures contract in an effort to capitalise on price risks created by the world oversupply of aluminium, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. Mr Daniel Rappaport, the chairman of Nymex, said that he hoped to launch aluminium futures in conjunction with his exchange's proposed merger with New York's Commodity Exchange, the precious metals futures exchange, but would go ahead with the project even if the merger failed. Nymex, best known for its successful crude oil futures and options, also trades platinum futures. Mr Rappaport said that if the foray into aluminium was successful, the exchange would attempt to establish trading in zinc and nickel futures. The exchange's board members are scheduled to vote on the Dollars 50m Comex merger package this week. If the plan is cleared by the board, it must then be approved by Comex directors and presented for approval to the memberships of both exchanges. Comex's volume and seat values have jumped this year in the wake of the 1993 gold rally, causing some members to question the value of the merger and putting the outcome of the plan in doubt. Mr Rappaport promised Comex members that he would invest heavily in a new aluminium contract if the merger was approved. Comex launched an aluminium futures contract in 1984, but volume was thin from the outset and it last traded in November 1990. The exchange formally delisted the contract this year.</p>

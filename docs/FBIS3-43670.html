According to [words indistinct] Luanda is making its  final preparations to launch major attacks on strategic National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]-controlled  areas in northern and northwestern Angola. Luanda's Futungo de  Belas Palace is using South African and Portuguese mercenaries  for that purpose. Those mercenaries are training forces in Cabo  Ledo that will be used in that military adventure.    Should Luanda go on that offensive, it can count on  sophisticated modern war materiel made in Brazil, the DPRK, and  Argentina, among other countries determined to see the war  continue in Angola.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: IRG urges bid rejection IRG, the Irish plastic packaging manufacturer, has advised its shareholders to reject the IPounds 22m (Pounds 20m) bid by Barlo, an Irish radiator manufacturer. Mr Brendan O'Kelly, chairman, said the share-exchange bid - 55 Barlo for every 20 IRG - 'offers IRG shareholders only 40 per cent of the combined business'. He said that of the combined entity IRG would contribute 79 per cent of turnover, 54 per cent of pre-tax profits and 51 per cent of net assets. 'Your board believes this Barlo offer is inadequate and accordingly cannot recommend that shareholders accept it', he stated. IRG announced a 23 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from IPounds 2.9m to IPounds 2.2m, on turnover marginally down to IPounds 55.9m (Pounds 56.4m) for 1991. Earnings per share fell to 12.2p (16.8p). The dividend is held at 6.2p with a final of 4.45p. The bid closes on June 4.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                    In an apparent attempt to keep petty theft at state enterprises  from mushrooming into large scale criminal activity, the Castro  regime has launched a crackdown on high-living profiteers who are  selling large quantities of stolen state merchandise on the black  market.  At the same time, Havana has hinted also concerned that  these newly affluent black marketeers could emerge as an economic  elite that would pose a political danger to the regime.                               END SUMMARY      The "nationwide" crackdown on "illegal enrichment"--authorized in  the recently-enacted "decree-law number 149"--involves raids  against suspected black market profiteers and permanent  confiscation of "goods and [monetary] assets" subsequently  determined by the state to have been obtained directly or  indirectly through "theft, speculation, embezzlement, [or] black  market activities" (Radio Rebelde Network, 5 May).  Havana does  not appear to be targeting the average Cuban who buys and sells  on the black market out of necessity, but rather individuals  whose involvement in the black market has led to ostentatious  affluence.  Thus, while Radio Rebelde on 6 June noted that the  "main goal" of the crackdown is "not" to make each citizen "prove  the legitimate origins" of goods in his possession, it defined  the goal the next day as rooting out those individuals "who enjoy  a lifestyle that exceeds their [usual] income."  Media reporting  on raids carried out thus far reinforce this message.  For  example, the target of one raid was a workshop "manager" whose  official salary was 167 pesos a month, but who had four boats and  a truck in his possession.  Another raid was directed at a  "citizen" possessing four trucks, two cars, a rice mill, a  welding workshop, six houses and over 35,000 pesos in cash (Radio  Rebelde, 7 June). (See Note 1)     (Note 1) As of 6 June, security forces had conducted raids  against 222 presumed profiteers found in possession of "180 cars,  83 motorbikes, 48 trucks, 24 tractors, 108 houses and over 3.5  million pesos" (Radio Rebelde, 6 June).  Radio Rebelde on 27 May  also reported the seizure of a total of 500 farm animals from a  group of 28 Havana residents.      Setting the Stage      Havana's campaign against profiteers follows frequent media  discussion in recent months of Cuba's longtime problem with theft  of state supplies which from all appearances has become more  serious as black market activity has expanded. (See Box 1)  Indicating that virtually all Cubans now rely on the black market  to some degree to meet their needs for food, journalists on the  Radio Rebelde's 23 March "Straight-Talk" program noted that, if  "the truth be told," Cubans "frequently have no choice but to  access" the black market because "as everyone knows, the official  market does not meet all the basic needs of the Cuban family  nowadays." (See Box 2) The journalists stressed that the  population should "clearly understand that merchandise  circulating in the underground economy" comes largely from  "theft" from "state companies or stores."  A subsequent "Straight  Talk" program emphasized that the long-accepted concept of  "missing inventory"--which traditionally condoned theft for  personal use or to "solve [inventory] problems for a buddy at  another enterprise"--is now "fostering criminal activity" (Radio  Rebelde, 6 April).  As a case in point, Radio Progreso on 25  April said that "corrupt" warehouse inspectors and others in  management positions steal from the state now for "the sole  purpose of enriching themselves" on the black market.      Political Threat      Havana's repression of affluent black marketeers also provides  the regime with an opportunity to take action against an  incipient economic elite as a potential rival of the Communist  Party of Cuba.  In fact, the Cuban media have hinted that the  Castro regime sees a political threat in the profiteers'  independent power base.  For example, the "Straight Talk" program  on 5 May reported that "macetas"--the pejorative term used by the  regime to describe Cubans who get rich buying and selling stolen  state merchandise--set themselves apart from socialist society,  not only by enjoying a "lavish lifestyle," but also by building a  network of "collaborators" and using personal "bodyguards" (Radio  Rebelde).  The 11 May "Straight Talk" program concluded that  these profiteers--who "live differently and think differently"  from others in socialist society--are "almost becoming a social  class" with its own distinct ideology.      Outlook      By cracking down on flagrant profiteering on the black market,  Havana is evidently hoping that it will be able to rein in forces  that the regime itself set loose when it implemented liberalizing  measures last year.  Having permitted limited market-oriented  measures in the cause of economic survival, the regime must now  also guard against the demoralizing effects of those who flaunt  their success in using the market conditions to gain affluence at  the state's expense.  Given the regime's diminished capacity to  maintain the traditional communist economy, a high-publicity  campaign against flagrant profiteers is probably the best  available means of keeping illegal activities in check.     At the same time, the regime's oft-stated intention to make  economic changes in a gradual and carefully controlled way  suggests that Havana is not unprepared for unforeseen problems.  Speaking on Havana's economic agenda--including the campaign  against profiteers--at last month's National Assembly meeting,  Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez reiterated the regime's  intention to proceed with due care, declaring that new measures  will be implemented as a "gradual process" that will require  "adjustments or changes" along the way (Tele Rebelde, 1 May).      (BOX 1)      The Expanding Black Market      Havana's efforts to stem the flow of state merchandise to the  black market notwithstanding, other policies promoted by the  regime seem to have fostered black market activity.  In  particular, two market-oriented measures implemented last year to  ease shortages of basic consumer goods and services seem to have  created new opportunities for black marketeers:     -- The legalization of self-employment in the service sector-  -which amounted to an endorsement of underground economic  activity--has apparently made it easier for Cubans to camouflage  the sale of state merchandise on the black market where goods  fetch a higher price than they would in the state's price-  controlled stores.  Given that the regime apparently never  specified where self-employed workers could obtain supplies-  -beyond suggesting that they "use leftover materials" (Radio  Rebelde, 15 October 1993)--many now seem to rely on theft from  the state.  One radio reporter noted that in Havana  "unscrupulous" people charging "astronomical prices" for stolen  foodstuffs manage "to mix" in with authorized street peddlers  selling "homemade" goods (Radio Rebelde, 7 January 1994).  Likewise, Radio Rebelde reported on 5 May that local officials-  -meeting with several Politburo members--reached the conclusion  that legally self-employed "craftsmen" were using fuel and other  raw materials "of dubious [i.e., state] origin."     -- The lifting of restrictions against holding dollars, which has  presumably led to an increase in disbursements from abroad, has  undoubtedly promoted activity on the dollar-based black market.  Remarks made by Cuban President Fidel Castro last December at the  National Assembly session certainly suggest that this is the  case.  According to Castro, "all the money [i.e., dollars] coming  into the country today . . . becomes a source for the black  market" (Havana TV, 30 December 1993).      (BOX 2)      Return of the Farmers Free Markets?      Cuba's private farmers--who, according to a 31 May report from  the official Mexican news service NOTIMEX, supply 35 percent of  Cuba's produce--may be unofficially reinventing the farmers' free  markets which Castro closed down in 1986 on the grounds that they  promoted excessive profitmaking.  Recent media reporting suggests  that private farmers are all but disregarding their obligation to  sell a set quota of produce to the state in favor of more  lucrative arrangements on the illicit private markets.  Havana  Radio Reloj on 31 May reported that Agriculture Minister Alfredo  Jordan "demanded that farmers fulfill their food delivery  commitments," noting that this year some farmers "have not  delivered a single quintal of farm products" to the state.  Suggesting that farmers are forsaking the low fixed prices that  the state pays in exchange for higher private market prices, the  labor union paper Trabajadores charged that some farmers are  "trying to get rich" (Mexico City NOTIMEX, 31 May).

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Unita poised to capture crucial city ANGOLA'S rebel Unita movement was yesterday on the verge of winning the battle for the central highland city of Huambo as fears grew for the security of the vital oil producing enclave of Cabinda in the north. Control of Huambo, traditionally a Unita stronghold, would help the rebel campaign in southern Angola and reinforce its bargaining power at peace talks, diplomats in Luanda said yesterday. A second round of talks between the government and Unita should have taken place in Addis Ababa on Wednesday but was called off at the last minute by the rebels. 'The situation is fluid but it looks very bleak for the government. It is plausible that Unita could take control within the next two days,' a western diplomat said. Aid workers said thousands of wounded were trapped in Huambo, where the government and Unita have been fighting for more than a month. The battle is the centrepiece of the war which resumed after Unita rejected its September electoral defeat and began to expel local authorities from 75 per cent of the country in violation of 1991 peace accords. UN officials were trying to arrange a truce to allow flights of food and medicines the city, which has been devastated by artillery and air attacks. But UN special representative Margaret Anstee has been unable to contact Unita leader Jonas Savimbi whose whereabouts were unknown. Rebel radio said Unita forces had seized Huambo airport and captured the riot police barracks after heavy fighting. The government said its hard-pressed troops were resisting a Unita onslaught, which it said was led by white mercenaries in South African-made armoured cars. 'Fierce clashes have taken place on the outskirts of the government palace and the military academy,' it said. Angola's prime minister, Mr Marcolino Moco, said this week the number of casualties was impossible to calculate. 'All we know is that many, many people have died.' A second diplomat said Unita looked set to capture a string of provincial capitals. 'The Portuguese are of the opinion that the government is on the verge of military collapse. They expect that within days if not hours Luena, Cuito, Bie and Menongue will also fall,' he said.</p>

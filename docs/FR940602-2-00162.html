			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eight respondents identified problems with the chart. They pointed out that the process shown when a project analysis decision allows the recreation residence use to continue (even though it had been found to be inconsistent with the Forest plan), does not agree with the text describing that process. The respondents suggested that when the use is allowed to continue it should not be subject to further review and analysis. Instead, the use should be considered as consistent with the Forest plan and the decision process should move directly to issuance of a new permit. In terms of the diagram, the arrow from this box should move left to the line showing consistency with the Forest plan instead of downward to the box showing decision review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Forest Service agrees with these respondents and has revised the diagram accordingly. Readers should recognize, however, that revisions in the direction and procedural guidance for continuance and removal of the use, discussed earlier in this notice, have also required revisions to the chart. The diagram appears in the final policy as section 41.23c. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4. Permit Issuance and Term. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed policy at FSM 2347.1, paragraph 3, and at FSM 2721.23a, paragraph 9, stated that permits for recreation residence use would be issued for a maximum of 20 years. Paragraph 10 of FSM 2721.23a provided direction for permit issuance following a decision to convert the lot to an alternative public use. In this event, the current term permit would be allowed to expire and a new term permit issued for up to 10 years to satisfy any additional time because of the 10-year notification requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There were 224 responses to these permit issuance and term provisions. Most respondents supported the 20-year term for recreation residence use, and the 10-year notification in case of conversion to an alternative public use. A few respondents preferred 30-year permits. Others objected to the 10-year notification with continued occupancy provision and the granting of additional time beyond the originally authorized term to satisfy notification requirements, stating that the holder accepted the original term and provisions, and should not receive these favorable considerations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Term Permit Act of March 4, 1915, authorizes terms up to 30 years. The Forest Service's long-standing policy has been to issue permits for 20-year terms, and if the use is to be terminated, the additional 10 years granted will keep the total length of the permit within the statutory limit. Also, specifying a maximum term of 20 years provides local agency officials flexibility in establishing length of terms to accommodate local needs. For example, if the official wished to have all permits on an administrative unit expire in the same year for efficiency in administration, a term of 18 years may be needed to match terms of permits issued earlier. The agency does not agree to elimination of the 10-year notification requirement or the provision providing additional occupancy when the use is to be removed. The investment in the recreation residence and the length most have been in existence make the agency's policy on notification and tenure fair and equitable. Readers are reminded that the agency does not pay a permittee for the value of the improvements when a permit expires under its own terms and must be removed. The agency is satisfied that a 20-year term for recreation residence term permits is appropriate and will adopt this provision in the final policy. However, to clarify that shorter terms may be dictated because of permit expiration and conversion of the lot to another public purpose, the provision is modified to reflect this exception to the 20-year term. This direction ensures compliance with the Assistant Secretary's appeal decision concerning indefinite tenure. This revised policy is also consistent with the final policy provisions requiring that decisions on continuance or removal of the use be based on the direction in the individual National Forest plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 5. Annual Fees in Event of Nonrenewal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed policy at FSH 2709.11, section 33.2, responded to the appeal decision's direction to reconsider the 1988 policy's direction for determining fees when a holder is placed on notice that a new permit will not be issued; that is, when the permit is placed on tenure. Three provisions in this section were examined in the proposed policy. The opening paragraph of this section stated that fees would be reduced 10 percent yearly during the 10-year notification period. This maintained the provision in the 1988 policy. The second provision (numbered paragraph 1) provided that in the event the decision to remove the recreation residence was reversed and the holder was given a new 20-year term permit, the Forest Service would recover all fees foregone while the permit was under notice it would not be renewed. This changed the provision in the 1988 policy which provided that 50 percent of the fees would be recovered. The third provision (numbered paragraph 2) provided that in the event of a reversed decision and a new permit was issued with a term of less than 10 years, fees foregone would not be recovered, but the fee would be reduced by 10 percent for each year the permit was under tenure notice (for example, fees for a 6-year tenure would be 60 percent of the full fee). This maintained the policy set forth in the 1988 policy provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There were 84 comments on these provisions of the proposed policy. Most respondents asked that the 50 percent fee recovery provision of the 1988 policy be reinstituted. They stated that the market value of the use is reduced when permits are placed on tenure, and, as the agency is required by law to charge fees based on fair market value, the 50 percent recovery is more than fair because the recovery amount should be zero. Others pointed out that the Forest Service's explanation that no precedent could be found in the private market providing for 50 percent recovery and therefore requiring full repayment of foregone fees was true because the private market would not recover foregone fees. On the other hand, several respondents asked why a holder should be entitled to reduced fees since it is not common practice in the private real estate market for a lessor to reduce rental fees when not renewing a lease, especially when the improvements must be removed by the lessee. One respondent asked whether fees for permits under tenure were subject to the same annual index adjustment as permits not under tenure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The agency decision in the 1988 policy to reduce fees when permits are placed on tenure was based on its understanding of common practice in the private real estate market. Reexamination of this question in view of the appeal decision does not provide information to contradict this earlier decision. The agency is not persuaded by respondents' statements contradicting its understanding of the private market. Therefore, the provision to reduce fees 10 percent for each year the permit is under tenure will be maintained in the final policy. (Section 33.2) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency based its decision to recover all fees foregone when a new 20-year permit is given for a use formerly under tenure because it could not confirm this was a common practice in the private real estate market. It also received legal advice that it had no authority to forgive fees foregone in this instance. Upon reexamination of this issue for preparation of this final policy, it again was not able to confirm that not recovering fees foregone is standard practice in the private market. Thus, the agency will keep this provision in the final policy. (Section 33.2, paragraph 1) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is also maintaining the provision from the proposed policy that when holders with permits on tenure are given new permits with terms of 10 years or less past fees foregone are not recovered and fees for the new term are reduced 10 percent a year. Holders who receive an additional period of use but do not get a full 20-year term permit do not have the full value of the use and thus should not pay a full fee. This provision is adopted consistent with the provision to reduce fees when permits are placed on tenure. The second sentence of this provision has been edited to clarify its intent. (Section 33.2, paragraph 2) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Readers should note that the third paragraph in this section, describing action to be taken when holders with permits on tenure are given new permits with terms of 10 to 20 years, was not revised in the proposed policy and remains identical to the language in the 1988 policy. In this case, fees are to be recovered in full. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

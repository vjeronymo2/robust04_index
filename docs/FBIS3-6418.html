At a time of reform, when the state of the political and  official communities is encountering serious criticism following  the collapse of the 1955 system, it is impossible for the  business community to be immune from criticism. The prolonged  recession, which is said to be the worst one since World War II,  may be one of the causes of such an opinion.    I am vice chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers  Associations. I think it is worthwhile in its own way for me to  express my own, impartial views as a member of the business  community.    Before I attempt that, it will be necessary to review the  historical roles that the four economic organizations have  played.    In making a fresh start from the ruins following the end of  the Pacific war, Japan's first objective was economic revival.  "Catching up and passing developed nations through attaining  economic growth" was the consensus of opinion of the whole  nation.    For nearly half a century since then, Japan has devoted  itself solely to the pursuit of economic growth. For that  purpose, each business had to be internationally competitive.  For Japan, which is dependent on other nations for resources,  to attain economic growth, it had no alternative but to increase  its exports.    In this period, the efforts of each business to make profits  and to develop and expand its scale led to the growth of  macroeconomics. Therefore, the government assisted enterprises,  and the Japanese public made efforts to develop enterprises,  which made yearly wage increases possible, and the Japanese  standard of living improved substantially. Working hard for  enterprises benefited individual workers and benefited the  nation as a whole.    In this way, in Japan, the government, enterprises, and the  people had the same idea, and they made a concerted effort to  develop the so-called Japan, Inc.    In that process, the role of the four economic organizations  were to insist on what enterprises wanted to do for the economic  development of Japan as the representatives of the business  community as a whole, to ask for the assistance of the  government, and to ask for the understanding of the people.    The four economic organizations had different roles to play:  Keidanren (Japan Federation of Economic Organizations)  represented large enterprises as the organ of business  organizations; Nikkeiren (Japan Federation of Employers  Associations) principally handled labor-management relations and  matters related to employment; Keizaidoyukai (Japanese  Association of Corporate Executives) served as the place where  each executive can express his personal opinions; and Nissho  (Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry) served as the  representative of an enormous number of minor enterprises  throughout the country.    If a goal is well defined, the method for achieving it will  be devised accordingly. What the four economic organizations  did to achieve their goals according to the methods they devised  was of great benefit to the Japanese public and Japan, as well  as to businesses. Japan enjoyed such a period.    This system began to exhibit some changes, probably about 10  years ago. Statistically speaking, Japan's per capita national  income exceeded that of [West] Germany in 1985 and even exceeded  that of the United States in 1988. At least on the surface,  Japan's national goal after the war was achieved in a way. And  the next goal was not well defined.    At the present stage in which the Japanese economy has  attained full growth and the only demand existing is the  replacement of what the people already have, such as electrical  home appliances and automobiles, no amount of new products and  no amount of price reductions will expand domestic demand  greatly. In the field of exports, a great trade imbalance has  bred tension, and the appreciation of the yen has decreased the  competitiveness of Japanese products overseas. In short, it has  become impossible for Japan to concentrate its energies on the  growth of its economy as in the past.    Moreover, although Japan has accomplished its goals from the  standpoint of statistical figures, a number of problems still  remain to be solved. These are problems such as housing, an  aging society, and the environment, none of which can be  surmounted by economic growth. To accomplish economic growth,  the principle of "efficiency first" will be pursued, the  concentration of people in one area will be continued, and the  problem of housing will never be solved. Furthermore, if the  economy grows, personnel costs will inevitably rise, making the  care of the aged practically impossible. With regard to the  environment, it is certain to deteriorate with the growth of the  economy. Once the goals that Japan has been pursuing are  accomplished, the Japan, Inc. established for that purpose  should be dissolved, and the relationship between politics, the  bureaucracy, and the business community should be changed  greatly. Under the present circumstances in which the next  goals are not well defined, a new relationship between them  inevitably remains unclear. As far as Japan, Inc. is concerned,  nothing but the unfavorable aspects of the cooperation between  politics, the bureaucracy, and the business community remain --  which have come to be censured as the iron triangle composing  the collusion between politics, the bureaucracy, and the  business community.    The estrangement of the Japanese public on the one hand and  politics, the bureaucracy, and the business community on the  other hand was at the point of rearing its head in the period of  high economic growth, especially during 1965-75, when the  problems of pollution became acute. At that time, the  relationship between the two was somehow restored through the  serious application of antipollution measures, which was  considered to be the "social responsibility of enterprises."  However, what little trust the Japanese public had in the  business world and the government was completely lost because of  land speculation at the height of the bubble economy and because  of the Recruit scandal, the issue of securities firms'  compensating clients for losses, and the current recession.    To overcome the current recession, we must regain the trust  of the public by implementing political reform, administrative  reform, and economic reform; by setting a new goal for Japan,  and by establishing a new relationship for cooperation between  politics, the bureaucracy, and the business community to attain  that goal.    The problems of the four economic organizations must be  reconsidered in that context.  <H3>  The Background of the Birth of the Four Economic  Organizations </H3>   In August 1993, the long-term, one-party rule of the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] collapsed, and the coalition government  was established. Around that time, Keidanren stopped acting as  a middleman for political funds.    At the time when politics, the bureaucracy, and the business  community formed a trinity in Japan, Inc., the contribution of  political funds was a chain which connected the three. Of  course, even at that time, the public should have dimly  perceived that some of the political donations were unlawful.  It is quite natural for the public to suspect that "they are  bribes."    At the time of the cold war, however, the majority of the  public preferred the long-term, one-party rule of the LDP to the  administration of the Social Democratic Party of Japan. The  public may have been in the mood to tolerate the contribution of  political funds which were used to support the long-term  administration if that was of benefit to the public, for these  political donations were not taxes imposed on the public.    However, the prices of goods rose sharply with the growth of  the economy, and the amount of funds needed to support the  administration increased. Meanwhile, the conditions for  political donations became strict because of the enactment of a  law regulating political funds. Driven by these two  contradictory forces, scandals such as the Recruit scandal, the  Saga Kyubin scandal, and the general contractor scandals  occurred in succession, although such scandals used to occur  only once every five or 10 years. Furthermore, it became evident  that the collusion between the government and the business  community did not necessarily benefit the public.    At a time when food, clothing, and shelter were inadequate,  the lives of salarymen became remarkably richer with the growth  of enterprises and with the increase of wages every year.    However, at the present time, when our society has become  rich enough to have almost all the necessities of life, the  realization that the mere increase of income does not bring  happiness to individuals has spread among the public. There is  a growing desire among people to give priority to themselves,  their families, and their friends because they consider it  unbearable to work desperately for their companies only to die  of overwork.    It is natural for public opinion to favor the  discontinuation  of political donations if the promotion of policies facilitated  by donations by the business and financial communities benefits  not the public but rather exclusively enterprises.    Meanwhile, what kind of kickback can enterprises expect for  contributing political funds? Excepting some enterprises, no  rights and interests have been awarded; no subsidies have been  granted; no tax exemptions have been awarded. On the contrary,  enterprises which make political donations solely "to avoid ill  treatment" are increasing in number.    Moreover, public opinion preferred a change in the system,  by  which reform could be implemented through changing the  administration, to maintaining the status quo -- the protection  of vested interests -- under the long-term, one-party rule of  the LDP. I think that it is for this reason that Keidanren has  decided to stop acting as a middleman for political donations.  There is no denying the fact that the discontinuation of acting  as a middleman for political donations has been one of the  reasons that triggered the opinion that the four economic  organizations are unnecessary.    It is an undeniable fact that we considered an economic  organization to be an agency which made requests to the  government as the representative of enterprises. The political  donations made through Kokumin Seiji Kyokai [People's Political  Association] were a guarantee that those requests would be  enacted, and those donations were also funds to protect the LDP  government. It is also true that political donations given  through Kokumin Seiji Kyokai are cleaner than those given by  enterprises individually.    However, political donations came to be perceived as the  means by which the economic organization reflected the egoism of  the business community in government policies. In other words,  there were people who considered the economic organizations to  be agencies which forced the egoism of the business community on  the government. If that is true, the business community will  lose its reason for being. However, is it really true?  <H5>  What Are the New Goals? </H5>   Before I answer that question, I will narrow down my  discourse to Nikkeiren, whose vice chairman I am. As I  mentioned before, the problem of employment is the primary  concern of Nikkeiren. We may term employment problems labor  problems.    Keidanren was originally established by the executives who  felt a sense of crisis concerning the intensification of the  labor movement following the end of World War II, in order to  protect their management rights from labor problems such as  labor disputes and collective bargaining.    However, labor problems have undergone a great change  because  of economic growth and the capital-labor conciliation policy.  For example, I think that spring labor offensives, on which  Nikkeiren has had a great influence so far, will cease to exist  in the future. The reason is that sooner or later it will become  impossible to continue the current system under which the basic  wage rate is raised every year.    Then, if spring labor offensives cease to exist, will  Nikkeiren lose its reason for being?    The fact is that Nikkeiren, since the time of Chairman Eiji  Suzuki, has promoted various projects with the focal point being  the lives of workers. If what we have been doing is persuasive  and if member companies approve of what we have been doing,  Nikkeren will continue to exist.    Let us take housing problems, for example. It is certain  that the living conditions of the Japanese have improved.  However, because of the concentration of people in one area  which was caused necessarily by economic growth, land prices  have risen sharply. And it has become almost impossible for  salarymen working in big cities to buy a house in an area from  which they can commute to their jobs in big cities within one  hour.    To solve this problem, there is no alternative but to  restrain the concentration of people in one area, to promote  decentralization, and to activate the provinces. As Rengo  (Japanese Trade Union Confederation) claims, the rise of nominal  wages does not lead to the solution of this problem. Past  experience has shown that the rise of nominal wages leads to the  rise of land prices.    Politics has no choice but to promote the following with  full  determination: the decentralization of each ministry and  agency, reforms of the land system such as constraints on the  private ownership of land in urban areas, the improvement of the  transportation system, and the improvement of the environment so  that living in a local city can compare to living in Tokyo.  Deregulation also must be promoted with full determination.    To accomplish these goals, there is no alternative but to  establish a political system which makes a change of government  possible. A change of government means none other than the  public's choice, through elections, from among the policies  presented by each political party. It is impossible for the  government to carry out drastic policies resolutely unless it  has the definite support of the majority of the public.    It was because of the aforementioned reason that the four  economic organizations expressed the view that "political reform  should have priority over economic stimulus measures" in  reference to the recent political reform bill. The LDP raised  the outcry, "Should not the economic organizations say that  priority should be given to economic stimulus measures?"  However, the position of the four economic organizations is  that economic problems cannot be solved unless politics changes.    The fact is that the four economic organizations have been  advocating the need for political reform for the past few years.  Unless Japan reforms itself now, it will suffer a prolonged  decline and may well incur a great depression. Political reform  is the first step toward that reform. However, it seems that  the LDP could not understand our sense of crisis.    I think that the four economic organizations must continue  to advance such a claim and present concrete measures for  realizing the claim from the standpoint of each organization.    If the four economic organizations, as economic  professionals  who stand not only for the business community but also for the  public as a whole, actively propose policies and insist that "if  you implement these policies, bankruptcies will decrease and  employment will be maintained," the public will listen to our  proposals and the government will have to implement our  proposals, even if the four economic organizations wholly  abolish political donations. If many enterprises go bankrupt,  that will only lead to the unhappiness of the people.  <H5>  Losing the Raison d'Etre Can Only Mean Going Out of Existence </H5>   If organizations lose their reason for being, they will have  to fade away, and this fact is not confined to economic  organizations. If economic organizations are entities which  merely contribute political funds and maneuver government  policies, member companies will leave their organizations, and  such organizations will immediately disappear, even if they do  not disband their organizations themselves. In other words, as  long as the four economic organizations have their roles to  play, member companies will pay their membership dues and the  organizations will continue to exist.    What then are the four economic organizations' reasons for  being?    Some supporters of the four economic organizations say that  the organizations should survive as think tanks for proposing  policies. That is right, but I do not think that is enough.  There must be a lot of things other than that which the  organizations should do.    For example, the peace and prosperity of Japan cannot be  attained without the peace and prosperity of its neighboring  countries or those of the world. For this purpose, Japan is  asked to do a lot of things. Japan's security system, its aid  to developing nations, and its contributions to peacekeeping  operations are all interwoven and have ceased to be separate  problems.    Therefore, there must be services we can render as economic  professionals. The good management of economics also leads to  peace and prosperity. In international as well as domestic  problems, what is important is the support of the nation. In  that sense, the business community should be able to play a  major role in shaping public opinion.    Some people express the opinion that the four economic  organizations are unnecessary because there are too many of  them. It may be that administrative reform is needed in the  business community also. However, I have already stated that  each of the four economic organizations has a different role to  play.    It seems that Keidanren receives the most severe criticism,  but its opinion counts heavily in Japan's business community,  where big businesses form a large percentage of the existing  firms. Furthermore, opinions from a group of individual  executives such as Keizaidoyukai are valuable because the  members are not bound by the resolutions or the interests of  their business organizations.    When Keidanren was leaning toward egoism, Keizaidoyukai put  the brakes on that. For example, it was Keizaidoyukai which  advocated social responsibility by enterprises when  environmental pollution became an issue. Keizaidoyukai spoke  out early on about business ethics, the protection of the  environment, and consumer protection.    And Nissho, which is the representative of smaller  enterprises, is an organization authorized by the law, and it  goes without saying that it is still needed at the present  stage. I have already discussed Nikkeiren.    The four economic organizations have functioned  effectively in Japan's economy or in Japan's society because  they have played their respective roles well.    However, we should think and act with the determination that  "losing the reason for being leads to our immediate  disappearance." Developed European nations and the United States  do not have economic organizations in the form of those found in  Japan, although they do have associations. In a sense, economic  organizations are found only in developing nations.    When viewed in perspective, the day will come when Japan  will  not need economic organizations. We do not know when that will  be. I think that Japan will need the four economic  organizations for the next five to 10 years, but I do not know  about their future in the 21st century. That does not bother  me. I think it is meaningless to make efforts to save economic  organizations which have lost their reason for being. If  economic organizations become organizations whose only reason  for being is to receive honors from the government, their  existence is meaningless.    Many owner-executives who are a generation younger than we  are seem to be less conscious of their country and society than  are the old executives, who have acted with due consideration  for the interest of their country as well. They tend to think  only of their enterprises and themselves and to view things only  from the standpoint of "What advantage will we gain if we become  members of the organization?" I sometimes feel that it will not  be easy for them to take a broad view of their society and  country.    Or, that may be natural. It may be essentially unnatural if  enterprises think, talk, and act like the government or if  employees and labor unions think like executives. Therefore, it  can be said that they, our next generation, may be the ones who  are thinking naturally.    We have regarded a sovereign nation as an absolute entity,  and that has been the center of all our thinking. However, the  authority of sovereign nations is diminishing or breaking up,  while various countries are moving toward a loose unity. That  is the actual situation of the world today. Economics is also  becoming global and borderless.    It is a plain fact that the four economic organizations,  whose primary concern has been about Japan, are being pressed to  change amid all of this.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Enterprises on the Brink of </F> Collapse Will Have To Prove Their Solvency or Go Bust"]    [Text] The president's edict "On Measures To Implement  Legislative Acts on the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Enterprises,"  as well as his note on this subject to Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin, are evidence that we are on the threshold of a  qualitatively new stage of economic reform. Strictly speaking,  we should have gone past that point a long time ago, but the  undeveloped nature of market relations, the complex economic  situation, and political instability have not permitted us to do  this.    The first two factors are still in place. As far as the  third is concerned, certain positive moves have evidently  occurred here. To all appearances, Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet  felt sufficiently strong to set about tackling a very unpopular  task. In terms of its social and economic consequences, the  administration of mass bankruptcies is comparable to the price  liberalization in January 1992. The expected "pluses" as  regards putting the economy's structure in good order are  obvious, but will the possible "minuses" finally sink it?    Unfortunately, the market mechanism for bankruptcies is  being  put into effect using glaringly nonmarket methods. It will not  be the market which singles out the "no-hopers," but officials  at various levels in accordance with criteria which they  themselves have devised. It is proposed, for example, that the  basic indicator of insolvency be the so-called liquidity  coefficient, which is derived by dividing the sum of financial  assets by the sum of short-term credits received by the  enterprise. According to figures from the Russian Federation  State Committee for Statistics, more than 1,000 Russian  enterprises could by this criterion have been deemed to be  bankrupt at the beginning of this year.    Clearly, those who do not wish to go bankrupt will devise a  thousand and one ways of not getting on the "black list." Those  who, on the contrary, want to go bankrupt will find this an  absolutely simple task: Having acquired and spent credit, they  go under the hammer. You can have no doubt that quite a few  will wish to do this. In January of this year alone, more than  100 enterprises applied to Russian Federation State Committee  for Management of State Property volunteering to be declared  bankrupt. In the opinion of legal specialists, they wanted in  this way to avoid an even less pleasant court examination  involving their creditors.    There is in general a danger that energetic  behind-the-scenes  activities will unfold around the administrative "bankruptcy"  procedures, with all the features associated with them from  "disinterested" lobbying to bribery and financial machinations.    We can expect the same when the question of how to deal with  insolvent enterprises is resolved: Should they be made to go  bankrupt or should they be given money in order to "rescue"  them. As we can see, there is a significant difference, and it  will again be an official who decides whether to eliminate or  spare them.    The paradox lies in the fact that in both cases a lot of  money will be required. Private investors are unlikely to step  up their involvement here, therefore the basic responsibility  for expenditure will again fall on the budgets at all levels.  Their "reserves of stability" will clearly determine the rate  and scale of the bankruptcy process in a decisive manner.    Whatever happens, it is wrong to delay the reorganization of  insolvent enterprises, and we do not possess any mechanisms  other than administrative ones. The task is to make this  process manageable, predictable, efficient, and open, and to  reduce social costs to a minimum. Many ministries and  departments are working on this at present.</p>

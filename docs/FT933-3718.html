			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Arts: Modigliani transformed - William Packer enjoys a remarkable exhibition AN EXHIBITION may be important for many reasons, consolidating a reputation beyond question perhaps, or confirming doubts and reservations. Venice has already enjoyed two such this year; on the one hand the Biennale's magnificent omaggio to Francis Bacon, still on at the Museo Correr, on the other, the definitive Marcel Duchamp retrospective that was the previous show sponsored by Fiat at the Palazzo Grassi. But actually to transform our understanding of an artist and his work is something else. The exhibition is drawn from the private collection of Paul Alexandre, a friend of Modigliani's. The scope and richness of it all are the surprise and the delight. Alexandre died in 1968 at 87. As a young doctor with a practice in Montmartre, he came to know many artists, whom he befriended and supported. He met Modigliani, some three years his junior and only lately come to Paris, in 1907 and was his first, for some years his only patron. Their close friendship continued until 1914 and Alexandre's marching off to war, after which they never saw each other again, Modigliani dying of Spanish influenza in notoriously tragic circumstances early in 1920. In the course of their association, Alexandre amassed an extraordinary number of drawings, some 430 in all, amounting to nearly half those extant, along with a great quantity of intimate documentary material. It is not that the existence of his collection was unsuspected, for he would lend particular items from time to time to exhibitions, and he released a few to other collections. But Alexandre had always meant to publish it himself, with his own account of Modigliani as he knew him, and so kept it all very close. Now at last his son, Noel Alexandre, has kept that tacit promise. The period is from 1906 to 1914 which is covered exhaustively but exclusively by means of the artist's working drawings, from the merest hint of an image to the most fully realised of studies. The 'working' epithet is the key, for the address is practical, unselfconscious and immediate throughout. There is nothing here of the precious or the refined indulged for its own sake. Modigliani was a remarkable natural draughtsman, blessed with the swiftest and most delicate of hands, but it is the use to which he put his gift that is the thing. Time and again, presented en serie, we find the particular image that engrossed him at a given moment developed and refined through any number of subtle variations until it becomes fixed and certain - and all achieved with an economy and attack that together take the breath away. But there is much more to this work, both singly and collectively, than the mere demonstration of technical mastery. His enduring preoccupation was with the figure, most especially the female figure, but it was its resolution, whether as painting or sculpture, that was always for him the larger end. And it is in the clarification of those transitions in the development of the work, that before seemed quite arbitrary, that the true importance of this new material lies. A new-found interest in the primitive and the archaic, in the sculpture of Africa, the Pacific and Minoan Greece alike, was the currency of Paris in the mid-1900s. With such contemporaries as Brancusi and Picasso close at hand, Modigliani was hardly alone in responding to it in his work, but no longer may we read his response as sudden, arbitrary and merely fashionable. Here in the earlier dancers, the tumblers and acrobats we find at once the immediacy of the life-model in the studio, and yet the foreshadowing of the classical, schematic simplicity of the caryatids and statuary to come. And even in those endlessly repeated formal studies for carved heads and kneeling, bending, swaying figures, those caryatids and decorative capitals, again we find, if only by the subtlest of inflexions in face or pose, all the active energy of the model as she lives and breathes. So it is again later on, as what once seemed the abandonment of sculpture is shown to be an easier and natural return to painting. The kneeling caryatids become kneeling and then reclining figures, and the model is there again in the studio as the sharp, sculptural contour softens into palpable flesh. How sculptural those great reclining nudes of Modigliani's last years now appear  -would that a few of them were in the show: and how humane the carvings, for all their totemic formality. The Unknown Modigliani, Drawings from the collection of Paul Alexandre, is at Palazzo Grassi, until January 4. Then it goes on a world tour until 1996, sponsored by Fiat, carrier Alitalia.</p>

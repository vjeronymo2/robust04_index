			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT MAY SHAPE NATO STAND ON TACTICAL A-ARMS;  </P> <P> MILITARY: MINISTERS DISCUSS DEFENSE OFFICIALS' FINDINGS -- THAT IT WOULD BE  SAFE TO CURB SHORT-RANGE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  </P> <P> In the wake of an agreement limiting non-nuclear forces in Europe, an attacking  army of Soviet troops would have so far to march and would arrive so  thinned-out that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can safely dispense  with most of its short-range nuclear weapons, senior NATO defense officials  have concluded.  </P> <P> The preliminary findings were presented to NATO defense ministers here  Wednesday in the draft of a study prepared by the alliance's "High-Level Group"  -- officials from 15 allied nations responsible for nuclear policy. Its  findings were among the first matters discussed as the ministers opened two  days of meetings here on the future of nuclear weapons in Europe.  </P> <P> The report is expected to shape NATO's position on pursuing negotiations with  the Soviets to reduce or eliminate each side's force of short-range,  ground-launched nuclear weapons. President Bush called for the acceleration of  such negotiations last Friday.  </P> <P> In their first day of meetings, however, allies here clashed about the aim of  those talks. West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he found  "wide support for the German position that the clear aim of these negotiations  should be the removal of all land-based systems of the United States and the  Soviet Union."  </P> <P> But a senior British official said his government opposes the proposal that  elimination rather than the reduction of those missiles should be NATO's goal.  American officials in Washington have said the Administration is willing to  accept a ban on the missiles in Europe. At the NATO meeting, however, U.S.  defense officials argued against publicly defining any stance as an opening  position in the negotiations.  </P> <P> Stoltenberg said Wednesday that those negotiations could begin as soon as  December.  </P> <P> The West German defense minister joined his Dutch counterpart, Relus ter Beek,  in urging the alliance unilaterally to withdraw nuclear artillery shells from  Europe and to ask the Soviet Union to do the same.  </P> <P> There was a "general feeling" within the alliance that the nuclear shells, most  of which are deployed in West Germany, can be eliminated, Dutch Ambassador to  NATO Adrian Jacobovits said.  </P> <P> With agreement now being finalized to cut conventional forces in Europe, the  report presented to defense ministers explores the implications for NATO's  nuclear needs. An American official said the study, commissioned six months  ago, strongly suggests that even after negotiated reductions, some ground-based  nuclear missiles should remain in Europe.  </P> <P> The alliance defense chiefs are expected to conclude the two-day meeting today.  </P></p>

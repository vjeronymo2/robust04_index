			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Germany After such a gloomy report from Germany's five wise men, it is natural to look for signs that the Bundesbank is taking more account of the domestic economy when setting interest rates. In marking the D-Mark down yesterday, the exchange market thought it had found one in the nine basis-point cut in the central bank's money market repurchase rate. It may be jumping to conclusions. Mr Hans Tietmeyer has been fortunate in that inflation pressures have lessened somewhat since he assumed the presidency and money supply growth is within reach of this year's target. But that does not necessarily mean that he is a softer touch than his predecessor or that inflation is no longer the bank's chief concern. On average, the repurchase rate has fallen just four basis points in each of the past three weeks. That is hardly throwing caution to the winds. The Bundesbank has, though, given other European countries leeway to cut their own rates. Given the relative strength of consumer demand, UK rate prospects probably still depend on the extent of budget tax increases, but Denmark and Holland have cut rates this week. France may follow soon. The question is whether the D-Mark recovers once other rates have adjusted. A weakening currency would give the Bundesbank little incentive to lead the way.</p>

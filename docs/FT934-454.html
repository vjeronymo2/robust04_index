			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A healthy backlash against vulgarity - Philippa Davenport reports that cookbooks published in 1993 have been leaner, fitter - and a good deal more appetising John Major will be pleased to hear that, in cookbook circles at least, there is already a return to basics. This year, I have received far fewer than usual of those with acres of gratuitous technicolour pictures and overblown copy. In a healthy backlash against vulgarity, things are looking leaner, fitter and a great deal more appetising. To call this the year of in-depth probes into single foods could sound a mite worthy, joyless and dull. In practice, it is quite the opposite. A Celebration of Soups, by Lindsey Bareham (Michael Joseph, Pounds 16), is an outstanding book; I would live happily on the recipes it contains. The Bread Book, by Linda Collister and Anthony Blake (Conran Octopus, Pounds 19.99), is splendid stuff, too. I wrote about both when they were published. The new edition of Jane Grigson's Fish Book (Michael Joseph, Pounds 20) is compulsive reading. She was working on it shortly before she died and it incorporates additions and updates to nearly two-thirds of the original. Also, you can find your way around it much more easily now that the entries are alphabetical. Her greatest gift, perhaps, is the way she makes you feel you are sharing an experience together. Ices, by Caroline Liddell and Robin Weir (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 18.99), is far-ranging and thorough. Sub-titled 'the definitive guide,' it is just that: a magnum opus answering nearly all the questions you ever wanted to ask about ice-cream. I say 'nearly' because nowhere does the book tell me how to make those intriguing iced petits fours sometimes offered in restaurants - a scoop of sorbet barely larger than a mothball, enrobed with chocolate. The reason, the authors say, is that these can be made successfully only with a commercial freezer. They know the answer but there was not room to publish it. And, anyway, after five years of research, they had enough material to write a book three times the published length. Another simple title, another comprehensive volume: The Rice Book, by Sri Owen (Doubleday, Pounds 20). This is probably the most handsomely produced cookbook of the year. Nice size, good paper, a clean typeface and layout, plus attractive black and white drawings on the cover and inside by Soun Vannithone. The recipes are as sound and clear as Sri Owen's fans have come to expect. This collection encircles the globe but - unsurprisingly, given her background - it is the Indonesian recipes that excite the most. What really grips me, though, is the first 100 pages tracing the history and future of rice - its varieties, nutrition, production, and the myth and magic surrounding the grain. Facts are presented eloquently and the layman is not blinded by science. We learn that in Louisiana and New South Wales, germinated seeds are sown by low-flying aircraft straight into fields levelled by laser-controlled scrapers. Swamp or deep-water rices thrive in flood conditions near river mouths, able to grow 10-15 cm a day to keep pace with rising water levels. The unfurling of the flowers, 70 or so on a single panicle, sounds magical indeed. Rice pudding will never taste the same again. Nigel Slater has produced another winner in Real Fast Puddings (Michael Joseph, Pounds 9.99). I am not sweet-toothed but the morning this one arrived, when I should have been concentrating on something else, I kept sneaking back to it. Slater has great flair for flavour combinations and he talks much sense. The book is snappy and fun. Sophie Grigson, Jane's daughter, is another invigorating young writer. Eat Your Greens (BBC Pounds 15.99) is tailor-made for those who like to centre their meals on vegetables rather than meat or fish. Some recipes are rooted in tradition, others are surprising, possibly appealing more to young and adventurous palates than hidebound oldsters. Rena Salaman's Greek Food (HarperCollins, Pounds 16.99) is gentler in tone and slower in pace. This appeared first as a paperback original in 1983 and has long been out of print. Now in hardback for the first time, it seems as fresh and evocative as ever. The original and charming line drawings are retained while the text is enlarged pleasingly, revised thoroughly and includes extra chapters cut from the paperback. Gift market books have grown up this year. They were always small hardbacks, decorative and unlikely to burn a hole in your wallet. Now, some are real cookbooks in miniature, tasty little mouthfuls with which to woo a new audience into buying other, larger volumes of an author's work. Positively desirable are Anna Del Conte's very pretty quartet Gli Antipasti, La Pasta, I Risotti and I dolci (Pavilion, Pounds 5.99 each) and the Jane Grigson collections: 50 Soups and 50 Desserts (Michael Joseph, Pounds 6.99 each). Above all, 1993 strikes me as the year of the paperback cookbook. Seldom has there been such a large and enticing crop of titles by top authors available simultaneously at such affordable prices. Particularly irresistible are Arabella Boxer's Book Of English Food (Penguin Pounds 9.99); Entertaining All'Italiana and Secrets From An Italian Kitchen, both by Anna Del Conte (Corgi, Pounds 8.99 each); Jane Grigson's English Food and a compilation, The Best Of Jane Grigson (Penguin, Pounds 12.99 each); Margaret Visser's The Rituals Of Dinner (Penguin, Pounds 9.99); and MFK Fisher's With Bold Knife &amp; Fork (Pimlico, Pounds 8). Classics all. Young writers are well represented with A Feast Of Flavours, by Annie Bell (Corgi, Pounds 5.99); Sophie's Table, by Sophie Grigson (Penguin, Pounds 8.99); and Real Fast Food, by Nigel Slater (Penguin, Pounds 5.99). This trio would make a marvellous starter library for any young cook about to set up kitchen. Shaun Hill's spirited Quick &amp; Easy Vegetable Cookery (BBC) also is excellent. Because good eating begins with good shopping, all cooks would do well to be armed with Henrietta Green's Food Lover's Guide To Britain (BBC, Pounds 9.99) and Glyn Christian's New Delicatessen Food Handbook (Good Food Retailing Publications, Pounds 9.95). But the Christian book is let down by bad production. The pages are trimmed atrociously, print and paper are poor, and Boyd-Harte's illustrations are ruined by crude reproduction. The text, however, is well-researched, wide-ranging, and written neatly - often, entertainingly. After years of a culinary love affair with Italy, I find myself seduced once more by Gallic charms. Marie-Pierre Moine's stylish Fast French (Conran-Octopus, Pounds 15.99) boasts eminently cookable, eminently edible recipes. Mireille Johnston's Cookery Course Part 2 (BBC) provides delicious back-up for her engaging television series. Jeanne Strang's Goose Fat &amp; Garlic (Kyle Cathie, Pounds 9.99) is relaxed and richly inspiring. Strang has spent part of each year for the past 30 soaking up the pleasures of south-west France. The place, the people, the food and the way of life come warmly through every page of her vivid and affectionate portrait. Here is country cooking of the first order, the sort of foods I love best. This is the home of the goose, the duck, the pig, of prunes, truffles, mushrooms, chestnuts, walnuts and game. The more I dip into the book, the more addictive I find it. Finally, I rejoice in the offerings of a publisher I have not seen before: Seriph, which has brought out Cooking With Pomiane and Cooking In Ten Minutes (Pounds 7.99 and Pounds 5.99 respectively) both by Edouard de Pomiane. He is an utter delight. You would have to be dull of soul not to have your spirits and appetite lifted by him. Pomiane can be brilliantly practical. He is deft, witty, to the point. His lightness of touch is a salutary reminder that good food can be taken too seriously. Cooking should be fun.</p>

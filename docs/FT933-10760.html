			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Banco Essi opens fund for foreign investment BANCO Essi, part of Espirito Santo, one of Portugal's leading private financial groups, is launching a Dollars 100m capital development fund in association with Mr George Soros, the international investor, to invest in Portugal. It will be five times bigger than any other if its kind in Portugal. The lead investor will be Soros Capital II, which will commit about Dollars 50m to the fund. 'Over the years Espirito Santo has developed strategic relations with new partners,' said Mr Michael de Mello, of the fund's consultant team. 'That is how we have built ourselves up after being nationalised in 1975.' Banco Essi will commit Dollars 7m to the fund. Other backers will be insurance companies, pension funds and other institutional investors. The closed-end fund will have two closing dates: one on August 4 at around Dollars 80m, and a second in November at Dollars 100m. The fund will typically invest in businesses over which it establishes control or a significant degree of influence. There will be no hostile investments and the fund will not invest in the financial or real estate sectors.</p>

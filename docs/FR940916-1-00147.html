			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Upon receiving the signal to apply brakes for test, make a 20-psi brake pipe service reduction; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) With the brake valve lapped and the pressure maintaining feature cut out (if so equipped) and after waiting 45&hyph;60 seconds, note the brake pipe leakage as indicated by the brake-pipe gauge in the locomotive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) When locomotives are equipped with a 26&hyph;L brake valve or equivalent, a railroad may use the Air Flow Method Test as an alternate to the brake pipe leakage test. Perform the Air Flow Method (AFM) Test as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Charge the air brake system to within 15 psi of the setting of the feed-regulating valve, but to not less than 75 psi, as indicated by an accurate gauge or device at rear end of train; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Measure air flow as indicated by a calibrated air flow indicator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The air flow indicator shall be calibrated for accuracy at periodic intervals not to exceed 92 days. The air flow indicator calibration test orifices shall be calibrated at temperatures of not more than 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Air flow indicators shall be accurate to within  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  3 standard cubic feet per minute (cfm).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The inspector shall position himself/herself, taking positions on each side of the car if necessary, so as to be able to examine and observe the functioning of all moving parts of the brake system on each car.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Angle cocks shall be properly positioned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The brakes shall apply and remain applied until a release of the air brakes has been initiated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Piston travel shall be within 7 to 9 inches for 81/2-inch and 10-inch diameter brake cylinders or within the piston travel stencilled or marked on car or badge plate for other types.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Brake rigging shall not bind or foul so as to impede the force delivered to the brake shoes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) All parts of the brake equipment shall be properly secured. On freight cars where the bottom rod passes through the truck bolster or is secured with cotter keys equipped with a locking device to prevent their accidental removal, bottom rod safety supports are not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Brake shoes/pads shall be aligned with the tread of the wheel or the disc-brake bearing surface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Brake shoes/pads shall have adequate wear material to complete the intended trip in accordance with &sect;32.15(m).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Wheels shall be free of cracks as defined in &sect;232.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) When release signal is given, the brake on each car shall be inspected to verify that it did release. Train speed shall not exceed 10 MPH if a ``roll-by'' inspection of the brake release is performed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12) The empty/load device shall respond as intended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13) If the train is equipped with an end-of-train device, the device shall respond as intended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (14) If the train is equipped with an end-of-train device, a comparison check shall be made to ensure that the head-end pressure reading is within  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  3 psi of the rear-end pressure reading. The rear unit of the end-of-train device shall be installed on the rear of the train when this check is performed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Prior to departure of a train, a railroad shall determine that the locomotive brakes and train brake control devices operate as intended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Prior to departure of a train, a railroad shall determine that oil and water have been drained from the air brake system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Class 1 tests of new brake system technology shall be conducted in accordance with the Class 1 test procedures developed in accordance with the process given in Subpart J of this part for that technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) A train equipped with a two-way end-of-train device or its equivalent shall not depart from a point of origin unless:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The device is capable of initiating a power brake application from the rear of the train, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The batteries of the device are charged to at least 75 percent of watt-hour capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

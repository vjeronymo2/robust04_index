			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Moody's downgrades Woolwich ratings NATIONWIDE and Woolwich, the UK's second and third largest building societies, have had their credit ratings called into question by Moody's, the US credit rating agency. Woolwich's long-term senior debt rating has been cut by one notch from AA3 to A1, and subordinated debt rating from A2 to A3. Moody's has also placed under review for possible downgrade the credit ratings of Nationwide. The move underlines the pressure on building societies caused by the poor state of the UK housing market. Moody's said that its decision to cut the Woolwich credit ratings reflected a decline in the building society's asset quality. At the end of last year, Woolwich merged with the smaller Town &amp; Country Building Society, the 15th largest mutual saving's institution in the UK, which had run into problems following a sharp increase in mortgage defaults and repossessions. The merger bought Town &amp; Country's Pounds 2.2bn loan assets, including a high proportion of problem loans, on to the Woolwich balance sheet. However, Moody's noted: 'The Town &amp; Country's past lending practices have been discontinued and replaced by more conservative under-writing.' The decision to place Nationwide's AA3 long-term credit rating and A2 subordinated debt ratings under review was based on similar concerns about asset quality. The rating agency said that its review will 'focus on the loss associated with high levels of residential loan arrears'. Renault, the French motor group, has issued a FFr1.2bn domestic bond due March 30, 2001, paying 9.00 per cent and priced at 99.86 per cent, Reuter reports from Paris. The deal, which may be increased to FFr1.5bn before March 16, is being re-offered at 98.51 per cent, giving a spread of 78 basis points over the equivalent French government bond. The lead manager is Banque Nationale de Paris.</p>

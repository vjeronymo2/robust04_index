			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission  said Wednesday [23 June] the recent appreciation of the Japanese  yen was not sufficiently reflected in retail prices of domestic  and imported products.    The commission said the report was based on a comparison of  polls taken from retailers last October and a year earlier on 10  items in four categories, including confectionery, coffee,  cosmetics and sports balls.    The survey showed that retail prices remained unchanged for  70 percent of chocolate items imported by importing agencies and  sold at department stores, the commission said.    Retailers refrained from bringing down prices of these items  because of rising advertising costs, it said.    Prices of domestically made biscuits failed to decline  because of government regulations on raw materials such as wheat  and sugar.    Prices declined for nearly 90 percent of imported lipstick  and slightly less than 60 percent of makeup foundations which  were sold at department stores.    There was no major change in retail prices of domestically  made cosmetics because most of them were sold at prices  recommended by manufacturers, the commission said.    The commission said it will continue to monitor price  movements and warned makers and import agencies to refrain from  resorting to excessive measures to regulate retail prices of  their products.</p>

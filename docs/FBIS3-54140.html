			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Political correspondent Gadi Sukenik report] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Energy Minister  Moshe Shahal met today in London for several hours with the  energy minister of Qatar. The meeting was designed to promote a  huge deal to export gas from Qatar to Israel and Europe. The  future of the deal remains unclear. Our political correspondent  Gadi Sukenik is in the Tel Aviv studio with further details:    Shim'on Peres arrived in London from Oslo this morning,  Moshe  Shahal flew from Israel. They apparently met at the Hilton Park  Lane Hotel in central London and from there set out for a  meeting with the Qatari foreign minister and several of his  advisers. The reason for their meeting: a gigantic transaction  worth over $1 billion. Qatar has natural gas which it is  considering shipping in containers through the Red Sea to a  special port which may or may not be constructed in Elat. From  there the gas will travel through pipelines at the bottom of the  Mediterranean Sea to Europe. The economic viability of all  this, at least as far as Israel is concerned, is extremely  doubtful. Natural gas can also be purchased from Egypt. The  discussions in London were not about the deal itself, but only  about the possibility of conducting feasibility studies to  decide whether or not doing it is economically worthwhile.    Energy Minister Moshe Shahal has recently held a series of  meetings on this matter, both within Israel and abroad. Shim'on  Peres entered the picture because this deal may constitute,  among other things, the first practical fruit of the peace  process. But, to an even greater extent, Peres is getting  involved with the aim of using this deal as a first-ever lever  to promote further initiatives between Israel and the Arab world.</p>

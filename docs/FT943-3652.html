			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Observer: Needled Times change - even at the Royal School of Needlework in Hampton Court. The impeccably connected Giles Shepard, skilled embroiderer of some 30 years' standing, was recently replaced as chairman of the finance committee of the Royal School by John Burke, chief executive of Bristol &amp; West Building Society. The well-cushioned Burke, whose dexterity with a needle doesn't quite stretch to fixing buttons on shirts, says that a friend on the council had been keen to tap a wider pool of business knowhow. Now that Shepard, who remains a council member, has checked out as managing director of The Savoy, he will perhaps have more time once again to devote to the school's most urgent task - raising funds to educate its apprentices. But perhaps one of the other luminaries on the council might volunteer to return with the begging bowl to Rocco Forte, who has apparently been known to donate in the past.</p>

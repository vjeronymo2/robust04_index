			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: DeBartolo calls off Dollars 690m investment trust issue A planned Dollars 690m flotation that would have created one of the US's biggest property investment vehicles was called off yesterday, the latest sign that the market for such issues has become saturated. The transaction was to raise cash for the heavily-indebted property empire of Edward DeBartolo, one of the most prominent developers of shopping malls during the 1980s. In a statement, the DeBartolo Corporation said the deal had been delayed 'due to the current market conditions for publicly traded real estate investment trusts'. The decision comes at the end of a year in which cash-strapped private developers have rushed to take advantage of renewed interest in public property vehicles. More than Dollars 10bn has been raised so far this year by real estate investment trusts, or reits, according to Mr David Kostin, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. Despite the congestion in the market, Merrill Lynch completed the largest-ever reit offering yesterday, raising Dollars 839m for another mall developer, Simon Property. The Simon shares were priced at Dollars 22 1/4 , compared with an indicated maximum price of Dollars 25 a share when the sale was first disclosed in September. At the issue price, the shares yield 8.54 per cent, compared with an indicated yield when the issue was first announced of 7.25 to 8 per cent. The increased yield needed to attract investors was due partly to the congestion in the new issue market and partly to the rise in Treasury bond yields since October, said Mr Thomas Davis, managing director of equity capital markets at Merrill Lynch. Shares in DeBartolo Realty were said by other market participants to have been offered at a yield of 9 to 9.25 per cent, compared with the 7.7 to 8.2 per cent range it first indicated. DeBartolo refused to confirm the figure, but said it had decided not to proceed with the issue at what it called 'a heavily discounted price'. The abandonment of the issue is expected to intensify talks between DeBartolo and its bankers over a refinancing of the group's debts. The company said it 'will monitor all . . . alternatives, including accessing the public markets in the future'. The restructuring of its bank debt last year extended the maturity of a large part of the company's debts to five years or more, reducing the need for it to raise equity capital immediately. Cash began pouring into the public property sector in the first four months of this year as retail investors and mutual funds searched for higher yields than those available in the equity and fixed income markets. This pushed up reit share prices, contributing to a total return for the sector in the first 11 months of the year of 18.7 per cent, said Mr Kostin. The congestion caused by the rush of new reit issues has coincided with a deluge of other new equity transactions in the past fortnight. 'We've got extraordinarily heavy supply, particularly given that it's the middle of December,' said Mr Davis. The congested equity calendar is likely to run into January and early February. Around eight small reit transactions are believed to have been called off in the past two weeks.</p>

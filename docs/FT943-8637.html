			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Bank of Ireland sells UK finance house for Pounds 25m Bank of Ireland, one of the two main clearing banks in the Irish Republic, has sold its UK finance house subsidiary to a consortium of UK-based asset finance specialists for Pounds 25.7m. British Credit Trust was originally acquired in 1978, and at its peak had Pounds 400m in leased assets and hire purchase agreements. However, Bank of Ireland decided to withdraw from the general instalment credit business in 1990, when the industry was incurring heavy losses, and has since run down BCT's book to Pounds 8m. The bank said the sale ended its involvement in the instalment credit business in the UK. Bank of Ireland's strategy in the UK is to develop its branch banking and mortgage finance businesses. Mr Roger Gewolb, one of the directors of the consortium that has bought BCT, said: 'The asset-based financing business is now undergoing something of a renaissance and it is a good time to acquire the right sort vehicle to build up a business.' BCT had been well-managed by Bank of Ireland, he said, and offered good potential 'both through organic growth and acquisition'. The company will focus on commercial and consumer finance in the middle and small-ticket leasing and hire-purchase sectors. The consideration for BCT included secondary collectables, properties and cash, in addition to the primary loan book. 'We paid very little in goodwill,' Mr Gewolb said. Bank of Ireland said it had received more than the book value of BCT.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [Studio announcer] Zoran Lilic, president of  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, held talks in Aleksandrovac  Zupski with the communal leadership. Miroljub Simonovic reports  from Krusevac.    [Begin recording] [Simonovic] By making the decision to  bomb Serbian positions around Gorazde, the United Nations has  lost credibility and trust in the mission it is carrying out,  said President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Zoran Lilic  in Aleksandrovac today, and added:    [Lilic] Because of its irresponsible and unprincipled and I  would say rash behavior of some of its prominent personalities,  and under the pressure of those who believe that they can  realize their interests through force and to the disadvantage of  others, the United Nations today is directly involved in  unnecessary destruction and new victims in the area of the  former Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has become a contradiction to  itself, and it does not even observe its own documents, not even  the UN Charter. By making the decision to bomb Serbian  positions around Gorazde, it has lost all credibility and trust  in the mission it is carrying out. The only way for the United  Nations to recover at least partially the role it has lost is to  proceed immediately with the signing of a peace settlement for  the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to deploy all its  forces on the demarcation lines of the conflicts, to protect  peace impartially, and primarily to enable political  negotiations. This is what we in the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia, the Republic of Serbia, and in the Republic of  Montenegro have always considered the only right solution and  the only real way out of the Yugoslav crisis.

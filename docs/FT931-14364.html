			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Margins of error One would not expect Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton to blame supervisory failure for the bad debt troubles afflicting British banks. Doubtless competition following the financial liberalisation and technical innovations of the 1980s did play a role, not to mention the government's delay in tightening policy when the economy began overheating. It all seems so obvious with hindsight. The Bank of England had worries at the time. It could have given fuller voice to them. Bankers are congenitally prone to excess, especially in markets freed of credit controls. They need constant reminding to price risk correctly. An under-borrowed customer can quickly become risky if offered credit on terms too generous to refuse. The worst effects of the asset bubble could have been avoided if, in assessing creditworthiness, banks had concentrated more on sustainable cash flow than availability of security. Institutions like Barclays would now spend less time doubling as property companies. Of course, the risks would be smaller if policy were more predictable and stable. Since it is not, bankers must set their prices accordingly. Margins have not risen much in the 1990s, so they still appear not to have learned this lesson. Borrowers should not complain about margins, especially those who shopped around in the good times. They will have got what they paid for  -lenders who had less natural interest in supporting them when times became tough. One lesson of the recession is that long-term banking relationships may be worth paying for.</p>

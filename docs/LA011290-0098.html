			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTHERN PACIFIC TO PAY $7,000 IN ASBESTOS  CASE  </P> <P> Southern Pacific Transportation Co. was ordered Thursday to pay $7,050 in fines  and penalties after being convicted of illegally demolishing a building  containing asbestos.  </P> <P> The fines were imposed by Los Angeles Municipal Judge Owen Lee Kwong after  Southern Pacific attorneys pleaded no contest to three violations of a state  Health and Safety Code section that makes it a misdemeanor to fail to comply  with federal regulations in the handling of asbestos.  </P> <P> Deputy City Atty. Donald Kass said the charges stemmed from the Oct. 5, 1988,  razing of a single-story building near Southern Pacific headquarters adjacent  to the Los Angeles River and Glendale Freeway.  </P> <P> The demolition was carried out by Cal Pacific, a Huntington Park company that  pleaded no contest in the case last October and was fined $2,350.  </P></p>

It was the lowest since Hosokawa formed the coalition  cabinet  last August.    The KYODO poll, taken Tuesday and Wednesday, also indicated  that those who do not support the Hosokawa cabinet came to 29.7  percent, up 5.3 percentage points.    Of those polled, 54.5 percent said they opposed the proposed  "national welfare tax," which Hosokawa presented on February 3.  The proposal was later revoked.</p>

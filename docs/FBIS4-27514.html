			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- Japanese authorities'  suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) has come under fire in different countries.  The Mozambican Committee for Friendship With the People of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement May 20 said  the Japanese reactionaries have perpetrated a vicious  anti-Chongnyon campaign, while scheming to hurl their Armed  Forces into the Korean peninsula by drawing up a "security  emergency legislative arrangement", but they are greatly  mistaken.    The Japanese reactionaries must correctly understand the  socialist Korea, the statement stressed, and added: If they do  not stop at once their reckless anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon  campaign, they will bump into curses and condemnations from the  Korean people and the world people.    The Nepal-Korea Friendship Association in a statement May 20  said the police search of the Osaka prefectural headquarters of  Chongnyon by the Japanese authorities was part of their  political intrigues to suppress Chongnyon and a crude violation  of the democratic national rights of the Korean citizens in  Japan.    The Nigeria-DPRK Friendship Association in a statement May  17  strongly urged the Japanese authorities to renounce the hostile  policy towards the DPRK and stop at once the suppression of  Chongnyon and apologize for it.</p>

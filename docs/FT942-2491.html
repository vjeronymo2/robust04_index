			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Outdoors: A perfect permanent partner - Gardening / Clematis and roses climb to the top of Robin Lane Fox's league One more weekend like the last and the ground will be like a brick. The weeds will have to be dead-headed, refusing to be uprooted. Summer, meanwhile, has brought on the roses with a rush. Five years ago, I planted the climbing roses for my new garden: the obligatory New Dawn; the tall and strong red Etoile de Hollande; the scented head-hanging Lady Hillingdon; the quartered white Sombreuil; the heavy-scented pale pink Caroline Teftout; silvery-white Madame Alfred Carriere in memory of Sissinghurst; double-white Mrs Herbert Stevens; a peach-white rambler which even Peter Beales does not list; and - my current favourite - the silky pink-apricot Paul Lede which all but one nursery has forgotten. They have all flourished and anyone would like to grow them, but most of them came to me because of invisible memories. Beside each of them, I see past faces: the people, homes and serious gardeners through which these roses came to my notice. Whenever I planted a rose, I planted a clematis beside it; it is odd that so few people remembered until recently to do the same. The results are admirable and would suit any garden with walls, however restricted. The plan is so good that all the books neglected it and even the catalogues do not mention it, preferring to list clematis for trees, not roses. The reason must be the segregation with which the English regard their national flower. They give it rose beds, rose gardens and rose arches; roses, I was once taught at Kew Gardens, in Surrey, must never ever be underplanted and in winter they must be pruned hard to look like bundles of sticks. Control them, keep them apart, fan-train them on walls and never imitate the French. The French nail roses on to posts and prune them hard after flowering, packing them on to scaffolds, far too close together. On English walls, roses must never criss-cross and we all used to be told that nothing must interfere with a climber's health. The idea of mixing in a clematis would strike a college-trained gardener as absurd. A clematis needs a deep-root run and a site which does not dry out. The base of a wall is dry and a neighbouring rose makes it drier still. If the clematis grew, it would hang like a mop of green hair or go brown at the bottom and accentuate a rose's lower nudity. In fact, the two families twine together very well and allow us all to double up our garden's seasons by ignoring Royal Horticultural Society rules. The deep violet flowers of Clematis V President have threaded themselves through the lower reaches of my large Madame Alfred; the orange-yellow Lady Hillingdon is crowned with the sky blue Perle D'Azure; sky-blue Lasurstern dominates the outer edges of the white varieties, while various viticellas prolong the season by flowering in August. Most of these clematis were planted within a foot of the rose and are none the worse for it. Most of them stand beside gravel or a paved path while their roots can run deeply, exploring the cooler soil underneath. I would like to take credit for this easy combination, but I copied it from better gardeners. Anyone can copy it, but they will need to think about the height and width of their clematis and to be willing to feed and water it whenever possible. People go wrong by assuming that most clematis grow to a similar height and can be planted without further thought. In fact, they vary hugely and need to be matched to the task in hand. Tall twining roses, such as red Etoile d'Hollande, need to be matched to a short-growing clematis so that all the flowers do not appear at the top of a wall. For tall roses, I recommend the white Clematis Henryi, mauve-blue Prince Charles, the dusky red Madame Edouard Andre for pale-flowered roses, and the blue H F Young, which flowers so profusely. Do not assume that all the late-flowering viticella forms are relatively short-growing. They are not and you should consult an explicit catalogue such as that produced by Valley Clematis, of Hainton, Lincoln, for details of the potential height of each variety. The shorter types of climbing rose, such as Lady Hillingdon, are easily suited in the opposite direction. The king of all easy clematis, the wonderful Perle d'Azure, will race up above any such climber and reach 15ft in height, crowning it with showers of its rounded blue flowers. I find it much better than the yellow-flowered varieties which are sometimes recommended but which are much too dense in leaf and growth. Why not have two beauties where conventional books think only of one? Promiscuity pays and I have got away with almost total neglect. Double-planting does not double the effort, but it does double the season, especially in enclosed urban gardens where the best planners know very well that they must think in terms of a jungle with layers. The one secret is to feed and water heavily whenever you can, adding Phostrogen to a can of water and drenching the roots of the clematis as often as once a week. Under the quiet moon of these recent warm evenings, it is an enchanting labour, tending a second presence among the curtains of roses which have just sprung to their yearly best.</p>

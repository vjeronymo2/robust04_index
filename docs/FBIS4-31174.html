			<p>BFN     [Text] The cabinet of our country's president of the  Presidency has released a statement explaining the position of  the Federation and Republic state delegation at the negotiations.    The delegation demands that the cease-fire throughout the  territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be for a period of four  weeks. Arms of 12.7-mm caliber and upwards must be concentrated  far from the front lines, and have to be guarded and monitored  by the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] and NATO. The monitoring  of the cease-fire and communication between the opponents would  be secured by UNPROFOR according to the procedure coordinated  with the legitimate authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation also insists on guarantees  for the unimpaired passage of humanitarian organizations  throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, the immediate release of all  civilians held by the aggressor side, the unconditional and  immediate opening of Tuzla airport for the delivery of goods for  civilian purposes, the cessation of ethnic cleansing, and the  effective implementation of all Security Council resolutions  regarding the protection of security zones.    The negotiations in Geneva are not being conducted directly  with the representatives of the aggressor, but according to the  principle of separate rooms. UN representatives are acting as  mediators for the proposals of the parties involved, reads the  statement from the cabinet of the president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report LONDON Metal Exchange contracts generally rallied yesterday afternoon after values had been hit in early trading by a wave of liquidation. Most base metals closed with losses still showing, but the rally continued in after-hours 'kerb' trading. This took LEAD, which closed Pounds 4 down for cash at Pounds 334 a tonne, near to a fresh 12-month high as the market was supported by trade buying and reports of Chinese offtake. ZINC resisted the early downtrend and support held at around Dollars 1,320 a tonne for three months metal, although it was unsettled by Monday's LME announcement that the market was again being 'closely monitored' because of concern over a developing technical supply squeeze. The later rally carried the three months zinc price to Dollars 1,344.50 at the close, down Dollars 14 on the day, and to Dollars 1,355 a tonne by the end of kerb trading. TIN rallied particularly strongly, as early short-covering prompted fresh buying, and ended with a substantial recovery from the recent decline. The cash position closed Dollars 170 higher at Dollars 6,880 a tonne and made a further gain after hours. COCOA futures rallied from early lows, raising hopes of consolidation after recent losses.

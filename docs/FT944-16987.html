			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Rightwingers descend into slough of despond - Fear of losing their seats will cause Eurosceptics to keep quiet This time around they will mainly avoid public confrontation. But Mr John Major would do well not to misinterpret the relative calm of the Tory right in Bournemouth this week. It will not be the calm of the content. Still less of the vanquished. It will be the calm of the despondent. And of a group that knows on which side its bread is buttered. Put bluntly, with the second half of the parliament now upon us rightwing MPs, in common with the rest of the party, are starting to worry about keeping their seats in the next general election. With the Conservatives lagging woefully in the polls and a bright young Labour leader threatening to make his party electable for the first time in more than a decade, they have concluded reluctantly that the last thing the party needs is a show of disunity. As Mr David Evans, a rightwing member of the executive of the influential 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, puts it: 'The Tories like winning. They won't win if they are divided.' Rightwingers seem as unhappy with the government's performance today as at any time since April 1992 - although they were encouraged both by the Eurosceptic rhetoric used by the prime minister in the European elections in June and the promotion of two of their favourites, Mr Jonathan Aitken and Mr Michael Portillo, in July's cabinet reshuffle. But they fear that any immediate move to oust Mr Major could leave them lumbered with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the incorrigibly Europhile chancellor. As Mr Nicholas Budgen, the Eurosceptic MP for Wolverhampton South West, put it, the right was likely to keep quiet in Bournemouth because: 'I don't think there is any alternative.' When they do speak out this week it will be to contribute to the debate inside the party about how best to combat Mr Blair. They will advise against any move to contest the centre ground that the Labour leader is attempting to make his own. Instead, they will call on the leadership to nail its colours to the mast in three key areas where they think it is vital to put 'clear blue water' between themselves and Labour. The most important of these was spelt out by the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward in its probably vain eve-of-conference call for 2p off income tax in next month's Budget. Even those who - like Mr John Townend, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee - think Mr Clarke is right not to cut taxes until public borrowing has been reduced to acceptable levels, still expect the chancellor to take the axe to public spending to clear a path for tax cuts in November 1995. 'He has got to start cutting spending this year if we are to get meaningful tax cuts before the election,' he said. Mr Townend also cautions against further increases in non-direct taxation. 'I think the government has underestimated the impact on the electorate of tax increases by sleight of hand,' he said. The right is also anxious for the government to retake the initiative on law and order, an issue on which it thinks Labour has eroded the Conservatives' traditional advantage, and on Europe, where it wants Mr Major to make it clear that Britain would not join a single European currency. With Maastricht done and dusted and the next intergovernmental conference still more than a year away, the Tory schism over Europe looks set to be less exposed in Bournemouth than at any Conservative conference since Baroness Thatcher's fall. There is a potential flashpoint today in an agriculture debate commending the government for its part in reforming the Common Agricultural Policy. But the debate's timing, at the start of the very first session, makes it likely that any trouble from Eurosceptics will be on a small scale. More worrying for the government is the right's attitude to the European own resources bill, increasing Britain's payments to the European Union, which is likely to come before MPs early in the next parliamentary session. Sir Teddy Taylor is '100 per cent' certain to oppose it, notwithstanding the feeling that the party needs to hang together at all costs. The MP for Southend East believes the bill will be 'a massive embarrassment to everyone' since it will increase public expenditure at a time of huge pressure to bring spending down. According to Sir Teddy: 'There is a depth of depression in the party I have never seen before in 30 years. I think there is a feeling of deep gloom and despondency. And a feeling I haven't seen since Ted Heath's time that we hope something will turn up.' If nothing does turn up and the party continues to trail Labour in the polls by more than 20 points, then the main talking-point at next year's conference in Blackpool may be the identity of Mr Major's successor. Without some sign of tangible progress the right would by then have concluded that if holding their tongues and avoiding public divisions was not working, then they had better try something else. They would no longer be prepared to 'hang on to nurse for fear of something worse'. As one rightwinger said: 'If the Blair honeymoon doesn't end, it's better to try anything rather than go off the precipice.'</p>

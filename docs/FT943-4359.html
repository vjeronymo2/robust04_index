			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Speech computer offers new hope A consortium of European universities and companies is developing a device that will enable people who cannot talk to hold a natural-sounding conversation by using speech synthesized by a computer. Two prototypes are already under test. The consortium is confident that a working device will be available within 2 1/2 years, said Dr Iain Murray of Dundee University, a consortium member who spoke at the British Association science festival in Loughborough yesterday. Aids for disabled people form an important and growing market for talking computers. Machines that convert text into speech for blind people and generate speech for the voiceless are the main applications. The new device is based on a portable computer and a speech synthesizer. It has special software that allows the user to generate speech at normal conversational speeds, and to make the speech sound more natural by including inflections like those that signal the emotion and meaning in normal speech. In order to generate speech faster than it could be typed in, the device will take advantage of the fact that much of the content of natural speech is predictable. By analysing the user's normal speech patterns, and by analysing what he has just said, the machine will be able to make a small number of guesses about what the user is likely to say, and present him with a set of choices on the screen. 'For example,' Dr Murray said, 'it will know that if the person has just said 'Hello' he is quite likely to say the name of one of his friends.' It will have learned the names of his friends, and other things he is likely to say, by analysing his past speech and will include them among the choices that it gives him.' Because each choice made by the user generates a word, or even a whole phrase, commands to generate speech can be issued rapidly enough to maintain a natural conversation with a human listener. The device will also analyse the emotional content of the speech it is about to generate, and vary the intonation and the pitch. With the new device, it will be possible to use a computer to speak on your behalf within three years. Speaking to a computer is much further away. Progress is being made in recognising speech, that is in converting the sounds into words. Understanding what the words mean is much more difficult, according to Dr Murray. The most successful word recognition systems recognise single words with an accuracy of between 60 and 99 per cent. Extracting the words from a stream of continuous speech is not yet possible, Dr Murray said. Recognition of single words is good enough for applications where only a limited number of words need to be used. Systems that handle simple travel inquiries are already in use.</p>

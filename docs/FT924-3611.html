			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Survey of Israel (9): Trying to withdraw - The government and the banks THE big issue for 1993 facing four of the five banks which dominate Israel's financial sector is not so much how they will perform, but what will become of their ownership. If the government sticks to its target, it will in the coming year move decisively at last to resolve the question of how to divest the state of the majority shareholdings it has in the four biggest banks - Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, Israel Discount Bank and Bank Mizrahi. (The fifth-largest, First International Bank of Israel, is privately owned.) The state took on the bank stock at the cost of some Dollars 7bn after a share collapse in 1983. A preferential share system left control in the hands of the original owners. But under agreements with all four banks, the government-held shares will have full voting rights when they are sold back to the private sector. In theory there is a deadline of October 1993. Under the terms of the government rescue, the banks would come under full state control from that time if they have not previously been re-privatised. The Labour-led coalition is anxious to earn the receipts this would bring the government and is committed not to preside over a full-scale nationalisation. Overall, the banks look relatively well positioned for sale. Mr Ze'ev Abeles, the Banks' Examiner at the Bank of Israel, says that despite a problem of non-performing debt in the agricultural sector, which has required big provisions over the past five years, the bad debts, strikes and other problems of the past decade have been largely overcome. The banks, which cover the spectrum of financial activity including retail banking, mortgages, asset management, brokerage and insurance, should report improved profitability this year over last year's inflation-adjusted average of less than five per cent net return on capital. Privatisation should inject keener competition into a sector notable for the almost total absence of foreign banks. But the process has to date proved slow and uncertain and many question marks still hang over how it may turn out. Mr Saul Bronfeld, the managing director of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), which is hungry for big bank equity issues to soak up heavy demand, voices the frustration of many at the way the bank sales are being handled. 'Mexico privatised 18 banks in 12 months. The Israeli government has not succeeded in privatising one bank in nine years. We are annoyed. The market is having its best year since 1982. The government may miss an opportunity.' This criticism irritates Mr Gil Leidner, the chief executive of MI Holdings, the government company charged with handling the bank sales. He argues that progress is being made. Agreement has been reached to sell a 51 per cent stake in Bank Mizrahi, previously owned by the World Mizrahi religious organisation, for Dollars 185m to Mr Gad Ze'evi, an Israeli businessman, which now only requires Bank of Israel assent. The balance will then be floated on the TASE. A long-delayed similar tender process will be launched in three to four months for Bank Igud, a profitable unit that is being split off from Bank Leumi. Meanwhile, Israel Discount Bank has been split from its parent, IDB Holdings. A controlling share of IDB Holdings, a big investment group, has been sold back to its original owners, the Recanati family of Tel Aviv. The remaining 42 per cent government stake in the holding company, valued at Shk950m, was due to be floated on the TASE late last month. Mr Leidner then intends to issue tenders for a 26 per cent stake in the bank - worth perhaps Dollars 250m - in the first half of 1993 that would establish a new owner. 'Our attitude is to sell a controlling interest first. We think it is important to secure long term, stable ownership of the banks before selling shares to the public,' Mr Leidner says. This approach is disputed, not least by the Bank of Israel. 'We need to think over whether the process of sale of control by auction is the right way to sell (Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi and Discount Bank),' says Mr Abeles. Mr Leidner himself admits that the sheer size of Bank Hapoalim, controlled by the Histadrut trade union federation, and Bank Leumi, controlled by the Jewish Colonial Trust, makes selling them 'a completely different ballgame'. Their combined assets of some Shk150bn are more than twice the combined assets of the other three banks. He intends a test flotation on the TASE of a 10 per cent stake in each (both had shareholder's equity last year of more than Shk3bn). There is still considerable debate on how to proceed from there, however. Mr Abeles, who doubts it will be possible to find investors willing even to buy a 10 per cent stake in Hapoalim or Leumi, says a steering committee should be set up with Bank of Israel participation to decide. It looks highly unlikely the issue will be resolved by October next year, leaving the government with an additional problem of how to avoid taking direct control of the country's two dominant banking groups.</p>

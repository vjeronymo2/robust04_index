The manufacturer of this state-of-the-art air  defense system offered it to the United Nations at the beginning  of the year.    According to preliminary conjectures, the Tamara radar could  be deployed in Cyprus. From this island, which is some 150  kilometers from the coast of Lebanon, Israel, and other Middle  Eastern states, the radar could monitor the airspace above this  region. It could also partially monitor the transfer of  military hardware on land and sea. Tamara has a range of up to  450 kilometers.    Tamara can detect aircraft against which normal radar  systems  are ineffective. It is similar to the U.S. AWACS [Airborne  Warning and Control System] early warning system. However, as  opposed to active radar systems, which emit radio waves into the  atmosphere and assess their reflections, Tamara only receives  radio impulses from the atmosphere.    Ludek Stodulka, vice president of the HTT Group, which  produces the radar, told us that Tamara can detect air-defense  systems and the precise coordinates of missiles, airfields, and  warning systems. It can differentiate between the false and real  locations of military hardware. It can distinguish types of  aircraft, missiles, ships, and radars at great distances.    According to Stodulka, the Czech Foreign Ministry has  described the company's initiative as encouraging. However, the  appropriate UN offices have not yet responded to the HTT Group's  offer. In the opinion of Army experts, the deployment of the  Tamara system would have forestalled such tragedies as the  shooting down of flight KAL-007 in 1983 by a former Soviet  fighter bomber or the shooting down of the A-300 passenger  aircraft by a U.S. Navy missile over the Persian Gulf.    Stodulka said that the HTT Group would like to apply to the  Association for Czech Republic Quality Awards to grant the  system a Czech Made trademark.</p>

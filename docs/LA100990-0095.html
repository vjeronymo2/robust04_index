			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACTIVISTS DEMAND GENTLER STANCE TOWRD THE  OBESE  </P> <P> Make a fat joke or toss an insult at an overweight man or woman and you're  skating on thin ice, say activists demanding a change in attitude toward the  obese.  </P> <P> Members of the National Assn. to Advance Fat Acceptance, or NAAFA, say they've  had enough of discrimination and cruel attacks simply because they carry extra  pounds.  </P> <P> "You can't joke about ethnic groups, and it's not OK to poke fun at the  handicapped. Fat is the last safe frontier," said Dee Davey, chairwoman of the  Los Angeles chapter of the organization.  </P> <P> Fear may be the reason for attacks on the obese, said Samuel Dambrocia, an  Orange County psychologist. "People are saying, 'Being fat is something I do  not want to part of,' " Dambrocia said.  </P> <P> But NAAFA members, who have begun fighting alleged discrimination on the job  and in the media with letters and lawsuits, say there are indications of  change, citing such prime time televsion shows such as "Roseanne" and "Babes."  </P></p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Greene King static at Pounds 20.4m - Government asked to cut beer duty to combat cheap imports Greene King, the regional brewer, yesterday blamed the lingering recession in East Anglia for a flat performance during the 12 months to May 1 with underlying pre-tax profits rising just 1 per cent to Pounds 20.4m. The Suffolk-based company said it had endured one of the longest and deepest recessions in memory, and beer volumes in its home market had fallen 7 per cent. However, Mr Simon Redman, chairman, said the brewer had managed to restrict its own sales decline to 0.6 per cent and contributions from newly-acquired pubs in other areas helped group turnover increase 5 per cent to Pounds 146.1m (Pounds 139m). He claimed this was a creditable result in a fragile market where many breweries were suffering from cheap European beer imports. Calling on the government to help the UK industry by reducing beer duty rates from 30p a pint to less than 10p, he warned: 'Failure to act merely exports jobs and passes tax revenue to our European neighbours.' Difficult trading conditions and the impact of continental imports meant prospects remained patchy, he added, even though pre-tax profits rose 18 per cent on an FRS 3 basis. The figures were distorted by exceptional costs of Pounds 2.8m arising from the abortive 1993 bid for Morland, the Thames Valley-based brewer. Trading profits were held at Pounds 26.7m (Pounds 26.8m) as the group struggled with its brewing and wholesaling business, where profits fell sharply from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 6.9m. The shortfall was offset by slightly improved profits in the tenanted trade  -which overcame intense price competition and discounting to report profits of Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 14.8m) - and a 24 per cent upturn in profits in the retail trade to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 8.5m). The acquisition of 44 pubs from Bass helped the managed pubs division improve margins with drink sales growing 12 per cent and food sales increasing 49 per cent. The Pounds 17.5m Bass acquisition took capital spending to Pounds 37.6m, while gearing rose from 34 per cent to 39 per cent. Adjusted earnings per share came out at 35.9p (35.6p) and a final dividend of 9.05p is proposed, making 12.9p (12.3p) for the year. COMMENT Although the results were slightly below expectations, Greene King should emerge from its local difficulties in a stronger position. It has shifted its bias away from tenanted pubs, where price cutting has been fiercest, to develop its managed estate while also building a reputation outside East Anglia. That effort will be boosted shortly by the opening of its Camberley depot to serve southern England and restoring its in-house canning operations. These developments are expected to lift profits this year to Pounds 22.5m, putting the shares on a prospective multiple of 12 - below the market sector's average.</p>

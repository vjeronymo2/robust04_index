			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AIDS VICTIM RYAN WHITE EULOGIZED;  </P> <P> FIRST LADY AMONG HOST OF CELEBRITIES MOURNING TEEN-AGER  </P> <P> First Lady Barbara Bush and a host of celebrities joined mourners at services  today for AIDS victim Ryan White, the teen-ager who steadfastly fought to the  end against public misconceptions and prejudice about his deadly disease.  </P> <P> The afternoon funeral was held in Second Presbyterian Church, chosen because it  was one of the few churches near his hometown of Cicero that could accommodate  the throngs of mourners. It can seat more than 1,000 people.  </P> <P> White, 18, died Sunday in Riley Hospital for Children after waging a five-year  battle against the disease and discrimination against its victims.  </P> <P> The Rev. Ray Probasco, a Methodist minister and friend of the White family,  delivered the main funeral sermon. The choir from Hamilton Heights High School,  where White was a junior, sang and singer Elton John, a friend of White's,  played and sang his own "Skyline Pigeon" and lead the congregation in the  Lord's Prayer.  </P> <P> John, football player Howie Long, talk show host Phil Donahue and three of  White's high school friends -- Tommy Hale, Leo Joseph and John Huffman -- were  the pallbearers.  </P> <P> Gov. Evan Bayh ordered flags in the state flown at half-staff. Classes were  held today at Hamilton Heights High School, where White was a junior, but  students were allowed to leave and attend the funeral.  </P> <P> White, who won the admiration of stars and common people alike during his  crusade for AIDS education, was remembered Wednesday by former President Ronald  Reagan as a teen-ager "who just wanted to be like the other kids."  </P> <P> "Ryan would probably be embarrassed by all the fuss we are making over him,"  Reagan wrote in an op-ed column in the Washington Post. "He did not want to be  anyone special. He just wanted to go to school, play with his friends and grow  up like every other kid in the neighborhood. But it was not to be."  </P> <P> After the funeral White was buried this afternoon in a private service at a  cemetery in Cicero, the town about 25 miles north of Indianapolis where he had  lived since 1987.  </P> <P> Hundreds of people called during visitation Tuesday at a mortuary in suburban  Carmel despite dreary, rainy weather.  </P> <P> The visitors included family, friends, classmates, well-wishers and AIDS  activists. About 25 people at a time were allowed into the visitation area,  where they were greeted by White's mother, Jeanne.  </P> <P> John, who arrived at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis on April 2 and  kept vigil in White's room until his death, stood behind Jeanne White to offer  comfort to her and other friends and relatives.  </P> <P> Prominently displayed in front of White's open casket were a slate from the  1989 television movie, "The Ryan White Story," and a People magazine cover  featuring White. Numerous photos, including a baby picture posted above White's  body, were placed among flowers that adorned the casket.  </P> <P> White was diagnosed with AIDS in December, 1984, after contracting the virus  from a blood-clotting agent used to treat his hemophilia. He was told he might  live six months to one year but he survived more than five years.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["International commentary" by Li Changjiu (2621 7022 0036) </F>   "The Most Favored Nation Status Is Not a Bestowal"]    [Text] Two countries' most favored nation [MFN] status is  an equal and mutually beneficial arrangement and a basis for  both sides to conduct normal trade. It is beneficial to both  sides and not a bestowal provided by one side to the other.  Prior to his China tour in March, U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher visited Australia. During his visit, Australian  Foreign Minister Evans explicitly said: "It is our opinion that  MFN is not something preferential but is a normal basis for  trade." But when Christopher visited China, he still regarded  MFN as a carrot and linked it to the human rights issue.    Sino-U.S. relations are not based on the same social system,  the same concept value, or on the same ideology but are  established on the basis of common interests. Despite their  different concepts on value and human rights, Sino-U.S. economic  and trade relations have rapidly developed since the signing of  a bilateral trade agreement in Beijing which provided each other  with MFN status in 1979. Sino- U.S. trade volume increased from  $2.45 billion in 1979 to $27.65 billion last year. Deputy U.S.  trade representative Barshefsky told the U.S. Congress that  direct investments by U.S. businessmen in China totaled more  than $7 billion; in 1993, U.S. business investments in China  amounted to $3 billion, some 550 U.S. firms had established  offices in China, and 500 major U.S. firms regarded their  investments in China as one of their strategic development  targets.    China needs developed countries' capital, technology, and  equipment for its modernization. When talking about investment  prospects in China recently, U.S. trade representative Kantor  predicted that in the coming 10 years, China's investment in  basic facilities construction alone will amount to $500 billion;  the United States has competitive strong points in the fields of  telecommunications, highway, and heavy machinery. Some U.S.  economic experts estimate that if the United States can obtain 1  percent of these contracts, this will create tens of thousands  of employment opportunities in the United States. Following the  sustained, rapid, and steady development of China's economy,  China's imports will continuously increase. China's imports  amounted to $103.95 billion last year and if they grow at 9  percent per annum, they will amount to $1,000 billion in the  year 2000. This serves as a large market for the world. As  long as the United States maintains normal economic and trade  relations, China will become an increasingly important market  for U.S. investment, commodities, and labor force.    A host of facts prove or suggest that mutual MFN status  between China and the United States is beneficial to the two  countries and their peoples. If the United States abolishes  China's MFN status, China's interests will be damaged but the  U.S. Government is clearly aware of the following points:  First, China has a large population and relies mainly on its  domestic market. Last year, China's exports amounted to $91.77  billion. Deducting the one-fourth export volume of the  "three-capital" enterprises and some of the export commodities  manufactured in the business form of "three come's and one  compensatory" [processing provided raw materials, processing  according to provided samples, assembling with provided  components, and compensatory trade], China's exports do not  account for a large percentage of its GNP. China relies mainly  on its domestic market and its ability to rely on its own  efforts is strong. Second, China's opening up is  omnidirectional and it is willing to develop economic and trade  relations with other countries on an equal and mutually  beneficial basis. So far, businessmen from more than 100  countries and regions in the world have come to China for  investment. Last year, investment agreements between China and  foreign businessmen amounted to $110.852 billion and the  investments actually made totaled $25.759 billion, of which U.S.  investments accounted for only a small percentage.    Many Americans understand that, should the United States  abolish China's MFN status, U.S. losses would not be smaller  than China's because it could lose a large market for  investment, commodities, and labor force. After Christopher's  visit to China, the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee held a  seminar on Sino-U.S. relations in Washington on 15 March. At  the seminar, some famous entrepreneurs called on the Clinton  administration to separate the human rights issue from China's  MFN status and to unconditionally renew China's MFN status.  Clarkson, vice president of the Boeing Company, said that the  company "fully supports renewal of China's MFN status" and hoped  that the U.S. Congress would abolish its annual debate on this  issue. Denholm, general manager of Chrysler--the third largest  automobile company in the United States--recently asked the  Clinton administration to separate the human rights issue from  renewal of China's MFN status. He pointed out that, at the same  time as the United States was using the human rights issue to  exert pressure on China, the German Government had expressed its  readiness to provide preferential financial aid to create  conditions for Mercedez-Benz and Chrysler to build a factory in  China, adding that the United States would harm itself in using  the human rights issue to impose trade sanctions against China.  Worlick, in charge of the American Telegraph and Telephone  Company, expressed the same uneasiness by saying that, in  retaliating against China, large U.S. companies could be the  first to suffer. His company has joined the project to build a  modernized telephone system in China. Worlick said: Only two  of every 100 people in China have telephone sets. There is huge  potential in this respect in a country with 1.1 billion people  and "by the year 2000, China will have the biggest  telecommunications network in the world." Worlick added: The  American Telegraph and Telephone Company must remain in a  favorable position, otherwise it will lose its leading position  among its opponents, like France, Germany, Sweden, and Japan.  In a speech on 23 March, President Clinton said that "the  United States absolutely needs to renew China's MFN status."  This indicates that President Clinton has a good idea of how  things stand. The problem is that some so-called idealists in  the United States are ignorant about China and the world and  unwilling to lay down the obsolete weapons of carrots and  sticks. However, we believe that reality is the best teacher to  awaken these "idealists" to the facts.</p>

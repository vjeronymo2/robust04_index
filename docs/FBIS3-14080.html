			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by MBC </F> Correspondent Mahir Shalabi on 22 March; place not  given--recorded, in English with superimposed Arabic translation]    [Text] [Shalabi] The Palestinians in Tunis say that your  delegation, which visited Tunis recently, did not make any new  proposals that could help the resumption of negotiations.    [Peres] I am not sure that they have said something like  this. I hope the talks will resume. This is a beginning, and we  are all in a difficult situation. But I believe that through a  common effort we can continue the negotiations and establish a  new reality.    [Shalabi] The Palestinians are saying that the Israelis are  proposing setting up a security belt around settlements in  Hebron instead of finding another solution.    [Peres] I do not think so. I believe that the Israeli  delegation said that while negotiating over the measures we need  to guarantee the security of all citizens--Arabs and Jews--and  we are ready to hold talks with the PLO over this matter.  However, the issue of the settlers is a purely Israeli matter.  This matter is the responsibility of the Israeli Government and  it will make the appropriate decision.    [Shalabi] In your opinion, what are the factors that will  help the resumption of the negotiations?    [Peres] I believe that we need to do two things. The first  is to take measures to provide security for everyone in Hebron.  We will take such measures. The second thing is to quickly  conclude negotiations over Gaza and Jericho in a very short  period of time. Thus, we would be showing the Palestinians and  ourselves a new reality, not only a new declaration. I hope  that within a few weeks the Palestinians' autonomy in Gaza and  Jericho will be a reality.    [Shalabi] Do you think that if you reach an agreement with  the PLO you will be able to implement it before 13 April?    [Peres] It all depends on when we start negotiations because  if we want to know when they will end, we need to know when they  will begin. However, it is not far away from that date. At any  rate, the talks will resume tomorrow.</p>

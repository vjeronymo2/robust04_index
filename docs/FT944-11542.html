			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Westminster Scaff in loss Depressed margins and poor trading conditions led Westminster Scaffolding, the construction industry sub-contractor, to continue its losses. The pre-tax loss for the six months to June 30 came out at Pounds 945,000 against Pounds 1.99m for the eight months to June 30 last year. This year's figure included a bad debt of Pounds 353,000. Turnover was down from Pounds 3.56m to Pounds 2.47m. Losses per share came out at 0.3p (3.8p). Although the losses were lower, the results 'should not be regarded as encouraging,' said Mr Michael Pelham, chairman. The group was 'constantly jeopardised by the reluctance of main contractors to abide by agreed terms of payment' and he could see no evidence of any improvement in margins. As a result, the company is scaling down its operations in the UK and expanding in the Gulf.</p>

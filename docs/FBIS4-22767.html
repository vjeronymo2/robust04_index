			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Kholodov: "You Will Feel Like a </F> Civilized Person: Federal Counterintelligence Service Fits Into  Statute"]    [Text] The Statute on the Federal Counterintelligence  Service [FCS], signed by the president on 5 January 1994, has  been protected from outsiders' eyes until now by the "For  Official Use Only" designation. This designation is not part of  the law on state secrets, but continues to perform its service  in some agencies along with the "Not For Publication" stamp.  Therefore we learn what kind of special service taxpayers are  financing almost four months later, when the absurd designation  is removed from the statute and the FCS' organizational  development is already complete.    This is how "imperceptibly" Russia took its first step down  the path to creating a civilized special service. We also have  to name the project's authors. Most likely we should count as  such former FCS Director Nikolay Golushko, Security Council  Secretary Oleg Lobov, Sergey Stepashin, and Yuriy Baturin,  although the latter joined the "process" at a later stage. And  it will be Sergey Stepashin, FCS current director, who will have  to prove that the mechanisms offered by him, first, will work,  and second, are civilized.    In the uncivilized category in the former organs was the  ability to conduct political surveillance. On the other hand,  over the past few months the MB [Ministry of Security] was  constantly being accused of reluctance to take on radical groups  and inability to keep the president and society informed in a  timely manner on the political situation in the country. Such  criticisms were heard after 1 May 1993, when an OMON [Special  Designation Militia Detachment] soldier was killed, and after  the events of 3-4 October, at which Barkashov commandos  appeared. The authors of the statute defined this sphere of FCS  activities very delicately as "suppression of illegally created  or banned public associations encroaching on the constitutional  system of the Russian Federation." Also, they included it in the  same point as "combating terrorism, illegal arms distribution  and drug trafficking, and illegal armed formations," which  indirectly indicates the administration to which the transformed  functions of the former Fifth--ideological--Directorate for  Protection of Constitutional System will be transferred. In  addition, according to the statute, among FCS tasks now are:    --counteracting foreign special services;    --obtaining information on threats to the Russian Federation  security;    --providing this information to the president;    --protecting state secrets;    --counterintelligence support for state borders.    The FCS staff is set at 75,000 persons, although Stepashin  himself considers this figure inadequate; the statute gives him  the right to submit to the president a proposal to increase it.    According to the statute these thousands of  counterintelligence officers are divided into military  counterintelligence organs in the armed services, and  territorial organs. Also, their independence from local bodies  of authority is emphasized. There is also a separate point that  emphasizes FCS independence from the legislative branch: Point  3--"The FCS is subordinated directly to the president of the  Russian Federation." There is not a word in the statute about  the parliament. One can easily foresee great arguments in the  future around this point. Quite possibly this summer the State  Duma will be adopting the law on the FCS, similar to the law on  foreign intelligence, already in effect since 11 August 1992. In  the new draft law the deputies will probably attempt to move  away from such a categorical wording, at least closer to the one  written in the law on the FIS [Foreign Intelligence Service]:  "The general leadership of foreign intelligence organs is  carried out by the Russian Federation president."    In addition to general provisions, tasks, and functions, the  statute sets forth the special service's administrative organs.  It is "headed by the director, appointed to the job and relieved  from the job by the Russian Federation president." The director,  his deputies, as well as several other high-ranking officials  comprise the FCS collegium, which "considers and makes decisions  by simple vote on the most important issues. The director,  however, has power of veto."    The productivity (that is, what kind, how much, and the  quality of information the president will receive) of the new  special service is limited by the financial abilities of the  state. At a press conference on Friday Sergey Stepashin for the  first time announced approximate figures for his service's  budget. "All in all" it is envisaged to appropriate for the FCS  "about 700-800 billion--up to 1 trillion rubles [R]." One would  salute such openness on the part of the director if he also told  us how long this money is supposed to last. If this is the  annual budget, one can only sympathize with FCS staff: There  will be only about R100,000 a month per each of them.    One should not judge the statute's authors harshly. First,  because they had only two weeks--which included New Year  celebrations--to draft it. And second, nobody in Russia so far  had any knowledge as to how a civilized special service is  supposed to function.    Therefore, the best thing to do is not rely on the statute's  dry provisions but count on time, willy-nilly, making a real  special service out of the former organs.</p>

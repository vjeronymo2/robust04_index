			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Defense Council met yesterday under the  chairmanship of brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of  the Armed Forces. The Council discussed several issues and  national developments on the political, military, security, and  economic levels and adopted the appropriate decisions.    The National Defense Council reiterated that the Republic of  Yemen is committed to UN Security Council Resolution 924 and is  responsive to all the good efforts seeking an entrenchment of  the cease-fire which the rebels who broke away from legitimacy  violated every time with the aim of internationalizing the  Yemeni crisis.    The Council stressed that the authorities in the Republic of  Yemen and all units of the Yemeni Armed Forces--forces of unity  and constitutional legitimacy--are very eager to safeguard and  spare the blood of civilians in the suburbs of brave Aden and in  all Yemeni cities and governorates because this is part of their  national responsibility.    In response to the call made by UN Secretary General Dr.  Butrus-Ghali yesterday; in order to give the rebels a new chance  to stop fighting and end their rebellion; and in response to all  good efforts by the brothers and friends to cease fire and solve  the Yemeni problem through peaceful dialogue within the  framework of the Republic of Yemen by maintaining unity and  respecting the constitutional legitimacy; the National Defense  Council announced a new initiative to entrench the cease-fire as  of 2400 yesterday, Saturday [2100 GMT on 25 June]. The U.S. and  French military attaches in the Republic of Yemen will directly  supervise the cease-fire until the other members of the joint  military committee arrive. This initiative is a proof of  credibility and a confirmation of the extent of the Republic of  Yemen's desire to abide by UN Security Council Resolution 924 in  letter and spirit.</p>

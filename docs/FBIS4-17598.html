			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Karpov report under the "Bosnia" rubric: "Chances </F> of Peaceful Settlement Are There. Success Is Expected if  Movement Toward Settlement Proceeds in Two Parallel Courses"]    [Excerpts] The NATO ultimatum seems to have once again  demonstrated its effectiveness as a peacekeeping tool.  Yesterday, the Bosnian Serbs continued the pullout of heavy  arms from Gorazde. Although Russian Federation Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev remarked yesterday that these actions were at  least one week late, one still should not underestimate the  importance of this fact. [passage omitted]    In regard to Vitaliy Churkin's words heard in the Sunday  television program "Itogi," Kozyrev said that the constant  rotation of Russian ambassadors is a style normal for the  Foreign Ministry's work, but Churkin has yet to work on settling  the Yugoslav crisis.    The threat of new NATO strikes against Bosnian Serb  positions  still remains. At the same time, the current diplomatic  activity by the world community leaders opens ways for the  resumption of the interrupted negotiating process.</p>

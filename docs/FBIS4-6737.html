			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ha Chun-u: "Beginning of Military Diplomacy"] </F>   [Text] Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae's overseas visit is  the first official trip of military diplomacy since the revision  of the national defense goal of adopting a comprehensive concept  of security on neighboring countries.    Among the three countries which Defense Minister Yi will  visit, two countries--Japan and Russia--have direct influence on  the security situation in the Northeast Asian region. This is  relevant to President Kim Yong-sam's order that was made early  this year to strengthen military exchanges with neighboring  countries.    In particular, this is the first time for an ROK defense  minister to visit Japan. The upcoming visit to Japan has  significance in that it will be an opportunity to carry out  military exchanges that were restricted by past relations  between the two countries. Currently, the only form of military  exchange between the ROK and Japan is the exchange student  program for one or two officers of each's military schools to  study in the other's country.    In the past, through military agreement with the United  States, the ROK and Japan have maintained peace in the Northeast  Asian region. Even though the two countries recognized each  other's military importance because they are close  geographically, in reality, military exchange between the two  countries was very limited.    It was learned that Japan has assumed a more active attitude  in carrying out military exchange with the ROK. On several  occasions in the past, Japan had promoted mutual visits of the  ROK defense minister and Japan's director general of the defense  agency. However, our government had not accepted it in  consideration of the people's sentiment toward Japan.    While in Japan, Defense Minister Yi will discuss ways to  enhance military exchanges with Japan. Concrete agreement is  expected to be reached on enhancing exchanges in military  education to the level of the National Defense College and to  increasing the exchange of maritime training students aboard  naval vessels.    The ROK and Japan have kept up consultations on preventing  mid-air collisions of military planes. It is expected that with  Defense Minister Yi's visit to Japan, the two countries will  cooperate on the level of promising exchange in the form of a  letter.    It seems that Defense Minister Yi's visit to Germany will be  an opportunity to introduce advanced German military technology  with a letter of intent. Until now, Germany has been passive in  military technology cooperation due to North Korea. However, it  has changed its attitude since 1992. It was learned that the  Defense Ministry is especially interested in introducing German  aviation technology.    In the final leg of his visit to three countries, Defense  Minister Yi will visit Russia to revise the 1993 memorandum of  understanding on military exchange which was concluded in late  1992 to the 1994 and 1995 memorandum of understanding. Its  level will be somewhat enhanced also with the addition of  clauses on the exchange of visits by high-ranking military  officials, mutual inspection of military installations, and  exchange of students.    Russia is expected to once again offer to repay its economic  cooperation loan with weapons exports, but since the government  has not come up with a policy on this matter, it seems that it  will be difficult for Defense Minister Yi to reveal whether it  will import weapons from Russia.    Through military exchanges with neighboring countries  including Japan, China, and Russia, the Defense Ministry's  strategy is to set up a plan for security on the Korean  peninsula after reunification is achieved. Defense Minister  Yi's upcoming overseas trip will be an opportunity to broaden  the depth of understanding on the security situation with the  defense ministry officials of these countries.</p>

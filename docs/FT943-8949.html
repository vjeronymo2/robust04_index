			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Clinton fights to rescue crime bill: Fate of reform agenda hangs on crucial legislation winning approval US president Bill Clinton fought back yesterday to rescue his crime bill, a key component of his domestic agenda that was blocked by the House of Representatives last week in the most shattering defeat of his 18-month-old presidency. White House officials believe they can salvage victory from defeat by launching a concerted attack on opponents of the measure, which is generally popular. Mr Clinton has signalled how much rides on the fate of the crime bill by focusing on the issue almost exclusively since the vote last Thursday. The fate of the crime bill and the president's healthcare reform programme is widely seen as a defining test of whether Mr Clinton's agenda for domestic reform can survive. It would not be the first time that the Clinton team has recovered quickly from apparent defeats. The president pulled off narrow victories on issues such as the budget and the North American Free Trade Agreement after last-minute campaigns of personal lobbying. However, some administration officials are worried that they are having to switch all their resources to pass the crime bill at a moment when Mr Clinton's biggest objective, healthcare reform, is stalled in both the Senate and the House. At the same time, Mr Clinton continues to be hamstrung by the scandals and distractions that have dogged his administration. Mr Roger Altman, the deputy Treasury secretary, was reported at the weekend to be likely to step down in the next fortnight after failing to convince senators that he had not misled them in his testimony on Whitewater. 'It has been discussed, and the fundamental question is whether he can re-establish the Senate's confidence,' Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said yesterday. With rare single-mindedness, Mr Clinton has spoken about nothing but crime since Thursday's procedural vote in the House which blocked the bill. After calling a press conference immediately after the vote, Mr Clinton then hastily arranged to address the National Association of Police Organisations in Minneapolis on Friday and on Saturday devoted his weekly radio address to crime. Yesterday, he went to a Maryland church to sustain the barrage with another speech on the same subject. Some Democrats believe they have already wrong-footed the Republicans, who urged the president to strip out the bill's ban on assault guns and put it to a separate vote. Republicans originally claimed they had voted to block the bill only because it had too many social programmes which Mr Clinton has advocated 'to give kids something to say yes to'. Stripping out the ban on assault guns in order to rescue the bill is unacceptable, senior Democrats insist. While in many parts of the US voters want their members of Congress to vote against any form of gun control, a ban that does not inconvenience hunters continues to command widespread popular support, even among gun owners. If the White House can turn the debate into a straightforward vote on gun control, it stands a good chance of getting past last week's procedural block and bringing the measure to a final vote it is confident of winning. 'If this bill comes to a vote it's going to pass. Everyone knows that,' Mr Panetta said. What worries Mr Clinton's supporters is whether the push on the crime bill can be turned into a sustained improvement in the discipline and focus of the administration - the sort of improvement that Mr Panetta's appointment last month was intended to bring about.</p>

On October 26, 1993, the Federal-State Alaska Joint Board (Board) adopted the Final Recommended Decision in CC Docket 83&hyph;1376. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The Final Recommended Decision presents a carefully integrated plan to meet the five objectives that it recommends should govern interstate telecommunications services between Alaska and the contiguous states (``Lower 48'') and between Alaska and Hawaii. We hereby adopt these five objectives and agree with the Joint Board that, based on the record, the Final Recommended Decision best achieves these five objectives: preservation of universal service; continuation of rate integration; <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  maintenance of revenue requirement neutrality; <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  allowance of market-based competitive entry; and encouragement of increased efficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Alaska Joint Board Final Recommended Decision, FCC 93J&hyph;2 (released October 29, 1993) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Final Recommended Decision <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ) 58 FR 63345, December 1, 1993.

We also conclude that implementation of the new market structure recommended by the Board will increase competition and will further economic growth in Alaska by lowering prices and stimulating demand for telecommunications services. Economic growth will be enhanced because the new market structure will stimulate, through lower prices, and facilitate, through new services, transactions between consumers and businesses in the state of Alaska and the rest of the nation. Increased competition should also encourage additional investment in the Alaska telecommunications infrastructure. Under this new market structure, we conclude that businesses and consumers can enjoy these benefits at the same time we preserve universal service, revenue requirement neutrality, and rate integration. In this order we thus adopt, with clarifications and minor modifications, the recommendations of the Board and establish implementation requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of the Final Recommended Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. In the Final Recommended Decision, the Board concluded that the Joint Services Arrangement (JSA) should be terminated, subject to the adoption and implementation of suitable transition mechanisms. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Under the recommended market structure, the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. (AT&amp;T) would provide MTS services between Alaska and the Lower 48 (northbound and southbound), and between Alaska and Hawaii, at integrated rates and under the terms and conditions applicable to AT&amp;T's provision of services in the Lower 48. After the JSA terminates, Alascom, Inc. (Alascom) could offer interstate MTS independently from AT&amp;T under its own tariff and with no obligation to charge AT&amp;T's integrated rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Final Recommended Decision, FCC 93J&hyph;2 at paras. 2&hyph;10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Under the Final Recommended Decision, Alascom would provide interexchange carriers (IXCs) common carrier services under tariff offered on a non-discriminatory basis at rates that reflect the costs of services. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Alascom's tariff would have separate rate schedules for locations subject to facilities competition (non-Bush) and for locations where Alascom has a facilities monopoly (Bush). The costs of service in each of these categories would be defined pursuant to a cost allocation plan developed by Alascom and approved by the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Alascom common carrier services are all interstate interexchange transport and switching services that are necessary for other interexchange carriers to provide services in Alaska up to the point of interconnection with each Alaska local exchange carrier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. The Final Recommended Decision also contemplates that Alascom would continue to provide interstate private line service upon reasonable request under its existing federal tariffing and Section 214 obligations. If AT&amp;T provides interstate private line service to or from Alaska, it would be required to do so under the same rate structures, terms, and conditions that apply to its provision of private line services between other states. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Board recommended a four-year transition period, beginning March 1, 1994. During the transition, AT&amp;T would be required to purchase certain services from Alascom to meet its MTS obligations. There would be two phases to the transition period, with the first phase beginning on March 1, 1994, and the second phase beginning on September 1, 1995. During the first phase, AT&amp;T would continue to obtain services from Alascom under the JSA for one and one-half years. On September 1, 1995, the JSA would terminate and Alascom's common carrier services would be offered to carrier customers under tariff. During the second phase of the transition period, lasting two and one-half years, AT&amp;T would be required to purchase a fixed amount of common carrier service from Alascom, defined as a percentage of a baseline revenue level. This obligation would decline to zero at the end of the second phase. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Facundo Landivar: "Shared Slates: In Politics </F> Two Plus Two Is Not Always Four"]    [Text] Two plus two is seldom four, except in mathematics.  And this sum is relevant in pre-constituent Argentina, in view  of the kind of arrangement that has appeared during recent weeks  in the country's political arena: the formation of shared slates  between the Radical and Justicialist Parties for the Constituent  Assembly.    A recent poll taken by the Javier Otaegui &amp; Associates  law  office in the Federal Capital has again shed doubt on that  mathematical axiom. It shows results indicating that the  country's two leading parties are very far removed from  automatically pooling their votes if they should run on a shared  slate.    The poll (in which 1,181 persons were queried by phone) was  taken last Tuesday in two parts. In the first, those polled  responded concerning their voting intentions in the 10 April  elections if the Radical Party and the PJ appear with separate  slates.    Based on that hypothesis, 20.9 percent claimed that they  would vote for the UCR; 19.4 percent for the PJ (the two parties  add up to 40.3 percent); 8.5 percent for the Great Front; 7.3  percent for the Socialists; and 2.9 percent for Modin. A total  of 21.4 percent claimed that they would not vote for any party,  and 16.4 percent appeared undecided.  <H5>  Everything Changes </H5>   Nevertheless, the situation changed substantially when they  were asked about voting intentions in the event that the PJ and  UCR formed an alliance: virtually the rest of the opposition  spectrum, basically, the Great Front and Modin, doubled their  votes. On the other hand, the two majority parties "only"  totaled 28.6 percent.    Result? PJ-UCR Alliance: 28.6 percent; Great Front: 15.5  percent; and Modin: 6.4 percent.    Conclusion: Although two plus two is 40.3 percent, if the  term "shared slate" is added to the equation, the result is  appreciably smaller. According to the poll, this is a reality in  the Federal Capital that could spread to other jurisdictions in  which the bipartisan system is not predominant either.    And, although the law office that took the poll might be  considered unreliable by some, particularly after its  well-remembered blunder in the elections held on 3 October of  last year in Buenos Aires Province, its conclusion is the same  as that of prominent PJ sources, such as Eduardo Duhalde.    Last week, the Buenos Aires governor was sufficiently clear  about precluding the possibility that a shared slate could be  formed in his district: "The only thing that it will do is  foster the chances of third political forces."  <H5>  Others Opposed </H5>   With the same forcefulness as Duhalde's, but opting for an  "off the record" comment, a top-ranking member of the Menemist  team assured LA NACION that such pacts "are absurd." He  predicted: "You'll see the parties at the extremes gain  considerably in votes if that notion succeeds."    Added to the list of "nonbelievers" in the virtues of the  alliance is the minister of economy, Domingo Cavallo, who, in an  article published today (see third section), claims that, if  there were no shared slate, he would have agreed to be a  candidate for the Constituent Assembly in Cordoba.    Of course, the results possibly accrued from such an  agreement depend on each district: Where the bipartisan system  is a constant, the possibility of a flight of votes to third  forces is far slighter, as the analysts agree.    Cordoba, Catamarca, Rio Negro, and Corrientes are some of  the  districts in which there is talk of a PJ-UCR alliance. If such  an arrangement should materialize, it is also certain to make a  substantial change in the political game that has predominated  in Argentina thus far. However, it no longer depends on  mathematics.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky </F> and FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic in Belgrade on 27  January; recorded -- Jeszenszky speaks in English with  superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation]    [Text] [Jeszenszky] What language shall I use? English?  Unfortunately I do not speak Serbo-Croatian. Thank you very  much. However, this is not enough. Well, I had a one-hour  conversation with President Milosevic and I was glad that Mr.  [Andros] Agoston, chairman of the Democratic Community of  Vojvodina Hungarians, attended this conversation on the Serbian  side. We discussed both bilateral issues and economic ones --  how we can work on the resumption of economic relations between  the two countries, how we should work, and what kind of plans we  should establish. We should obviously admit that the basic  problem is economic life, and this is largely as a result of  sanctions. I have listened very carefully to the president's  stands and opinions, as well as Minister Jovanovic's on how a  solution for Bosnia can be found. It is really not for me to  say whether conditions offered for peace are sufficient, but I  hope that on the basis of the proposals of the European Union,  the so-called Juppe-Kinkel proposals, it will be possible to  bring this conflict to an end. I can see that there is a  readiness on the Serbian side to adopt these proposals and  recommendations.    With Mr. President I also discussed the question of the  so-called Krajinas, regions that are close to Hungary, such as  the Baranja region. We have a large number of refugees from  Baranja who were forced to flee. I also expressed hope that a  serious facility such as an oil pipeline should be opened. This  is very important for Hungary, but also for Yugoslavia. I think  that the present situation is such that the relations between  Serbia and Croatia are promising and that this will perhaps  enable all of us to enjoy the fruits of this facility which was  in fact a joint investment of the whole of Yugoslavia and  Hungary.    I also think that it is important not only for your and my  country, but also for Europe that these hostilities end and, as  I said in an earlier interview, Hungary will be very happy to  support the lifting of sanctions, but this can only happen when  it receives international approval.    [Jovanovic] It has turned out that with the end of the  Yugoslav crisis coming nearer, prospects are opening for the  strengthening of our relations with neighboring countries. The  arrival of Mr. Jeszenszky here is also the first swallow, the  harbinger announcing that the end of the crisis is coming closer  and that the time for beginning the normalization of relations  with neighboring and other countries is coming. We also had  this in mind when we examined the prospects of development of  bilateral relations. We also touched upon the conclusion of  projects linked with the Belgrade-Budapest-Vienna railroad and  highway. We also pointed to the geographic-strategic importance  that the two countries have, being on the road connecting Europe  and Asia. The interest number one in order that peace returns  to Bosnia-Herzegovina immediately and that negative developments  are prevented is for all countries to advocate immediate  suspension or lifting of sanctions. This is the shortest and  easiest cure for the belligerent policy that the Muslim  leadership in Sarajevo persistently carries out at the  persuasion of forces from outside who see their interests in  continuing the crisis and continuing the war.</p>

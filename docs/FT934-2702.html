			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Deadlock broken over R&amp;D spending EU leaders have managed to break the deadlock over financing the Union's research and development budget for the next five years. They agreed that the total budget for the EU's fourth 'framework programme' of research and development, which runs from 1994 to 1998, should be 'not less than Ecu12bn (Pounds 9.14bn), to which might be added a reserve of Ecu1bn (Pounds 760m), to be released at a later date'. That appears to represent a small victory for the European Commission, which had proposed an R&amp;D budget of Ecu13.1bn for the five-year programme. That plan was supported in meetings of research ministers by nine member states. But at last Monday's research council, the Union's biggest paymasters, France, Germany and Britain, held out for a lower figure - said to be around Ecu11bn - and the issue had to be passed to the summit. The leaders acknowledged that the research programme would be an important element in support of the general growth plans agreed on Saturday. In their communique they said 'the implementation of an ambitious, well-targeted research programme constitutes a significant contribution to efforts towards recovery, particularly in areas such as information technology'. If the Ecu12bn budget is approved by the European parliament, some Ecu10.5bn will be spent on the R&amp;D projects themselves, and the rest on training, international co-operation and dissemination of results. Research ministers have already agreed that 28.2 per cent of the Ecu10.5bn should go to fund information technology and communications research, 18.15 per cent towards non-nuclear energy projects, 16 per cent to industrial technologies, 13.1 per cent to life sciences, such as biotechnology, and 9 per cent to environmental projects. Even at a reduced figure of Ecu12bn, the fourth framework programme is, in absolute terms, the largest ever undertaken by the EU. But Commission officials point out that it cannot be compared directly with the 1990-94 programme (worth Ecu6.6bn) because of inflation and changes in its composition.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Arts: Forty years of memories - Radio HOW TO mark the 40th anniversary of the Queen's coronation on radio but by reminders of the day itself? Only Radio 2 did so wholeheartedly, first recalling the events of the day (including the ascent of Everest), then with music as played in Westminster Abbey precisely 40 years before. This was followed by presenter Raymond Baxter (can it be his 40th anniversary too?) remembering some events of 1953. Radio 3, who gave a lovely concert of madrigals commissioned for the occasion, must have regretted that the coronation had not been in 1968, which they are still celebrating. Anniversaries being in tune, on Sunday Radio 3 began its observance of Christopher Marlowe's death 400 years ago with two of his shorter plays. Dido, Queen of Carthage, perhaps written with Nashe, uses the same story from the Aeneid as Purcell's opera Dido's love for, and betrayal by, Aeneas. It is thought to be an early play, but uses the poetic skill of the later works. This production, directed by Michael Earley and Alan Drury, was very much cut, not only of lines, but of speeches and whole scenes; and frankly this was not much loss, for the performance was unexciting. Aeneas (Timothy Walker), hailing the Carthaginian citizens on his first landing, might have been asking the way to the library. Sally Dexter's Dido was short of emotion too, and could not move me even with such lines as 'I'll frame me wings of wax, like Icarus/And o'er his ships will soar into the sun/That they may melt, and I fall in his arms.' It sounded too much like a first reading. Josephine Veasey in Purcell's 'When I am laid in earth', played afterwards, gave the true feeling. The Massacre at Paris deals not only with the butchery of the Huguenots on St. Bartholomew's Day (off-stage) but with sundry murders contrived by the Duke of Guise in his campaign against the Protestants and hope for the French crown. (He even put down the French King's professor of logic for having argued against Aristotle's Organon, but this scene was cut.) The Radio Times called the play 'savagely comic', and indeed the succession of assorted deaths is somewhat extravagant; but there is much of Marlowe's dazzling verse, and Jeremy Blake spoke Guise's splendid lines admirably. The company, that must take 34 parts besides 'Protestants, soldiers, murderers, etc.' was mostly the same as in Dido, but the playing was a good deal better. The same directors were in charge, but the Radio Times has - significantly? - reversed their names. To hear these two plays at all was a joy; but we must do better next week with Edward II. Radio 3 gave enjoyable readings of Graham Greene's short travel pieces, and Radio 4 had Dirk Bogarde himself reading extracts from the memories of his childhood in Great Meadow. Addicts can buy a Radio Collection cassette of the entire set, but I have to say that the kind of youth recalled will appeal mainly to older listeners. I would like his recollections as a wartime staff officer - I had his job later when he had moved on. But that is for the oldies too, I suppose. Generally it is Radio 1 FM leading the social-improvement campaigns, but for Do It] this week, designed to stir the nation's volunteers into helpful action, they just boosted the free information line (0800-500-800 from 9am to 7pm). More detail on Radio 2 and Radio 5, encouraging listeners to deliver meals, rattle charity-cans, aid the blind, rescue lost cavers, what you will - and some of the recorded recipients sounded less than grateful; but the help-line is what really matters.</p>

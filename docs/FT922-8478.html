			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: JC Penney surges to Dollars 136m JC PENNEY, the big Dallas-based retailer, yesterday reported a sharp upturn in profits during the first three months of the 1992 financial year. However, its performance contrasted with that of The Limited, a once high-flying specialist retailer, whose profits and earnings per share were flat during the same period. JC Penney announced it made Dollars 136m after tax in the three months to April 25, compared with Dollars 80m a year earlier (excluding the effect of an accounting change). Its retail sales during the period increased from Dollars 3.43bn to Dollars 3.79bn - a rise of 10.5 per cent. Penney said unit sales had accelerated 'significantly' in four merchandise divisions. However, it also acknowledged that gross margins slipped slightly. Mr William Howell, chairman, said a turnround in the US economy, 'coupled with the more recent uptick in consumer confidence, bodes well for retailing generally'. At The Limited, however, it was long faces and news of after-tax profits only marginally higher at Dollars 51.5m, against Dollars 50.9m, in the 13 weeks to May 2. Moreover, the figure includes a Dollars 9m pre-tax gain as a result of the flotation of United Retail Group, the 'large size' specialty women's wear retailer in which The Limited holds a 20 per cent stake. Sales increased by 10.2 per cent, to Dollars 1.42bn, and The Limited said its Victoria's Secret stores had enjoyed a record first quarter. Mr Leslie Wexner, chairman, said he was disappointed by the performance. 'In addition to the external factors of sluggish mall traffic, a difficult economic environment and unseasonably cold weather, we also created some of our own merchandising problems,' he said.</p>

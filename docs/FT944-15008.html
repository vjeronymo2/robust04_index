			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Re-engineering the Treasury The long-standing objective of the UK Treasury has been the achievement of sustained growth and higher living standards. The manifest shortfall of Treasury performance against objective in the postwar period makes an unanswerable case for radical reform of the institutional structure of Whitehall's most powerful department. The results of the fundamental expenditure review announced yesterday by Treasury permanent secretary Sir Terry Burns are, at least by British standards, genuinely radical. But so were the Treasury policies that culminated in sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. How are we to judge these sweeping reforms? The striking feature of the UK Treasury is the sheer breadth of its remit. Unlike the US, France and Germany, it still retains ultimate control over monetary policy. Unlike the French finance ministry it is the chief source of economic advice in government and does not leave control of public expenditure to a separate ministry. Its role is central. To that extent the current review proposes a wider reform of governmental machinery than appears at first sight. No doubt a New Zealand administration would have taken a more vigorous axe to the various parts of this highly centralised machine. Yet the current review could hardly be called soft, since it seeks both to decentralise much of the Treasury's second-guessing role, while dismissing a quarter of the department's top civil servants. In so far as objectives are being clarified and senior civil servants are given a less cluttered strategic role, this is all to the good. Yet there must be some unease at the proposals to push part of the task of controlling expenditure back on to the spending departments. There is, admittedly, some merit in devolving responsibility for public sector pay, in that a Treasury pay policy driven by public expenditure concerns makes for poor staff management and leads to results that can be remote from labour market reality. In their wider monitoring role Treasury officials' concerns are all too often with short-term objectives. The absence of a public accounting discipline that provides protection for capital projects as against current expenditure notoriously exaggerates that fault. The control of public expenditure is, nonetheless, one of the tasks that the Treasury has done well by international standards, at least since the second half of the 1970s, when a catastrophic failure of control led to the arrival of the International Monetary Fund. And while the Treasury is often accused of being remote, it does have the advantage of independence in dealing with the departmental clash of vested interests. All history suggests that any relaxation over public spending has a nasty way of ending up in tears. Those who have watched the Treasury's performance with increasing disillusionment over the years might feel that it is proposing to loosen its grip in an area where it has done rather well in order to devote more resources to policy activities where its record has been dismal. A more fundamental worry is that job insecurity at the top of Whitehall will dramatically transform the notion of an independent civil service. Criticism of the Treasury can be overdone. But in view of the record, a reform of the Treasury driven from within is bound to raise more than the odd doubt.</p>

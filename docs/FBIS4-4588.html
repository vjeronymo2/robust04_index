			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Thada Mahapaoraya] </F>   [Text] Thailand and the United States will hold talks  tomorrow and Wednesday in Washington on an aviation agreement to  replace one terminated by the Thai Transport and Communications  Ministry four years ago.    The Thai delegation will be led by Transport and  Communications permanent secretary Mahidon Chanthrangkun. Other  members will include Civil Aviation Department director-general  Dr Sisuk Chanthrangsu, Thai Airways International [THAI]  president Thamnun Wangli, and Somnuk Hanphanit, THAI's  vice-president for international relations.    The US side will be headed by Carl Candiff, the State  Department's head of special negotiations for transport affairs.  The team includes representatives from the Department of  Transportation and members of national air carriers, a source in  the Thai Transport and Communications Ministry said.    The Thai team will be listening closely to US proposals on  implementing a new agreement the source said.    THAI believes that an open-skies policy would hurt Thailand,  the source said.    "US carriers are anxious for the agreement since their  flights to Thailand outnumber the flights THAI operates to the  US."    THAI flies four times a week to Los Angeles and has no plan  to increase flights until at least the end of 1994.    US airlines -- Northwest, United, Delta and Flying Tiger (a  cargo carrier) -- operate 28 flights a week to Bangkok.    American Airlines also wants to enter the Southeast Asia  market.    "Now they are flying under a seasonal agreement approved by  the Thai Transport and Communications Ministry," said the  source. "Under this agreement the US feels insecure, since they  cannot make long-term plans and flight numbers will be frozen at  28 per week which is insufficient to accommodate the growing  numbers of passengers and cargo."    The source said this week's negotiations would be confined  to  broad principles.</p>

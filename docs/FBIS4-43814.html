			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dominic Johnson: "Accomplice With a Bad </F> Conscience"]    [Text] The time has come for punitive expeditions. If a  French military intervention really takes place in Rwanda in the  next few days, France will return to its African "backyard" with  a stir.    Such an intervention, no matter how humanitarian French  politicians may present it, is regarded as taking sides in  Rwanda -- taking the wrong side. Admittedly, French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe, the driving force behind an intervention,  does not completely share the blind loyalty to [deceased Rwandan  President Juvenal] Habyarimana with large parts of the French  establishment, and he calls the events in Rwanda "genocide,"  expressly meaning the activities of the government troops by  this. "Those who have committed, promoted, or covered up  massacres" shall be excluded from the necessary national  reconciliation process in Rwanda. Nevertheless, Juppe cannot  ignore certain facts: The French have supported Juvenal  Habyarimana's regime -- whose murder triggered the new round of  civil war -- for decades. It was the French who established,  equipped, and trained the Rwandan Army after civil war broke out  in 1990. Certain Frenchmen seem to have stayed in the country  after UN troops were stationed there in the autumn of 1993,  training the militarily organized opponents of a peace between  the government and the guerrilla forces in militias and thus  paving the way for a new war. No matter what Juppe says, if  armed Frenchmen go back to Rwanda, the mass murderers in the  militias loyal to the government will cheer them, and the  guerrillas, who are also fighting a war, but who do not  deliberately kill civilians, will fight against them.    What is the purpose of such an intervention? The latest  statements from Paris say that the French are to stay until the  UN blue helmets have arrived. But why then does France not  simply help the UN go to Rwanda quickly? The fact that various  African states want to join the French mission adds to the  confusion. Will we soon have "French" Senegalese and UN  Senegalese drive around Rwanda trying to fulfill the same  "humanitarian" mission? Either France really wants to fulfill a  humanitarian mission -- in the current situation this must  primarily mean taking victims away from the militias in Kigali,  which would double the UN mission -- or France wants to achieve  something else. But this would immediately give rise to  accusations, and maybe the fact, of siding with murderers.    The central problem is: For France, Africa is a big parade  ground. Where can France play superpower if not in Africa,  where certain Parisian circles can do a lot of damage with  little effort? On the other hand: How severe can the damage be  without doing irreparable harm to the superpower's prestige?  Rwanda is an excellent stage for gaining new importance through  cheap effects. Comparisons of the planned French action with the  landing of the U.S. Marines on the Somali coast in December 1992  are quite interesting. Back then, the Marines did not achieve  any results, but all of a sudden the United States had a  glorious new Africa policy -- if only for a short time. Perhaps  the French intervention in Rwanda will lead to the French shadow  diplomacy, which has been a major promoter of the war, having to  step down in favor of a commitment that is more suitable.  Juppe's attempt, which is more cautious than President  Mitterrand's talk of "a matter of hours," and has been agreed  upon with the UN, shows first signs of a bad conscience for the  murderous consequences of the French policy conducted so far. A  France that no longer wants to be an accomplice and therefore  intervenes against itself? This would be the only slightly  favorable interpretation of events that must be found simply  catastrophic otherwise.</p>

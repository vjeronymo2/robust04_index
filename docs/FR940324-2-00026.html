Northwest states that the proposed facilities would be used to provide approximately 11,000 million Btu per day of firm transportation service to the planned Klickitat Energy Partners (KEP), cogeneration facility. Northwest states that the looping and other facility modification are required because the capacity of the existing Hood River Lateral is fully committed to deliver up to 5,909 million Btu per day at two existing meter stations for the account of Northwest Natural Gas Company under existing blanket agreements. It is indicated that KEP was formed to develop, finance, construct and own the new KEP cogeneration facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is indicated that KEP's planned cogeneration plant would have 53.5 megawatts of generating capacity and would consist of a natural gas-fired combustion turbine, a heat recovery steam generator and three steam turbines. It is also stated that KEP has contracted to sell up to 49.5 average megawatts of power generated at its facility to the Bonneville Power Administration under a 20-year contract and that process steam would be sold to a lumber company located at the proposed plant site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Northwest states that DA has agreed with KEP to secure firm transportation service from Northwest to the plant site beginning when the plant commences operations, scheduled for August 1995 and for plant start-up prior to that time.

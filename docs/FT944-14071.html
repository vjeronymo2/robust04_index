			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bad name Sir, I have read with interest all your articles on re-engineering and was struck particularly by Christopher Lorenz's observation ('Putting re-engineering in perspective', October 21) that re-engineering may be 'getting a bad name'. I wonder, rather, whether it is a bad name? Chris Cossey, London SE11 4LD</p>

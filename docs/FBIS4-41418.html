			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Batuyev under the "Problem" rubric: </F> "`Outcasts' Wait for Somebody To Take Care of Them. Delay  Fraught With Danger"]    [Text] Russia never had nuclear submarines in the Black or  Baltic Seas. So after the Soviet Union broke up none of them  was inherited by the former Union republics. Over the next few  years Russia alone will have to recycle more than 200 of these  craft containing a considerable quantity of radioactive waste.  This is required by both START-II and the fact that the service  life of the submarines, many of which are still afloat, has come  to an end. But it turns out that at present Russia still cannot  comply with START-II promptly, in an environmentally clean  fashion, and at the same time to its economic advantage: There  is no appropriate technology that can be universally applied.  There are programs and government decrees, but extremely poor  financing hinders their implementation. The recycling of  submarines is a loss-making process. In addition, the Navy --  the latest owner of the equipment, although technically it is  owned by the State Committee for the Management of State  Property -- does not keep track of the degree to which all  required parts of the equipment are present. It is received for  recycling without parts and circuits containing nonferrous and  precious metals, such as gold, silver, and copper.... In  addition, the recycling has to be done by the so-called  "roundabout" method: After a submarine is placed on the stocks,  the reactor compartment is cut off, but associated redundant  compartments are retained. The reactor compartment is then  sealed and thrown into the water. Hence the term "outcast."  They will remain in the water until the Defense Ministry builds  long-promised storage facilities for them. The Defense  Ministry, in turn, is waiting for money from the state to do so.    Currently there are around 30 nuclear submarines and  "outcasts" subject to recycling underwater near large cities,  such as Severodvinsk and Bolshoy Kamen, and the village of  Snezhnogorsk. Each of them is kept afloat thanks to municipal  electric power, thus causing economic damage to the state. Once  the power is turned off the "outcasts" will run aground, and the  possible seal failure (after 30 years in service) may cause a  discharge of radioactive waste. Each submarine (of the earlier  types) contains 300-400 cubic meters of radioactive waste  measuring from 100,000 to 1 million curie, whereas the safe  level for discharging such waste into the water stands at 10  curie (to the power of minus 9). The overall quantity of  radioactive waste awaiting recycling has been estimated by  specialists at 2,200 cubic meters in Severodvinsk, 2,000 cubic  meters in Bolshoy Kamen, and 93 cubic meters in Snezhnogorsk.  In the coming years another 200 or so submarines will be  decommissioned in the Navy.</p>

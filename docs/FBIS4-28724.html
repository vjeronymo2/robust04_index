[Passage omitted]-The Secretary-2 said in his address that  cooperative system enables those lacking strength to become  strong economic organization to win a competitive edge in the  market economic system. The country, he said, is practising  market economy. In a market oriented system, he pointed out,  people doing business will certainly encounter such conditions  like insufficient supply of capital, weakness in commodity  production technology, incompetence in the administrative skills  and market instability. All those who are weak must cooperate  and reciprocate one another to remedy the weaknesses, he said.  This is cooperative way, he added.    He noted that the Cooperative Market Festival aims at  securing vast markets for domestic products and strengthening  the existing markets for the products. The cooperative  societies, entrepreneurs and the public are to strive toward  that end, he added.    The Cooperative Market Festival in itself is self-evident,  he  said. It involves trading, collective efforts and entertainment  programmes.    Products of different localities, traditional costumes,  works  of art and traditional dishes will also be available at the  festival thereby promoting and preserving cultural traditions,  the Secretary-2 said.    He said the festival is vital for finding markets for  domestic products, strengthening and expanding the existing ones  and introducing new products in accordance with consumers'  demand.    He said he believes acquiring new markets and producing new  products will contribute toward realizing the Allround  Development year in 1994-95.    The people of Mandalay Division and Mandalay can take pride  for being able to organize the festival welcoming the Allround  Development Year, he said.    The Secretary-2 looked forward to expanding trade as  transactions are to be carried out through contracts at the  festival. Cooperative societies, those engaged in cooperative  undertakings and interested persons of the States and Divisions  are converging on the festival. During their stay at the  festival, they are said to be attending a seminar on upgrading  and improving cooperative activities, he said. The seminar will  concentrate on doing cooperative undertakings actively, boosting  export and producing new items required by the markets, he said.    He underscored that stability is ensured in political,  economic and administrative spheres in the country. The  National Convention has made some progress in laying down  principles to serve as base in drafting the State Constitution.  Altogether 11 armed groups in the jungles have responded to the  government offer, then returned to the legal fold and finally  are implementing the regional development projects together with  the government.    Economically, he said, short-term projects have been laid  down and then implemented from 1992-93 to 1995-96. With the  fulfilment of targets during the first and second years, firm  economic bases have already been established, he said. Foreign  nations are found to have invested more in the country and  efforts are being mad3 with added momentum during the current  fiscal year of 1994-95, the third which is designated as  Allround Development Year. In the process, he said, cooperative  societies are to play an important role. Cooperativie  University and colleges are to be opened soon, he said.  Cooperative undertakings, he said, have already engaged in  agriculture, livestock breeding and fisheries and industries.  They are also doing business in services such as transport,  monetary and health care. In trading too, he said, they are  making preparations to step up domestic and foreign trade. He  urged cooperative societies to try their utmost as they are  deeply involved in allround economic activities.    In conclusion, the Secretary-2 called on the cooperative  societies to try to realize economic objectives of the State for  the establishment of a modern and developed nation and also try  to fulfil the objectives of the Cooperative Market Festival--to  find markets through collective efforts, promote and preserve  cultural traditions, develop commodity production, promote  friendship and cooperation among cooperative societies and  substitute imports.

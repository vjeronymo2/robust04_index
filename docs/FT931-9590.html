			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at Ryanair Ryanair, the independent Irish airline, reported after-tax profits of IPounds 850,000 (Pounds 885,000) for 1992 on turnover of IPounds 50.1m. The outcome marks the second successive year of profitability for the airline since it was set up in May 1986. Ryanair had accumulated losses of IPounds 20m up to 1990. Mr Conor Hayes, chief executive, said the improved performance resulted from the closure of the loss-making regional routes from Ireland to the UK, the disposal of its turboprop aircraft and the introduction of a new competitive fare structure with a 'no-frills' service on its principal Dublin-Stansted route.</p>

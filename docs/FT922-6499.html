			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar continues to strengthen THE DOLLAR continued to strengthen against the D-Mark and other European currencies yesterday as the market saw more evidence that the differential between German and US short-term interest rates is unlikely to widen further, writes James Blitz. Part of the reason for renewed confidence in the US currency was the news that German monetary supply in April had grown more slowly than expected. After last month's poor figure showing a 9.75 per cent rise for March, the April figure for M3 money supply came in at 8.8 per cent, dashing fears that it would be in double figures. That will take pressure off those in the German central bank who were tempted to raise rates again. So, too, will the figure for Germany's March retail sales, which were down 6.4 per cent year-on-year, when many had expected it to be down by far less. Combined with the Federal Reserve's apparent unwillingness to cut rates, the interest rate differential now looks less likely to widen further. As a result, the markets pushed the dollar up to DM1.6240 in early European trading. However, confidence in the dollar wore off later in the day. Some traders speculated that this weekend's preparatory meeting for the July summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations might make a statement that the D-Mark should be stronger. Others are still waiting for better indications of US economic recovery before becoming convinced dollar bulls. As a result, the dollar closed in London at DM1.6185, up nearly half a pfennig on the day. In late American trading, it declined further, down to DM1.6170. The yen also made significant gains against the D-Mark, which was pushed below the important psychological barrier of Y80. Dealers said that the yen had gained from the German currency's downside in D-Mark/dollar trading. 'The dollar was in more demand against the mark than against the yen, and this had the effect of pushing the mark down on the yen cross rate,' one trader said. The D-Mark ended down on the day at Y79.83, compared to a previous close of Y80.80. Sterling also gained against the D-Mark, as the markets clearly ignored the fall in period rates in the sterling cash markets in recent days. Instead, one London-based analyst suggested that dealers were impressed by the British Chancellor's statement earlier this week that he wants to get inflation down to 2 per cent. The pound gained half a pfennig against the D-Mark to close at DM2.9375. But UK economic indicators this week have been mostly mixed, and sterling has never looked likely to push through its central rate of DM2.95.</p>

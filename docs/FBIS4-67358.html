			<p>BFN     [Text] Taipei, April 14 (CNA) -- Acid rain is posing a  greater threat to Taiwan than ever before, according to the  Environmental Protection Administration [EPA].    An EPA official said the north of Taiwan was at greatest  risk, but that the pattern exists around the island.    According to data collected by the EPA from 12 sites around  the island from September [word indistinct] through March 1994,  the rain falling at Wanli, a coastal township about 30 minutes  drive from Taipei, was the most acidic, with an average pH level  of 4.3.    pH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in  water. The range of PH values is from 0 to 14. The pH levels  from 0 to 7 indicate acidity, with 0 being the most acidic, and  pH levels from 7 to 14 indicate alkalinity. A pH level from 6  to 8 is considered safe. The pH levels in rain at all 12 sites  the EPA kept statistics for were all below 6.    The EPA statistics show that rain falling at Wanli and  Panchiao, a suburb of Taipei, [words indistinct] levels of 3.9  in January, while Yangmingshan and Kuanying -- also in the north  -- also had especially acidic rainfall.    The lowest levels of acidity in rain were found in Taihsi in  western Taiwan and Taitung in the southeast. The pH levels  there were 5.6 -- signaling a smaller threat to the environment,  but a threat nonetheless.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 5 (CTK) -- No talks have been held  about a postponement of the parliamentary elections, nor did the  Coalition Council discuss the idea, Christian Democratic  Movement (KDH) Chairman Jan Carnogursky told journalists today.    He was reacting to yesterday's remarks made by ex-Premier  Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the opposition Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), at the HZDS meeting and aimed  against the present government coalition who, according to  Meciar, are allegedly trying to render impossible the coming  early elections to be held in autumn. Carnogursky said other  remarks by Meciar were "embarrassing and laughable."    Meciar said at the meeting that a plot had been hatched by  Carnogursky and the U.S. President to reunite the Czech Republic  and Slovakia.    Carnogursky said the KDH manifesto was to be based on Slovak  independence. Even the figures who publicly opposed the  (January 1, 1993) split and who the KDH would like to see on its  slate, understand that the split is permanent, he added.    "Ex-Premier Meciar should realise that... he has now  included  in his lies the President of the United States," Carnogursky  said, adding that advertising in "one newspaper alone" will cost  the HZDS 2.5 million crowns (72,500 USD). The KDH has been  working on a bill to limit parties' election campaign  expenditures.</p>

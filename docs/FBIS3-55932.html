			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Zaynetdinov report: "Can You Count on a </F> Counterspy? Russian Special Service Leaders Go Public"]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin signed the "Statute on the Russian  Federation Federal Counterintelligence Service" on 5 January.  The new special service did not keep journalists in an agony of  suspense but held a press conference straight after the Orthodox  Christmas holiday.    It was stated at the press conference that Russia's Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FCS] is the legal successor to the  Security Ministry but is in no way "a clone of the disbanded  ministry since it is a...special service" (and what was it,  then, we had before?). The FCS' main mission is to detect,  prevent, or stop intelligence and subversive activity directed  against Russia by foreign special services and organizations; to  combat terrorism, the illegal trade in drugs and weapons, and  illegal armed formations; and to ensure the day-to-day  protection of Russia's state border.    Twenty foreign spies were caught red-handed in Russia last  year. Several state officials recruited by foreign special  services have been dismissed from their posts on the submission  of the former Security Ministry's counterintelligence service.    The reorganization of the Security Ministry and the creation  of the FCS is in full swing: Among other things, the former  Security Ministry's investigation administration has been  transferred to the General Prosecutor's Office and the Lefortovo  detention center transferred to the Ministry of Internal  Affairs; certain special operations subunits have moved to the  Federal Government Communications and Information Agency; and  the fight against organized crime and racketeering (apart from  corruption in the top echelons of power) has been handed over  completely to the militia. On the other hand the Alfa and Vympel  special antiterrorist subunits remain part of the president's  Main Protection Administration. As FCS First Deputy Director  Sergey Stepashin stated, "the preconditions for political  investigation to arise have been completely eliminated."  However, he did advocate the creation of an internal  intelligence service (and is that not the same thing?).    The FCS' strength will, compared with the Security Ministry,  decrease by 46 percent and amount to no more than 75,000  staffers countrywide. However, there will be no cuts in  counterintelligence operational subunits, which are under  strength. All the special service reforms will be completed  within one month of the statute being signed.    According to Sergey Stepashin, the special assessment  commission now operating in the FCS will carry out the  reassessment of cadres within one month. The central apparatus  will be slimmed down from 3,500 to 1,500 persons.    As Sergey Stepashin observed, President Yeltsin in a  conversation with him, drew attention to the fact that there  have been no purges whatsoever in the process of reorganization  and cadre selection has been carried out on the basis of  qualities such as professionalism and loyal service to the  fatherland and the state. As far as staffers who fail the  assessment are concerned, they will not, as Sergey Stepashin  stated, find themselves without a job but will be able to  transfer to the Internal Affairs Ministry, the tax police, or  the General Prosecutor's Office.</p>

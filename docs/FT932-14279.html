In a letter sent to each of the 340 strikers Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said: 'Failure to obey the instructions of the union's executive council will render you liable to expulsion from the union.'

Next week, representatives of both the company and the union will present their cases before the House of Commons employment committee.</p>

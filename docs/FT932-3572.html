			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Howard favours Sunday opening MR MICHAEL HOWARD, home secretary, yesterday came down firmly in favour of deregulating Sunday shop opening hours, saying that he did not believe any other alternative would work. Mr Howard said, however, MPs would still be given a choice of four options for reforming Britain's widely-discredited Sunday trading laws and hinted that he was prepared to listen to the arguments for a compromise solution. Speaking on BBC television, Mr Howard made clear his preference for extending the Conservative's free-market economics to the high street. 'I'm doubtful that anything other than deregulation will actually provide a really effective answer, but that is doubtless something that will be explored in coming months,' he said. The Home Office will publish a draft Sunday trading bill before the Commons recess which starts at the end of next month. Legislation is expected to be introduced in the session of parliament starting in November. The options will split the Conservative party, in which the Keep Sunday Special lobby has substantial support. Government business whips will allow Tory MPs a free vote, but Mr Howard did not rule out the possibility that no option would win a majority. By setting out his own preference he might have been hoping to increase the chances of MPs rallying around one option. The four choices to be voted on by MPs are: :Total deregulation with shops able to open on Sundays like any other day. Partial deregulation with larger shops restricted to six hours opening on Sundays and smaller shops totally deregulated. Limiting Sunday opening to convenience stores and sales of emergency supplies. A complex compromise that would allow all shops to open on the four Sundays before Christmas but only certain categories of shops to open on other Sundays.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Cleaner Thames tempts salmon to return - after 150 years IT IS pleasant, when sauntering across Southwark Bridge to or from that palace of learning and culture which is the Financial Times' headquarters, to think that, somewhere in the murky Thames' water swirling beneath one's feet, the silver Atlantic salmon is running again. The appreciation is purely mental, unfortunately. You are as likely to see a salmon there as a mermaid. But not so far upstream, at Molesey, in Surrey, they have been popping up in the National Rivers Authority fish trap in numbers which gladden the hearts of those who have worked long and hard to bring the salmon back. The whole thing is a minor modern miracle in view of the fact that London's filth had blocked the salmon's way for almost 150 years. Early in Victorian times, the river was no more than an open sewer until an event known as the Great Stink inspired a revolution. A huge raft of suspended faeces came to rest beneath the windows of parliament. The upshot was the construction of the capital's first sewerage scheme, designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette. But it was not until after the Second World War that the marvellous transformation of the Thames began  - one which should compel admiration throughout continental Europe, where, by and large, the degradation of the great rivers has continued unabated. Having made the river clean enough for salmon, the old Thames Water Authority decided that salmon there should be. It wanted - understandably, if vaingloriously - to show off what it had done. The task was immense. To establish a self-sustaining run of salmon, much more than clean water is needed. In particular, the fish has to be able to make its way up-river to spawn at the time of year when it feels the need. Having got there, it must be able to find suitable spawning grounds. Standing in its way, however, were more than 40 weirs. It was essential to build fish passes - but these cost anything up to Pounds 60,000 each and the scientists reckoned that - at the very least - they would have to be installed in the 22 weirs up to Reading, west of London, for the project to have any chance of success. So, five years ago a charity, Thames Salmon Trust, was set up to raise the money. Enlightened souls such as Sir James Goldsmith and companies like Shell and Siebe, have put their hands in their pockets. So far, a dozen passes are in place, and others are on the way. At the same time, the NRA has continued its work in enhancing the gravel beds suitable for spawning, and introducing juvenile stock. How admirable and plausible it all sounds. But grave doubts linger. The target of the Thames project is to achieve a run of 1,000 fish a year. When you consider that on a river like the Moy, in the west of Ireland, something like 10,000 salmon are caught each year on rod and line, it can be seen how modest the ambition was. Yet, in 20 years it has come nowhere near to being realised. In the best year, 1988, the run approached 500. Last year, the confirmed total was 59. This is no fault of the scientists, who have done their utmost; nor of the Thames Salmon Trust. The causes have been the general fall in the numbers of Atlantic salmon and the successive years of drought. This summer's healthier flows have encouraged a distinct improvement in the migration. It is, however, worth asking what the benefits would be if a run of 1,000 fish a year was established. In sporting terms it would be almost nil, since the fish would still be too scarce to repay serious angling. Any value would be principally symbolic. It would tell people that something has been done. At what cost, though? The fish passes up to Reading will have cost around Pounds 1m when completed. The NRA's continuing budget adds up to another Pounds 1m over 10 years. And all this to nurture and cosset a fish which even those who live by the river are most unlikely ever to see. It is impossible not to speculate on what could be done with such resources to save whole rivers from extinction. And yet and yet. Having raised the objections, I confess that I am still undecided. Reason suggests that the whole idea was a pipe dream and should have remained such. But having come so far, and having expended such effort, it would seem a terrible shame not to go on, even if circumstances do eventually conspire to sabotage the project. And, yes, it is cheering, even inspiring, to think of this marvellous creature fighting its way against the odds and the current through the heart of London, as it did two centuries ago. The Thames Salmon Trust is anxious to attract individual and corporate sponsors for the fish pass programme.

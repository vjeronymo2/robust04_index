			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad -- Chief of the PAF [Pakistan Air Force]  Air Chief Marshal Farooq Feroze Khan has said the F-16 are not  indispensable and we do not depend entirely on them for our  aerial defence.    "We cannot sacrifice our nuclear programme for these. If we  do not get them we have other options and we will make alternate  arrangements," he added.    In an exclusive interview with this correspondent at the Air  Headquarter, the PAF chief said "we are looking for  multi-functional planes which are readily available."    He disagreed with the suggestion that the defence capability  of the Air Force will suffer a setback as F-16 have become part  of the national psyche and said that we have blown the qualities  of the aircraft and of proportion. [sentence as published] He  said that although the F-16 was a good plane but it does not  mean that our Air Force would be incapacitated without them.    To another question about the possibility of acquiring  MiG-2000, SU-27 or MiG-29, the PAF chief said that we should not  take hasty decisions on replacing F-16s. "We have to make a  choice keeping in view our needs for the next 25 years and  considering all technical aspects."    Replying to another question, the Air Chief Marshal said  that  Mirage-2000-5 was still in its infancy and it would take at  least three to four years for this aircraft to roll out of the  assembly plant.    He revealed that Taiwan was likely to be the first recipient  of the plane in 1998. "Our priority is to opt for the planes  which could be delivered immediately," he added.    The Air Chief was of the view that nuclear programme and  F-16  were absolutely different issues and these should not be  intermingled "Our stand and that of the govt on the issue is  similar," he added.    He dismissed the suggestion of kickbacks in defence deals  and  said that the role of the PAF comes to an end the moment choice  of planes is made.    The PAF chief said the defence of Kahuta [nuclear power  plant] was in safe hands and keeping in view the probable  dangers defence of the vital national project has been made  impregnable and so one can dare violate Kahuta air space.  [sentence as published]    He said no one wanted war. "Wars take place where diplomacy  falls and our diplomacy is moving in the right direction.  However if war was thrust on us, we are fully prepared to  repulse aggression and are capable of defending the motherland,"  he added.    He said that the six K-8 trainer aircraft have been acquired  from China to fill in the gap created by American T-37 which  have been returned after expiry of the lease period.</p>

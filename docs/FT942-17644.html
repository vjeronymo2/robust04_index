			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Insurer warns on endowment policies One of the UK's largest insurance companies has warned customers that they may need to increase the amount they pay into endowment policies in order to pay off their mortgages. Royal Life, the life insurance arm of Royal Insurance, has written to about 24,000 of its 500,000 policyholders, triggering fears that other companies may follow suit. The warning follows cuts in the reversionary - or annual - bonus which Royal has paid on its 'with profits' endowments in the past two years. The policyholders affected are those who bought so-called 'low start' 22 to 30-year policies in 1991 and 1992. Premiums are set at a low rate during the early years of the policy. Royal stressed yesterday that customers need take no action this year. But if bonuses remained at current levels modest additional premiums would be necessary. Mr Icki Iqbal of Royal Life said that following falls in inflation and interest rates the company was taking a more pessimistic view about future investment returns. Royal reduced its reversionary bonus from 3.75 per cent to 3.25 per cent - an amount annually charged on and added to the basic sum insured - in January last year. This year a so-called 'super reversionary bonus', calculated as a percentage of the reversionary bonus, was reduced from 5.5 per cent to 5 per cent.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Leading nations back OECD plan to reduce jobless: Call to reassess statutory minimum wage Ministers from the world's 25 leading industrialised nations yesterday backed a wide programme of policies aimed at reducing the ranks of the 35m unemployed in their countries. The ministers, in Paris for the annual meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, endorsed an OECD report containing more than 60 recommendations ranging from encouraging entrepreneurship to changing laws that discourage hiring of labour. The organisation also calls on governments to 'reassess the role of statutory minimum wages' as an instrument for redistributing earnings. The measures will be used by individual OECD member states to fashion tailor-made policy programmes, to be implemented with the help of the Paris-based organisation. Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister who chaired yesterday's meeting, said there was 'a strong desire among ministers to undertake the policy options outlined'. Emphasis was placed on improving training and education programmes. 'With the change in labour markets, you are an apprentice all your life,' Mr Ahern said. The decision to launch an international employment strategy reflects the realisation that the industrial world's recovery from recession will not be sufficient to bring back the high levels of employment that existed in the 1950s and 1960s. A communique issued after the meeting noted that the ministers had agreed to embrace change. Technical advances and the expansion of trade and investment 'create vast new opportunities for the OECD countries to expand employment', it said. That, though, required the industrialised countries 'to be permanently innovative and able to adjust, constantly improving their economic efficiency'. To reduce unemployment, the ministers agreed that comprehensive reforms of their labour markets and other structural reforms were essential. They pledged their countries to: Nurture entrepreneurship; Ease regulations that discourage private initiative; Improve education and training systems; Improve the functioning of labour markets to achieve a better match between the supply and demand for jobs; Make employment services more effective, giving high priority to 'active labour market policies' designed to put people in touch with jobs; Change laws and regulations that discourage hiring of labour. At the same time, the ministers agreed that the industrial countries should maintain 'an adequate social safety net' for those who could not adapt to change. Mr Ahern insisted that the OECD countries were 'not talking about unravelling the welfare system, taking away the basic rights of workers or undermining long-standing collective agreements'. However, the organisation proposes strict guidelines to prevent unemployment benefits acting as a disincentive to work. It also suggests that over the medium term, collective bargaining agreements should be made more flexible to give employers a chance to renegotiate terms in times of difficulty. The report acknowledges that the industrial world will continue to create low-wage, low-skilled jobs. But it underlines the importance of training as a way of enabling people to cope with technological change and increased competition. Recognising that the US was creating too many low-paid jobs, Mr Robert Reich, the US labour secretary, said it would be impossible to increase productivity 'without a substantial investment in training and learning'.

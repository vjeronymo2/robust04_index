			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN &amp; DOUBLE TROUBLE "IN STEP." EPIC ***:  ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE(POOR) TO FIVE(A CLASSIC) STARS  </P> <P> As the last big discovery by the late John Hammond, Vaughan rightly dedicates  his latest effort to the pioneering record producer and talent scout who died  two years ago. Vaughan hopscotches between the blues, jazz and rock that his  benefactor mined so successfully in discoveries from Benny Goodman and Billie  Holiday to Dylan and Springsteen. Vaughan doesn't take any quantum leaps beyond  the raucous roadhouse blues and rock he has traversed already in three studio  albums and one live recording, but he can still set fire to a guitar quicker  than you can say "Jack Flash." The closing tune, "Riviera Paradise," seems  designed to show that Vaughan can shine in low gear as well as overdrive, but  the nearly 9-minute, moody excursion waffles between introspective blues and  lazy lounge jazz, falling too often on the snoozy side of the street. Mostly,  though, it's blazing business as usual. RANDY LEWIS  </P></p>

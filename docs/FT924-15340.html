			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Letter: Figures point to personal benefits and real savings of community care Sir, I was interested to read Maggie Urry's article on the nursing home sector and the changes occurring in the care market with Implementation of Care in the Community ('Costings are tight in an ageing market', September 23). Some of the issues which the article addresses should be looked at in the context of the whole caring market and Community Care. The NHS and Community Care Act will be implemented by local authorities over a period of 10 years from April 1, 1993. The article implied that there was apprehension about the Act and that the industry was unsure about how best to put it into practice. However, in Tunstall's experience, most of the authorities are well down the road in determining their own strategies for implementation and have submitted detailed plans already. The Act's principal aim is to promote the development of services which enable people to remain in their homes wherever that is feasible or sensible. Although Maggie Urry states that the top nursing home companies have only 4 per cent of the total market, it must be remembered that this market also constitutes residential homes, sheltered housing, NHS long-stay hospital wards, and home care. It will be the responsibility of local authority care managers to allocate funds to these different sectors, while providing individuals with maximum choice. Public expenditure on community based care in England is now a third greater than that spent on the hospital service. The government has pledged to increase the proportion of public expenditure which is directed towards caring for people in their own homes. Figures compiled by Professor A. Tinker show that the cost of caring for someone in their own home is Pounds 1,000 a year less than residential care and almost Pounds 15,000 a year less than hospital care. The Public Accounts Committee's 26th report, published in November 1988, highlighted that almost 25 per cent of those receiving benefits for residential care could have remained in their own homes had community support services been available. The NHS and Community Care Act is now well under way and companies such as Tunstall are working with local authorities to ensure a smooth and efficient transition from next April.

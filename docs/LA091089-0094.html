			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Nicholas, one of the two rarely seen beaked whales that washed up on a San  Francisco area beach two weeks ago has died of pneumonia, officials said. The  second whale, nicknamed Alexander, remained in stable but guarded condition.  Officials at Marine World Africa USA animal park in Vallejo said the prospects  for Alexander's survival remained very poor, only about 5%. The species has  never been known to survive in captivity. Both ailing whales had been force-fed  a liquid mixture of seafood.  </P></p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Japan tops consumer list for best quality goods The world's consumers believe the best quality goods are made by Japan, Germany and the US, while goods from Britain and other exporting nations lag well behind, according to a world-wide Gallup poll* of 20,000 people. Japan scores the highest, with nearly 39 per cent of consumers rating its products very good or excellent. Germany and the US do almost as well. Britain leads the rest of the field with a score of 22 per cent. The poll, commissioned by Bozell, the US advertising agency, is believed to be the first large-scale attempt to quantify world-wide perceptions about the quality of goods made by the 12 biggest exporting nations. Japan's position at the top of the league table confirms impressions that its manufacturers are now considered the world's best. Britain's manufacturers may draw some comfort from finding themselves relatively high up in the league table. But the poll makes grim reading for Russia's manufacturers, rated the worst. The Gallup Organisation, a US-based market survey company, carried out the poll by asking more than 20,000 people in 20 countries how they rated the quality of manufactured goods produced by each of the 12 countries named. Ratings were given on a five-point scale ranging from poor to excellent. Some 38.5 per cent of interviewees thought Japan's products were very good or excellent. Germany was second with 36 per cent, and the US was third with 34.3 per cent. Next, after a big gap, came Britain, France, Canada, Italy, Spain, China, Taiwan, Mexico and Russia. The breakdown of replies given in individual countries suggests that national prejudices influenced consumers' opinions. In France, for example, consumers said French manufacturers' products were the best. Consumer patriotism was highest in Japan, where 76 per cent of respondents rated Japanese products as very good or excellent. Next highest scorers in Japan were Germany with 49 per cent, then Britain with 39 per cent. * Bozell-Gallup Worldwide Quality Poll.

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei slips as Hong Kong recoups losses A sharp fall in Sony's share price, which affected the consumer electronics sector, dampened investor confidence and the Nikkei index lost marginal ground amid small lot selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index lost 34.01 to 19,302.56 after a high of 19,332.07 and a low of 19,199.24, barely changed over the week. Share prices lost ground on the morning session on selling by institutional investors and profit taking by foreigners. A steep decline in Sony later prompted selling of other high-technology shares. Volume remained flat at 210m shares. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 4.14 to 1,523.47 and the Nikkei 300 lost 1.02 to 279.73. Losses led gains by 476 to 448, with 235 issues remaining unchanged. The ISE/Nikkei was down 0.02 per cent to 1,250.28. Sony tumbled Y310, or 5.3 per cent, to Y5,480 on profit taking. Investors were discouraged by Thursday's announcement of the company's writing off losses which had stemmed from Sony Pictures Entertainment, former Columbia Pictures. Sony's decline affected other electrical stocks. Matsushita Electric Industrial, which also owns a US film studio MCA, declined Y40 to Y1,540. Sharp fell Y20 to Y1,780 and Toshiba retreated Y8 to Y708. Mitsubishi Estate lost Y20 to Y1,050 on worries over the financial state of the Rockefeller Group of the US, in which the Japanese group owns an 80 per cent stake. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 11.93 to 21,455.96 in volume of 21.3m shares. Roundup HONG KONG managed to recoup part of its steep morning losses, having found support just below the 9,400 level, after plunging sharply ahead of an expected bank rates rise. The Hang Seng index tumbled 90.84 to 9,427.44, against a day's low of 9,373.69, but was still 0.6 per cent higher on the week. Volume fell to HKDollars 2.4bn from Thursday's HKDollars 2.88bn. The Sino-British Land Commission's decision on Thursday to boost sharply land supply was a further factor clouding the property market. SEOUL finished lower in moderate trading on tight liquidity concerns but late institutional buying of some primary blue chips recouped early losses. The composite stock index lost 2.18 to 1,118.45, off a low of 1,113.02, for a 0.4 p+er cent fall on the week. KUALA LUMPUR encountered renewed retail buying which enabled most shares to rebound although falls in core stocks dragged the composite index down 3.60 to 1,048.88, but still 1.8 per cent higher on the week. Retail investors were reported to have bought second-line and speculative stocks amid optimism that some favourable news would emerge from Malaysia's dominant United Malays National Organisation's general assembly this weekend. SINGAPORE was easier on institutional selling amid worries that high US interest rates would squeeze corporate profitability while strong October trade data came too late in the session to influence trading. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 3.3 down at 2,354.67, but was still 1.4 per cent higher over the week. TAIPEI made headway on hopes of a technical rebound and bullish remarks from the ruling Nationalist Party's business manager. The weighted index added 52.83 to 6,350.71 in low turnover of TDollars 20.5bn, down 2 per cent on the week. Textile shares led the advance on expectations of increased earnings from polyester products, which are in heavy demand on international markets. Shinkong Synthetic Fibres rose TDollars 0.8 to TDollars 28.70. MANILA rose slightly as a technical rally, sparked by bargain-hunting in Petron, reversed an early downtrend. The composite index put on 8.76 to 2,912.86 for a 0.47 per cent loss on the week. SYDNEY was supported by industrials which offset weakness in resource issues. The All Ordinaries index dipped 0.4 to 1,922.0 in turnover of ADollars 490m, off 1.5 per cent this week. Among resource stocks, CRA fell 18 cents to ADollars 17.40 in active trade, mainly on the exercise of ADollars 19 put options.</p>

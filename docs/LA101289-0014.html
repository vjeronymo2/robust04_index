			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LIVE, FROM ROLLING HILLS ESTATES, IT'S CITY COUNCIL NIGHT  </P> <P> It was "show time" for the first time Tuesday in the Rolling Hills Estates City  Council Chambers as the council made its debut on Dimension Cable Service,  Channel 3. With two cameras set up and technicians checking monitors at the  back of the chambers, Mayor Nell Mirels told the audience: "We're live on TV --  for the first time."  </P> <P> Before the cameras were turned on, council members got a few pointers from  Dorothy Ciffone, Dimension's public access studio coordinator, on how to look,  act and sound before the electronic eye.  </P> <P> Out are white clothing and busy patterns that reflect too much light or jump  around on the TV screen. In are solid colors, ranging from the darker hues to  light peach. Jewelry, too, is fine.  </P> <P> Sound, Ciffone cautioned, is a major concern. "Talk a proper distance from the  microphone, not too far forward or too far back," she said. And don't "shuffle  papers or drag maps over the microphones." That makes a terrific racket.  </P> <P> And, she said, beware the open microphone: "You're on live and whatever you say  will be picked up." This prompted Mirels to say that the council had better  watch its "editorial comments."  </P> <P> Council chambers have been brightened up for the cameras. There is new  light-blue carpeting, and a darker blue wall-covering behind the council dais  comes complete with a new wooden logo with the city's name and its pepper tree  symbol.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills Estates council meetings -- held the second and fourth Tuesday at  7:30 p.m. -- will be telecast live, with repeat showings the following Thursday  at 7:30 p.m. Dimension already telecasts meetings of the Rancho Palos Verdes  City Council, Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District board and the  board of the Palos Verdes Library District.  </P> <P> The debut telecast had a potential audience of 22,360 homes -- the total number  of Dimension subscribers on the Palos Verdes Peninsula and in a portion of San  Pedro. But only a handful -- 878 -- are in Rolling Hills Estates, where  installation of the cable system has yet to be completed. Some 1,800 homes are  able to receive service and new hookups are being made on a daily basis,  according to the company.  </P> <P> Mirels said she hopes the televised meetings will bring the council closer to  residents -- and blunt some criticism that the city is a poor communicator.  </P> <P> "We hope people in town will have a better chance of seeing what's going on,"  Mirels said.  </P></p>

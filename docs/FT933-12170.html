			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (10): Link with M4 may revive fortunes - The docks: the city is still a working port THE PLANNED transformation of 2,700 acres of Cardiff is the second biggest regeneration project of its kind in Britain after London Docklands. Yet, while both are creating new housing, office, leisure and industrial opportunities in old port areas, they differ in one important respect. While the port trades of London have moved down river to Tilbury, and further afield to Felixstowe, Southampton and elsewhere, Cardiff remains an important, middle-ranking, working port. Indeed, from the windows of the spectacular new NCM building now rising alongside the Roath Basin, office workers will get a grandstand view of the maximum 35,000 tonnes dwt vessels which can enter the biggest of the two remaining Cardiff docks, the Queen Alexandra; and yacht owners, coming in an out of the impounded basin which will be created by the barrage, will have to take care when large vessels enter and leave the sea locks into the docks. Guests who book into the Celtic Bay Hotel, converted out of the brick shell of a former bonded warehouse, can dream, too, of boarding in Cardiff one of the most romantic voyages still open to the sea traveller from Britain - a cruise down to St. Helena, via Tenerife, Ascencion and Cape Town (with a once-a-year extension to Tristan da Cunha), on the only remaining Royal Mail Ship, the RMS St Helena. Yet, despite these reminders of a great past, Cardiff's glory days as a port have been well behind it for some time. In 1913, when exports reached a record 13.7m tonnes (including 10.5 m. tonnes of coal), 900 ships a month called at the port, which for brief periods exceeded both London's and Liverpool's tonnage. In 1920, the city boasted 122 shipping companies, owning 1.5m gross tonnes of shipping, to make it the greatest steamship-owning centre in the world. The switch to oil for boilers did for Cardiff, and for the Welsh coal industry, and a long, slow period of decline has followed, taking with it old ship-owning names like Cory, Seager, Instone, Lovering, Radcliffe, Tatem, Turnbull, and Reardon Smith. Only two Cardiff shipowning companies survive - Graig and CM Willie - of which only the latter, with a weekly liner service to Bilbao, sails out of Cardiff. As late as the 1960s, efforts were still being made by the port's owners, the nationalised British Transport Docks Board, to attract new portside industry to create large new trades for the port on land once occupied by 40 miles of railway track, but these failed to produce any significant results. Since privatisation, Associated British Ports has pursued a different policy of seeking to sell off its surplus land, and it has been this which has opened the way for the dockland developments now taking place. Enough land has been retained to make sure the port can continue to function, but other land has been made available for development. ABP's property arm, Grosvenor Developments, is responsible for two of the main office blocks currently under way on 170 acres it has set aside for development - for NCM and the Welsh Health Common Services Agency. The port itself now handles around 2.5m. tonnes of traffic a year, split between imports and exports. Coal and coke products are still exported, though coal is now also imported, along with large quantities of oil and petroleum products, mainly from refineries around the UK coast. Cardiff is also an important fruit and timber importing port, though this latter trade has been badly affected by the recession. General cargoes, some containerised, are also handled, together with project cargoes, such as heavy plant and machinery, with the port's hinterland from which it can draw business extending across much of southern Britain. Importation of orange juice, one of the fastest-growing grocery products of recent years, is a relatively new speciality, developed as a result of investment over recent years by ABP in improving Cardiff's quayside cold storage. Other trades which could take advantage of the 9,000 tonne cold store facility are also being investigated. Just how easily port activities and the whole range of new living, working and leisure facilities planned for the bay, including a new opera house, can co-exist, remains to be seen, but the symbiosis that is already developing looks as though it could benefit both. The bay developments could not have happened if such large tracts of land, much of it originally reclaimed from the sea for dock development, had not been available and ripe for comprehensive development. In return for releasing land, the port is obtaining not only new neighbours who will bring both income and life to the area but an extensive new road network. Originally built to be served exclusively by railway, Cardiff docks will, with the completion of a peripheral distributor road through the bay, be on a loop of the M4 motorway, giving instant access to the UK motorway network, barely more than 20 miles from the second Severn river-crossing. As a result, the port itself could become much more attractive to importers and exporters, securing a revival in its fortunes which has eluded it for much of the present century.</p>

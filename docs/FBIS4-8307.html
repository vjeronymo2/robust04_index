			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 12 (CTK) -- U.S. Undersecretary  of State Strobe Talbott will meet with top Slovak politicians in  his one-day visit to the capital today. He will be received in  the morning by President Michal Kovac, then meet in the  afternoon with Premier Jozef Moravcik, Parliament Chairman Ivan  Gasparovic, and Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan. Talbott and  Kukan will hold a press conference at the conclusion of their  meeting.    Kukan says in the Slovak press that Talbott's visit is  significant not only because of his close personal relationship  with President Bill Clinton, but as a signal with regard to the  current situation in Slovakia. He says he expects his  discussion with Talbott to revolve around international  questions and Slovakia's economic situation, particularly in  regard to opportunities for American capital and businesses.</p>

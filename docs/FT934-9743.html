			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Tribasa securitises toll road revenues TRIBASA, the Mexican construction company, has sold Dollars 110m of bonds in the Euromarkets backed by the revenues from two private toll roads. It is the first successful international toll road securitisation by a Mexican company this year. The bond offering was oversubscribed, with about 80 per cent of the demand from the US and the remainder from Europe. The bonds, of an average maturity of 8.5 years, were priced at 10.5 per cent, 500 basis points over US Treasury bills of the same period. The demand for the bonds augurs well for other Mexican toll road and infrastructure securitisations, which bankers say could constitute a multi-billion dollar market. The Mexican government has awarded concessions on more than 4,000km of toll roads in the past five years, and construction companies are keen to off-load debt by securitising the roads. The finance ministry is planning to securitise the state-owned Cuernavaca-Mexico City toll road in the international markets in January next year. The securitisation, which had originally been planned for September, may fetch about Dollars 600m. So far, Mexico's toll road programme has been plagued by the poor performance of many of the roads, with traffic use far below projections and construction costs far above. However, the government and construction companies are working to resolve the problems by agreeing on capital increases for the troubled roads. Tribasa sought to reassure investors concerned about a devaluation or low traffic by agreeing to extend the life of the toll road bonds to 18 years should US dollar revenues fall short of those forecast. The two roads securitised were the heavily used Ecatepec-Piramides road near Mexico City, and the less popular Armera-Manzanillo on the Pacific Cost.</p>

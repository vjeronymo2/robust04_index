			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Yen driven up by trade deadlock: Japanese share prices hit by fears of lost export sales Nervous financial markets yesterday pushed the yen to its highest level in five months and drove leading Japanese stocks sharply lower in response to the weekend failure of the US and Japan to reach a trade agreement. The stronger yen reflects investor fears that the Clinton administration is determined to talk up the Japanese currency as a way of curbing a Dollars 50bn (Pounds 34bn) trade deficit by making Japanese exports more expensive. The US administration said yesterday that it would not be hasty in considering its response to the failed talks. President Bill Clinton said: 'We are reviewing all our options. We haven't ruled anything out.' Asked whether US sanctions could lead to retaliation and a trade war, he said: 'It could be, but I think they (the Japanese) would have to think long and hard about it.' The Nikkei share average fell nearly 650 points to about 18,800 in early trading this morning after falling 531.45 in the previous session amid fears that Japanese groups would lose export sales as a result of a strong yen. In Tokyo early today the yen was trading at Y102.175 against the dollar after rising sharply yesterday in New York where it briefly touched Y101 before closing at Y102.2. In London, it finished at Y104.1, against its Friday close in New York of Y107.2. Japan's leaders said they would take steps before the July summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations to deal with the deficit. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, told his coalition partners that the situation 'must be improved' and that the continuing surplus with the US was 'not favourable'. The government and private sector must both make efforts to reduce the surplus, he said. The prime minister received support from Mr Michio Watanabe, a faction leader in the opposition Liberal Democratic party, who warned that Japan risked a trade war with the US unless it worked out market-opening measures. The US administration made clear, however, that any move to reopen talks should come from Japan. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said: 'They understand exactly what the framework means. They understand the need to open up their markets.' He said US officials would meet all week to formulate a response to 'the failure of the Japanese government to live up to their obligations'. The renewed rise in the Japanese currency provoked concern from the Bank of Japan, which said it would take steps in co-operation with other industrialised countries if the currency speculation continued. Currency analysts also warned against the dangers of the yen strengthening too far. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, noted that a 10 per cent appreciation in the yen would result in a 0.5 per cent fall in Japanese gross domestic product growth. 'Even from the US point of view, there must be a recognition that a Japanese economy that is expanding is preferable to one that is flat on its back,' said Mr MacKinnon. Mr Mark Cliffe of Nomura Research Institute in London said the strong yen would undermine confidence further, squeeze profits and threaten more labour-shedding.

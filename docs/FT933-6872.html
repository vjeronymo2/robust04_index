			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Invesco The combination of Britannia Arrow and Invesco of the US in 1988 aimed to create a global fund management business. The ambition remains intact, but the performance of the shares for most of the intervening years underlines that a fund manager's franchise is easily tarnished. The company's mismanagement of Drayton Consolidated investment trust and links with Mr Robert Maxwell left a sour taste. Litigation relating to the Mirror Group Newspapers pension fund still looms. Until that issue is resolved - preferably outside court - winning business from other UK pension funds will be difficult. But with investment markets reaching new peaks and the US business making gains, Invesco's problems in London look like a local difficulty. Sales of mutual funds to US private investors show no sign of slowing. US institutions are distant enough from the Maxwell case not to care. The 350 per cent rise in the shares since last September outstrips even the startling gains seen elsewhere in the sector. That is not to deny the legacy of past mistakes. Winning institutional business in continental Europe is proving difficult, and will remain so until Invesco regains the confidence of institutions closer to home. Rebuilding the balance sheet means slower dividend growth than might otherwise be the case. While investors keep faith in the upward momentum of world stock markets, though, that will not take the shine off Invesco's shares.</p>

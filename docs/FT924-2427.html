			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Hillsdown sells bed-making side Hillsdown Holdings, the food group which has been retreating from its non-food interests, has sold its bed-making interests, including Sleepeezee in the UK and businesses in France and Italy. The buyer is Cauval Industrie, a French group. Hillsdown made a profit on the sale, the cash consideration of Pounds 17m exceeding the net asset value of Pounds 14m. Mr David Newton, chief operating officer, said: 'This is another significant step in the process of concentrating our interests on core activities.' In 1991 the non-food activities contributed 16 per cent of group operating profits.</p>

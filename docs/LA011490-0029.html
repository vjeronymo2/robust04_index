			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: BIG MOVE  </P> <P> Where will John Conboy take "Santa Barbara"?  </P> <P> The former exec producer of "Capitol" and producer of "The Young &amp; the  Restless" and "Love Is a Many Splendored Thing" has been at work unofficially  at "SB" for several days in the newly created post of senior exec producer.  </P> <P> But he tells us it's too soon for a definite game plan.  </P> <P> "Right now, it's a little early for me to make some judgmental comments on  where I'm going with the show," Conboy said, "because I'm just getting to know  the people and meet them."  </P> <P> Conboy did reveal that the characters of Cruz (played by A Martinez) and Eden  (Marcy Walker) will get back together romantically, possibly on an exotic  location.  </P> <P> "SB" has been a perennial Emmy winner -- eight last June, including best  daytime drama -- but a ratings flop. NBC and New World Prod. began working out  a deal last September to lure Conboy to the soap; he'll take over officially  later this month. SI Sue Facter  </P> <P> </P></p>

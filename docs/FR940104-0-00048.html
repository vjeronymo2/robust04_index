			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In September 1992, the Corps initiated consultation with NMFS concerning a new GCID permit application to conduct maintenance dredging and other activities at its facility over a 3-year period (1993&hyph;95). On April 22, 1993, NMFS concluded consultation and issued a jeopardy biological opinion and incidental take statement that limited dredging in the upper oxbow, required maintenance of the training wall and pilot cut through the lower oxbow, limited the permit duration to a period of 1 year, and required GCID to pursue a long-term solution for protecting winter-run chinook salmon and correcting passage problems at the facility. Following issuance of the Corps permit, GCID conducted maintenance dredging and other maintenance activities in accordance with the requirements of the biological opinion, and subsequently began pumping water on a restricted basis beginning on August 1, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Justice and GCID signed a new stipulated agreement in June 1993 that allowed operations to continue in 1993. This new agreement, in conjunction with the biological opinion that was issued to the Corps, restricted pumping activities at the Hamilton City facility, required various types of monitoring, and committed GCID to ensure the implementation of long-term protective and conservation measures for winter-run chinook salmon at its Hamilton City facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1992, GCID, the State of California, and the Corps began a joint Federal and state environmental review process to evaluate several long-term alternatives for correcting fish entrainment, impingement, and passage problems at the GCID facility. The Bureau is now the lead Federal agency responsible for preparing the environmental documentation and constructing the selected long-term protective and conservation measures due to the passage of the Central Valley Improvement Act. The environmental review process has been delayed, but is expected to be completed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mid-1994. NMFS will consult with the Bureau to evaluate the effects of constructing and operating the selected long-term protection alternative on winter-run chinook salmon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Delta Export Facilities of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Bureau and the California Department of Water Resources operate facilities in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to convey Sacramento River water into and through the Delta and to export water out of the Delta. These facilities include the Delta Cross Channel operated by the Bureau, and water export and fish protection facilities operated by the Bureau (Tracy Pumping Plant) and California Department of Water Resources (Byron Pumping Plant). The operations of these and other Central Valley and State water facilities, which are coordinated through the Coordinated Operations Agreement between the Bureau and the State, can adversely impact winter-run chinook salmon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To address the potential adverse effects of gate operations on juvenile winter-run chinook salmon survival in 1992, NMFS included a reasonable and prudent alternative measure in the February 14, 1992, biological opinion for 1992 CVP operations requiring the Bureau to close the Delta Cross Channel from February 1 through May 1, 1992. This action was expected to substantially reduce the diversion of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon into the Delta from the Sacramento River, especially with the extremely critical water supply and low export pumping rates that were anticipated to occur in 1992. Operation of the Federal and State export facilities in 1992 was not expected to incidentally take more than a small percentage of the 1991 winter-run chinook salmon outmigrant population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, based on monitoring at these facilities during February and March 1992, NMFS determined that the taking of juveniles exceeded the amount identified in the incidental take statement, and requested consultation be reinitiated. After further consultation with the Bureau and the State was completed, NMFS amended the incidental take statement to restrict the combined daily water export rate from both facilities to 1,200 cfs during the remainder of April 1992. The amended take statement also required that consultation be reinitiated if the incidental take of juveniles exceeded 400 fish during this period or there was evidence to indicate that winter-run outmigration would substantially continue beyond April 30, 1992, and required both the Bureau and the State to support efforts to develop a more refined and accurate method for determining the level of taking incidental to pumping operations at the water export facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the losses of juvenile fish at these facilities were higher than expected in the spring of 1992, NMFS and the CDFG established a Delta Salvage and Loss Working Group consisting of representatives from NMFS, FWS, the California Departments of Fish and Game and Water Resources, and the Bureau. The objectives of this group were to (1) review and refine the juvenile winter-run chinook salmon loss estimates at the water export facilities during the 1992 outmigration period, and (2) evaluate the loss estimation and reporting procedures used in 1992 and make recommendations for improving the procedures for 1993 and future years. The group met frequently to discuss these issues and issued a summary report in September 1992 that included a revised estimate of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon losses in 1992 and a series of recommendations for loss estimation and reporting. The loss estimation and reporting procedures developed by this group were eventually incorporated into the February 12, 1993, biological opinion and incidental take statement that NMFS issued to the Bureau on the long-term operations of the Federal and State water projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Aden, June 3 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni forces  fought their way closer to the south's bastion of Aden on Friday  [3 June] after trading rocket and artillery fire with southern  troops, despite both sides' acceptance of a UN ceasefire call.    Northern army units loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  moved to within 15 kilometers (nine miles) of Aden, as a  northern minister said they were now in a position to capture  the city after four weeks of civil war.    Salih's troops captured the villages of al-Waht, 20  kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Aden, and Lahij, 30  kilometers (19 miles) north of the city, southern commanders  confirmed.    Dozens of people were killed in the battle for the two  villages on Thursday and Friday, and hundreds of villagers fled  the fighting.    Southern troops loyal to the president's rival 'Ali Salim  al-Bid said they were forced back to Bi'r Nasir, some 15  kilometers (nine miles) north of Aden.    Northern troops advancing on Aden from the east also moved  forward to within 30 kilometers (19 miles) of the port city  after fighting in the Abyan region.    Two surface-to-surface missiles were fired at Aden in a dawn  attack Friday, without causing casualties.    A military spokesman in Aden, capital of a breakaway  southern  state, said southern anti-aircraft fire intercepted one missile  while the other landed in an uninhabited area of desert.    In Sanaa, Information Minister Hasan al-Lawzi told reporters  that northern forces were now "able to enter the city, but they  are awaiting a political decision."    Salih's troops have mounted "fierce offensives on all  fronts,  destroying villages and killing civilians," the southern command  charged in a statement. "We are resisting with all our strength  to protect our land and our honour."    A military spokesman in Aden said southern forces on  Thursday  repelled an offensive by northern troops in the oil region of  Shabwah, 300 kilometers (180 miles) northeast of Aden.    The spokesman told Aden Radio that the northern troops  commander in Shabwah, Colonel Muhammad Salim al-'Arif, lost his  right arm in the fighting, while "several" northern soldiers  were killed or injured.    Southern army units destroyed four tanks and three troop  carriers and captured two tanks and several northern army  vehicles, the spokesman added. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter De Ionno] </F>   [Text] Talks between Defence Minister Joe Modise and SANDF  [South African National Defense Force] chief General Georg  Meiring about high-level command posts for Mr Modise's former MK  [Umkhonto we Sizwe; Spear of the Nation--ANC military wing]  comrades-in-arms have deadlocked.    The impasse is embarrassing Mr Modise by frustrating the  expectations of his closest supporters, who see the SANDF  opposition as a last-ditch attempt to retain white control of  the military command structure.    Calls for Mr Modise to exert his political authority over  the  generals are rising as he faces a personal test this week with a  bid to persuade government leaders to appoint a deputy minister  to help him restructure and re-orient the defence force.    Ronnie Kasrils, Mr Modise's long-term MK ally and confidant,  is favoured for the post, if the minister can break through the  ceiling of 12 deputy ministers.    Mr Kasrils, who has been attending official briefings at Mr  Modise's side, favours moves to change the complexion and image  of the SANDF with the appointment of black generals. He would  give powerful support to Mr Modise in forcing the generals to  compromise.    The headquarters generals are insisting on pre-election  agreements that appointments and ranking of MK officers could  only be based on internationally accepted military standards.  This would exclude many veteran MK commanders.    Senior MK officers can claim 30 or more years of guerrilla  warfare experience and training in African and Eastern Bloc  military doctrine. But many do not have academic qualifications  and the breadth of command demanded for high office by a modern  conventional defence force.    A Defence Ministry source confirmed this week that an MK  list  suggesting 17 names for leadership posts had been sent back by  the SANDF with a demand that it be cut to seven names.    While the arguments are centred on two vacant positions at  SANDF headquarters -- chief of staff (effectively second in  command) and chief of staff intelligence -- the outcome will  have a direct effect on the ranking of all MK cadres being  integrated into the defence force.    MK officers fear that assessment boards will not recognise  ranks and commissions awarded in the guerrilla army.    The chief of staff position, vacant since the retirement in  November of Lieutenant-General Pierre Steyn, has been widely  expected to go to Siphiwe Nyanda, who succeeded Mr Modise as  commander of MK. As chief-of-staff he would be heir apparent to  General Meiring.    Mr Nyanda, 43, a former sports journalist who returned from  exile in 1988 to head Operation Vula, has spent the past two  years guiding MK towards integration, but senior SANDF sources  reject him because "he is not qualified".    Similarly, attempts to moot MK's head of operations Lambert  Moloi for the SANDF intelligence chief's post (which also  carries the rank of lieutenant-general), are being dismissed  "because he does not have the right background".    "The generals do not realise that there is a political  imperative to make provision for our people if the military is  to be seen to change and be seen as legitimate by the whole  country," said a ministerial adviser.    "The SANDF command just cannot remain lily-white. There has  to be political intervention and acceptance of affirmative  action."    Meanwhile, initial hiccups at the Wallmannstal assembly area  for MK soldiers being prepared for integration appear to have  been overcome.    The number of MK cadres listed for integration has been  settled at 26,864, more than double the 12,000 originally  expected.</p>

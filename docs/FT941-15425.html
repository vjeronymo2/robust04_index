			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / As They Say in Europe: New pieces in an old game From a Prague newspaper: 'If the west is not to bend the knee before Moscow, it will have to give the central European countries a clear promise. Not because those lands face an acute threat but in order to save face and to show that, five years after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, there is at last a project for the whole continent.' Thus the daily, Lidove Noviny, showed its lack of enthusiasm for what the Americans called 'Partnership for Peace' at the Nato summit this week. In the same paper, Lech Walesa, the Polish president, attacked the Czechs for being 'too soft' in their attitude to the formula. The west planned 'PforP' as a bare maximum - the most that could be offered without annoying Moscow. This was not enough for the Poles and others in central Europe who want to join Nato. They think the west is offering them protection in the future, once it has been demonstrated they don't need it. The crispest answer to the implicit accusation of hypocrisy came in a German paper: 'A security system for eastern Europe cannot be constructed without or against Russia, but only with it.' Nevertheless, German opinion was divided. The Frankfurter Rundschau said Partnership for Peace had some advantages - it gave Russian President Boris Yeltsin the chance to sell the Nato decision as a success, but added that the future of Russian democracy depended far more on economic success than anything in the security field. This view was echoed in Moscow: Pravda said of US President Bill Clinton's visit: 'The US delegation has in its bag more pieces of advice and political declarations than economic programmes, or, most importantly, funds for their realisation.' In fact the Americans are just plain confused; they went to Moscow in the belief that Yeltsin was still the one man in the region they could do business with. But the arguments within Nato today are the same as those between the wars, after the collapse of the imperial system in east and central Europe. The question is this: once a belt of new independent nations has been constructed down the middle of Europe between Russians and Germans, who is going to guarantee their security? The very act of offering a guarantee can lead to trouble. So the British and French refused to stand up for Czechoslovakia in 1938. The Poles then rejected Soviet guarantees in 1939 - the country's foreign minister Colonel Beck was said to have signed away his country between two flicks of his cigarette. And the British knew that by offering Poland a treaty they were probably guaranteeing, not Poland, but a second world war. But things have changed in some respects. Germany is no longer led by a maniac and most countries of the region welcome a security system in which Germany plays a leading role. There is also the unrecognised fact that today Russia has no borders with any country of central Europe, a unique situation. Instead Ukraine acts as one buffer and Belarus as another. Everybody forgets Belarus, still known in German as White Russia. This fact should offer an unusual opportunity. Sixty years ago the successor states of central Europe were supposed to form a cordon sanitaire against Bolshevik expansionism. Today, in different circumstances, Ukraine and Belarus might play the same role. But nobody thinks in those terms, so the west has demanded that Ukraine get rid of its nuclear arsenal. It might one day be glad that that country does not make good its promise to do so. With Russia now removed from central Europe's back yard and Germany run by peace-loving democrats, why is everybody so worried? The noted Liberal Democrat, Vladimir Zhirinovsky is obviously one reason but the other is that nobody seems able to grasp the full dimension of the present situation. Policy-makers see no role for Belarus or the Baltic states because they have not assimilated them into their planning framework. Bismarck or Kissinger would have known what to do - support someone unpleasant or pour men and weapons into the region. The situation is like a chess championship played with many new pieces. Imagine Short and Kasparov have been given extra rooks and pawns, plus some new pieces with unusual moves, say a 'Serb' (10 squares backwards and then mates itself). In such circumstances players like me could probably give a grandmaster a hard time. That's the trouble with Europe today: far too many pieces on the board, nobody knows what they can do, where they are or what they are all called. It makes novices of us all.

To this end, 28 male Vistar rats  exposed to an external background radiation of 4 mR/h in Khoynik  rayon of Gomel oblast for one month and 28 animals exposed to an  external background radiation of 0.4 mR/h in Rechitsy rayon of  Gomel oblast for five months are examined. The rats received an  equivalent internal and external doses of 0.0141 and 2.52 rem,  respectively, in the first group and 0.0021 and 1.44 rem in the  second. The control group was exposed to an external background  of 0.011-0.014 mR/h at the Minsk Medical School. The enzymatic  antioxidant protection system indicators and the concentration  of the lipid peroxidation products were compared to those of the  control group. The experimental procedure is outlined. The  reduced glutathion concentration and the glutathion peroxidase  concentration in the liver and erythrocytes in group 2 rats are  summarized. The study shows a marked increase in the lipid  peroxidation product content in the irradiated animals; the  superoxide dismutase activity in the animals exposed to a lower  irradiation dose was much higher than that in the control group,  attesting to stressed compensatory mechanisms which usually  neutralize free oxygen radicals forming under the effect of  ionizing radiation.

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (7): More jam tomorrow on roads - Environmental pressures are increasing THE transport and distribution industry is finding itself under increasing pressure from environmental influences, which raise many issues but provide few solutions. Road congestion, which is already regarded by many as a barrier to the UK's economic growth, can only get worse. Transport bosses complain that motorways are starting to become congested at night, as well as during the day. 'The congestion issue will hit the transport industry quite seriously over the next few years,' according to Dr Mike Monaghan, director of environment for P &amp; O. The group, which operates barges on the Rhine, is looking seriously at an increase in rail freight and coastal shipping to bypass the roads in Britain. However, these alternatives will bring only marginal benefit: 'The nub of the problem is the private car, not the commercial vehicle. That's where the massive growth has been.' Substantial new road programmes and spending on public transport are needed, according to the Freight Transport Association; but the signs are not encouraging. One leading transport group cites the Channel Tunnel as a frightening example of government 'penny-pinching, bungle and lack of clarity. 'They have a hell-bent, doctrinaire approach about not investing in public services. As a result, Railfreight Distribution and its links to the Channel, launched with such a fanfare three years ago, has fallen flat on its face.' The view is widespread. James Watson, chairman of NFC, warned recently that the freight industry will view the tunnel as little more than 'an expensive hole in the ground'. Transport Development Group's leading cross-Channel operator, Beck &amp; Pollitzer, already hauls by rail to Boulogne, but says it will go on using ferries and the roads for the UK leg of its international operations, after the tunnel opens. In London, the area of greatest congestion, the government offers its low-cost Red Route scheme, 300 miles of priority routes with strictly enforced parking bans. It promises slightly faster and more predictable journey times for delivery vehicles. Ironically, however, even this programme is proving to be a mixed blessing for the distribution industry, which is already complaining of inadequate access to shops on the trial routes. Increasingly, transport operators are finding problems even before they go on to the road. Rights of residents and the local authority to object lorry operating bases were introduced in the mid-1980s, but over the past two years have been greatly strengthened through changes of interpretation of existing law. Apart from dedicated industrial zones, expansion and growth has become extremely difficult, even on some sites zoned for light industrial use. 'The government doesn't realise the extent of the problems,' according to Jonathan Lawton, a prominent transport lawyer. Showpiece distribution centres seldom have environmental problems; but there are real worries for small- to medium-sized transport operators. The 'headline' environmental issue on lorries, however, is weights. Local newspapers frequently carry news of accidents involving juggernauts or protests against them and the anti-lorry sentiment this reflects has dominated political action for more than a decade. Gross lorry weight is equated, quite mistakenly, with size. Ironically, since the furore over the increase in weights from 32 tonnes to 38 tonnes in 1983, increases in both the length and (in the case of refrigerated vehicles) width of articulated lorries have gone almost unnoticed. The controversy over lorry weights continues, however. There is strong support within the Department of Transport for a further increase from 38 to 44 tonnes, to reduce the number of heavy trucks on the roads. Running on six axles instead of five, these trucks would also do less damage to roads, officials believe. A unilateral move by Britain to 44 tonnes, which is already allowed in some EC countries, remains a possibility. Legislators are in disarray, however, on lorry weights. The method used to calculate the damage lorries do to roads, and also the tax levied on them, are regarded by engineers as crude. Technical advances in 'road friendly suspension', especially air suspension, promise reduced road wear. But the benefits are largely unknown. 'It could be 50 per cent or it could be 1,000 per cent,' according to Peter Sweatman, who heads a UN-sponsored research programme. Reducing the environmental impact of exhaust emissions has become a substantial area of cost for lorry manufacturers and therefore, ultimately, operators. While no exact figures are available, Daf estimates that the industry has spent around Pounds 150m a year in this one area of research over the past five years. This is a cost which will continue during the 1990s, as the industry strives to meet stringent EC emissions targets. However, the research is running into the law of diminishing returns. 'Clean burn' improvements become more marginal, at the expense of slightly greater fuel consumption. Manufacturers complain that legislators are doing little to clean up engines in operation.</p>

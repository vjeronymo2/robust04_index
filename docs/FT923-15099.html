			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Algeria attempts to fill leadership void ALGERIA'S military-backed rulers yesterday named Mr Ali Kafi - a prominent veteran of the war of independence against France - as the new head of state, replacing the assassinated Mr Mohamed Boudiaf. They also said a six-man team today would start work to uncover the 'authors, instigators and masterminds' of Mr Boudiaf's murder. The investigators must produce their first findings within 20 days and these will be made public. The 64-year-old Mr Kafi, who was already on the five-member High State Council, now becomes its president. This body, Algeria's collegiate presidency, includes General Khaled Nezzar, the influential defence minister. The council appointed a new member to fill the vacancy left by Mr Boudiaf's death: Mr Redha Malek, a signatory of the Evian Agreement by which France granted independence to Algeria 30 years ago. The two appointments are a sign of continuity and so are likely to be welcomed in western and Arab capitals. Mr Malek's appointment is as important as the promotion of Mr Kafi because he is widely respected for the skill and determination he showed in Algeria's successful efforts to release US diplomats held hostage in Tehran in 1981. He has had a distinguished career as ambassador to Paris, Belgrade, Washington and Moscow. With these moves, Algeria's military chiefs have acted swiftly to fill the void left by the shooting of Mr Boudiaf as he delivered a speech in the town of Annaba on Monday. In less than six months since being recalled from 28 years' exile, Mr Boudiaf did more than many previous leaders to confront the country's ills. Economically, Algeria's crisis could not have come at a more sensitive moment as it is seeking fresh backing from international lenders and oil companies. Politically, Mr Boudiaf had just begun to tackle corruption, to liberalise the rigidly state-run economy, and to establish a dialogue with younger people who make up the bulk of the population and provide most of the popular support for the now banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). The speed with which he moved might have contributed to his assassination. Mr Boudiaf upset powerful interest groups that had much to lose from his policies. Despite assumptions abroad that his death was the work of Islamic extremists, it is hard to find ordinary Algerians who blame the FIS, despite the fact that one of the two killers, now under arrest, was said to have cited religious motives. Many people instead point the finger at a mafia of politicians who lined their pockets during the previous quarter of a century of single-party rule under the Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN). Mr Boudiaf's death places even greater responsibility on Gen Nezzar, the most powerful member of the collegiate presidency. The army is now the only source of authority which has avoided becoming enmeshed in the country's religious, regional and tribal conflicts. Gen Nezzar is said not to relish the role of national policeman and has tried to ensure stability without dominating the government. That is why he and his colleagues recalled Mr Boudiaf after cancelling last December's election - Algeria's first multi-party poll - and ousting the discredited President Chadli Bendjedid. The FIS was set to win the election and the military wanted a respected civilian to avert fundamentalist rule. The need to fill the power vacuum is especially urgent because Algeria is delicately poised to reform an economy burdened by debt charges equivalent to 75 per cent of foreign revenues. It is in the middle of negotiations for a third standby loan from the International Monetary Fund crucial to confidence of foreign commercial and state lenders. The uncertainty also casts a shadow over promising negotiations with international oil companies for production and exploration. Further violence could jeopardise this important source of cash. The new head of state derives his legitimacy for the post as a respected figure in the struggle for independence. His later position as secretary-general of the war veterans' organisation gave him wide influence. In his first televised address to the nation last night he promised to follow Mr Boudiaf's path 'whatever the price and sacrifice.'</p>

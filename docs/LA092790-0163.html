			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "The Crimson Pirate" (1952), directed by Robert Siodmak. 104 minutes. No  rating.  </P> <P> A spoof of all those Errol Flynn pirate movies. The pirates say "Arrrgh!" a lot  and tend to get their peg-legs stuck in the grills over the hatches. And this  time it's Burt Lancaster who gets to be gallant as hell. MIKE FLAGG  </P></p>

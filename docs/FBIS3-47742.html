Larson,  commander-in-chief of US Pacific Command, arrived here on Sunday  for a three-day visit to Vietnam. He is the most senior US  active-duty officer to visit since the end of the Vietnam War in  1975.    Larson's visit is aimed at getting more first-hand  information about Vietnam and about the MIA issue.    Yesterday afternoon, Admiral Larson and his entourage were  received by Vietnamese Deputy Minister of Defence Nguyen Thoi  Bung who reaffirmed that Vietnam regarded, the MIA issue as a  humanitarian one. `No matter how', said Deputy Minister Bung,  `the relations between the United States and Vietnam are  developing, Vietnam would always actively cooperate with the US  in the MIA issue'.</p>

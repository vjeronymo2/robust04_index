			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK satellite TV producers will be urged to include majority of European broadcasting MR PETER BROOKE, national heritage secretary, will tell UK satellite television operators next week to move to include a majority of European programming in their broadcasts. Mr Brooke gave warning of the move yesterday in the first two-yearly report to the European Commission on the European content of UK broadcasts. Mr Brooke will write to broadcasters asking why they have not met the requirements. British Sky Broadcasting, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times has a stake, is likely to be among those receiving letters.</p>

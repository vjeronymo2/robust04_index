			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 5 (CNA) -- The manufacturing industry's  investment willingness, a leading economic indicator, remained  sluggish in the first quarter of 1994, the Ministry of Economic  Affairs' Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) said Thursday [5  May].    IDB statistics show that the number of newly established  enterprises hit 1,413 during the period, up 1.9 percent over the  same period last year.    The aggregate registered capital of these new companies,  however, decreased 26.8 percent to NT [new Taiwan dollars] $18.6  billion (US$701.88 million).    The figures pointed to a slowdown in the growth of  large-size  enterprises, officials said.    Meanwhile, a total of 1,505 companies increased their  investment by NT$76 billion (US$2.86 billion) in the three-month  period, down 60.3 percent from a year ago.    The officials noted that both new investments and capital  increments have been on the decline since January 1993. The  whole year of 1993 saw a 35.45 percent drop in manufacturing  investment growth, they added.    Investment growth reached a peak of 40 percent in 1992 after  four consecutive years of growth, they said.    IDB Director-General Yin Chi-ming pledged that the bureau  will keep a close watch on the continued slump in domestic  manufacturers' investment willingness.</p>

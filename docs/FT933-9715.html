			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Books: Late-Victorian literati - The fin de siecle poets who gathered at the Cheshire Cheese LONDON IN THE 1890s: A CULTURAL HISTORY by Karl Beckson W W Norton Pounds 19.95, 455 pages PURITANS first began to give their children 'virtue' names - Faith, Hope, Charity - in Elizabethan England. For boys the virtue name that came into favour as appropriate to the Empire-building Victorian male in the last quarter of the 19th century was Ernest - an English form of the German Ernst, 'earnestness, vigour'. Apart from Wilde's pair of Ernests, revealing the precise opposite of these attributes, there were two notable Ernests in real life among the literati. Ernest Rhys and Ernest Dowson were both members of The Rhymers' Club, fin de siecle poets who met periodically at the Cheshire Cheese in Fleet Street to recite their verses while quaffing ale. These meetings and the anthologies the Rhymers published are rescued from oblivion in this informative book on literary movements in London at the end of the Victorian period by the American scholar Karl Beckson, professor of English at Brooklyn College. The name quite suited Rhys, to whom we owe that earnest publishing venture, Everyman's Library; it still survives and last year celebrated its 100th anniversary with many new volumes. Ernest did not work quite so well as a name for Dowson. His claim to posthumous fame is that he wrote 'Cynara' - a poem that recalls his debauched experiences with a prostitute ('I have forgot much Cynara] . . . Flung roses, riotously with the throng;/ Dancing to put thy pale lost lilies out of mind . . .'). But we remain indebted to him too. His poem provided Margaret Mitchell with the title for her novel Gone With The Wind; and its line 'I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion . . .' gave Cole Porter the refrain for one of his best numbers in Kiss Me Kate. Dowson's sentiments epitomise not earnestness but decadence, one of the chief moods and modes of the period. Decadence was a devastating hurricane that blew across the Channel from France. If there were some Franco-sceptics among the men of letters of the 1890s who resisted it, most of them were committed to a common literary currency with their Gallic counterparts. They aspired to that 'de-regulation of all the senses' advocated by the likes of Verlaine, Rimbaud, Baudelaire. Beckson documents the progress of decadence as a reaction against industrialism and materialism; it gave rise to movements like aestheticism and symbolism, the precursors of Modernism. The development of Yeats, a leading member of the Rhymers' Club, sums this up. Oscar Wilde was not a member of the Rhymers' Club but he was a charter member of a closely associated society started by Yeats, the Southwark Irish Literary Club, some of whose meetings were hosted in the Cheshire Cheese by the Rhymers. Wilde delivered the death blow to Ernest as a virtue-name in his comedy. But, Beckson suggests, there was in the title a pun within a pun. Ernest is a play on a more esoteric term - Uranist - coined at this period by a German lawyer, Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, a homosexual who wrote books proving that homosexuality was congenital, hence natural. Wilde described his love of boys as Uranian. When, for instance, after prison he went to live with Bosie in Naples, he justified himself in a letter of 1898 to Robbie Ross like this: 'It is very unfair of people being horrid to me about Bosie and Naples. A patriot put in prison for loving his country loves his country, and a poet in prison for loving boys loves boys. To have altered my life would have been to have admitted that Uranian love is ignoble. I hold it to be noble - more noble than other forms.' Wilde was not the only gay poet to make a pun on Ernest and Uranist. In 1892 there appeared a volume of poems Love in Earnest by John Gambril Nicholson containing a sequence of 50 love-sonnets addressed to a 14-year-old boy. In The Importance . . . the joke is kept strictly under wraps, but occasionally it peeps out as when in Act II Gwendolen tells Cicely: 'The home seems to me to be the proper sphere for a man. And certainly once a man begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate does he not? And I don't like that. It makes men so very attractive.' Beckson is a bloodhound who sniffs out gay innuendo in the most unlikely parts of the text. Jack Worthing tells Lady Bracknell that his house in Belgrave Square is let to Lady Bloxham. Beckson points out that Bosie had a young friend up at Oxford, John Francis Bloxom, who edited a Uranian magazine The Chameleon to which Wilde contributed a series of 'Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young' and to which Bloxom, under the pseudonym X, contributed a story about a pederastic Roman Catholic priest and his altar-boys. The magazine did not survive its first issue. It may give point to Lady Bracknell's observation that Lady Bloxham's advanced age 'was no guarantee of respectability'. Beckson deals with many ephemeral anthologies of this kind as well as those well-known ones, The Yellow Book and The Savoy, embellished with Beardsley's decadent homoerotic illustrations. There was bound to be a backlash and it came not just with Wilde's downfall but with the publication in 1895 in translation from the German of Max Nordau's study Degeneration. Nordau equated decadence with degeneration, seeing them both as a kind of criminality inherent in certain types and races - and we all know what that unfortunate theory led to. The book's sentiments were echoed by anti-decadents like the poet WE Henley, an influential editor and friend of RL Stevenson. Then Shaw instigated a backlash against the backlash in his essay 'A Degenerate's View of Nordau', later published in a revised form as The Sanity of Art. What is remarkable about Beckson's study - apart from its wealth of learning - is its revelation of how many of the crucial concerns of art and literature in our own period originated in the 1890s.</p>

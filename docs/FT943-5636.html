			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Amcor advances to ADollars 336.9m and increases yearly dividend Profits at Amcor, the Australian paper and packaging group, rose to ADollars 336.9m (USDollars 250m) from ADollars 266.9m in the year to end-June, after tax but before abnormal charges. The company said the advance reflected improved results across its operations, and came despite highly competitive markets. However, bottomline results were marred by abnormal items, which included a charge of ADollars 80.3m, mainly covering restructuring costs flowing from the APPM acquisition last year, and goodwill write-offs. In the previous year, Amcor enjoyed a ADollars 48m abnormal surplus, so profits after tax and abnormals fell to ADollars 256.6m from ADollars 314.9m. Sales for the year were up to ADollars 5.55bn from ADollars 4.82bn, and earnings per share before abnormals and on a fully-diluted basis increased by 19.7 per cent, to 56.4 cents. In the containers packaging division, sales were up by 12.3 per cent to ADollars 1.79bn, while operating profits rose to ADollars 203.9m, from ADollars 200.8m. Amcor said the result was good, given 'the extensive rationalisation and other structural changes in the industry sectors in which containers operate'. Amcor Fibre Packaging saw sales rise to ADollars 1.78bn from ADollars 1.53bn, while profits were ADollars 141.9m, against ADollars 111.1m last time. On the paper side, Amcor Paper Group produced a 9.4 per cent operating profit gain, at ADollars 177.4m, with sales climbing by 28 per cent to ADollars 1.15bn. Interest charges fell to ADollars 63.8m from ADollars 75.1m, and the group's capital and acquisition expenditure during the year topped ADollars 1.1bn, compared with ADollars 708m previously. The dividend for the year is 34 cents, up from 31 cents, with a final of 2 cents higher at 18 cents. Burns Philp, the Sydney-based company which has been building up its food ingredients business aggressively in recent months, yesterday announced after-tax profits of ADollars 123m in the year to end-June, up from ADollars 110.1m last time. Operating earnings, before interest and tax were 14 per cent higher at ADollars 219.8m, while sales were ADollars 2.79bn, compared with ADollars 2.68bn previously. Earnings per share, on a fully-diluted basis, increased by 6 per cent to 27.6 cents.</p>

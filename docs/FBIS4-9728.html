			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Eugenia Mondragon] </F>   [Text] The number of Guadalajara voters who will vote for  the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] in the August  presidential elections increased from 49.2 percent to 64.6  percent, according to a poll carried out by the Opinion Studies  Center (CEO) the day after Luis Donaldo Colosio was murdered.  CEO Director Cesar Morones Services explained that due to a lack  of time, the poll was to find out what the citizens' state of  mind was following Colosio's murder. The survey was only  conducted in Guadalajara and not in the 13 cities of Jalisco  initially planned.    The survey results showed that the 49.2 percent of the  people  who would vote for PRI increased to 64.6 percent. In contrast,  the 11.4 percent of the people who would vote for the PRD [Party  of the Democratic Revolution] dropped to 6.1 percent. The people  who would vote for PAN [National Action Party] increased from  15.0 percent to 17.3 percent.  <H5>  A Voluble Judgment </H5>   Morones Servin explained that the results do not predict  what  will happen in the 21 August elections, but they do reflect the  way the people felt at the time they were polled in the street.  "The citizens' opinion can change when they get to the ballot  boxes," he said.    According to the poll, 12.7 percent of the people in  Guadalajara believe the PRI is guilty of Luis Donaldo Colosio's  death; 14.4 percent say Mario Aburto killed him on his own; and  24.2 percent say they do not know. Although it was reported  yesterday that Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon is the PRI's new  presidential candidate, the citizens of Guadalajara favored  Manuel Camacho Solis as the proper person to replace Luis  Donaldo Colosio.    On a personal basis, Morones Servin said preference for the  PRI had increased in Guadalajara after Colosio's death because  "citizens voted in favor of the country's political stability."  He added: "Citizens reject any violence manifested in the  country." According to the poll, he added, support for the PRI  increases when violence occurs "so that it can guarantee what it  has given us for so many years: stability. Colosio left PRI  preferences very high and held a great gap between his candidacy  and that of his closest opponent." It is possible, however, for  the new candidate to change those conditions, he asserted.    The CEO, a decentralized organization of the University of  Guadalajara, held its first pre-electoral poll from 16 to 22  March. As a result of the 23 March events, some of the  information gathered by the CEO was superseded. Other  information, however, such as how many people want to vote, how  many have their photo ID's, and the degree of trust in the  electoral organizations remain valid.  <H5>  Poll in 13 Cities </H5>   The CEO held its first poll in 13 cities: Mexico City,  Guadalajara, Monterrey, Tijuana, Ciudad Juarez, Villahermosa,  Hermosillo, Culiacan, Morelia, Veracruz, Acapulco, Torreon, and  Puebla. The CEO considers these cities to represent 32 percent  of the country's total population, that is, one out of every  three citizens in the republic had the possibility of being  polled. This makes the survey very representative.    In those 13 cities, 78.6 percent said they would vote in the  upcoming elections; 8.5 percent said they would not vote; and  10.0 percent have still not decided. This shows people are very  interested in participating. If this is the case, abstentionism  will be surmounted. Of the total number of people polled, 81.7  percent said they already had their photo ID's and 15.2 percent  said they did not have them. Regarding the people who said they  did not have their ID's, 41.3 percent said they were being  processed but they had not received it yet; 23.8 percent said  they had not requested their cards; and 9.5 percent had not  picked the card up yet.    Regarding the degree of trust that the upcoming elections  will be honest, 45.5 percent said they did not believe in  electoral honesty; 20.7 said they did; and 27.8 percent did not  know. Asked if foreign observers would give the electoral  process more security and credibility, 54.1 percent said no;  29.6 percent said probably; and only 14.3 percent said yes.  Opinions on the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) were divided  because 37.3 percent do not believe it is a trustworthy  organization; 34.3 percent do; and 26.4 percent did not answer.    With regard to the main national problem that the next  president will have to attend, 23.8 percent said it was to  improve the people's purchasing power; 21.0 percent considered  it to be increasing the number of jobs; 14.2 percent said the  main problem to be confronted was to have clean elections; and  16.8 percent believed it was the quality and quantity of  education. The opinions of the people polled were even more  divided with regard to the personal characteristics a  presidential candidate should have. Most of the people polled  (32.4 percent) said he has to be responsible; 20.9 percent said  intelligent; 22.2 percent said honest; 3.0 percent said  intelligent [as published]; 3.9 said he has to be a peacemaker;  5.0 percent said strong; and 7.1 percent did not answer. All of  this data, said Morones Servin, is subject to "natural"  variations. The CEO, however, will conduct six more polls to  survey the citizens' feelings. The results of the last poll will  be announced on 15 August.</p>

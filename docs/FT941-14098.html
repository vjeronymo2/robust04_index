			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers held back by Dollars 500m pre-tax charge Bristol-Myers Squibb, the US drugs group, has taken a Dollars 500m pre-tax charge to cover a possible settlement of breast implant claims, cutting into fourth-quarter earnings which were otherwise much in line with expectations. The company said it expected its share of a proposed Dollars 4.75bn global settlement of claims over leaking breast implants to reach Dollars 1.5bn, Dollars 1bn of which would be covered by insurance payments. The extent of its insurance coverage is still the subject of litigation, Bristol-Myers said, though it added that it believed it would eventually receive more than Dollars 1bn. Leaving aside this charge and a one-off item the year before, fourth-quarter earnings reached Dollars 566m or Dollars 1.10 a share, up 7 per cent from the corresponding period last year. The results reflect a 6 per cent increase in sales to Dollars 2.99bn. in the latest period, in line with expectations. The company said it had not experienced any moves by drug wholesalers to reduce their inventory. This was blamed by Pfizer the day before for its sales slow-down. The Pfizer news surprised Wall Street and had sent the shares of all drug companies lower on fears that drug pricing was coming under greater pressure than expected. For the year, Bristol-Myers' drug sales, which contributed about 55 per cent to revenues of Dollars 11.4bn, rose 3 per cent. Other areas were slightly ahead, though sales of consumer products fell 1 per cent, in part as a result of increased competition in the US. Fourth-quarter net income of American Home Products, the US drugs and healthcare group, was Dollars 382m or Dollars 1.23 a share, up from Dollars 361m or Dollars 1.16. Full-year net income rose to Dollars 1.47bn or Dollars 4.73 a share from Dollars 1.37bn or Dollars 4.36 before one-off charges and accounting adjustments in 1992. Total sales during the quarter rose nearly 6 per cent, to Dollars 2.1bn, buoyed by a 13 per cent rise in consumer healthcare products, to Dollars 1.7bn.</p>

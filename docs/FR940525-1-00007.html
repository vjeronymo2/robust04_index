			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Related Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of these proposed regulation changes, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timing of provider reminder letters, PS&amp;R Summary Reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the submission of HCRIS data would also be affected. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan to revise the Intermediary Manual and the PRM as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to reflect these changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Reminder Letters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because we are proposing to lengthen the amount of time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a provider has to file its cost report, we also would change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the deadline for the intermediaries to send reminder letters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to providers to notify them that cost reports are due. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised deadline would be by the end of the fourth month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the close of the cost reporting period. The reminder  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letter may be sent at the same time an intermediary sends  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the PS&amp;R Summary Report to the providers, but an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediary may not send the reminder letter before sending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the PS&amp;R Summary Report. The reminder letter will inform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provider that if the cost report is not received by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end of the fifth month after the close of the cost reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, the provider's interim payments will be suspended in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their entirety the following day, rather than just reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (as the Intermediary Manual now provides). Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;405.371(d), if a provider does not furnish necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information that is needed to determine the amounts due the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider under the Medicare program, interim payments may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspended immediately. In addition, under &sect;405.376(e)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest will be assessed immediately in the case of a cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report that is not filed on time. However, given the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended filing deadline, we believe that providers should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have little difficulty in filing timely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. PS&amp;R Summary Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In conjunction with the change in the cost report due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dates, we also intend to revise our Manual instructions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extend the time that HCFA allows the intermediaries to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnish the PS&amp;R Summary Report to providers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Intermediaries would be required to furnish the PS&amp;R Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Report by the last day of the fourth month following the end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the provider's cost reporting period, instead of 60 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following the end of the provider's cost reporting period,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as is currently the practice. For cost reporting periods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ending on a day other than the last day of a month,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediaries would be required to furnish the PS&amp;R Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Report by the 120th day following the end of a provider's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost reporting period. As noted above, an intermediary must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> send the PS&amp;R Summary Report to a provider before or at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same time as it sends the reminder letter. (The reminder  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letter cannot be sent before the PS&amp;R Summary Report.) This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change would ensure that a provider still would have at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least 30 days after receipt of the PS&amp;R Summary Report to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete and submit the cost report to the intermediary. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provider receives the PS&amp;R Summary Report later than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last day of the fourth month (or the 120th day, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable) following the end of its cost reporting period,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provider would have 30 days from receipt to file its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. HCRIS Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Presently, the intermediary must submit HCRIS data to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA within either 180 days of the end of the hospital cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting period or 60 days of receipt of the cost report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the provider, whichever is later. The current 180-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadline is based on the following: (1) 90 days for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider to file its cost report, (2) 30 days for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extension of time to file (available to providers with good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause), and (3) an additional 60 days for the intermediary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to submit HCRIS data to HCFA. In conjunction with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed extension of the deadline for filing a cost report,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we would revise the Intermediary Manual to instruct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediaries to submit HCRIS data to HCFA within 210 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the last day of the hospital cost reporting period. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new deadline is based on the following: (1) 150 days for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filing a cost report and (2) 60 days for submission of HCRIS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data to HCFA. The 30-day extension of time to file a cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report would be eliminated. As explained above, extensions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be granted only under extraordinary circumstances, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore an additional 30 days for a filing extension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normally would not be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we plan to revise our Manual instructions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to specify that if the intermediary is late in sending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PS&amp;R Summary Report to the providers, the amount of time for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the intermediary to submit the HCRIS data would be reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the same number of days the PS&amp;R Summary Report was late.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, if the intermediary sends the PS&amp;R Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Report to the provider 10 days late, the provider would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still have 30 days from receipt of the PS&amp;R Summary Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to file its cost report. However, the time remaining for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the intermediary to submit the HCRIS data would be reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a corresponding 10 days (that is, from 60 to 50 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following receipt of the cost report.) In such cases, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediary still would have a total of 210 days from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end of the hospital cost reporting period to submit HCRIS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data to HCFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained above, the overall effect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extension of the time frame for providers to file cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports would be that HCFA would not have access to updated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCRIS data until 210 days after the end of a given cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting period. This change would not delay significantly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the availability of the analytical files (which are updated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarterly) in HCRIS, and it should improve the accuracy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial cost report data. Although it would delay the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability in the analytical files of cost report data for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the most recent cost reporting period, it would not affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of a complete set of cost report data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the current requirements for intermediaries to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmit cost report data extracts, a complete set of cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report data for any Federal fiscal year is not available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until 180 days after the latest cost reporting period in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal fiscal year. For example, if a provider's cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting period begins on September 1, 1993 and ends on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 31, 1994, its cost report extract now would be due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA by February 27, 1995 (180 days after the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost reporting period). The data would be available for use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the next quarterly update of the analytical files, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would take place on March 31, 1995. In this case, under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed provisions, we would extend the due date for HCRIS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submissions from 180 days after the hospital cost reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period ends to within 210 days of the last day of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's cost reporting period. Thus, in the above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, the cost report extract of a provider with a cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting period ending August 31, 1994, would be due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA by March 29, 1995. The data from this provider's file  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still would be available for use in the March 31, 1995  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> update of the analytical files.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Good engineering practice provides that public sidewalks be both paved and separated, either horizontally or vertically, from adjoining roadways. While this may be a more accurate technical definition of public sidewalk, these guidelines are intended also to cover pedestrian walkways that are not raised and separated, as for example, roadway shoulders in rural areas improved for pedestrian use. The definition of public sidewalk has therefore been modified to broaden its application to include such pedestrian routes. Walkways in public pedestrian easements have also been added. The word ``public'' has been added to clarify the distinction between sidewalks in the public right-of-way and those within sites. The appendix note has been expanded to provide other examples of public sidewalks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM defined continuous passage as ``[a] continuous unobstructed pedestrian circulation path within a sidewalk connecting pedestrian areas, elements, and facilities covered by section 14.'' Several commenters asked if an accessible route was required on public sidewalks or if the continuous passage was required to meet provisions for an accessible route.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of continuous passage has been amended to clarify that it is applied in the public right-of-way in lieu of an accessible route. Continuous passage is discussed further below and in appendix note A14.1.1. to differentiate between the requirements of an accessible route and the requirements of a continuous passage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed ADAAG 14.5 (Curb Ramps and Other Sloped Areas) required curb ramps or other sloped areas where pedestrian walkways cross barriers at streets. ``Other sloped areas'' is found in the Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA (28 CFR 35.150(d)(2)) and applies to elevation changes within public sidewalks at street crossings that are not accomplished by means of a curb ramp. Several commenters requested clarification of the term ``other sloped areas.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ADAAG 14.5 has been moved to ADAAG 14.2.4 (Public Sidewalk Curb Ramps) and a new definition for ``Public Sidewalk Curb Ramps'' has been added to ADAAG 14.1.1. The definition describes perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramps, including diagonal public sidewalk curb ramps, and parallel public sidewalk curb ramps and clarifies that these are alternative means of achieving the transition between curb height and street crossing. Although ADAAG currently contains a definition and technical provisions for curb ramps on sites, public sidewalk curb ramps must meet different requirements. For example, public sidewalk curb ramps in a public right-of-way are required to have level landings. Language was added to the definition of Curb Ramp in 3.5 (Definitions) referencing Public Sidewalk Curb Ramps. The phrase ``parallel public sidewalk curb ramp'' has been substituted for ``other sloped areas.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters requested a definition of vehicular way. Other commenters asked if bicycles were considered vehicles and whether bikeways, which are sometimes shared by pedestrians, were to be considered vehicular ways.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Vehicular way is defined in ADAAG 3.5 (Definitions). Under the Uniform Vehicle Code, bicyclists are considered motorists. When using a public sidewalk, however, a bicyclist has the same rights and duties as a pedestrian (Uniform Vehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance, Article XII, National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, Revised 1992). If pedestrian use is intended, a bicycle path in the public right-of-way must comply with the requirements for public sidewalks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed a definition of site infeasibility adapted from the definition of technical infeasibility in ADAAG 4.1.6(1)(j). Most commenters supported both the necessity for and the definition of site infeasibility in the NPRM. One commenter asked for a clarification of the difference between extremes of terrain discussed in the NPRM and structural impracticability due to unique characteristics of terrain, described in the preamble to the Department of Justice final regulation implementing title III of the ADA. (56 FR 35577). A FHWA region recommended that constraints arising from common practice in the geometric design of certain street and highway structures, such as bridges and tunnels, be specifically included as examples of site infeasibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Site infeasibility is intended to be the basis for exceptions to new construction guidelines for additions and alterations in the public right-of-way. This definition has been clarified by substituting the phrase ``site development conditions'' for ``physical or site constraints'' in the NPRM. Extremes of terrain are recognized in both new construction and alterations provisions by permitting public sidewalks to take the running slope of adjacent roadways without invoking an exception. Thus, steeply sloping terrain is not in itself grounds for a finding of site infeasibility. Rather, it is adjacent development and constrained right-of-way width that give rise to exceptions for site infeasibility. Where newly-constructed bridges and tunnels are intended to carry pedestrian traffic, they must incorporate public sidewalks that meet section 14 provisions. This is further discussed at ADAAG 14.2.5(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2&blank;New Construction: Minimum Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section addresses the minimum requirements for new construction. An appendix note provides examples of new construction and emphasizes that it requires a high degree of accessibility and usability in pedestrian public right-of-way improvements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> State and local departments of public works, members of the site planning and engineering professions, and individuals with disabilities and the organizations that represent them recommended that the final rule distinguish between new construction and alterations. Most jurisdictions were concerned that the proposed guidelines were too restrictive for alterations. Commenters noted that provisions limiting cross slope, requiring level landings at public sidewalk curb ramps, or specifying counter slope at street crossings could be achieved in new construction but not in every alteration. Persons with disabilities and organizations representing them commented that the number of exceptions provided in the NPRM to accommodate existing conditions could also be used to excuse compliance in new construction. For example, one commenter noted that although all accessibility standards require that new public sidewalk curb ramps be constructed to the least possible slope, most exceed the 1:12 maximum permitted slope. On the other hand, as noted by one engineer, guidelines that are overly stringent may discourage implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim final rule has been reorganized to distinguish between new construction and alterations. The exceptions previously permitted in new construction have been moved to ADAAG 14.3 (Alterations), which has been expanded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

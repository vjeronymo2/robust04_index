			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Congolese Prime Minister Joachim Yhombi-Opango held  a news conference in Paris this morning. He said he was hopeful  about finding a solution to the country's chronic violence.  Mohammed Youssoufou Saliou has the details.    [Begin Saliou recording] The prime minister was serene and  determined at all costs to get his country out of the vicious  circle of violence. He essentially said there was cause to be  hopeful about the country's situation. He was optimistic that a  solution would be found to the differences that exist between  the Union for Democratic Renewal-Congolese Labor Party Alliance  and the presidential group.    Regarding the thorny issue of the retrieval of illegally  distributed weapons in Brazzaville, he said plainly that, since  the beginning of the crisis, Brazzaville had become the dumping  ground for Zairian arms trafficking. Furthermore, he said that  80 percent of common-law prisoners in Congo were Zairians. The  victory of peace in Congo will be ephemeral if there is no peace  or national reconciliation in Zaire. He said he hoped,  therefore, that peace would be restored in Zaire.    Answering several questions on cooperation between France  and  Congo, and especially cooperation with the French petroleum  company, Elf, the prime minister said nothing clouded relations  between Paris and Brazzaville and, even less so, relations with  Elf. He strongly maintained that, on the contrary, relations  between the two countries were stronger, more profound, and  deeply rooted. [end recording]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart M_[Amended]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Appendix A is added to subpart M to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix A to Subpart M_Interpretive Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Governing Roof Removal Operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> I. Applicability of the Asbestos NESHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.1. Asbestos-containing material (ACM) is material containing more than one percent asbestos as determined using the methods specified in appendix A, subpart F, 40 CFR part 763, section 1, Polarized Light Microscopy. The NESHAP classifies ACM as either ``friable'' or ``nonfriable''. Friable ACM is ACM that, when dry, can be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure. Nonfriable ACM is ACM that, when dry, cannot be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.2. Nonfriable ACM is further classified as either Category I ACM or Category II ACM. Category I ACM and Category II ACM are distinguished from each other by their potential to release fibers when damaged. Category I ACM includes asbestos-containing gaskets, packings, resilient floor coverings, resilient floor covering mastic, and asphalt roofing products containing more than one percent asbestos. Asphalt roofing products which may contain asbestos include built-up roofing; asphalt-containing single ply membrane systems; asphalt shingles; asphalt-containing underlayment felts; asphalt-containing roof coatings and mastics; and asphalt-containing base flashings. ACM roofing products that use other bituminous or resinous binders (such as coal tars or pitches) are also considered to be Category I ACM. Category II ACM includes all other nonfriable ACM, for example, asbestos-cement (A/C) shingles, A/C tiles, and transite boards or panels containing more than one percent asbestos. Generally speaking, Category II ACM is more likely to become friable when damaged than is Category I ACM. The applicability of the NESHAP to Category I and II ACM depends on: (1) the condition of the material at the time of demolition or renovation, (2) the nature of the operation to which the material will be subjected, (3) the amount of ACM involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.3. Asbestos-containing material regulated under the NESHAP is referred to as ``regulated asbestos-containing material'' (RACM). RACM is defined in &sect;61.141 of the NESHAP and includes: (1) friable asbestos-containing material; (2) Category I nonfriable ACM that has become friable; (3) Category I nonfriable ACM that has been or will be sanded, ground, cut, or abraded; or (4) Category II nonfriable ACM that has already been or is likely to become crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder. If the coverage threshold for RACM is met or exceeded in a renovation or demolition operation, then all friable ACM in the operation, and in certain situations, nonfriable ACM in the operation, are subject to the NESHAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> A. Threshold Amounts of Asbestos-Containing Roofing Material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.A.1. The NESHAP does not cover roofing projects on single family homes or on residential buildings containing four or fewer dwelling units. 40 CFR 61.141. For other roofing renovation projects, if the total asbestos-containing roof area undergoing renovation is less than 160 ft <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , the NESHAP does not apply, regardless of the removal method to be used, the type of material (Category I or II), or its condition (friable versus nonfriable). 40 CFR 61.145(a)(4). However, EPA would recommend the use of methods that damage asbestos-containing roofing material as little as possible. EPA has determined that where a rotating blade (RB) roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material, the removal of 5580 ft <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  of that material will create 160 ft <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  of RACM. For the purposes of this interpretive rule, ``RB roof cutter'' means an engine-powered roof cutting machine with one or more rotating cutting blades the edges of which are blunt. (Equipment with blades having sharp or tapered edges, and/or which does not use a rotating blade, is used for ``slicing'' rather than ``cutting'' the roofing material; such equipment is not included in the term ``RB roof cutter''.) Therefore, it is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material, any project that is 5580 ft <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  or greater is subject to the NESHAP; conversely, it is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material in a roof removal project that is less than 5580 ft <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , the project is not subject to the NESHAP, except that notification is always required for demolitions. EPA further construes the NESHAP to mean that if slicing or other methods that do not sand, grind, cut or abrade will be used on Category I nonfriable ACM, the NESHAP does not apply, regardless of the area of roof to be removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.A.2. For asbestos cement (A/C) shingles (or other Category II roofing material), if the area of the roofing material to be removed is at least 160 ft <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  and the removal methods will crumble, pulverize, reduce to powder, or contaminate with RACM (from other ACM that has been crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder) 160 ft <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  or more of such roofing material, the removal is subject to the NESHAP. Conversely, if the area of the A/C shingles (or other Category II roofing materials) to be removed is less than 160 ft <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , the removal is not subject to the NESHAP regardless of the removal method used, except that notification is always required for demolitions. 40 CFR 61.145(a). However, EPA would recommend the use of methods that damage asbestos-containing roofing material as little as possible. If A/C shingles (or other Category II roofing materials) are removed without 160 ft <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  or more of such roofing material being crumbled, pulverized, reduced to powder, or contaminated with RACM (from other ACM that has been crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder), the operation is not subject to the NESHAP, even where the total area of the roofing material to be removed exceeds 160 ft <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ; provided, however, that if the renovation includes other operations involving RACM, the roof removal operation is covered if the total area of RACM from all renovation activities exceeds 160 ft <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> the definition of regulated asbestos-containing material (RACM), 40 CFR 61.141.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.A.3. Only roofing material that meets the definition of ACM can qualify as RACM subject to the NESHAP. Therefore, to determine if a removal operation that meets or exceeds the coverage threshold is subject to the NESHAP, any suspect roofing material ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> roofing material that may be ACM) should be tested for asbestos. If any such roofing material contains more than one percent asbestos and if the removal operation is covered by the NESHAP, then EPA must be notified and the work practices in &sect;61.145(c) must be followed. In EPA's view, if a removal operation involves at least the threshold level of suspect material, a roofing contractor may choose not to test for asbestos if the contractor follows the notification and work practice requirements of the NESHAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

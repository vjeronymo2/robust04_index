			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Observer: A pip squeaks The debate over whether Lord Healey ever threatened to 'squeeze the rich until the pips squeak' rumbles on. Healey has denied it on page 369 of his memoirs but the phrase still niggles some old hands who were around the last time that a Labour party was on the brink of power, 20 years ago. Could it be that Lord Healey made the remark  - not an original one as it was used against the Germans after the Treaty of Versailles  - off the record? Then he would never have said it . . . officially.</p>

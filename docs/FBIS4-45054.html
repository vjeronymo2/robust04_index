			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Over 700 Said To Have Been Killed </F> Since Mid-March"]    [Text] After a few weeks of relative calm, attacks by  Islamist armed groups resumed, killing at least 15 members of  the security forces during the last 10 days. Most of these  attacks were reported in the local press but not confirmed  officially. This new outbreak of terrorism follows intensified  repression operations in all of Algeria since mid-March.    According to a nonofficial estimate made by the AFP, over  600  alleged Islamists, some 30 members of the security forces and  over 100 civilians (including six foreigners: four Frenchmen,  one Russian, and one Vietnamese) were killed during that period.  That is a total of over 700 dead. The offensive of the security  forces is said to account for the lack of progress of the  "dialogue" with imprisoned leaders of the banned Islamic  Salvation Front [FIS] initiated late last year by the government.    Although many believe that these contacts continue, the  government does not seem in a hurry to meet the demands of the  Islamist movement. The latter demands, among other things, that  its leaders be released or put on probation, and it asks for a  speedy return to the electoral process. A few days from the Aid  El Adha (Feast of the Sacrifice), which will be celebrated next  Saturday, the recurring rumor of a possible release of  banned-FIS leaders, including Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, is  circulating again. So far, however, there is no indication that  the government is planning any gesture of clemency.    Simultaneously with intensified military repression, special  courts have pronounced several tens of new death sentences since  the beginning of May. Last Sunday, the Algiers and Oran special  courts alone sentenced 34 individuals to capital punishment.  These verdicts bring to 489 the number of death sentences  pronounced since special courts took office on 22 February 1993.  So far, 26 of these sentences have been carried out.    The development of the Algerian crisis was debated at length  last Monday in Brussels by the European Union (EU) foreign  affairs ministers. To try and prevent an "Islamic swing over"  that would have "incalculable consequences," "the only card we  can play is the economic card," the French foreign affairs  minister, Alain Juppe, stated. As a result, on Monday 16 May,  the foreign affairs ministers agreed to immediately grant  Algeria a loan of 150 million ECUs [European currency units]  (990 million French francs), representing the second installment  of a balance-of-payment support loan promised in 1991. The  Twelve also agreed to consider a new loan of 200 million ECUs  (also in the form of a balance-of-payment support loan) by the  end of the year, subject to a favorable decision by the IMF and  the Paris Club.</p>

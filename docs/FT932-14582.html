			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Travel Focus, Italy: Sunstruck Puglia, home of Horace THE WORDS my schoolmaster once used when none of us knew what he meant - 'Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny' - now come back to me whenever I look at a map of Puglia. There it is: 240 miles of rugged, gorgeous, sun-struck earth, with its very own 'heel' in the Gargano peninsula and its own 'toe' below, in the curling tip of land from Otranto on the east to Gallipoli on the west. 'Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Andrews minor - give me an example.' Sir? Back then, aged 10, I was flummoxed or day-dreaming. Now I might lob Puglia at him as an impertinent geographical illustration. The development of the individual (Puglia) recapitulates the development of the species (southern Italy). And not just in appearances. Puglia in its time has been over-run by every ragged army that ever set bruising foot on Italy's larger foot. Greeks, Saracens, Normans and Spanish left calling-cards: from bits of old temple to the mini-casbahs of Bari, from Norman cathedrals (Trani) to Spanish-baroque churches. Meanwhile, the Swabians under Frederick II left a legacy of castles, notably the spectacular polygonal Castel Del Monte, resembling a giant threepenny bit on a hill. But the largest invasion force, in Puglia as in all Italy, has been tourists. They may be more merciful here than almost anywhere else. Still my advice is: retreat from the ports and beaches, avoid 'gateways to Greece' like Brindisi, and enjoy the hinterland of olive-tree-dotted plains, wandering donkeys, sleepy sun-baked villages, grape-dressed tavernas, boundless vineyards and, above all, trulli. Trulli give southern Puglia its bizarre, knockout enchantment. Sometime between 2,000 and 1,000 BC - the travel books are vague - these cylindrical stone cottages with cone-shaped roofs first appeared in the area. The roofs themselves are topped with white crosses or other adornments. When the owner wants more room for himself, or his family, or his goats, or his television, he knocks down a wall and attaches another stone cylinder plus cone roof plus cross (or star or sickle or satellite dish). Result: south-central Puglia can look like Disneyland gone delirious. If you are hurried, Alberobello is the place to visit for a definitive eyeful. Here the white-topped trulli cascade down the town's main hill. If you are unhurried - much better - get into a car and roam over the plains. Here the wacky edifices are in their natural, random habitat. You spin past the cone-homes from town to town, and southern Puglia really is worth covering entire. In clockwise order from Alberobello these should be your major points of call: Polignano sul Mare. Leave the car on the edge of town; thread the narrow medieval streets; peer over limestone cliffs into a rock-slapping sea. Then eat in the dining-room of the main hotel which looks out into a floodlit sea cavern. Ostuni. This hill village near the coast can snow-blind the unwary passer-by. A man-made cliff of dazzling white, Ostuni is composed of rearing town-walls flush with slit-eyed houses, of higgledy churches and piggledy towers. Note the splendid 18th century Spanish obelisk and the fulsome views from Largo Castello. Lecce. Showcase for baroque architecture. The soft local sandstone allowed 17th century Spanish-influenced chisel-masters to run amok. Enjoy not just the shapes of the churches and palaces but their colouring too: deepest honey mellowed by the sun. Otranto. Horace Walpole never slept here. His Gothic shocker, The Castle of Otranto, came straight from his imagination. Never mind. The town boasts its own grand guignol character and history, including an Archbishop who was sawn in half and 800 citizens who were decapitated, both in the wake of a 1480 AD Turkish siege; and it has its own haunting beauty: a glorious Romanesque cathedral, a craggy Aragonese castle. In the old port, linger romantically to enjoy the moon over the water. Gallipoli. Good beaches to the south. Martina Franca. Welcome back. You are now in trulli country again. Wander through this Moorish-flavoured town, feel its medieval heart, and then gaze from the 14th century town walls over the cone-roofs of the distant valley. The poet Horace, who studied his advocacy of wine and song during hours normally appointed for homework, was born in Apulia and knew what it was all about. It is the capital of the grape. It sluices Italy and much of western Europe with vino da tavola and sometimes even adds quality to quantity. Try Castel Del Monte: a fruity red with a hint of bucolic insouciance. Horace, if he lived today, might also sample the fish restaurants on the coast. And if the poet felt like a trip to the hills he could visit Selva di Fasano, where two majestic restaurants await. Fagiano's serves delicious goat meat and if you ask politely it will pour wild mushrooms over the regional pasta speciality, orechiette (little ears). Down the road is a pizzeria where the products emerge from the ovens spitting like volcanoes and waving tiny sage-leaves as surrender signals. Since sun-dried tomatoes and oil-soaked vegetables are also local favourites, you will probably realise that Puglia is a bit Greek. My theory is that it snapped off from western Greece thousands of years ago and drifted aimlessly across the Adriatic. It bumped into Italy during siesta hour and started attaching itself geologically and culturally. My schoolmaster once nodded vigorously at this theory when I put it to him. But then it was the end of term and he was hurrying to get away for his Italian holiday.</p>

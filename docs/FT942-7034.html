			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / BAe opposes US successor for Hercules British Aerospace stepped up pressure on the government yesterday to replace the Royal Air Force's ageing Hercules transport aircraft with European rather than US planes. If Britain ordered the US aircraft, said BAe, the UK could lose its place in a large European project and risked losing its leading position in aircraft wing design. Mr Dick Evans, BAe chief executive, said the Ministry of Defence should order the European Future Large Aircraft, which BAe is helping to develop, rather than the latest generation of Lockheed Hercules, the C-130J. The company has been lobbying the government directly, but concern that the wider industrial impact of the decision may be overshadowed by departmental budgetary issues has prompted companies including Rolls-Royce and Shorts of Belfast, to raise the subject in public. The MoD is deciding whether to replace half of its Hercules fleet with the new C-130J from 1997, or refurbish them while it waits for the FLA to become available around the year 2000. A decision is expected by the end of this year. Industry sources suggested that an early decision would favour Lockheed, and that if the FLA lost the order British involvement in the project would have to be scaled back. BAe called on the government to defer an immediate decision. The company said the FLA would have a much greater airlift capacity at a lower fleet-ownership cost. Mr Evans said the FLA would be able to carry 20 per cent more types of army equipment than the C-130J. Potential sales of the FLA are estimated by BAe at 400 to 700 aircraft, which would provide Pounds 5.5bn to Pounds 12.8bn worth of work to the UK. By comparison, BAe says that the C-130J would bring work estimated at Pounds 1.2bn to Pounds 2.2bn. Development costs of the FLA are thought to be about Pounds 2bn over a 10-year period, with 20 per cent being funded by the UK if it took a full part in the programme. Lockheed said the C-130J would meet fully the specification laid down by the MoD, and that the Commons defence committee had endorsed the idea of buying them.</p>

A draft resolution, endorsed by the council of the  State Duma, is to be presented at a plenary session.    The parliamentarians, while sharing the main provisions of  the presidential message, emphasise that the major task of the  State Duma is to provide "legislative support for the  development of an intergrated and stable democratic society"  where the rights of the individual and citizen are respected, an  effective economy functions, the principles of federal relations  are consistently exercised, and the rights of nations and  nationalities are assured".    Apart from considering a draft resolution, the Duma intends  to review the enactment of its resolution "On a legal basis for  elections to the state power bodies of the subjects of the  Russian Federation and local self-government bodies and on the  ensurance of the electoral rights of citizens."    The deputies are also expected to consider a bill "on a  procedure for the provision of military and civilian personnel  of the Russian federation for participation in peacekeeping  operations or in the restoration of international peace and  security and other types of peacemaking activities".    [Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 0915 GMT on 16 March adds  the  following: "The State Duma has again failed to adopt a  resolution concerning its stand with regard to President Boris  Yeltsin's message `On the State of the Nation' after several  days of discussion.    "In his message delivered at the end of February President  Yeltsin called for a stronger Russian state."]</p>

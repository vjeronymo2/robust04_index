			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Viktor Valentinov: "Our Politicians Forget </F> the Difference Between NATO Partners and NATO Members"]    [Text] Bulgaria was the eighth country to sign the  Partnership for Peace [PFP] Program, after Romania, Poland,, and  the Ukraine, but before the Czech Republic and Albania. People  at NATO headquarters praised our enthusiasm, but did not promise  that we would soon become full members.    At the same time people in the West are more and more  frequently launching the thesis that NATO's expansion to the  East is likely to obliterate the organization's image. It would  become a confederation rallying too many different interests,  which would make it similar to the fable of the eagle, the crab,  and the fish, each of which was trying to pull in a different  direction.    Bulgaria actually consented to partnership after Moscow and  Washington declared that NATO should gradually expand. Our  politicians, however, do not seem prepared to imagine what our  role within NATO is likely to be, while the signature under the  program, which has no definite form for the time being, might  also have some surprise in store. Clinton's proposal has not  yet been discussed by Congress, which might propose some  corrections to the president's views. Everything shows that  even people in the White House have no clear idea about what  NATO partnership should actually mean.    The number two at the State Department, Talbott, recently  said that the PFP should develop as a buffer between Russia and  Western Europe in the event Moscow becomes aggressive. Others  among Clinton's advisers see it as a step toward a collective  security system, without heeding Yeltsin's warning that former  Warsaw Pact members should not be admitted to NATO.    Our statesmen do not seem to be concerned about the lack of  clarity regarding partnership with NATO. They seem not to  realize that President Zhelev's signature under the program is  only the first, but not the last step toward our future  association with NATO. After the brilliant expose on the reasons  for our future association with NATO which was submitted in  Brussels and made an excellent impression, it is high time to  say how we imagine the future.    The Poles, for example, declared that they do not intend to  pay for the implementation of the initiative. This question did  not seem to concern us Bulgarians. Our politicians claim that  the rearmament of our troops according to NATO standards, would  not disastrously affect our military budget, but no arguments  and figures were submitted in this respect.    Bulgarian politicians reached some kind of consensus as  regards the necessity of accepting NATO's partnership offer, but  should they not have reflected on our country's future strategy  within the organization?    A wait-and-see policy might have achieved some success in  the  past, but it can hardly guarantee a place in the sun for us.  The other four countries from Central Europe are treated with  greater benevolence. They are eager to join NATO as full  members without standing in line for the PFP. It is not very  likely that people in Brussels are going to like them less,  because they only half-heatedly supported the idea, and  demonstratively sent lower-level delegations to sign the  document.    According to NATO, the PFP signatory countries should decide  for themselves to what extent they wish to be associated with  NATO. Bulgaria has not responded to this remark, so far. Our  politicians do not even mention the fact.    If we would like to have our share of the pie, would it not  be better to declare our intentions unmistakably, rather than  waiting for the others to assign us our place?    This is so, because in spite of Brussels' vehement  protestations in denying the existence of two speeds in progress  toward NATO -- one for the Visegrad four, and the other for the  remaining countries -- we should not forget that war is being  waged in our neighborhood and that precisely the guarantee for  our national security was our "leitmotif" in opting for NATO  partnership.</p>

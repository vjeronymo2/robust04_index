			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS ITS NON-BANKER S&amp;L NOMINEE  </P> <P> The White House today rejected Democratic criticism of its selection of  attorney T. Timothy Ryan Jr. to regulate the savings and loan industry, but  acknowledged it "had a little trouble" finding a banker who would take the job.  </P> <P> At a confirmation hearing, Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee gave a  chilly reception to Ryan, questioning his ethics and lack of experience in  banking or savings and loans.  </P> <P> In response, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, "Frankly we've  had a little trouble finding people in the banking industry who want to take  this job.  </P> <P> "And also, frankly, I think it's not at all certain from the track record from  the S&amp;L industry that that's the best place to draw on expertise."  </P> <P> "I think the feeling here is, we need somebody who is a tough enforcer, who  knows how to go in there and get things done and clean up this mess and knows  how to use the law and use the resources at his command to crack some heads and  get things moving," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Ryan, 44, a former senior Labor Department official, now is a private attorney  specializing in pension and employee benefit law.  </P> <P> He told senators complaining about his lack of relevant experience that he was  surprised when Treasury Department officials approached him about the job about  four weeks ago.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Ryan replied, "Absolutely," when senators asked if he was fully  qualified to direct the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision,  which supervises 2,600 thrift institutions.  </P> <P> "I am not . . . an absolute expert on the thrift industry. I can tell you,  though, that in the last four weeks, I've spent an enormous amount of time  trying to educate myself," he said.  </P> <P> Ryan said he is an experienced manager of large organizations, citing his  1981-83 tenure as solicitor of the Labor Department where he managed 600  attorneys working in Washington and 16 field offices.  </P> <P> Despite their misgivings, senators are under intense pressure to confirm Ryan  quickly. President Bush nominated him March 22, hoping to blunt a  constitutional challenge that has put the Administration's S&amp;L bailout  program in limbo.  </P> <P> A U.S. district judge in Washington ruled last week that the acting director of  the thrift office, Salvatore Martoche, and his predecessor, M. Danny Wall,  lacked the constitutional authority to close failed thrifts because they were  never confirmed by the Senate.  </P> <P> The Banking Committee could vote on the nomination as soon as its next meeting  on April 3.  </P></p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Henlys confident of defeating Cowie bid HENLYS GROUP, the motor trader and bus and coach builder, yesterday said its main shareholders had not accepted the Pounds 32.1m hostile bid from T Cowie, the Sunderland-based motor dealer. The offer, which closes at 1pm today, is expected to be close. Over the weekend Cowie said its acceptances had increased to 33.76 per cent. After talking to its main shareholders, which include Guinness Mahon, Morgan Grenville Nominees, TSB Group and Standard Life Assurance Co, Henlys said it was confident of defeating Cowie's bid. Mr Robert Wood, chief executive of Henlys, said: 'Our feeling is that we expect the majority of the big institutions, which hold 60 per cent of the shares, to stay with us.' Cowie's bid has been helped by Mr David Matthews, former chairman and chief executive of Henlys who left the group last November. Mr Matthews is keen to buy Henlys' coach and bus business. Mr Wood said the majority of shares under Cowie's control comprise those pledged by Mr Matthews and his associates - including Peter Cundill Associates, the Canadian investment trust - and the 9.9 per cent Cowie bought for cash in the market last week.</p>

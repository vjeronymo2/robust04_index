			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 10 SAPA -- Former arch-enemies Cuban  leader Fidel Castro and South Africa's now Deputy President F W  de Klerk and the chief of the defence force, General Georg  Meiring, chatted amiably at lunch on Tuesday [10 May]. "Welcome  to South Africa," Mr de Klerk told the Cuban leader on being  introduced by President Nelson Mandela at his inauguration lunch  at the Presidensie. Mr Castro replied, through an interpreter,  "I hope you are successful". Mr de Klerk then introduced Mr  Castro to Gen Meiring. The two uniformed men both shook each  other's hands warmly.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Company finances could be hit by pensions solvency standard Sir, Barry Riley is quite right to point out that the proposed introduction of a minimum solvency standard for UK pension funds raises some very far reaching investment issues ('New benchmark worries UK pension funds', September 21). More than that, it has potentially enormous financial implications for employers. If pension funds switch investment away from equities towards bonds, based on long-term historical investment returns, the cost of pension provision will increase substantially. On the other hand, if pension funds retain their strong equity bias to maximise investment return, there is a risk that large amounts of additional cash will need to be found in the future, due to their failing the solvency test. It is encouraging that some of the implications of the proposed standard are now beginning to be recognised. However, I do not believe that the potentially highly damaging impact on the finances of British business has been considered sufficiently.

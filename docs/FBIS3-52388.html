On the festive anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ, son of  Mary, the word of God, the chosen servant, and the great divine  prophet, I congratulate all Christians, Muslims, and all those  with faith in his eminence, in particular the Christian  compatriots.    Armed with miracles and a divine call for human salvation  from the darkness of dualism, unbelief, ignorance, and injustice  to wisdom, justice, and divine worship, Jesus Christ was chosen  for a divine mission and throughout his presence among men, did  not hesitate for a moment to fight evil and call for good. Such  is the lesson that must be learned by Christians and Muslims --  who believe in the prophethood of his eminence.    Today more than ever, humanity needs such teachings, and  Islam, which completes the Christian tradition, has placed the  call for the good, worship, and excellence at the top of its  program.    Lost humanity, which has control over the endless power of  nature through the God-given knowledge, is now moving against  these very aims -- and this increases the responsibility of the  faithful.    The dominant powers and governments, under the pretext of  Christianity but in truth materialist and ignorant of the  teachings and traditions of His Holiness Christ, have made life  difficult for the innocent nations and peoples, and commit all  forms of injustice against them.    The most tragic of these examples can be found in the  present  condition of the world. These include the unprecedented  aggression of Serbs and Croats against the Bosnian Muslims and  the continued aggression of the Armenian Government against the  Azerbaijan Republic.    Undoubtedly the great powers, for many reasons, share the  responsibility for these bitter and tragic events.    I ask the Almighty to shine his light of guidance on  humanity  and to give victory to the forces of goodness, worship, and  justice against those of evil, ugliness, and suppression.    I should also thank my Christian compatriots for their  stance  regarding current events in the region and the world.    [Signed] Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i    [Dated] 3 January 1994</p>

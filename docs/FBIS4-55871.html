			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by correspondent </F> Robert Tamchyna in Lany; date not given; from the "Conversations  at Lany" program -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [Tamchyna] If you will permit, Mr. President, let  us begin today by casting our minds back to last week when the  international conference "Europe and Us" was held in Prague.  When I read excerpts from some of the speeches and  presentations there were of course some interesting moments and  even some idealistic notions, but in addition to that a degree  of uncertainty and apprehension about the question of the future  of a new, modern Europe and our role within it.    [Havel] I did not attend the entire conference, but from  what  I heard I get the impression that it was a very interesting and  important conference. There were some interesting personalities  here from all over Europe, some of whom I met and spoke to, and  for me the staging of the conference was a kind of signal to  consider certain things.    For example, I realized, and also said so when I was there  briefly at the conference, I realized that a temporary,  transitional phase had ended, not just in our country, but also  in others that have shaken off communism. We must bear in mind  the monolithic power that existed here and had at its disposal  all the instruments of power -- there was no system of political  plurality. When that power collapsed organizations grew up to  oppose it and sought a means of organized expression of their  will. That was the period of the big mass movements, such as  Solidarity in Poland or Civic Forum in our country, which  constituted a kind of improvised revolutionary counterbalance to  the ruling power. It was clear that that was merely a bridging  period leading to more normal political circumstances in which  the spectrum of political parties would become defined and in  which political parties would grow up around various programs.    For the first two years we lived through this truly  transitional phase, full of various anomalies that do not belong  to normal, stable democratic life, and it was a very important  period. Nowadays we sometimes have a tendency to make fun of it,  to turn our noses up at the whole period of revolutionary  euphoria and the idea of that kind of general understanding, but  I do not think that that is entirely fair. Let us remember that  that was the time when all the fundamental changes to the system  were made. That was the time when the character of our economic  reforms was agreed upon, when fundamental legislation was  passed, when the transformation of the entire legal system  began, and when we established ourselves on the international  scene as an independent country. But it was a period of  transition, to which I gave the working label of "post  communist," by which I wished to express its unusual character.    We have had two sets of free elections, we have normal,  structured political parties which compete for power in those  elections, and we are genuinely becoming, as far as all the  external signs of political life are concerned, a normal  democratic country. I think it is important to realize this, and  when our politicians are sometimes accused of being arrogant and  people say that we are always praising ourselves and that we are  somehow conceited, I think it is possibly a little unjust. We  are trying to truthfully reflect the situation and to persuade  others to keep up with the times, so to speak, and to realize  that we are genuinely further than we were at the beginning of  1990.    The above is not true just of the Czech Republic, which in  the table of indicators is doing relatively well, but also of  those neighboring countries where the fact that so-called  post-communist parties are winning elections is causing a  certain nervousness. I admit that that does not make me all  that nervous. I do not see in it any sign of a return to the  past or anything like that. I would prefer to see it as  precisely an expression of normality. That is how democracies  work, sometimes the left wins and sometimes the right, and we  have to become accustomed to that. [passage omitted]</p>

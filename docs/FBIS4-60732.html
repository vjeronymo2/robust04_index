			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 26 May (INA) -- AL-THAWRAH has questioned  the meaning of Washington's allocation in its foreign assistance  program of $3 billion to the Zionist entity and $2.1 billion to  the Egyptian regime.    In an article published today, the newspaper, organ of the  Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, said the declared and undeclared  U.S. assistance to the Zionist entity, whether the material,  military, or political assistance, emphasizes that their  relationship is not a provisional alliance but a deep and active  strategic alliance.    As for what Washington offers the Egyptian regime, it is no  more than an illusion and a lie. The paper adds: This  assistance to Mubarak's regime is not free, but aims to increase  Egypt's dependence and its involvement in policies and positions  that are totally against the Arab interest.    The newspaper emphasizes that the U.S. assistance to the  Mubarak regime amounts to no more than shackles to increase  dependence, and subsequently becoming led by the objectives and  designs of the United States in the region at the expense of the  Egyptian people, in the first place, and the Arab region and its  aspirations for liberation and progress.    The newspaper stresses that the Egyptian regime, which has  practiced all dirty means and declared its full bias toward  anything that serves the U.S. policy in the region, offered a  great deal in order to receive more assistance and sympathy.  This regime thought it was the first candidate to become the  favorite of the U.S. Administration. This regime intentionally  ignored the fact that Tel Aviv is not Cairo, and that in the  field of service or expertise, this regime is only a small  worker, who has a specific role that eventually serves the  Zionist interest.    Concluding its article, the newspaper asks: Are these people  aware of the swamp in which they have placed themselves?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report over video by unidentified reporter, including </F> recorded statements by peasant leader Felix Santos; Bolivian  Labor Federation leader Juan de la Cruz; and Bolivian Social  Communications Minister Ernesto Machicado -- recorded]    [Text] [Unidentified reporter] The initial evaluation of  the Bolivian Labor Federation, COB, and the General Trade Union  Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia, CSUTCB, shows that  a large number of peasants all over the country blocked various  highways in support for COB demands and also to draw the  administration's attention to their own petitions.    COB leader Juan de la Cruz and CSUTCB leader Felix Santos  stated that members of the two organizations participated in the  demonstrations but, in many cases, the sons of peasants who are  doing their military service prevented road blocks.    [Begin recording] [Santos] In Oruro the military (?cleared  the road blocks) in (Virauna), and many peasants reported that  the soldiers had their faces painted. The peasants recognized  several of their sons among the painted faces. It is very bad  for the peasants to see their children being used in such a  cowardly manner by the government. It is a pity that things  have gone so far.    [De la Cruz] We have confirmed information that three groups  of peasants totalling some 20,000 people are blocking roads in  Santa Cruz. In Cochabamba, especially in (Parotani) district,  along the Cochabamba-Oruro highway, and along the  Santacruz-Cochabamba highway through the Chapare region, there  are approximately 30,000 peasants blocking the roads. There are  also peasant roadblocks along the Oruro-La Paz highway in  Caracollo and Vila Vila, although the latter roadblock  reportedly has been cleared, the peasants are still  demonstrating along the highways. The same thing is happening  in Potosi, Tarija and Santa Cruz.    [Reporter] Meanwhile, workers have been demonstrating in  various departmental capitals, but police and military forces  prevented the demonstrators from reaching the downtown areas.  This led to clashes between workers and policemen. Some people  were injured and streets were destroyed. Social Communications  Minister Ernesto Machicado criticized the vandals, adding that  the demonstrations were politically motivated because they were  staged to secure the reelection of certain COB leaders at the  COB national congress scheduled to take place on 1 June.    [Machicado] It appears that there is a power struggle within  the COB which is getting ready for the elections at which the  new members of the executive board will be chosen. There are  several candidates and many people want to get elected to the  COB executive board. It is obvious that those who fight the  administration the most are likely to become the most acceptable  candidates. I think that this is what is going on. I believe  all this street violence and the strikes are part of a political  campaign, not a labor struggle.    [Reporter] The minister lamented that demonstrations staged  by COB leaders to serve their own interests are harming  everyone. [end recording]</p>

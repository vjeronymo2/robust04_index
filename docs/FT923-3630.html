			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Warning over economy MR Lars Jagren, economist at the Federation of Swedish Industries, said the large leap in interest rates would have a serious 'negative impact' on the Swedish economy. 'Even if the rates come down, it is unlikely they will come down to their previous level (of 13 per cent in the marginal rate) immediately.' He warned that the high rates will curb consumer demand - which is already weak - and probably lead to an increase in the number of bankruptcies, a rise in unemployment (currently at a historic high of 5.8 per cent) and a further decline in property prices. The impact is likely to be much greater on smaller companies than on the big groups, many of which are well insulated from the turbulence in Sweden because a high proportion of their income comes from abroad. Corporate Sweden was adopting an unconcerned attitude yesterday to the new high short-term interest rates. Indeed, there was overwhelming public support from the large private companies for the Central bank's drastic action. 'Sweden needs the large companies but the large companies don't really need Sweden any more,' explained Mr Marcus Storch, chief executive of Aga, the industrial gas group. Only about 10 per cent of his company's activities are within Sweden. 'We are little affected by what is happening in the Swedish market. Aga can live with the interest rates but I am less sure about our domestic customers.' For Sweden"s internationally renowned blue-chip companies like Volvo, Electrolux, Saab-Scania and Astra - the draconian domestic interest rates play little part in their calculations. 'The short-term interest rate rises have no impact at all on us,' said Mr Klaus Dahlback, chief executive of Investor, the largest Swedish investment company in the Wallenberg sphere of interest. 'We fully support the action the Central Bank has taken.' Some companies could make short-term gains from the high rates as long as they have liquid funds that can be used in the money markets. 'The short-term interest rates actually have a slightly positive effect on our business,' said Mr Staffan Ternby, vice-president at Astra. 'We have substantially more liquid funds than any interest bearing short-term liabilities'. Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive at Ericsson, the telecommunications giant, agreed. 'We are in a fortunate position with a good liquid cash situation. 'We can even gain in the short term from these high interest rates.' But he added that he supported the high interest rates as a 'warning signal to Sweden'. 'It is better for us to stick to the present exchange rate value.'</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAG-BURNING AMENDMENT  </P> <P> A constitutional amendment is not necessary to curb flag burning. A natural  deterrent already exists. Now that the people know that the laws and courts are  unable to protect them from the lunatic fringe, they will take matters into  their own hands with an exercise in civil disobedience. After a little pushing  and shoving around, the police will arrive and arrest the flag burners for  inciting a riot.  </P> <P> JOLLY F. GRIGGS  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

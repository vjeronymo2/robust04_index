			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Imre Pozsgay, chairman of the National </F> Democratic Federation, by Jozsef Peter; place and date not  given: "National Consensus Also in the Economy"]    [Text] [Peter] In the heat of the election campaign,  every party offers lower taxes and greater benefits to investors  and prospective voters. I presume you are doing the same. Is  there any original idea in the economic program of the National  Democratic Federation [NDSZ]?    [Pozsgay] Our program has two basic elements: One is the  starting of economic growth, the other is the protection of  domestic industry and production, and we will also contribute to  this with protectionist laws if necessary. This is not  something to hide at all. I visited the United States recently  and I saw there a protectionist legislature bordering on  discrimination. I think we also have an original idea on how to  handle our debts. We are convinced that we are unable to create  adequate means for economic growth precisely because of the  large-scale outflow of resources. We do not say that we do not  want to pay at all; we only say that foreign debt is not a fate,  but the consequence of a mistaken economic policy. Therefore,  we want to renegotiate our repayment system.    [Peter] According to experts, this is impossible because of  the structure of our foreign debt.    [Pozsgay] We also have experts who claim that the repayment  conditions are renegotiable and that it is possible to handle  even such a diversified and funded debt. It is possible to  convince the creditors to invest their bonds in Hungary. The  bonds of those who refuse to do this must be sold. This way, we  could fulfill our repayment obligation while the money would  stay here and could be used for development. Taking new credits  is not risky in this system if the creditor is interested in  domestic investment.    [Peter] You mentioned economic revival. How do you envisage  this?    [Pozsgay] First of all, we must find the sources that make  it possible to start the economic growth, in our view, manpower  and the joining capital. As I already mentioned, we can get  capital by restructuring our debt and by targeted capital  investment, and not one that further increases our debts. All  this is needed for this well-trained society capable of work to  be able to work. We think it is a mistaken policy to focus on  handling unemployment; our goal is to create employment, and  economic growth is a precondition for this. We also think it is  important to develop a credit system to support the new  ventures, a system that would also give a chance for the people  working in agriculture and food production to survive.    [Peter] The NDSZ has a rather original idea on  privatization. If I recall it correctly, in one of your  speeches, you mentioned a privatization by referendum.    [Pozsgay] My words were probably misunderstood, because I  spoke of national consensus, and not a referendum and, in my  opinion, the fate of our national property also belongs here.  We say that we should convene a national coordination congress  to deal with the preparation of a new constitution and the  coordination of public interests regarding the protection of  national property. As a result, the big national interest  organizations could come to an agreement, like the state, the  employers, and the employees in Austria and Spain. Among other  things, this agreement would deal with the management of our  national sovereignty; in other words, we must decide what we can  give away from our independence regained with bitter struggle  for the benefit of our joining the international integration.    [Peter] What is your opinion about the privatization  practice?    [Pozsgay] In my opinion, in working out the concept of  privatization, a very important element was overlooked, namely  that we are not talking here simply about the exchange of  property, but about a change in social structure. Therefore,  the Hungarian privatization cannot be compared with the British  one, for example, where privatization is simply a matter of  rates: When the Labour Party is in power, they nationalize  property; when the Conservative Party is in power, they engage  in privatization. They can do that, because all this only  affect a tiny part of the national property. There has been no  privatization in Hungary before; we must change a system called  socialist and of stalinist origin into a market economy: almost  90 percent of industrial equipment and millions of workers.  Therefore, in my opinion, corruption is not the biggest mistake  of the Hungarian privatization, because this is only something  that accompanies the distribution, something that originates  from a lack of concept.    [Peter] You said in one of your interviews that the party  that can bring hope to people will win the upcoming elections.  In your opinion, is the NDSZ capable of doing this?    [Pozsgay] Yes, because we offer work to the people. If they  have work, their living conditions will improve and their fear  from tomorrow will disappear. Let us not forget that we are  part of European civilization and people adjust their demands to  this. If needed, people can give up some of their demands, but  they will not endure deprivation beyond a certain limit.  Therefore, we must provide a systematic security to the weak  strata of the population and to the backward areas. Unless we  come to our senses, our capital city will soon resemble Mexico,  while other areas become poor and deserted.    [Peter] Regarding its economic program, with what other  party could the NDSZ cooperate?    [Pozsgay] If you allow me, I will not name parties here;  instead, I will say that we can cooperate with all the parties  engaged in the protection of domestic production and domestic  market and which regard domestic bourgeois civilization and the  necessary modernization as essential. We also think that the  national feeling is not an obstacle in all this; on the  contrary, only a nation can create a community. Without a  community image, we will become a smeared manpower source in  Europe at most.</p>

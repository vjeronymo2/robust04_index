			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Honolulu, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Finance ministers  from the world's biggest and fastest growing economies are to  meet here from today to explore opportunities for future  cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.    The meeting is to be held under an agreement reached in  Seattle last November when leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) met for the first time.    Deputy finance ministers met in Honolulu earlier this month  to work out an agenda for this week's financial meeting, the  first of its kind.    The meeting is expected to address some of the challenges  facing the region, including ensuring non-inflationary regional  growth, financing investment and infrastructure development, and  promoting capital market development.    However, no trade or investment breakthroughs are expected  from the Honolulu talks. But some officials from APEC members  believe that the talks will pave the way for future development.    In all, more than 300 representatives and aides from the 17  APEC members have arrived here for the meeting.    Chile will attend the meeting as an observer, pending full  membership next year.    APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Indonesia,  Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand,  Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, and  the United States. Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong joined the  regional economic forum as regional economies.    Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli arrived here Friday and  will hold bilateral talks with his counterparts from some APEC  member states later today.</p>

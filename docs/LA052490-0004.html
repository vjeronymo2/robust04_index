			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> PRISON LABOR ISSUE QUALIFIES  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian said more than enough voter signatures have been  collected to qualify his prison labor initiative for the November ballot. In  part, the proposal would amend the state Constitution to enable convict  volunteers to work at private enterprise jobs to help pay their board and room  and make restitution to victims. Organized labor is opposed, contending that  the measure would provide employers with a "captive labor" force that would  unfairly compete with free workers for jobs.  </P></p>

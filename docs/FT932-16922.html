			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Syncordia in telecom service deal with BP SYNCORDIA, British Telecom's 18-month-old Atlanta-based subsidiary for telecommunications network outsourcing, has won a contract from British Petroleum. The oil company becomes Syncordia's fifth customer. Syncordia will manage BP's voice, data, video and messaging services among five sites in the UK and Stavanger, Norway. BP and Syncordia are also negotiating to include additional sites. Although the five-year contract's total value was not disclosed, Syncordia said its first year was worth Dollars 12m. BP said it believed the outsourcing arrangement would bring 'significant operating and financial benefits'. Last year, Syncordia began working with BP Chemicals, a unit of BP, managing its communications network among 11 sites in seven European countries. Syncordia, although it has been off to a slow start, aims to capture a significant slice of the fast growing market for network outsourcing - whereby companies contract out the management of their telecommunications systems to specialists. Competition in the global network outsourcing market, estimated to grow to Dollars 4bn to Dollars 6bn by the mid-1990s, is increasingly tough, with companies such as AT&amp;T, MCI and Unisource jockeying for market share with BT. For BT, Syncordia is a key element in its strategy to expand internationally and become the world's leading supplier of telecommunications services.</p>

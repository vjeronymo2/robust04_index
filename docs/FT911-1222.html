			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Donors agree to help India over payments crisis WESTERN donors have started to raise short-term funds to India to help it overcome its fiscal and balance of payments crisis, according to Mr Attila Karaosmanoglu, the World Bank's vice-president for Asia. Leading donors - including the World Bank, the IMF and the Asian Development Bank - held an informal meeting in Vancouver on April 28 where Indian officials presented a menu of short-term measures. These included a 'candid assessment' of the current situation and action by the Reserve Bank of India and finance ministry on monetary and budgetary policy. The promise to have ready for a new government 'a skeleton programme of reforms' was so 'comforting' to the aid community that donors have begun to raise the funds needed to help see India through next September, Mr Karaosmanoglu said in an interview. India has an interim government pending elections which start on May 20. The Asian Development Bank promised Dollars 150m in emergency credit, which Japan is expected to co-fin-ance. The Dutch government said it would make Fl 50m (Pounds 15m) available in quick disbursing finance. Britain and Germany are expected to make other aid available. The US will keep food credits available, and the US Export-Import Bank has said it will keep all its windows open in India. The aid will have an impact, Mr Karaosmanoglu said. But it is not certain if it will be enough and in time. India is anxious not to jeopardise its position as a nation which has never defaulted on its obligations. The creditors have as great a stake in keeping the waters calm. 'It is seen clearly that it is in nobody's interest to led India go. It will be costly for the Indians and everybody else to pull them out,' Mr Karaosmanoglu said. For the long-term, the World Bank is making 'serious preparations' for a programme of policy-based lending to India, if requested by the new government. Tens of millions of dollars worth of 'quick-disbursing' structural adjustment loans would provide the hard currency India needs. The lending programme would put pressure on New Delhi to make the structural changes necessary to achieve a more competitive industry and an improved export performance. In the past, Indian governments have strongly resisted the lure of structural adjustment lending, preferring to go their own way on economic policy. However, it is believed in Washington that the current crisis will leave the new government little choice in the matter. India's debt, about Dollars 70bn, (Pounds 41.4bn) is the third highest in the developing world. It has only enough foreign exchange on hand to cover a few weeks of imports, and the caretaker government has been unable to meet the conditions for an emergency injection of International Monetary Fund assistance. Meanwhile, the World Bank has other means to help. The continued depreciation of the rupee has meant a 'significant amount' of savings for the bank in some of its projects. These savings will be converted into usable funds for projects 'being implemented without problems'.</p>

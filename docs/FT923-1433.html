			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (2): Bruised but not battered  -Riding the Recession OVER THE past two years Atlanta and the wider Georgia economy have had to cope with a phenomenon of which they have had remarkably little recent experience: recession. The economy of the Georgian capital has grown so rapidly since the second world war that it has not suffered nearly so badly from periodic recessions as most of the US. And it managed to avoid the great 1981 downturn entirely, thanks in part to an extensive public works building programme. Not so the 1990-1992 recession, which has been the worst in Atlanta since a severe property crisis in the mid-1970s. 'We took a significant recession and we're just gradually digging out of it,' says Mr Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University. Total payroll employment in the state dipped to 2.942m in 1991, down 1.6 per cent from 1990, and economists are expecting only a marginal increase this year, of about 0.2 per cent. Atlanta, for its part, saw a 1.4 per cent drop last year, to 1.46m jobs, with signs of an equally muted upturn so far this year. The big question now is how much business conditions will improve in 1993, with many economists hopeful of jobs growth of 1.5 to 2 per cent, provided the wider US economy does not fall into a 'triple dip' recession. However, Mr Moncure Crowder, economist at Wachovia bank, points out that the current slow pace of recovery means no one is ready to proclaim the return of the kind of boom Atlanta enjoyed in the 1980s. And while the state is generally expected to enjoy stronger economic growth than the nation as a whole during the 1990s, it may not retain quite the advantage of the past decade. As economists at the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta have pointed out, changes in the structure of the regional economy have diminished some of the comparative advantages of the Southeast, which is increasingly 'becoming subject to the same general influences as the nation.' Atlanta's growth over the past 30 years has certainly been remarkable. In the 1950s it was roughly the same size as the steel city of Birmingham, Alabama, but it is now far bigger and the undisputed economic capital of the South. Contributory factors have included: An optimistic, boosting, can-do business philosophy; The city's geographical position, as a rail, telephony, road and air communications centre; Its political leadership - which grasped the need to reinforce these advantages with, for example, repeated modernisation of the city's Hartsfield airport, one of the world's biggest and An early, enlightened attitude to racial integration, which gave comfort to companies from outside the region looking (in the 1960s and 1970s) for a city in which to place a southeastern regional headquarters. The first boom occurred from 1966 to 1973 and included two developments which have been important to the city's continued success. One was the modernisation of Hartsfield. The other was construction of the first wave of the hotels which have propelled Atlanta to an important position in the convention business. Boom was followed by a property bust in the mid-1970s and then, starting in about 1977, came a long wave of expansion which saw the city consolidate its regional position and aim to become an international centre of note. The boom drew in a substantial number of foreign companies and produced a widely diversified economy. (For although the Atlantan and Georgian economies are heavily dependent on the services sector, no single industry dominates, and agriculture, once the state's mainstay, now forms a relatively minor component of its output.) This second boom ended in 1990 as the US headed into a national recession. Atlanta was hard hit by the demise of Eastern Airlines, which had a large presence at Hartsfield, and the closure of one of two General Motors plants in the area. (The second appears safe for now). The overheated property market also slumped. Atlanta currently has an office vacancy rate of about 20 per cent, similar to many other big US centres, and its warehouse and retail vacancy rates are also high. 'Property is going to be a drag almost throughout the decade,' says Mr Bethel Minter, economist at SunTrust Banks. However, positive economic factors should significantly outweigh any negatives over the medium to long-term. Atlanta's good infrastructure, pleasant life-style and relatively low property costs means that it consistently ranks at or near the top of surveys of the best US cities in which to do business. It will continue to be a magnet for new investment, whether it comes from the small, new technology firms which quietly provide many of the new jobs, or dramatic corporate relocations such as the move of United Parcels Service to the city from its former Connecticut headquarters. The 1996 Olympics will also give a direct boost to the economy, provisionally estimated at some Dollars 3.5bn - but almost certainly its greater long term importance will be the public relations impact it will give Atlanta internationally as a place to do business. The Olympics will certainly give a mid-decade impetus to the city's important tourism industry. This has been stuck on a plateau for the past two years, and may find it hard to show substantial growth while the US economy remains so subdued. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, an important local employer and one of the 'big three' US carriers, is expected to expand less aggressively over the next few years as it digests its recent purchase of many of defunct Pan Am's routes, which enabled it to make a huge leap into the international arena. However, growth in the city's transport services business is expected to remain positive. Among the best hopes for strong growth over the next few years are the city's various high technology businesses. Communications is a huge industry; it ranges from BellSouth, the largest of the Bell regional telephone companies, to Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network (CNN). Atlanta has one of the most extensive networks of fibre optic cable in the US, and the city's role as a communications hub was cited by British Telecom when it decided to place the headquarters of Syncordia, a subsidiary set up to manage large users' worldwide networks, in the area. The Georgia Center for Advanced Telecommunications Technology represents an attempt by government and private industry to capitalise on the state's communications advantages by researching ways of integrating the convergent technologies of telecommunications, consumer electronics, cable tv, computers and tv programming. Computer software is also becoming a significant employer. So is medical technology, with the location in Atlanta of the US Public Health Service's Centers for Disease Control and the American Cancer Society.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               KEY FACTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   ATLANTA        GEORGIA  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Population (1990 census)                          2.8m              6.5m Area (sq miles)                                    132            58,910 Labour Force (June 1992)                        1.475m            2.969m Unemployment rate   (1st quarter 1992)                              5.8%              6.2% Per Capita personal   income (4th quarter 1991)             Dollars 20,263    Dollars 17,364 Number of companies listed   in Fortune magazine's '500'                        6                11 1992 general funds government budget      Dollars 351m   Dollars 7.553bn Tourism revenue (1991)                   Dollars 3.7bn    Dollars 10.4bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: regional government statistics  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              NEW MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES REPORTED IN 1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Name                Country   Product             Jobs     City  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- B E L Tronics       Canada    Radar detectors     300      Covington '5' Rubber    Corporation      France    Rubber seals        350      Griffin Ritz Instrument     Germany   High voltage                                   transformers    500      Waynesboro Matsushita Storage  Japan     Lead acid batteries 340      Columbus Toto/Mitsui         Japan     Vitreous china                                   plumbing ware   200      Atlanta Brown, Jered        UK        Marine cranes       200      Brunswick  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Georgia Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN GEORGIA  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       New Industries             Expanded Industries                                   Capital                        Capital Country        No.   Employed   Investment   No.  Employed    Investment  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria         -        -           -        1      n/a         3.25m Canada          4      360        15.0m       6      124         6.32m France          1      350        10.0m       3       25         7.00m Germany         2      560        12.0m       2      n/a         1.42m Japan           3      540        43.0m      13       97         60.13 Netherlands     1       80         8.0m       3      100          2.84 Sweden          1       30         3.2m       -        -             - UK              4      265        32.5m       2      n/a         3.09m TOTAL          16     2185       123.7m      30      346        84.05m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- New and expanded manufacturing industry investments announced in 1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Georgia Dept. of Industry, Trade and Tourism  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC GROWTH 1983-1991  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         1986     1987     1988     1989     1990    1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Announced projects (est) 437      568      576      407      260     195  Value (Dollars bn)      8.6     15.6     14.3      9.1      3.6     3.1  Office space sq/ft m     24       35       30       17        6       7  Hotel rooms          10,156    8,378    3,642    3,950    2,209     775  Employment (est)    186,832  244,200  235,000  109,304  236,327  42,091  New companies           190      146      123      150      130     129 International included    38       27       50       39       36      26  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Atlanta Chamber of Commerce  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

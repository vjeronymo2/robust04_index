			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Reducing a CGT bill - Briefcase, Q&amp;A Some time soon, I intend to buy a house for my mother and stepfather. Because it will be solely for their use, does this exempt me from CGT whilst they are resident there, or will I be faced with it when eventually I come to sell? CGT relief for houses occupied by dependent relatives was abolished (except for some existing cases) by the Finance Act 1988. But you could get a substantial reduction in the prospective CGT bill by: 1. Granting your parents a formal tenancy (at modest rent, perhaps, but not a tenancy for life, preferably). 2. Living in the house for a short time (perhaps before they move in). 3. Giving judiciously-timed main-residence notices under section 222(5)(a) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (jointly with your wife, if appropriate under subsection 6(a) of that section). The guidance of your solicitors - or other experts in the tax rules and practice relating to domestic property transactions - is essential: the CGT rules are quite arbitrary and generally are enforced rigidly with scant regard for equity or logic. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

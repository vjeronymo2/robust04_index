The spirit of a so-called Baltic-Black  Sea alliance hovered in the lobbies of the Seimas where the  meetings took place. The first step has been taken.    The curtain was raised a fraction on the eve of Leonid  Kravchuk's visit by Rostislav Bilodid, Ukrainian ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Lithuania. He said: "I am  a supporter of a Baltic-Black Sea alliance, but would not like  to narrow this to just a political concept. I interpret it more  widely. After all, there is so much in common in the characters  of our people. In short, we should be closer to one another.  Ukraine is committed to cooperation with Lithuania."    In the ambassador's opinion, both countries jave a lot of  work to do in the economic sphere. Today Lithuania's share of  exports to Ukraine stands at 8-10 percent. This is too small,  R. Bilodid noted. Ukraine, in his opinion, should become a  profitable export market for Lithuania. In his view, this  republic has hitherto focused too little attention on the region  to its south. Specific steps have already been taken.  Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys and Rostislav Bilodid  have initialed a treaty between the two countries' governments  on encouraging investments and providing bilateral export  guarantees.    Leonid Kravchuk also assigned a special role to economic  relations in his speech to the Lithuanian Seimas. In his  opinion, economic and trade links have not attained the  necessary level. Both countries could cooperate with mutual  profit in any sphere. The Ukrainian president offered to export  to Lithuania ores, coal, coke, rolled iron, metal goods,  electrotechnical instruments, and cars. In its turn Ukraine  would like to receive from Lithuania consumer goods, footwear,  clothing, and chemical and electronics industry products. There  are big opportunities for cooperation in the field of transport.  Ukraine would like to have access to the Baltic Sea and to  other North European countries via the port of Klaipeda.  Lithuania, Leonid Kravchuk proposed, could also take advantage  of the potential of Ukraine's Black Sea ports.    It is clearly not easy to implement such an extensive  cooperation program in the context of "conventional" agreements.  Hence politicians in both countries have seized on the idea of  creating an alliance. At any rate, neither Leonid Kravchuk nor  Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas denied this idea at the  press conference held after the signing of the friendship and  cooperation treaty. True, Leonid Kravchuk did stress that the  talk of an alliance meant not military blocs of any kind but  only cooperation in the sphere of economics and culture. And  Algirdas Brazauskaks added that such initiatives in no way  denoted the formation of military blocs; on the contrary, they  were a step toward pan-European cooperation on security matters.  Both presidents give a high assessment to the "Partnership for  Peace" program recently signed by Lithuania. Here the idea of  an alliance between Baltic and Black Sea countries takes on a  whole new aspect. Leonid Kravchuk recalled Ukraine's initiative  on the creation of stability zones in regions of Central and  East Europe. He expects it to cover all countries in the Baltic  and Black Sea regions. This initiative, the Ukrainian president  said, coincides with other security system projects. It was  noted at the press conference that the initiative for forming a  Baltic-Black Sea alliance is supported by Poland, France, and  other countries.    Thus it would appear that the idea of an alliance has more  than just an economic content. For example, Leonid Kravchuk  noted that Ukraine is connected with the Lithuanian people  historically; the roots of this friendship go back into the  distant past. Cooperation began as far back as the days of  Kievan Rus, which played a large part in Lithuania's formation.  "In its turn the Great Lithuanian Principality of the 14th  century helped Ukrainians to preserve their traditions,  language, and religion and did not allow that unique culture to  die," Leonid Kravchuk said. "At that time our countries were  part of a single state, and deep ties were formed between our  peoples which today are taking on a new significance."    Such good relations with Lithuania could not help provoking  questions about relations between Ukraine and Russia. Leonid  Kravchuk expressed the conviction that, if his country adheres  to the trilateral agreement on nuclear weapons signed in Moscow,  friendly relations will not change. At the same time he singled  out the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, which in his opinion has  to be resolved before there can be any question of discussing a  solution to other problems. Relations with Russia, he said,  have a special significance in our foreign policy, and they will  have a real content if good will is shown on both the Ukrainian  and Russian sides.    The idea of a Baltic-Black Sea alliance probably suits the  hearts and minds of the Lithuanian opposition, which fervently  opposes any alliances with Russia. Thus Vytautas Landsbergis  described Leonid Kravchuk's visit to Lithuania as "the summit of  today's actualities." "We have long understood that Ukraine's  fate is also vitally important to Lithuania's independence," the  Lithuanian opposition leader stressed. "Today Ukraine is  seeking support, and it is important for us to support that  aspiration."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 30 (AFP) -- The French National  Assembly gave permission on Wednesday for the arrest of French  MP Edouard Chammougon, who faces charges of corruption and  embezzling public funds.    A committee of parliament chaired by Speaker Philippe Seguin  lifted the parliamentary [immunity] of Chammougon, the  independent MP for the French West Indies island of Guadeloupe,  whose arrest was authorised.    Chammougon is accused in connection with commissions paid by  the town of Baie-Mehault, of which he has been mayor since 1977.  The town's budget is in the red to the tune of 208 million  francs (about 35 million dollars).    The MP is also being asked to explain the origin of two  million francs (330,00O dollars) that were paid into his bank  accounts.    Two other French MPS face embezzlement charges, but have not  been jailed.    Olympique Marseille President Bernard Tapie, a former  minister in the socialist government, faces two embezzlement  cases and has also been accused of bribery and interfering with  witnesses in an attempt to throw a match.    On Tuesday conservative Michel Noir, the mayor of Lyon and  also a former minister, was charged with embezzling public money  and ordered to put up bail of 2.4 million francs (420,000  dollars).    Three ministers in the government of Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur have meanwhile been named in a judicial report exposing  illegal financing of the right-wing Republican Party, part of  the ruling coalition.    The report by Rennes examining magistrate Renaud Van  Ruymbeke, who has also probed illegal financing of the former  ruling Socialist Party, said Gerard Longuet (Industry),  president of the party, Francois Leotard (Defence), honorary  president, and Trade Minister Alain Madelin were all aware of  cash payments into Republican Party coffers of 28 million francs  (4.9 million dollars) between 1987 and 1991.</p>

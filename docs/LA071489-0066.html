			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TAGLIAFERRI, WHITE AGAIN FAIL TO SCORE 700 ON SAT  </P> <P> Russell White and Gino Tagliaferri, perhaps the Valley-area's most prominent  high school athletes during the past school year, shared less auspicious ground  recently as both again failed to meet the minimum score of 700 on the  Scholastic Aptitude Test mandated by Proposition 48 of the National Collegiate  Athletic Assn.  </P> <P> Cal, which signed White to a letter of intent in February, announced Thursday  that the tailback will forfeit his freshman year of athletic eligibility  because he failed to score 700. White, who attended Crespi High, was one of the  nation's most recruited players.  </P> <P> Tagliaferri, who led Kennedy High to the City Section 4-A Division baseball  title last month, received similar news last week and will sit out his freshman  year at Fresno State.  </P> <P> Under the guidelines of Prop. 48, which took effect in 1986, high school  student-athletes must maintain a 2.0 grade-point average in core-curriculum  classes and an SAT score of 700 or better to ensure eligibility as a freshman.  </P> <P> White, who could not be reached for comment Thursday, and Tagliaferri met the  core-curriculum requirements but failed to meet the SAT standards.  </P> <P> White, who set state career records for rushing (5,998 yards), touchdowns (94)  and scoring (568 points), took the SAT at least three times. Tagliaferri also  took the test on several occasions.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed that I will not be able to play this season, but I came here  to Cal to get a good education and this gives me a chance to focus on my  academics the first year," White said in a prepared statement released by Cal.  "I'm going to be like any other freshman getting adjusted to college. Next  year, I'll put the uniform back on and resume my football career."  </P> <P> Although White, who is attending summer school at Cal, is eligible to play  football at a junior college next season, he said earlier this year that he  would not pursue that option if he failed to meet Prop. 48 requirements on the  SAT.  </P> <P> White and Tagliaferri could also retain their four years of eligibility by  paying their own expenses for the first year at Cal and Fresno State, but it is  doubtful that either of them will do so.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed for Russell," said Bill Redell, who coached White during his  three varsity years at Crespi. "I personally think that the whole SAT testing  thing for athletes needs to be addressed. He took more core subjects than (NCAA  guidelines) require and his GPA was 2.3, when they only require a 2.0. Russell  did fairly well academically."  </P> <P> White led Crespi to a 28-8-1 record during his career at the private all-boys  school in Encino. White was named the state player of the year after leading  Crespi to the Southern Section Big Five Conference title in 1986.  </P> <P> He also performed brilliantly in track and field, winning six Southern Section  2-A Division titles during his career, including the 100 and 200 meters, long  jump and triple jump this season.  </P> <P> White placed third in the triple jump, eighth in the 200 and ninth in the long  jump in the state championships in June and was eighth in the 200 (88) and  second in the triple jump (87) the previous two years.  </P> <P> Tagliaferri, who last season led California players in home runs with 13, was  named the City Section 4-A and Times Valley Player of the Year and set a City  career home run mark of 23.  </P> <P> Tagliaferri said that he is still in contact with the Detroit Tigers, who  selected him in the third round of the amateur draft last month, but does not  expect to sign. He said Detroit's most recent offer was for $55,000, a bonus  that is at least $15,000 less than Tagliaferri would like.  </P> <P> "I'm registered for 17 units, I have a place to live and I'm ready to go," he  said. "(Detroit) keeps saying that I won't survive in an academic atmosphere.  But I've always done the minimum to get by in school. If I try, I know I can  make it."  </P> <P> Fresno State Coach Bill Bennett said last month that the school would welcome  Tagliaferri even if he did not satisfy Prop. 48 requirements.  </P> <P> "It's embarrassing," Tagliaferri said. "But they told me that this way, maybe  it would help me adapt to college better."  </P> <P> Staff writer Steve Elling contributed to this story.  </P></p>

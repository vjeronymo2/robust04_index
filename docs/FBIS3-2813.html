			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900) and Fang </F> Zhengjun (2455 2398 6511)]    [Text] Beijing, 12 Mar (XINHUA) -- In discussing and  deliberating the "Government Work Report" with the Hubei  delegation today, Liu Huaqing, member of the Standing Committee  of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman  of the Central Military Commission, said emphatically: We now  have a good opportunity to deepen reform and accelerate  development. People across the country must seize the  opportunity, take the overall situation into consideration,  pluck up their spirits, and make concerted efforts to carry out  China's economic construction.    During the discussion, Liu Huaqing listened attentively to  the deputies' remarks and interposed from time to time. He  showed great pleasure when Hubei Governor Jia Zhijie briefed the  deputies saying that last year the province's gross domestic  product exceeded 100 billion yuan; total industrial and  agricultural output value topped 200 billion yuan; revenues rose  above 10 billion yuan; and urban and rural residents' income  registered a considerable increase.    Liu Huaqing said: For Hubei, which is situated in the  hinterland of central China, the construction of the Three  Gorges project -- to divert water from Danjiang reservoir to  north China -- and the opening of Wuhan and Huangshi cities  present a very good opportunity. If the province's 56 million  people make concerted efforts to advance in an invigorated  spirit and handle relations among reform, development, and  stability well, accelerating Hubei's development looks very  promising.    Liu Huaqing pointed out: The state has promulgated many new  reform measures this year, which involve the readjustment of  certain interests. This requires everyone to correctly handle  relations between overall and partial interests, subordinate  minor interests to overall interests, and foster the thinking of  coordinating all the nation's activities as in a chess game. In  the transition from the old to the new, some localities will  encounter difficulties. The important thing is to take into  consideration our actual conditions, display the spirit of plain  living and hard struggle, be diligent and frugal, and work hard  to overcome difficulties.    Liu Huaqing stressed the need to attach importance to  building socialist spiritual civilization. He said: The drive  to combat corruption and promote clean government launched in  the entire party, army, and country last year was a great  success. However, it has not achieved all our objectives. The  drive to combat corruption and promote clean government is a  long-term task. We must carry it out to the end and never relax  our efforts. When speaking of social practice, Liu Huaqing  pointed out: We must advocate new socialist practice and fine  social ethics, and vigorously promote the spirit of plain living  and hard struggle to change prevailing habits and customs. We  must adhere to the principle of fostering both material and  spiritual civilization, attaching equal importance to both. We  must work hard to nurture a new generation of socialist people  with ideals, morality, knowledge, and discipline.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Union threatens German steel strike THE German steel employers association meets tomorrow to decide its next step after the breakdown of arbitration talks with IG Metall, the country's giant engineering union, over a wage settlement for the east German steel industry. The fifth round of talks unexpectedly broke down in Berlin after IG Metall rejected a 9 per cent pay offer by the employers association. IG Metall said yesterday it would continue to insist on a 20 per cent increase, agreed under a programme of equalising pay between western and eastern German workers by April 1994. The union said it expected the employers to follow Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers association, in revoking the March 1991 contract when it meets tomorrow. The union said if that happened it would respond with warning strikes, followed by a ballot on a full strike if IG Metall's 20,000 members in east Germany did not receive the 20 per cent pay rise on April 1. Rank-and-file support for such action is uncertain. Since Gesamtmetall revoked earlier this month the contract guaranteeing east German metal and electrical workers a 26 per cent wage increase, several factory managers in the region have started negotiating separate pay deals with the unions. A foreign manager of a company which has invested heavily in eastern Germany, said yesterday he was prepared to offer a 15 per cent increase. 'This is realistic in view of the fact that our productivity is 65 per cent of west German levels,' he said. IG Metall yesterday shrugged off moves towards separate wage agreements, saying that warning strikes would reveal whether its members were prepared to continue to pay west German prices while earning east German wages.</p>

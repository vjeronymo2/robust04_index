			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Yen Traders Case Split: Two commodity traders who contend trading rules were  broken routinely at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will be tried separately  from 12 others in a federal fraud case, U.S. District Judge William T. Hart  ruled. Hart said evidence presented by defendants Sam A. Cali and Ray Pace in  their unusual defense might prejudice the jury against the 12 other defendants,  who have denied breaking rules. Hart did not set a date for the separate trial.  </P></p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Zurich rally on window-dressing RALLIES in Germany and Switzerland, with more than a suggestion of window-dressing, contrasted with a shock for the Spanish banking sector, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT forged ahead again as window-dressing, thin turnover and expectations of a year-end rally took the DAX index to its highest close for four weeks, up 17.66 at 1,544.61, just 2 per cent below its starting point for 1992. Turnover fell from DM2.7bn to DM2.6bn. Volatility in illiquid stocks such as the battery maker, Varta, DM14.50 higher at DM225, and the ball-bearing manufacturer, Kugelfischer, DM5 better at DM91, suggested that fund managers were using the thin market to enhance year-end performance. Deutsche Bank rose DM8.90 to DM653.50 and the insurer, Allianz, added DM33 to DM1,988 on short-covering and hopes of an interest rate cut early next year. Kaufhof rose DM15.50 or 3.8 per cent to DM425 on a continuing reaction to last week's announcement that the retailer had bought 50.1 per cent of the Swiss travel agency, Kuoni. ZURICH's SMI index rose 30.9 to 2,092.4 on hopes for lower interest rates in Germany, and in turn in Switzerland. Speculation on a strong rally in 1993, a dollar above SFr1.45 and window-dressing also contributed to the firm tone. Banks benefited with CS Holding SFr60 higher at SFr2,140, SBC up SFr9 at SFr304 and Swiss Volksbank, the subject of takeover speculation some weeks ago, up SFr60, or 8.8 per cent at SFr740. Brown Boveri rose SFr80 to SFr3,620, having returned to favour this month after a share price retreat earlier in the second half. MADRID's banking sector fell, leading to general weakness after a high court ordered Banco Santander to post a Pta8bn bond to cover alleged tax irregularities in past loan transactions. Santander fell Pta230 to Pta4,290. Central Hispano and Popular both eased by more than 1 per cent as the general index closed 3.07, or 1.4 per cent lower at 215.07. PARIS gave back most of the day's gains but managed to close slightly firmer. The CAC-40 index put on 2.94 to 1,857.53 in thin volume of FFr1.7bn, off the day's high of 1,872.43. On Christmas Eve, the index rose 33.48 to 1,854.59 on the first day of the January account. MILAN ended virtually unchanged as early losses were countered by a light recovery later on. The Comit index rose 0.61 to 438.48 in estimated turnover of L100bn after L260bn on December 23. Fiat was fixed down L96 at L3,834 but later recovered to L3,870. Other gainers included the retailer Rinascente, up L290 at L7,900, and the insurance sector, led by Fondiaria, up L468 at L27,218. BRUSSELS was pulled down by a decline in the food retailer, Delhaize. The Bel-20 index fell 4.60 to 1,132.99, after gaining 1.94 to 1,137.59 on Christmas Eve. Delhaize dropped BFr22 to BFr1,368, pushed down by a 4 per cent drop in shares of its US Food Lion unit on new rumours that hygiene standards at the discount chain were unsatisfactory and on a newspaper report, denied by Delhaize, that Food Lion would halt its expansion programme. AMSTERDAM continued its end-year rally but a flat opening on Wall Street dampened earlier gains. The CBS Tendency index closed at 107.1, up 0.3 from last Thursday when it closed 0.2 higher at 106.8. STOCKHOLM was little changed after late buying reversed a weak trend at the opening. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 0.9 to 917.8 as turnover dropped to SKr368m from SKr624m. Among active stocks, Ericsson B share roses SKr3 to SKr190 while Astra B closed SKr1 down at SKr737. OSLO fell 1.4 per cent in thin post-holiday trading. The composite index fell 5.21 to 368.75 in turnover of NKr66.8m. Norsk Hydro lost NKr3.5 to NKr151 while Saga Petroleum A shed NKr1 to NKr67.50.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- December 24 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes*          Open     10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1077.35   1077.51   1077.52  1077.97 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1158.94   1158.09   1158.30  1158.93                         13.00     14.00     15.00     Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100         -         -         -   1078.93 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         -         -         -   1160.29  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Dec 23    Dec 22    Dec 21    Dec 18    Dec 17 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1073.60   1072.92   1059.21   1050.25   1034.41 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1154.31   1157.60   1145.44   1136.56   1119.02  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1079.50; 200 - 1160.29 Low/day: 100 - 1077.18  200 - 1157.94 *Partial  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Italian government calls confidence vote THE Italian government yesterday called a confidence vote tomorrow on a minimum tax on the self-employed, threatening its survival and delaying initial voting on a crucial deficit cutting budget, Reuter reports from Rome. The government called the vote in order to retain the so-called 'minimum tax', seen by its supporters as a key weapon in the fight against tax evasion, which had been due to lapse tomorrow. The government of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi must automatically step down if it loses. Most observers expect the government to come through the vote but an inital senate vote on the 1994 austerity budget will now have to be delayed until next week.</p>

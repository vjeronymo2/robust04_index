			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 CAMPS TRY TO SORT OUT PANAMA EVENTS  </P> <P> Refugees from the unsuccessful coup in Panama remained in seclusion in Miami  Wednesday as the Bush Administration and Panamanian exiles each tried to put  together a coherent account of last week's debacle.  </P> <P> Administration officials, seeking to deflect charges that they helped cause the  failure by not providing adequate support for the coup, have been working to  portray the coup leaders as disorganized bunglers. The exiles, meanwhile, are  "attempting to get themselves together" and "work things out internally before  they present their case to the public," said a congressional source who has  been in contact with the Panamanians.  </P> <P> For now, the Panamanians appear to be divided about how much they should blame  the failure of their coup on the Administration, which has disappointed them in  the past but which remains their chief hope for ever returning home.  </P> <P> Several exile sources have quoted coup survivors as saying that the U.S.  government did not provide promised aid for their effort. But another  Panamanian source, who has been in close contact with the exiles, insisted that  "they don't blame the United States." The downfall of the coup was confusion  and a "lack of coordination" with U.S. forces, this source said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, President Bush met Wednesday morning with two senior members of the  Senate Intelligence Committee to smooth relations after his national security  adviser and defense secretary complained about congressional "micromanagement"  of foreign policy.  </P> <P> The micromanagement charges surfaced Sunday during a television appearance by  National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney  repeated the charge Tuesday in an interview with the Associated Press,  complaining that congressional interference during the coup last week created  "all kinds of problems" for the Administration.  </P> <P> "The President is the commander in chief. He's the one who has to manage a  crisis. You cannot have every member of Congress involved," Cheney said.  </P> <P> The comments set off a minor storm in Congress, which Bush sought to quiet by  meeting Wednesday with Sens. David L. Boren (D-Okla.) and William S. Cohen  (R-Me.), the chairman and senior GOP member of the Senate Intelligence  Committee.  </P> <P> The senators emerged placated. "The meeting had a very good spirit," Boren said  afterward.  </P> <P> Attempts to analyze the failure of the coup continue to be hindered by the  welter of conflicting stories about practically every key moment in the drama.  </P> <P> Several sources, for example, have said that after the rebels seized Noriega's  compound, Noriega's subordinates summoned help while the general remained under  detention in his office. But an American military officer with long experience  in Panama said that two Panamanians who participated in the coup told him that  the rebels actually let Noriega leave after deciding not to turn him over to  American officials.  </P> <P> The rebels sent the general home from Panama Defense Forces headquarters with  an aide-de-camp and a chauffeur behind the wheel of his blue Mercedes, this  source said. Once clear of the compound, Noriega apparently picked up his car  phone and ordered his protege, Maj. Fiqui Olechaea , commander of Battalion  2000, the largest combat unit of the Defense Forces, to attack the compound.  </P> <P> The attack led to the death of the coup's leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega. One  source said that Noriega shot Giroldi three times in the chest after the major  was beaten by other Panamanian officers, and shot the other coup leader in the  head.  </P> <P> The various stories about the coup seem to agree on one key point -- that the  insurrection was doomed when Battalion 2000 threw in its lot with Noriega  rather than the rebels.  </P> <P> The Panamanian exile leader said he was told by Capt. Javier Licona, the most  senior officer to survive the coup, that the rebels had been counting on the  support of the elite battalion when they seized Noriega's headquarters in  Panama City the morning of Oct. 3.  </P> <P> The exile source offered no explanation of why the battalion, whose  participation was apparently central to the rebels' plans, did not join them.  He said that Giroldi "kept his planning close to his chest." He added that when  Giroldi died, "a lot of explanations died with him."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Melissa Healy and Sara Fritz in Washington and Barry Bearak  in Miami and Times researcher Anna Virtue in Miami contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Searching for consensus on risk assessment - Traders and market regulators are changing their focus Fears about derivatives risk have tended to centre on credit risk, potentially snowballing into systemic risk and bringing about the collapse of the international financial system. But there is a growing school of thought which argues that this focus is misplaced. According to many market participants, market risk is a much more fundamental danger than credit risk, and existing measures for risk management are often misguided. Because derivatives are highly leveraged, losses on market positions have been exaggerated, and volatile conditions have caused assumed correlations between markets, on which hedging is often based, to evaporate. Consequently, volatile markets can prove more dangerous for the derivatives trader than for the cash market trader. In fact, many derivatives specialists argue, credit risk in the derivatives market only becomes a serious problem as a result of market risk: in most cases where heavy losses have been incurred, it has been as a result of a lack of understanding of market risk. Credit risk, on the other hand, is arguably the same for derivatives as for other markets. In its recent report on derivatives, the US General Accounting Office concluded from its survey of 14 US participants that the net credit risk from derivatives at the end of 1992 was only Dollars 68bn - much smaller than for loans. (This assumes that netting of derivatives is enforceable). Regulators who are primarily concerned about credit risk could be barking up the wrong tree. Many market participants think they are, arguing that regulators pay too little heed to the way that derivatives specialists look at risk. For a derivatives trader, the key issue is the present value of a particular position, and an important part of the job is to create models to calculate this, using historical data. The Basle Committee is currently working on new capital rules for market risk, but the approach detailed in consultative papers circulated last year has been widely criticised by market participants as bureaucratic and antiquated. In a recent speech, Mr William McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve, noted that market participants are arguing that 'the market risk measurement models the banks had developed for their own risk management offered a means to measure capital requirements with greater precision and with much lower regulatory burden than the proposed supervisory model.' Mr McDonough described the consideration of a models-based approach as 'a major step for the international supervisory community,' but did not rule it out. The problem, though, may extend beyond regulators, touching the entire conceptual approach to derivatives. Many regulators come from a loan officer tradition or an accounting tradition, and therefore their approach may be fundamentally at odds with the way the market actually functions. This explains, too, the growing sense of dissatisfaction with the accounting treatment of derivatives, which means that information in company reports on derivatives business is often meaningless. 'Accounting should reflect economics,' argues Mr Flavio Bartman, managing director, commodity derivatives at Merrill Lynch. 'We have principles of accounting that were drafted for a world where you only had bonds and stocks.' According to Mr Michael Black, head of consultancy at CSC Index, who advises firms on derivatives risk management, 'accounting systems define value in terms of capital; derivatives in terms of the net present value of a position: these are apples and pears.' Similar problems may arise within the senior management of banks, which often focus too closely on return on capital, according to Mr Black. Derivatives traders have their vested interests and preconceptions. But, increasingly, finding transferable values which allow traders, regulators, accountants and senior managers to discuss risk management in the same terms is becoming one of the goals of the debate. This is the first of a weekly column on derivatives.</p>

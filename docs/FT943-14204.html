			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Invesco raises Pounds 19m as Japan trust opens Invesco has so far raised Pounds 19m from a placing of shares in its Japan Discovery Investment Trust. The size of the trust has been capped at Pounds 70m, with the minimum set at Pounds 20m. The public offer, which opened yesterday, ends on July 29 and dealings begin on August 8. The new trust will invest in smaller Japanese companies for long-term capital growth. The Japanese investment trust sector has been the focus of substantial enthusiasm so far this year. Earlier this month, Schroders' new Japan Growth Investment Trust, investing in a broad range of companies, was oversubscribed by Pounds 2.8m after raising its full Pounds 125m. Fidelity Japanese Values, a smaller companies trust, raised Pounds 105m. Invesco already runs two Japanese unit trusts, and the new investment trust will be managed by its existing Tokyo-based fund managers. Shares are issued at 100p, with one warrant attached to every five shares. Issue expenses have been capped at 4.9 per cent.</p>

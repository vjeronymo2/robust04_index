			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: AAF sells US offshoot for Dollars 33m AAF Industries, the mini-conglomerate which plunged into the red in its first half, is to sell its US modular building subsidiary for a total of Dollars 33.3m (Pounds 22.3m). Mr Alex Brown, chief executive, said yesterday that the disposal 'takes a lot of the pressure off and gives us a chance to look at the group afresh.' No decision had yet been made on making further disposals. On April 1 the company announced a 1-for-4 rights issue at 175p which was 97.6 per cent subscribed. It was followed by profits warnings in July and September which sent the shares tumbling. Last month AAF reported an interim loss of Pounds 11m compared with a profit of Pounds 2.26m. The deficit stemmed directly from expansion of its prefabricated building manufacturing business, which it bought in 1989, into an on-site contractor. The group warned that further costs of Pounds 7m would be incurred in the second half because of the closure of the lossmaking division. Yesterday the shares, which have traded as low as 19p, rose 11p to 49p. The group has agreed to sell Diamond Engineered Space to GE Capital Modular Space, a unit of General Electric of the US, for Dollars 27.3m cash and a further Dollars 6m in consideration for the giving of a non-competition covenant. Ohio-based Diamond had a book value of some Dollars 30m at the end of September. Last year it contributed Dollars 1.9m to profits on turnover of Dollars 24m. GE Capital will not be assuming Dollars 15.9m of Diamond's debt and liabilities. AAF said the net proceeds of the sale would be about Dollars 13.3m of which Pounds 4.3m would be used to reduce debt to about Pounds 24m, leaving gearing at between 110 per cent and 115 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin said here today that he was full of confidence about the  growth of the ties between China and Japan.    In an interview here this morning with Hatsuhisa Takashima,  chief commentator of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation [NHK],  Jiang said the Japanese political situation had changed on  several occasions.    But, he said, the friendly cooperation between the two  countries in every field was still growing in a stable way.    He said Japanese parties in and outside the government, and  Japan's people, share views on the expansion of bilateral good-  neighborly ties.    Jiang said the China-Japan friendship established on the  basis of their common interests and a long history of culture  and on the grass-roots level is full of strong vitality.    A statesman, he said, should seriously do practical things  to  conform to the historical trend of the times.    Jiang said the 20th century will come to an end. The  existence of a Sino-Japanese non-governmental committee on the  21st century showed that the two peoples are willing to take the  Sino-Japanese ties of mutual understanding, mutual trust,  equality and cooperation and common prosperity into the 21st  century, carrying on such friendship from generation to  generation.    "I have full confidence in the future development of such  relationship," he said.    When asked about China's stand on Japan's hope of becoming a  permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations,  Jiang said: "We have noticed Japan's hope of being a permanent  member of the U.N. Security Council so as to play a greater role  in international affairs.    "We appreciate and attach great importance to your desire,"  Jiang said.    He said China agreed to appropriately enlarge the security  council when the time was ripe, to reflect the changing  international situation and the facts of increasing membership  of the United Nations.    At the same time, Jiang said: "We should not take the poor  or the rich country as the only condition to consider this issue.    "It is imperative to fully demonstrate the principles of the  rational regional distribution and the coordination of  consultation," he said.    At present, the U.N. Security Council is in a stage of  discussing reform, so it needs to fully listen to the opinions  of member states.    Takashima, a well-known Japanese commentator on  international  affairs, has interviewed many countries' leaders. Chinese  President Jiang first met him in November, 1989.</p>

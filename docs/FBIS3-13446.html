			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First Friday prayers sermon by President Akbar </F> Hashemi-Rafsanjani at Tehran University on 11 March -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. [passage omitted] In the first sermon I will briefly  discuss the effects of prayers during the month of Ramadan and  the self-development in those days. I will also devote the  second sermon totally to the issue of Palestine and Jerusalem  and the global effects of such an important issue. [passage  omitted]    Our nation which pays attention to prayers and evaluates the  effects of its self-discipline should also recognize the value  of such practices and not permit the incorrect and immature  analysis of some so-called intellectuals, which is in fact  narrow mindedness, to enter their mind with the idea that  spending energy and time on prayers and fasting can be the cause  of underdevelopment in economic and other issues. Even if such  prayers did not exist and let us say that we could enjoy a  strong economy, then we would have become like one of those  advanced Western countries and that has never been our goal.    It is impossible to have a strong society without such basic  foundations for the development of human beings in today's  world. You can see how world arrogance and imperialism  repeatedly deal violent blows to the Third World countries  stopping them from getting up and standing on their own feet.  We see the source of our resistance in prayers even if that  might seem trivial and common to some, but prayers are deeply  wise and constructive.    My point in this sermon is that we use this harvest that we  have reaped from the holy month of Ramadan this year -- like  other years, it is not an exceptional year -- to preserve the  spirit of our piety throughout the year, especially since we are  on the eve of a new year. With that same asset we are today  rapidly taking the country forward in the face of so much  conspiracy and mischief.    As the country's chief executive I say that without the  presence of those earnest people on the scene the country could  not advance, with all its enemies, with the method with which it  is being rebuilt, and at this speed -- that we were able to  shrug off the new conspiracy of the arrogant powers about the  fall of the price of oil and go on our way, I see the secret in  those strong pillars of society and in the alertness of our  people.    One cannot help but admire a nation 30 percent of whose  income is taken away from it, but it continues its programs as  normal and does not declare a state of emergency. Despite all  the propaganda and wicked plans to dishearten the people --  which one can sometimes hear from certain uninformed, or perhaps  sincere, people inside the country -- the society continues on  its course.    We are now in the construction period. Our main slogan is  construction. The blow they intended to deal us was to close  that road to us. During the war they blockaded us to prevent us  from obtaining arms. Or they created havoc inside the country  to disrupt our security.    In the construction period they intend to take away the  tools  of our construction, which is the budget. But they see today  that they have come unstuck. [passage omitted]    The great big shock wave with which they had planned to  bring  us to our knees has passed over this society like a breeze, and  if there is any delay in some of the work the society is so  aware that it can understand well. [passage omitted]    I hope that the world of Islam fathoms clearly this correct  direction of Iran's movement and that it finds its way, as our  nation has, in Islam, the Koran, worship, contact with God,  self-sacrifice and hard work.

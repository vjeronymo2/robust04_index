			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Pilat report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F> "Crimea"]    [Text] An extraordinary session of the Crimean Tatar  People's Assembly is at an end. Assembly Chairman Mustafa  Dzhemilev, his deputy Rifat Chubarov, and other Assembly members  said in their addresses that in the series of acts of violence  that is gaining momentum in Crimea, the assassination of  Iskandar Mamedov is not the first act directed against the  Crimean Tatars. All these events, says the Assembly statement  made in connection with the escalation of violence in Crimea,  attest to the efforts by certain political forces to destabilize  the situation by inveigling Crimean Tatars into a wide-scale  conflict. The Assembly of the Crimean Tatar people, which  rejects violence in solving any questions, believes: "In the  situation that has taken shape, measures should be immediately  taken to resolutely cut short actions that threaten peace and  the fragile calm in Crimea." It is necessary, in the Assembly's  opinion, to stop crime in Crimea, which has appreciably grown  owing to the worsened political situation in the course of the  elections for Crimea's president and the preparations for the  elections for a new Supreme Soviet.    The Assembly finds it necessary to take measures to preserve  peace and accord on the peninsula. The statement says that a  special investigation group should be created on a  first-priority basis in Ukraine's prosecutor's office to carry  out a thorough and objective investigation into all acts of  violence and terror in Crimea. The Assembly demands that the  Supreme Soviets of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea should  "examine and bring into line the provisions of the Republic of  Crimea's constitution with the existing legislation of Ukraine  and with the requirements of the trilateral agreement between  the United States, Russia, and Ukraine on nuclear disarmament  and mutual security guarantees."</p>

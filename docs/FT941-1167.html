			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Smith urges European rates cut Mr John Smith yesterday called for an immediate co-ordinated cut in European interest rates to stimulate demand as tax rises begin to bite. The Labour leader used a speech to the Federation of Small Businesses in Edinburgh to portray Labour as the natural ally of small companies. It was a priority for Labour to ensure that the proportion of small businesses that made the transition into medium-sized enterprises was increased from only one in 50 at present, he said. The latest retail sales figures indicated that a cut in interest rates was needed, he added. They showed that consumer demand had fallen even before the new batch of tax increases took effect. In a speech that focused on the problems encountered by small businesses in raising finance, Mr Smith called for legislation to 'make sure that those who use late payment (of debts) as a matter of normal practice pay the costs of that credit.' He said companies should be required to publish statements on payment practice and payment records in their annual accounts. A 30-day period for payment of debt should be a standard in both the public and the private sectors. Commenting last night on the Labour leader's remarks, Lord Strathclyde, minister for small businesses, said the government was taking the idea of legislating on late payment 'fairly seriously', but there was 'no point in doing it unless it will make a difference'. He said the Federation of Small Businesses had told the government it did not regard legislation as the top priority. Welcoming recent moves to reduce the sector's dependence on overdraft finance, Mr Smith nevertheless described the number of companies which took advantage of the government's loan guarantee scheme for small firms as 'derisory'. The scheme - whose costs were reduced and scope broadened in the Budget a year ago - would have to be changed and improved if it was to have any real impact on access to finance, he said. Lord Strathclyde said the Budget changes had been 'a great success' with applications rising and defaults falling. Mr Smith gave a nod in the direction of the subsidised small business loan fund that small firm lobbyists have long called for, saying Labour might set up a private-sector managed investment fund to channel investment from elsewhere in the private sector. He said there was no reason why mutual guarantee schemes, of the type used to raise capital by companies in some European countries, could not be made to work in Britain. The Labour leader also stole some of the government's clothes, calling for a crackdown on unnecessary red tape and a network of 'one-stop shops' for business registration to help cut down on form-filling.</p>

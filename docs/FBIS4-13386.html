			<p>BFN     [Text] Appeal Public Attorney Munif 'Uwaydat today  announced that the Lebanese judiciary has lifted the diplomatic  immunity of the two Iraqi diplomats accused of assassinating  Iraqi oppositionist Talib al-Suhayl. He pointed out that now  that the diplomatic ties between Iraq and Lebanon are severed,  the two do not enjoy diplomatic immunity. Speaking to reporters  today, 'Uwaydat added that the two detained defendants will be  tried by the Lebanese judiciary.    [Paris AFP in English at 1317 GMT on 19 April, in a related  item reports: "The Lebanese Foreign Ministry notified Iraqi  charge d'affaires 'Awad Fakhri of Lebanon's decision to cut ties  with Iraq and told him that he had 72 hours to leave Lebanon  along with the embassy's other diplomats.    ["Fakhri said his country still considered that Khalaf and  Kazim were protected by their immunity, which Baghdad refused to  lift after a request from Lebanon last week. Baghdad has denied  any involvement in the murder.    ["Lebanon must respect the Vienna convention," which  regulates diplomatic ties between states, he said after leaving  the Lebanese Foreign Ministry. He declined to make other  statements."    [The AFP report continues: "Lebanon is also demanding that  Iraq hand over two other suspects -- embassy guard Hadi Hasan  who is believed to be the one who pulled the trigger and consul  'Ali Darwish -- who have sought refuge inside the embassy.    ["Police reinforcements have been deployed since last  Wednesday around the compound in the residential district of  al-Hazmiyah south of Beirut."]</p>

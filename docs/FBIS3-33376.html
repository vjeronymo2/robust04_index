At the end of the first  verifications they made of the Brazilian public accounts last  week, they came to the conclusion that not even the zero  operational deficit was achieved. The operational deficit  includes financial spending, and to have a zero deficit it is  necessary that the country achieve enough primary surplus to  compensate for paying the debt interest.    The government promised to achieve the zero operational  deficit. The IMF really wants an operational surplus that,  honestly speaking, is an unobtainable goal. But according to the  verifications made by the IMF team, not even the promise made by  the government is being fulfilled despite all the effort for the  fiscal adjustment being debated in Congress.    There is a good possibility that the Social Emergency Fund  will be approved in the second round this week. Even the  opposition congressmen admit they will have problems in bringing  the 293 deputies needed to debate any amendments. The economic  team only admits one problem: If new negotiations are needed,  the government has nothing to yield.    The team is preparing charts to clarify the Social Emergency  Fund's final version. So many changes were made that even the  deputies who take care of this matter in detail are confused  about how the fund is made up. The charts will be distributed to  the deputies by leader Luiz Carlos Santos.    If this effort does open the way for an agreement with the  IMF, part of Finance Minister Cardoso's strategy will be ruined.</p>

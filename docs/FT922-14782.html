			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / The Long View: First victims of Maastricht CAN EUROPE'S monetary structures stand the strain? Two of the European Community's biggest four countries face national elections in the next few days. A third, having just completed local elections in which the ruling party has performed poorly, has ousted its prime minister. These events come against the background of poor economic performance, with growth of not much more than 1 per cent in the EC during 1991, and prospects little if any better for 1992. The average unemployment rate is around 10 per cent outside Germany. Bond markets throughout Europe have become apprehensive. In Britain we are so obsessed with our own election campaign that it can be an effort to step back for a moment and look at the broader picture. Indeed, John Major's government has to bear responsibility for its own home-grown recession which relates to the domestic miscalculations from 1985 onwards. But the UK's recovery is threatened by a broader world slowdown which is affecting Japan and Germany, locomotives that until recently were still driving the global economy forward. In the US, George Bush is facing re-election problems largely because of economic disappointments. At least Americans have the freedom to use a full range of economic policy options to stimulate a recovery. So have the Japanese, who this week unveiled an economic package including lower interest rates. In the EC this freedom no longer exists, monetary policy has been surrendered to the Bundesbank. Only some four months after the intoxicating rhetoric and historical grandeur of Maastricht many of Europe's politicians are facing harsher local realities. In Italy, which votes this weekend, the damage may be no more than the emergence of some regional factions like the Lombardy League. But John Major seems likely to lose office, not because of any great popular enthusiasm about Labour but because too many voters face economic hardship. Yet it is the problems in France that are probably most central to the growing European economic crisis of confidence. This was the country that in the early 1980s knuckled down to the challenge of curing its historical weaknesses of inflation and political instability. It has eased its inflation down to, and below, German levels. Now that British borrowing levels are soaring France appears to be the only EC member state that can expect comfortably to comply with the famous Maastricht conditions for monetary union, including a budget deficit of no more than 3 per cent of GDP and total outstanding public sector debt of less than 60 per cent of GDP. In the capital markets France has been rewarded with a steadily reducing premium in the rate it has to pay on its government bonds compared with the Germans. As for short-term interest rates, on three-month money the rate on French francs is only  1/4 of a percentage point higher than on the D-Mark. The pound sterling pays 1 1/2 per cent more, the lira 2 1/4 per cent and the peseta 2 1/2 per cent. For these very real achievements the French Socialists might have expected some electoral recognition, but they have not received it. Instead Jean Le Pen is on the warpath, feeding off unemployment and regional recession, and the Socialists face disaster in next year's national elections. This week Edith Cresson, the former premier, paid the price, admittedly for more than just economic misfortunes. Her successor Pierre Beregovoy is well-regarded by the financial markets. His prospects in the country may be another matter. European interest rates now stick out a mile from the global list. This week Japanese yen money rates fell to under 5 per cent, much in line with dollar rates, and half the level of even the keenest EC rates. The UK and France are bravely forecasting that economic growth will accelerate later this year but it seems fanciful to suppose that a recovery of any strength can be achieved while interest rates are so high. But interest rates are determined by what is going on in Germany, and there seems no early prospect of any relief from Germany's lethal combination of anti-inflationary zeal at the Bundesbank, which holds short rates up, and fiscal imprudence by the government which is maintaining bond yields high throughout the EC. There is, of course, a conspiracy of silence about this in the British election campaign. All the parties are committed to maintaining sterling in the ERM at a central parity of DM2.95. This united stand has worked. Speculators have not dared to attack sterling on any scale during the campaign. But one-year money is at 11 1/4 per cent, showing that rates are regarded as more likely to rise than fall in the months ahead. The Tories must carry the blame for the past, but if Labour forms the next government it will quickly acquire responsibility for any failure of the economy to recover. If parliament is hung that responsibility might be assessed against Labour in hard votes at a second election quite soon. What could be more natural than to form a common cause with the otherwise doomed fellow-socialists of France and hatch plans to confront the Germans? For the time being Labour's leaders are maintaining their manifesto line. If interest rates have to go up after the election in order to maintain parity, they say, then so be it. They will do whatever is necessary. Before very long, however, the next British government may find itself facing a financial crisis. Bank shares are tumbling as concern grows about a new wave of bad debts, and there can be no adequate solution that does not include a sharp fall in interest rates. Europe's leaders have invested a formidable amount of political capital in EMU, nobody more than Beregovoy. But if they are ever to reach 1997 they must, as a first step, survive 1992.</p>

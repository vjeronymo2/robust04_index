			<p>BFN     [Text] Estonian Foreign Ministry's Vice-Chancellor Raul  Malk described the atmosphere at the 18th round of  Estonian-Russian talks completed in Moscow on Thursday as  unfavorable.    Speaking a a press conference in Tallinn, he noted that  Estonia did not expect special results from the talks, because  the difference over the main issue, the withdrawal of Russian  troops, was very serious. According to Malk, from the very  beginning the Russian delegation took an ultimatum position,  linking the withdrawal of troops to giving residence permits to  retired military pensioners and putting forward unjustified  demands. "In essence, there have been no talks on military  pensioners at all," he said.    At the same time, Malk characterized the talks on  humanitarian issues as "the most fruitful." "This is especially  evident compared to the previous rounds," he pointed out.    Addressing the border issues, Malk said that the prepared  but  not ratified agreement on support for border regions "had been  assigned to history."    Malk dismissed allegations of the Russian side that two  criminals who killed a Russian border guard on 1 April and  wounded another two had come from Estonian territory and had  returned there. "All these allegations were not confirmed," he  said.    The delegation's secretary, Ago Tiima, who attended the  press  conference also denies press reports about alleged serious  environmental pollution on the territory of the Russian military  unit in Viimsi near Tallinn on April 1. He said that eight  tonnes of mazut leaked into a ditch and the press described it  as an ecological disaster.    Tiiman noted that on Monday the site of the accident was  visited by officials of the Estonian Environmental Protection  and Foreign Ministries. "What they saw of course is unpleasant,  but it is not an ecological disaster," Tiiman said. "It would  not be such a serious event in the republic if the Russian side  had informed us at once and in detail about the accident," the  diplomat said.</p>

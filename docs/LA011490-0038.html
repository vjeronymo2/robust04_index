			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A YANK IN JAPAN  </P> <P> Concerning "The Mr. Know-It-All of Japan," Dec. 31:  </P> <P> I recently returned from two months of working as an entertainer in Tokyo. I  often tuned in "at any hour of the day or night" and I saw Dave Spector only  once on television.  </P> <P> His command of the language was indeed admirable, but his incredibly  self-centered, egomaniacal attitude is pathetic.  </P> <P> For him to say, in Alan Brown's article, that "people from Utah don't count" or  that he "should have gone back and continued" his career (as if making $500,000  in Japan is somehow not as good as making it in the United States) is  indicative of his own "warped look at life."  </P> <P> DAVID CHESTER, Los Angeles  </P> <P>  In Brown's article, Spector is quoted as saying that two of three other  Americans getting wide exposure on Japanese TV are Mormons, and he adds: "Talk  about a warped look at life."  </P> <P> </P></p>

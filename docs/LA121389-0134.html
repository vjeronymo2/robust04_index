			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER CONTRACTS FOR FARMERS  </P> <P> The Times' editorial "Not Exactly a Watertight Deal" (Dec. 1) suggests that the  federal government provide water to California farmers under "temporary  contracts" while environmental impact studies are pending, studies which, by  your own estimate, could take three to five years.  </P> <P> To understand the reality of such a suggestion, next time you apply for a  mortgage to buy a home, try telling the lender that you are "temporarily  employed." Then, tell the lender that there is a study under way which may  adversely impact your employment. Just for good measure, tell the lender that  there is likely to be litigation over that study. That is the very situation  farmers and local communities would find themselves with temporary water  service contracts.  </P> <P> Department of the Interior officials renewed the water contracts of 28  irrigation districts because they are obligated to do so under law. The  department is absolutely correct in stating that, if environmental impact  studies indicate that policies should be altered, those alterations can be  implemented when the studies are complete.  </P> <P> It should be noted that in an earlier editorial The Times reminded us that the  President's Council on Environmental Quality had recommended an EIS be done  before contracts are renewed. It is interesting that the chairman of the  council is now calling Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan's decision "a sensible  balancing between environmental concerns and the need to provide water."  </P> <P> If The Times truly wants to see environmental restoration, it should recognize  Lujan's call for an initiative to restore the San Joaquin River as a move in  the right direction, because it signals a willingness to enhance the valley's  environment without punishing farmers and valley communities.  </P> <P> STEPHEN K.

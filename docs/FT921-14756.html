			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Japan Foreign buyers who pumped a net Y112bn into Japanese equities last month must be feeling frustrated. Once again, the Nikkei index was hovering yesterday uncomfortably close to the levels which pose capital adequacy problems for the banks. Nor is there any particular reason why it should recover in the short term, now that the market seems to have decided to ignore last month's interest rate cut. Corporate profits have fallen further than expected, and there is again a hint of political scandal. Retail buyers are disillusioned. The tokkin funds, through which companies invest surplus cash, are due to become net sellers as they stock up liquidity before the end of the financial year. Futures arbitrage activity could also put pressure on physical equities. Yet this is the fifth time since last August that the index has slid to the mid-21,000 range. That suggests a fairly solid floor around these levels. Admittedly the index could fall steeply were it to break out of this range, possibly returning to the lows around 20,000 seen in October 1990. But the weakness should not last, both because equities would then be cheap in absolute terms and because institutional investors would come under pressure to prevent a banking crisis by supporting the market. The downside risk is thus limited. Even if there is no solid rally till the new financial year begins in April, foreign investors might recall that the chances of currency gain look to be greater now than later in the year.</p>

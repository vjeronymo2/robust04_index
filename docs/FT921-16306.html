			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A burning land issue IF SOMEONE burnt garden refuse on a small piece of land on a roadside bank outside the boundary of his property for a few days each year, would he be able to claim adverse ownership after 12 years? No. the use would not amount to adverse possession, and in fact would not even constitute possession at all. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Business and the Environment: Clear skies through long-term vision - Tokyo's example / Urban air pollution MOSS may not gather on rolling stones but it is growing in Tokyo's parks again. When scientists at Tokyo's Metropolitan Research Institute for Environmental Protection looked for this essential component of Japanese gardens 20 years ago, they found none. Following drastic cuts in sulphur dioxide levels in Tokyo air since the last survey, the fuzzy green stuff is once again gracing trees throughout the city. The density of sulphur dioxide, one of worst air pollutants, is less than an eighth of its 1966 peak. 'In Tokyo we have virtually solved the problem,' says Noburu Yoshino, chief of automobile pollution with the Tokyo metropolitan government. None the less, the levels of particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and ozone remain unacceptably high. Walking on the pavement of a congested Tokyo street is more pleasant than in London, for example, but no one ought to breathe too deeply. Tokyo's air pollution crisis was a product of the density of population and industrial plant in the Tokyo area combined with the breakneck pace of economic development during the 1960s. Japan was determined to put post-war poverty behind, and industrial growth was pursued with little regard for side effects, such as environmental degradation. By the late 1960s, however, a public backlash had gathered strength at a time when the ruling Liberal Democratic Party was losing electoral support. A consensus developed that something had to be done. The first target was sulphur emissions, caused primarily by industry. In 1970 the government announced a drastic reduction in the level of sulphur permitted in fuel. The new limit was 0.5 per cent, compared with three to four per cent in imported crude oil. The government's next target was carbon monoxide, an important component of automobile exhaust. The Japanese government required that all new cars sold in Japan from 1975 be fitted with catalytic converters. The devices removed 95 per cent of carbon monoxide from exhaust. Use of catalytic converters also led to the gradual introduction of lead-free petrol, since lead fouls the catalyst. Nearly 100 per cent of petrol sold in Japan is now unleaded. Although reducing atmospheric lead was never a principal goal, this has been a welcome side effect. Sulphur and carbon monoxide, however, were the easy steps. From here the going will be considerably tougher. Suspended particulate matter: The concentration of suspended particulate matter (mainly dust and soot) in the air fell sharply in the late 1970s, but has since remained high. The initial decline was a result in part of switching from heavy fuel oil to gas oil and natural gas. In addition, the government required electrostatic precipitators to be installed on smokestacks where particulate matter is a problem. Further progress will be difficult and expensive. Yoshino says that 30 per cent of the problem is from nature, and cannot be controlled. Another 30 per cent of particulate matter is generated by chemical reactions of other pollutants, such as nitrogen and sulphuric acids. Some 20 to 30 per cent of the total is caused by the carbon particles from diesel fuel. NOx: The level of nitrogen oxides in Tokyo's air has remained stubbornly high since the late 1960s. While the government has fixed a target of reducing NOx by 50 per cent in 10 years, it has no concrete method of achieving this. 'We are depending on a technological breakthrough,' says Yoshino. This could be a new catalyst, which car companies the world over are researching, use of methanol engines or electrically-powered cars. Ozone: Photochemical oxidants, experienced as urban smog, are also an enduring problem that is occasionally severe enough for the city government to order some plants to cease operating. Barring an unforeseen technical breakthrough, significant progress on particulate matter, NOx and ozone is difficult to imagine without a reduction in the activities, particularly automobile traffic, that cause them. For Tokyo, however, this is especially hard to engineer. The city already has superb public transportation, so there is little hope of coaxing more commuters out of cars by offering a better alternative. Road pricing schemes look especially hard to implement because traffic congestion is spread over a huge area, rather than in the centre of the city. Much of the diesel fuel is also consumed by delivery trucks, which are the economic lifeline of the city. Further progress is likely to come slowly, if at all. In the meantime, city residents can console themselves that at least the moss does not seem to mind. Next week's article will focus on Athens.</p>

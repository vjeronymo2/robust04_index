			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / From one bright idea to another: How the successor to the community charge could suffer similar pitfalls Once upon a time there was a bright and enthusiastic secretary of state for the environment, called Nicholas Ridley, who was particularly enthusiastic about a bright new idea called the community charge. Introducing the new idea to the House of Commons in December 1987, he announced that 'every authority will be able to levy exactly the same community charge - Pounds 178 this year - to provide a standard level of service efficiently. A higher charge will be a direct result of higher spending, a lower one will mean greater efficiency and prudence'. A little less than two years later, the UK found itself with another bright, but less enthusiastic secretary of state, called Chris Patten. One reason for his lack of enthusiasm was the Treasury's pronounced unwillingness to finance the bright new idea. In November 1989 he announced that charge-payers in England were now expected to pay an average community charge of Pounds 278 in the coming financial year. When the community charge - or poll tax as it came to be called - was introduced, its average level in England turned out to be Pounds 357. In just two and a half years, the starting level of the new tax had doubled (though after the reduction schemes and transitional reliefs and income support, the average actually paid was 'only' Pounds 285). How was it possible for the level of the community charge to exceed that initially expected by so huge a margin? The answer lies in its leverage. All local authority spending above government assumptions fell on a tax that accounted for about a quarter of local authority current spending and 20 per cent of total spending. Given this degree of leverage, the chances of huge divergences from government expectations were high. But was that not the whole point of the exercise? Not, as the government soon learned, if the overshoot could be laid at its own door rather than that of the local authorities. The difference between the assumption in November 1989 and the outcome a few months later was not due to local profligacy, but to inflation. Mr Patten was forced by Mr Nigel Lawson's Treasury to assume that local authority expenditure would increase by 3.8 per cent in the following financial year. This was below the Treasury's forecast of 5 3/4 per cent for the increase in the retail prices index in the year to December 1990, itself enormously below the outcome of 10 per cent. The community charge was killed off by the Treasury. A tax designed to make any increases in the burden upon it as unpopular as possible was asked in 1990-91 to cover a higher proportion of local authority spending than in any year of the 1980s. Now the UK has another bright, enthusiastic secretary of state for the environment. Indeed, he is secretary of state, partly because of his party's panic over the old bright idea. He has a new bright idea. It is called the council tax. Will the new bright idea suffer the fate of the old bright idea? Mr Michael Heseltine, the once and present secretary of state for the environment, says that this year a couple living in a house in the middle of his seven bands and under a council that spends in accordance with his department's Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) would pay Pounds 400. A couple living in the lowest band would pay Pounds 267, while a couple in the most expensive would pay Pounds 668. Just think of the hullabaloo if all those numbers were to double by April 1993. Could that happen? One reason that it might is Mr Heseltine's success in raping the Treasury. By persuading the Treasury to increase value added tax by two and a half percentage points in the Budget and then set the Pounds 4 1/4 bn proceeds against the community charge, he has lowered the proportion of current English local spending covered by the community charge to 16 per cent. Of total local authority spending in the UK, the community charge will cover a mere 11 per cent. Suppose that total local spending in 1993-94 were to be around 10 per cent higher than the government hopes, but that there were to be no increase in central government support for local authorities. Then the new council tax would be double Mr Heseltine's current estimates. Nothing, it would seem, could be more likely than that, given the Treasury's dreadful forecasting record on inflation and the fact that the closest approximation to inflation in local spending is not the retail price index, but the increase in earnings. Is the Treasury going to increase its contribution by the rate of pay inflation? One must wonder, particularly when one recalls that, in a moment of dementia, the increase in the business rate, now a national tax earmarked to local spending, was limited to the increase in the retail price index. That has worked out well for the government this year. Next year it will not. In the long run the retail price index will rise perhaps two and a half percentage points less rapidly than local authority costs, this being the long run increase in real wages. Thus, grants from the Treasury to local government would probably have to rise still faster than local authority costs if the share of spending to be met by the council tax were to be kept where it is now expected to be. The problem of leverage does not only arise for the burden of locally set taxation overall. It also arises across councils. Wandsworth will have no community charge this year, while Lambeth's charge for two adults will be Pounds 901. For the median band of the council tax, the taxes would be Pounds 135 and Pounds 501, respectively. Yet the spending of the two councils diverges only modestly from the Department of the Environment's assessment of needs: plus 6.5 per cent for Lambeth and minus 8.7 per cent for Wandsworth. Out of these divergences from what the man in Whitehall thinks he knows best, vast differences in taxation emerge. The government has never shown itself particularly concerned about such inequities. But it is concerned about huge council bills. The secretary of state may comfort himself with the thought that this time an election comes between announcing the bright new idea and putting it into effect. He may hope that the Treasury will prove reasonable thereafter. But, if the worst comes to the worst, he will cap every council in sight. Like any modern fairy story, this one will not have a happy ending. It was the tax that disappeared last time. This time it is more likely to be what remains of discretionary local services. If readers want clean streets, they had better get used to picking up the rubbish themselves.</p>

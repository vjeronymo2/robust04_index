			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Filipinos ponder choices as presidential election nears: Jose Galang looks at the candidates' backgrounds and their chances of succeeding Mrs Corazon Aquino as head of state THE PROBLEM with Filipinos, it is often observed, is that everyone wants to be leader. This perhaps is the best explanation for the large number of candidates vying for national and local government positions in next Monday's general election. There are seven candidates for president. Some 80,000 more are competing for nearly 16,980 other positions - from vice-president to town mayors and councillors. Given the reputation also of most local politicians as poor losers, the immediate task of unifying the nation after the bruising 90-day campaign appears most daunting for the winners. No clear winner is emerging among the presidential contenders. Mrs Miriam Defensor Santiago, a former judge and immigration commissioner, has consistently topped the polls. But most analysts trivialise these, arguing that political machinery of the big parties will play a big role. Mrs Santiago is running for the newly formed People's Reform Party which pegs its agenda on a crusade against corruption in government. The party was the only one not able to gain official accreditation from the Commission on Elections (Comelec), which recognised only six. Comelec accreditation is important because it authorises the party to deploy 'watchers' at the polling centres and intervene in activities in case of questionable acts. Parties accredited are also entitled to copies of the Comelec certificate of canvas, the document on which any protests can be based. An awesome machinery is what Mr Ramon Mitra, speaker of the House of Representatives, is banking on. He is the standard bearer of the majority Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP), under whose wings the bulk of incumbent officials are standing. The LDP's bid has also been boosted recently by the 'implied' endorsement of Cardinal Jaime Sin, head of the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Manila, whose influence over the predominantly Catholic population is substantial. However, Mr Mitra's image as a 'traditional politician' (referring to old-style politics of patronage and largesse) is a handicap. The recent discovery of LDP campaign printing materials at the House of Representatives' printing office, furthermore, has imperilled his bid. He and his entire line-up could be disqualified if his involvement is proven. The Comelec is conducting an inquiry into the discovery of the printing materials at the House in a 'raid' by leaders of the Lakas Edsa-National Union of Christian Democrats, which is fielding Mr Fidel Ramos, former defence chief. LDP officials, attempting to defelect attention from the discovery, have warned that the 'raid' could be a preview of the militarist rule of Mr Ramos if he wins. Mr Ramos was head of the Philippine Constabulary, regarded as the most undisciplined of the four military units during the martial law government of former president Ferdinand Marcos. The human-rights record of the military during Marcos' rule has been raked up as a campaign issue against Mr Ramos. Indeed, the past continues to hound most candidates in an election that should be focusing on how the country could move briskly into the future. Two big symbols of the excesses of the Marcos government - his widow Imelda and his best-known crony Mr Eduardo Cojuangco - are also among the presidential hopefuls. But while Mrs Marcos has only a slim chance, Mr Cojuangco is considered one of the frontrunners at the home stretch. Mr Cojuangco has diversified investments in local industries and is one of the few candidates seen capable of putting up a credible programme to rev up the economy. However, his involvement in monopolist policies in the Marcos era, such as that in the coconut industry, is proving to be a tough stain to expunge. Mr Marcos allegedly provided Mr Cojuangco with a large financial base, through the United Coconut Planters Bank, in the form of a levy on the coconut industry. Collected between 1973 and 1982, the levy brought in at least 9.7bn pesos, of which a large part was apparently permitted to be used by Mr Cojuangco to buy into various businesses, including San Miguel Corporation, the country's largest industrial entity. Along with Mrs Santiago, the only other candidates who have not been linked to the tarnished past are Mr Salvador Laurel, Mrs Aquino's estranged vice-president, and Mr Jovito Salonga, former Senate president. Mr Laurel, owing to his bitter falling out with the Aquino administration, has marginalised himself over the past years. Mr Salonga, on the other hand, appears to offer a vision for the future which so far has been attracting academics and certain left-leaning groups. However, many of the country's jobless remember Mr Salonga's rejection last year of a treaty to extend the stay of the US military facilities here. Although their withdrawal will be not be completed until this summer, the bases are now almost bare, as are the cupboards of the families who made their livings there. Unemployment is also a major problem in rural areas, where most of the 65 per cent of the population living below the poverty line reside. Whoever replaces Mrs Aquino after the May 11 election may not enjoy the same majority which swept her to power in 1986. However, he or she may be able to provide the decisive leadership that Mrs Aquino clearly lacked .</p>

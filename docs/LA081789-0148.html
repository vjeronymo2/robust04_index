			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BRENTWOOD;  </P> <P> TENANTS BEAT EXIT DEADLINE  </P> <P> A developer who evicted nearly all the apartment residents on the north side of  an entire city block said that most of the tenants have vacated their  apartments well before the Sept. 1 deadline.  </P> <P> The offer of a $1,000 bonus for leaving by July 31 helped speed the departure  of about 100 residents, said a spokesman for Bancorp Development, which  assembled the row of nine small buildings on Kiowa Avenue over the past year  and a half. Only three tenants are left.  </P> <P> In addition to the bonus, tenants were to be paid relocation benefits required  under city law, including a basic payment of $2,000 each and an additional  $3,000 for disabled residents, those 62 or older, and parents with minor  children.  </P> <P> Bancorp Development has yet to decide whether apartments or condominiums will  be built at the site once the 25-year-old buildings now occupying the north  side of the block near San Vicente Boulevard are removed, the spokesman said.  </P></p>

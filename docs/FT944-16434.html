			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Cable and Wireless The prospects for the Chinese telecommunications market can, appropriately enough, be described in terms of telephone numbers: at least Dollars 100bn (Pounds 63.2bn) to be spent between now and the end of the century and exponential growth in the number of telephone lines. In this context, Cable &amp; Wireless's announcement yesterday about a possible Dollars 300m investment in two Chinese projects is drop in the ocean - but an important one none the less. If the joint ventures come off, C&amp;W stands to win a commanding position in the fledgling mobile telephones market in Beijing, and to capture the bulk of telephone traffic between Hong Kong and the Chinese capital. It will moreover be well positioned for further opening of the market - hence a jubilant reaction from the UK and Hong Kong stock markets. However, the market reaction was driven more by sentiment than an assessment of what Hongkong Telecom - C&amp;W's 57.5 per cent owned subsidiary - has so far achieved in its negotiations with China's telecoms authorities. The details of the contracts have still to be worked out and C&amp;W's hopes of investing in China on the basis of profit-sharing may well be dashed. China has not definitively dropped its objections to foreign companies taking direct equity participation in the sensitive telecoms sector. Still, the China connection is positive for C&amp;W, which generated nearly two-thirds of its operating profits from Hongkong Telecom last year. But investors who like the story are more likely to want to buy shares in the Hongkong company direct. Long-term questions about C&amp;W's future strategic orientation remain, especially now that Mercury is entering a low growth phase.</p>

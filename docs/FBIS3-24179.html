			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yakov Plyays, doctor of historical sciences: </F> "About the Present and Future of the CIS; Notes on the  National-State Structure of the Former USSR"]    [Text]  <H5>  Opinion </H5>   Attempts to find a new, effective form of national-state  structure of the former USSR have not yet been crowned with  success. The reason for this is mainly the complexity and  arduousness of this matter and, in addition, the errors of  politicians, both former and current. The most significant error  on this path, in my opinion, was the signing of the Belovezha  agreement by the leaders of three republics on 8 December 1991  without the concurrence and even against the will of the people  who in March of that same year had expressed themselves for the  preservation of the USSR.    The Belovezha act was an error, because it disrupted the  process of the reformation of the USSR and its transformation  from a unitary state, if not into a genuinely federative one,  then at least into a confederative state. As a result, instead  of a directed, objectively necessary, and extremely important  process of reformation, we got an unmanageable, chaotic process  of a hasty, in many ways senseless, "parade of sovereignties"  and the collapse of both the former USSR and also of its  component parts. This could not help but have a negative effect  on all aspects of life of the former Union: on the economy,  politics, culture, humanitarian relations, etc.    The politicians who signed the agreement on the creation of  the CIS justified their decision by the fact that attempts to  reform the Union failed one after the other, that it would not  have been possible to preserve it under any circumstances, and  that, therefore, nothing remained except to agree to a new form  of mutual relations--the Commonwealth of Independent States.    Explanations such as this (or, more accurately,  justifications) seem to me, to put it mildly, incorrect. Mainly  because the process of reformation, albeit with great  difficulty, was moving forward, and I am confident: It would  have been crowned with success sooner or later.    In justifying the signing of the Belovezha agreement,  reference is also made to the categorical nonconcurrence and  lack of desire of Ukraine to enter into any kind of new union,  which without it allegedly would be inconceivable. From my  standpoint, this is also an incorrect position. I think that  even if Ukraine did not agree to join the new union, it would  have to be created without it. The situation sooner or later  would have forced the most zealous Ukrainian separatists and  nationalists to join the new union. Especially because in its  essence it really would be new. What is happening now confirms  such a conclusion. Getting to the point, present-day Ukraine  already agrees to join an economic union, and it is hardly worth  doubting that with time it will also agree to join other unions  within the scope of the CIS. The realization is sinking deeper  and deeper into the consciousness of the masses, and into the  consciousness of the politicians, that abstract freedom, or  freedom in itself, is not worth a lot if it does not have an  appropriate material or other base, if it cannot be used for the  welfare of a majority of the population, and if it only brings  grief and difficulties for millions of ordinary people.    After three years, bitter experience has now proved that  which in March 1991 in the all-Union referendum prompted common  sense and a healthy instinct. It was the rapid and reckless  collapse that was the main source of a majority of today's  troubles of the inhabitants of the CIS, and especially of their  economic difficulties. It follows from this that in order to  correct the situation, it is necessary for the post-Soviet  state, without putting it off, to join in union relationships.  But at the same time, it must be clearly understood that there  can be no question of the former Union relationships. Only a new  type of union can be at issue.    In creating it, in my opinion, it is necessary to take into  account several fundamental facts. And the following most of all.    1. A majority of the former Soviet republics, and most of  all  those that were not federations, judging by everything, will  become federations. For example, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Moldova,  and Ukraine, however absurd and undesirable it would seem now to  some politicians. The development of events could lead to this  even in some post-Soviet Asiatic countries in which the national  liberation struggle of small nations is already flaring up.    2. The Soviet Union cannot objectively be restored to its  own  previous form. But in the course of centuries (and especially  during the decades of the Soviet period), the component parts of  the former USSR, their economies and other spheres of social  life became so knitted and intertwined, that as a matter of fact  a single organism was formed which, of course, cannot and will  not function normally in a torn-apart condition no matter how  much this would be forced. But this organism was developed  inharmoniously and disproportionately. We already knew very  well, for example, that the VPK [military-industrial complex]  and certain other spheres enjoyed excessive privileges and  resources. It follows from this that in creating a new union it  was necessary to get rid of these defects, first and foremost  owing to the structural restructuring of the economy.    3. The unequal and nonequivalent relations among the  republics that manifested themselves, on the one hand, in the  fact that the center (Kremlin) dictated and, on the other hand,  in the fact that by order of this same center, Russia gave the  outskirts much of what it vitally needed itself, must remain in  the past forever, no matter how much someone from Moscow or on  the periphery would like the reverse.    It follows from all of this that the problem of changing the  essence of the relations among the former parts of the USSR is  very complicated, but it became even more complicated when in  December 1991 the process of the reformation of the Union was  disrupted and the broken-up parts started to get farther and  farther away from each other, each creating its special  socioeconomic system. Today, it is already more difficult than a  year or two years ago to unite these parts, although centripetal  forces are also building up. Of course, the question can also be  put in a different way: Why is it absolutely necessary to unite?  Perhaps to create a genuine commonwealth of independent states?  In my opinion, in the case of the former republics of the USSR,  such a form as a commonwealth is obviously inadequate (in  contrast, for example, to that commonwealth of nations that  Great Britain created in its time). Not so much because it does  not allow the reformation of the former Union as fast as  possible and more effectively, and (which is most important of  all) with the least costs for everyone, especially for the  population of the CIS, but because the process of reformation  could be disrupted completely. In failing to bear the burdens of  reorganization of the totalitarian system, the people of the  former Union republics can express themselves simply for a  return to the old and bring forces to power that will come out  in support of this. This will mean that the historical mission  that was entrusted to all former Soviet republics and that  consists of imperative changes in the socioeconomic system will  not be fulfilled. But this chance, which history gave us, will  be missed once again.    Another variant of the negative development of events--the  construction of wild capitalism (it is this variant that is  being conducted now before our eyes)--also will not bring us  closer to the desired objective--a civilized, modern society.    4. Rather intensive processes are developing not only in the  republics of the near abroad, but also in Russia itself, that  are leading to its reorganization into either a genuine  federation or into a federation with elements of a  confederation. The recent example of the signing of the treaty  between Russia and Tatarstan is a graphic illustration of this.  If we do not forget that other autonomous republics, krays, and  oblasts are also not only dreaming of something like this, but  are persistently pressing for their own, then it can be asserted  with confidence that "the process has started." (What is more, I  think that in signing the treaty with Tatarstan, Russia set a  good example for other countries of the CIS, in particular the  states of the Transcaucasus.) And this is not a process of  dissolution, as many claim, but a process of reformation. It  should not be feared, nor should attempts be made to turn it  backwards. Not so much because such efforts will be fruitless,  but because they obviously will lead to opposite results.    Therefore, as it seems to me, it is necessary to meet this  process halfway deliberately, directing it and not allowing it  to turn into one that is rapid and out of control, and with all  our strength to prevent a repetition of the errors of the  collapse of the Union in 1991. If this is not done, then an  enormous tragedy, which will be the consequence of the breakup  of Russia, cannot be avoided. The dissolution of Russia is  possible now only by reforming the mutual relations between the  subjects of the Federation in Russia itself, and by reducing the  role of the center and increasing the independence of the  regions. In other words, under current conditions, the power of  Russia should begin not in the center, but in the regions that  comprise it. The center should behave like a wise and capable  regulator of the basic social processes in the country, and not  like a monster that is feared by everyone and that everyone is  striving to get rid of.    What is the general conclusion?    The present CIS is an ineffective formation, and it is  generally not very viable. It is necessary to acknowledge this  honestly and, boldly abandoning it, to shift to the creation of  a confederative union of Eurasian states, keeping in mind that  with time it could develop into a more durable national-state  formation.</p>

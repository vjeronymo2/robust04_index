			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: By George, he's got it] Since the Bank of England is not going to be independent, it matters rather less who is going to be its governor. The choice of Mr Eddie George, announced with characteristic abruptness last night, is safe but uninspiring. As deputy governor, Mr George has been actively involved in the Bank's affairs during a period when it has been found wanting in two of its most important activities. It failed in its bank supervisory role to deal early enough with the troubles at BCCI. It was also a willing party to the UK's stubborn determination to maintain an unrealistic exchange rate within the ERM even when the damage to the economy was becoming obvious. Mr George is an intelligent and articulate man with considerable technical central banking skills. That makes him the obvious choice in a field which did not offer any candidate with overwhelming appeal. The other leading contender, Sir David Scholey of SG Warburg, might have been seen as too much of a City spokesman, with no direct experience of monetary policy. Mr George went out of his way last night to stress that his overriding task was to work for price stability. More startling is the appointment of a journalist as deputy governor. Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea could be seen as an ideas man who will inject some vigour and originality into the policy debate; at The Economist he displayed fervent support for monetary discipline and the ERM exchange rate. But what is needed in Britain is a fresh approach to policy-making. These appointments suggest the prime minister is still hankering after old ideas. After the trauma of September 16 a more open-minded approach to policy-making was promised. That now looks as conveniently forgotten as the original exchange rate pledge.</p>

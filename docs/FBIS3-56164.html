In an interview with journalists on Thursday, Chachua  explained his call by the fact that the state of emergency  imposed in the city on September 20, 1993 for two months and  then prolonged for another two months has failed to restore law  and order and combat crime in the capital.    Chachua stressed that at least 15,000 to 20,000 people are  needed to keep up order in the city. At present the total  number of Interior Ministry and regional police troops in the  whole republic does not exceed 25,000 people.    Chachua said that during the state of emergency law  enforcement bodies have confiscated 160 sub-machine guns, six  machine guns, three grenade launchers, about 70 grenades, large  amounts of ammunition and explosives and even one large-caliber  gun from an armoured personnel carrier.    One to two out of 100 crimes reported in Tbilisi are  committed at night when a curfew is in effect, the commandant  said.</p>

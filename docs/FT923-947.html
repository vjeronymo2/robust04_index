			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Time to assess Mr Clinton WHEN SOME 400 leading US businessmen, some of them big Republican contributors in the past, declare their support for the president's November opponent, Governor Bill Clinton, it is time to take the US opinion polls seriously. The election was always Mr Bush's to lose, and the evidence continues to suggest that he will duly lose it. If he does, America's partners will lose a long-familiar friend, whose prime interest - fatally, perhaps, for his re-election hopes - was foreign policy, and will have to come to terms with a successor who is, internationally, a virtual unknown. This is hardly a novelty. The US system usually finds its leaders from domestic politics, rather than from the experienced cabinet hands who normally succeed to the leaderships of European political parties. Presidents Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Ford, Carter and Reagan were each accused in their time of dangerous navety in foreign affairs; they did not do notably worse than the experienced presidents, Nixon and Bush. The fact that Mr Clinton will find it easier than Mr Bush has done to shed the expensive trappings of the cold war may even prove an advantage, especially in restraining the US budget deficit. However, the main problem of the present day is recession rather than ideology, so Mr Clinton's economic policies will be of far more interest to his partners than his foreign policy. Some of his speeches during the campaign have shown disturbing protectionist undertones, and his opponents have painted him as a covert liberal, whose promises of fiscal restraint are not to be believed. Only an extreme optimist would believe that the deficit reduction sums set out in his campaign platform add up. Fortunately, there is a good deal of evidence that Mr Clinton is concealing conservative rather than liberal tendencies. His record in Arkansas is of a tight and sometimes tough administrator, prepared to confront extravagance and to do some of the things, such as imposing performance-related pay on public servants, which are still only agenda items for Britain's Conservative government. He has brought new enterprise, and some prosperity, to a previously depressed southern state. His campaign proposals for a tough reform of the welfare system and for a cap on health spending are not those of a soft-hearted liberal. The rumour that he would try to recruit Mr Paul Volcker as Treasury secretary is still more suggestive. His demand for a line-item veto, giving him the power to block purely vote-buying spending proposals, steals a long-standing item from the Bush agenda. The difference is that Mr Clinton, working with a Congress of his own party, and with many new members free of long-standing political debts, might get it enacted. This political change, coupled with Mr Clinton's freedom from personal political debts, is the strongest reason for believing that a Clinton administration would develop a new, activist style. He believes that government action, mainly through large investment in education and the infrastructure, can secure better growth. Those who believe that recession is the biggest world threat might welcome a Clinton victory. Those who believe, with the IMF, that US and German fiscal deficits are the biggest bar to recovery, will still have some reservations.</p>

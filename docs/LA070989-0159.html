			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> U.S. Customs Service surveillance planes watched a plane drop bales of cocaine  to a speedboat just inside Cuban waters, then withdrew as Cuban MIG fighters  approached. A few hours later, federal agents recovered 1,600 pounds of cocaine  from the speedboat, found abandoned 20 miles south of Miami, said Patrick  O'Brien, U.S. customs special agent in charge for South Florida. "The crackdown  in Cuba has done little to stop the flow of drugs," O'Brien said. He said the  seizure is significant because it follows a Cuban crackdown on drugs that has  reached the highest levels of the Communist island nation's government.  </P></p>

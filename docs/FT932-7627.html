			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Letter: Lavishness of dinner in eye of the beholder Sir, Your reporter David Owen writes of a 'lavish dinner' to mark the chancellor's 21st anniversary as member of parliament for Kingston-upon-Thames ('Knives out for Lamont again', May 15). As somebody who was also there I can confirm that it was a very pleasant and convivial occasion, but 'lavish dinner'? - it depends on one's standards. David Owen also refers to 'days when Conservative governments used sometimes to win mid-term by-elections'. In fact, Norman Lamont won the Kingston by-election in May 1972 with a negligible swing against a Conservative government nearly two years into office. This was attributable to his impressive qualities as a candidate, the legacy of the retiring member John Boyd-Carpenter, and an efficient Conservative organisation with more than 6,000 members. David Ives, 76 Florin Court, 6-9 Charterhouse Square, London EC1</p>

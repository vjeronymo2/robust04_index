			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Ryland worth up to Pounds 30m in float Ryland Group, the family-owned vehicle distribution group, yesterday announced plans for a stock market flotation valuing the company at between Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m. The move follows a rapid expansion of the Midlands-based group, which has spent Pounds 1.5m on new dealerships this year, giving it a network of 25 showrooms across the country. Mr Peter Whale, chairman and chief executive, hinted that funds raised by the flotation, by way of a placing sponsored by Albert E Sharp,would be used to accelerate the group's expansion prog-ramme. 'We expect to raise between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m and that will give us greater flexibility in financing acquisitions,' said Mr Whale, a grandson of Mr Harry Whale, who started the business in 1951 by selling trucks in Birmingham. Since then it has established distribution agreements with manufacturers including BMW, Mercedes, Nissan, Vauxhall, Toyota, Honda, Renault and Ford. The timing of the flotation has also been influenced by resurgent demand for new and used cars in the past year. Buoyant sales helped Ryland increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 773,000 to Pounds 2m in the year to April 30. Operating profits moved ahead from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 3m on increased turnover of Pounds 190m against Pounds 157m. Following the placing, the Whale family's holding in the company is expected to dec-line from 65 per cent to between 30 per cent and 40 per cent.</p>

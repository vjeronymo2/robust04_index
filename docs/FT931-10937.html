			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major defends workfare - Proposals may mean long-term jobless face greater compulsion THE government would not shrink from considering radical options to introduce workfare-style schemes, Mr John Major said yesterday. He emphasised that the aim would be to keep people who were unemployed 'in touch with the world of work'. Challenged at Commons question time about the prospect of requiring the unemployed to carry out some activity in return for state benefit, the prime minister said that might mean extending the element of compulsion present now in the Restart scheme for the long-term unemployed. There will be a two-stage process. First proposals from the group of senior ministers discussing employment - chaired by Lord Wakeham, the leader of the Lords - could be announced even before the Budget in mid-March. These might include expanding existing employment schemes. More radical plans, which are still at an early stage, would follow. Mr Major's speech on Wednesday was discussed by senior ministers at a political meeting after a cabinet meeting yesterday morning, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, had a separate meeting with Mr Major afterwards. Mrs Shephard has previously criticised the idea of a general workfare scheme, and even after Mr Major's speech, she made clear her reservations about a single scheme to cover all 3m or so unemployed. 'If by workfare it is meant we should treat all unemployed people in the same way as if they were not individuals . . . of course we would rule that out,' she said. Downing Street said that the approach was to look at different schemes for different categories of unemployed, depending on why they were having difficulty finding work. The Treasury will be especially uneasy at the cost of any new scheme, especially as Downing Street has said that there might be two rates of benefit, with a few pounds more a week for those taking up some activity. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is thought to be among workfare's main supporters in the government. Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, may see the initiative as strengthening his efforts to crack down to 'scroungers'. While there seems to be little opposition within the Tory party to targeted schemes enabling the jobless to undertake voluntary work or education, the most difficult political argument is the question of compulsion. Downing Street said that it would only be in limited cases, but some ministers are already warning that any extension of coercion is impossible in the current political climate. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, was among Labour MPs condemning the proposal. He said it was 'demeaning' to force people 'to work for next to nothing'. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers union, denounced Mr Major's suggestion as 'the first step back to the workhouse'.</p>

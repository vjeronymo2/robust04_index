			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Opposition to roles for investors reported MANY finance directors are opposed to allowing shareholders a greater say in corporate decision making, according to a survey by 3i, the venture capital group. The survey questioned finance directors in about a third of the UK's 750 largest companies. It found that many opposed reforms which would give more control to shareholders. Some of the options for reform are expected to be backed by the Cadbury committee's investigation into the financial aspects of corporate governance when it publishes its report next month. The committee, chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury, is expected to recommend that audit and remuneration committees be composed solely of non-executive directors who in turn should have special responsibilities for reporting to shareholders. Allowing shareholders to be represented on audit and remuneration committees was opposed by 82 per cent and 78 per cent respectively of those surveyed, while 78 per cent opposed consultation with institutional shareholders on new board appointments. The survey found that 38 per cent of finance directors either favoured a two-tier corporate board structure or were unsure of its merits. A third believed that more stakeholders such as employees and local communities should be represented on boards. In addition, the survey found that most finance directors believed that the UK's current system of corporate governance was biased toward short-term results at the expense of investment and long-term performance. A total of 45 per cent of those surveyed said that, in spite of their concerns about short-termism among investors, they had not taken adequate steps to ensure that their own pension-fund trustees had a sufficiently long-term outlook.</p>

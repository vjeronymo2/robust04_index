			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Sri Lanka counts cost of bombing The assassination on Sunday of Mr Gamini Dissanayake, the Sri Lankan opposition leader, is a grim reminder of the violence which permeates the island's politics. Mr Dissanayake's death comes less than 18 months after assassins claimed the lives of two other prominent politicians - Mr Lalith Athulathmudali, a close colleague of Mr Dissanayake, and President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who like Mr Dissanayake was blown up in the middle of a crowd by a suicide bomber. In each case the security forces suspect the hand of the LTTE, the Tamil Tiger separatist militants fighting for an independent homeland for ethnic Tamils in the north. But the LTTE yesterday denied it was involved, and police have not in the past found enough evidence to prove their suspicions. Police in the capital Colombo said yesterday a Tamil woman suicide bomber whose severed head was found on top of a two-storey building was responsible for the blast, which killed 52 people. The tradition of violence predates the LTTE, going back at least as far as the assassination of the late prime minister, Mr Solomon Bandaranaike, who was killed in 1959 by a disgruntled Buddhist monk. Mr Dissanayake's bloody death at the age of 52 brings shock, confusion and uncertainty to Sri Lankan politics. Its impact also seems likely to spread to the economy, particularly the tourist industry. The immediate effect is to rob the opposition United National party of its presidential candidate for the election which is due to be held next month in which Mr Dissanayake was running against Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunge, the prime minister. The government, while postponing indefinitely peace talks set for yesterday with the Tamil rebels, said the November 9 presidential poll would go ahead despite the attack. Mr Dissanayake was an urbane, western-educated lawyer on the UNP's conservative wing. He had little chance of winning against Mrs Kumaratunge, who won a general election only in August when she took power from a UNP jaded after 17 years' rule. But Mr Dissanayake had gone some way to rebuilding party morale. His place could now be taken by Mr Ranil Wickremasinghe, who was prime minister until August, or possibly by the incumbent president and UNP elder statesman, Mr D B Wijetunga. Either man might hope to capitalise on a possible wave of sympathy among the majority Sinhalese for Mr Dissanayake or for the tough pro-military policy he supported on the Tigers - a policy which may have cost him his life. Equally important, Mr Dissanayake's death has called into question Mrs Kumaratunge's whole approach to the Tamil question. She was elected on a promise to try to make peace with the LTTE, a promise which she has bravely and rapidly attempted to put into effect by moves including lifting an economic embargo on the Tigers' northern stronghold in the Jaffna peninsula. Government officials this month started talks with LTTE representatives. Despite continuing LTTE attacks on Sri Lankan targets, including ships, Mrs Kumaratunge persisted with the peace effort. Against the advice of army officers, she trusted ambiguous peace messages put out by Mr V Prabakaran, the LTTE leader. Now her strategy has been thrown into jeopardy. The Colombo stock market was closed yesterday amid an island-wide curfew imposed after the attack. Mr Jayadeva Uyangoda, an economist attached to Colombo University, said the economy would suffer in the short term due to the attack. 'Long term stability will depend on any social unrest and the overall political situation,' he added. 'In the past, such dramatic assassinations have not impacted on society, which has come to terms with the deaths of major political figures. Foreign investors will react only if there is social unrest. Otherwise they will wait and see what happens before taking the next step.' Sri Lanka has shown amazing resilience to political deaths. Even last year's two assassinations did not throw the country's democratic institutions into disarray: there was little street violence and this year's general election was peaceful and judged to be fair. The economy has continued to grow, with gross domestic product up 5.7 per cent last year; the tourists have kept coming. Yet it is hard to believe that Sri Lanka can forever enjoy its economic success and holiday paradise reputation while the streets of Colombo are regularly soaked in blood.</p>

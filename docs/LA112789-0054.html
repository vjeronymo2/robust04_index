			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS: MAGAZINE KILLS S.D. ADS FOR  'PUBLISHER WHO CARES'  </P> <P> In their never-ending search for ways to publicly express their discontent with  Union-Tribune publisher Helen Copley, members of the local chapter of the  Newspaper Guild, involved in increasingly bitter contract negotiations with the  company, decided to place anonymous position-wanted ads in Editor and  Publisher, the national trade publication.  </P> <P> After first checking with the magazine to ensure it would accept a large group  of classifieds, 46 ads representing more than 75 reporters and editors were  written and sent off to the magazine.  </P> <P> Many of the ads clearly identified the authors as Union-Tribune employees  seeking a "publisher who cares about employees," or something similar. Many  were more detailed.  </P> <P> "We wanted to let people know nationally that something is wrong here," one  participant said. "That it's not just a bunch of hotheads embroiled in a labor  dispute."  </P> <P> However, the Editor and Publisher advertising department reversed its decision  and rejected 43 of the 46 ads.  </P> <P> Editor and Publisher advertising manager Donald Parvin said he was "naive" when  he originally told the Guild members he would accept the ads, believing that  they would submit ads legitimately seeking employment.  </P> <P> The ads were not an attempt "to get relocated by sincere people," Parvin said.  Noting that the magazine reserves the right to refuse ads, he said the U-T ads  would confuse readers looking for real position-wanted ads.  </P> <P> Parvin bristled at any suggestion that Copley's influence as a major advertiser  might have affected the magazine's decision.  </P> <P> "We have had no contact with Copley," Parvin said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, negotiations between the guild and the newspaper continued last  week. The two sides reportedly came to an "understanding" on health-care costs,  an important economic stumbling block.  </P> <P> The majority of reporters and photographers at both the Union and Tribune are  continuing a byline boycott against the papers, refusing to put their names on  stories and photos. The boycott is now entering its third week. Notable  non-participants include columnists Tom Blair and Michael Grant, and several  members of the sports staff.  </P> <P> An unsigned letter to The Times complained about a recent column in this space,  which chastised local TV sports departments for not following the commonly  accepted style of listing the visiting team first and the home team second when  reporting scores. The author pointed out that The Times and U.S.A. Today list  the winners first in boxes on the front pages of the sports sections, and said  an apology was due to the sports departments.  </P> <P> The writer clearly missed the point. Both newspapers include box scores, and  plainly tell readers at least once where the games were played -- basic  information that the local television stations don't bother to share with  viewers because of their refusal to follow the logical format. Even the  television networks follow the style when giving the scores.  </P> <P> "Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire. It's easy to take pot shots at  television sportscasters," the articulate, shy author wrote.  </P> <P> He identified himself as a "local sportscaster."  </P> <P> The San Diego Chargers received a call from former running back Chuck Muncie's  attorney after the team aired an interview with Muncie on a recent episode of  the "Chargers Report" television show.  </P> <P> The interview, taped in the Metropolitan Correction Center, where Muncie is  serving a 2 1/2-year sentence for drug-related offenses, included a strong  anti-drug message. Muncie evidently thought the interview was intended for use  in schools, and was surprised to see it on television, without so much as a  notification from the team.  </P> <P> Muncie's attorney, Cynthia Aaron, said it was Muncie's "preference" that the  interview not be used by the Chargers until after his legal situation is  completely resolved, i.e. he is out of jail.  </P> <P> According to a Chargers spokesman, there was a "lack of communication."  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge last week denied a motion by an attorney representing  Copley Press to unseal a civil suit filed by six deputies against Sheriff John  Duffy. One of the main reasons for keeping the case sealed was to protect the  identities of the deputies, who are facing disciplinary action in the sheriff's  probe of inmate abuse at the El Cajon jail.  </P> <P> One problem: The San Diego Daily Transcript had already printed the names,  which it discovered by simply scanning court records. The next day, the San  Diego Tribune also printed the names.  </P> <P> The attorney for Copley Press argued that, because the names were already  public, there was little reason to keep the case sealed.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge James R. Milliken, clearly irritated, denied the motion.  </P> <P> "I don't think it is valid argument," to use the publication of the names,  which "borders on unethical," to argue for the opening of the case, he said the  next day. "It is an argument I find almost contemptuous."  </P> <P> With the station owners heading toward Chapter 7 involuntary bankruptcy, there  has been a rash of gallows humor at KNSD-TV (Channel 39). One report has the  station's call letters being changed to KNSF for "non-sufficient funds."  Instead of Channel 39, Cable 7, one staff jokester says, the station will now  be identified as "Channel 39, Chapter 7." . . .  </P> <P> KGTV (Channel 10) anchorwoman Kimberly Hunt is negotiating for a new contract  with the station. Her current deal expires next month. "I would like to stay  here," she said, although she acknowledged having discussions with other  stations. Her agent is Ken Lindner, who recently inked an L.A. deal for Michael  Tuck. . . .  </P> <P> Besides turning disc jockeys Mike Berger, Jeff Prescott and Cookie (Chainsaw)  Randolph into poster children for insomnia, KGB-FM's (101.5) 30-hour  "Foodathon" collected almost 17 tons of food for the Joan Kroc St. Vincent De  Paul Center, plus more than $1,000 in unsolicited cash donations. . . .  </P> <P> From the San Diego Daily Transcript: "Allen Neuharth, past chairman of Gannett,  told a gathering of the San Diego Communications Council that anonymous sources  in news stories should be banned. A source says that's impractical." . . .  </P> <P> The name of the morning sports personality at KGMG-FM (Magic 102) has a  familiar ring. It's Benny Ricardo, former kicker for the Vikings, Lions and  Saints of the NFL. . . .  </P> <P> Former KCBQ morning personality Jack Hayes is the new afternoon news anchor at  XTRA-AM (690).  </P></p>

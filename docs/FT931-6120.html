			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Nissan told to pay past importer Pounds 6m NISSAN, the Japanese motor manufacturer, was yesterday ordered to pay Pounds 6m to Nissan UK, its former British importer, for not honouring an agreement to provide marketing support for sales of its range of Bluebird cars. The Pounds 6m payment had been negotiated by Mr Octav Botnar, chairman of Nissan UK, as an incentive for taking 12,700 of the cars in the six months before they went out of production in 1990, the vice-chancellor, Sir Donald Nicholls, said in the High Court. Nissan had denied such an agreement had ever been reached. However, Sir Donald ruled that an agreement had existed and that Nissan UK had fulfilled its side of it. Mr Botnar was not in court. He has remained in Switzerland following a warrant for his arrest in connection with an alleged tax fraud.</p>

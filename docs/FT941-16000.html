			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Squabble over metals group rescue Deutsche Bank has accused one of the largest domestic creditors to the troubled Metallgesellschaft group of jeopardising plans to restore the Frankfurt-based metals, mining and industrial group to financial health. The extraordinary public recriminations were triggered by a statement from Mr Manfred Bodin, chief executive of the Norddeutsche Landesbank, who denounced components of a DM3.2bn (Pounds 1.23bn) refinancing package which must obtain a seal of approval from creditor banks by 5pm today. Mr Bodin, whose bank is owed DM240m by the ailing group, condemned the 'dictatorial' way in which the rescue package was presented to bankers as an 'all or nothing' solution last week. He declared his reluctance to see Metallgesellschaft disappear but said NordLB would not shy away from taking responsibility for driving the group into bankruptcy if those responsible for conducting talks with the company did not listen to alternative proposals. The statement from the house bank to the state of Lower Saxony, one of the largest domestic creditors to the Metallgesellschaft group, prompted a furious response from Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank which is chairing the committee representing the 100-plus creditor banks. Deutsche is the largest creditor to Metallgesellschaft as well as a major shareholder. Deutsche said that NordLB's behaviour was 'extremely unprofessional', endangering attempts to put Metallgesellschaft back on a sound footing. It said that Mr Bodin's comments were 'in part unqualified' and was surprised by them as NordLB had belonged to the committee of creditors from the start. Mr Bodin's criticism of the refinancing package is understood to be shared by other bank creditors, especially foreign banks with a comparatively small exposure. The discontent among bankers focuses as much on the 'take it or leave it' presentation of the proposals as on the details. It is thought unlikely however opposition to the proposals will drive Metallgesellschaft into bankruptcy. Bankers calculate that they will get far less money back under full-scale bankruptcy than under the stringent refinancing proposals.</p>

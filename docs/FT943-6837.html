			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Investment asset value 273.3p Scottish Investment Trust saw a decline in its net asset value from 280p per share at its October 31 year-end to 273.3p at July 31. However, over the 12 months net asset value rose by 7.6 per cent. Gross revenue for the nine months increased to Pounds 22m (Pounds 20.5m); the costs of servicing the new Pounds 50m debenture, however, meant that pre-tax revenue slipped from Pounds 14.1m to Pounds 13.1m.</p>

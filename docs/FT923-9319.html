			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Technology (Software At Work): Customer Snapshot The Committee for Organising the Olympics (COOB) at Barcelona was formed at the time of the bid in 1986, and is composed of local dignitaries and officials, headed by the mayor of Barcelona. Nature of Business: Mounting a one-off international event, the 1992 Olympic Games, 25 July through 9 August. It takes six years to organise the Games. Income derives from sponsorship, largely from television. It is shared jointly between the International Olympics Committee and the orgainsing committee. COOB commissions and afterwards owns the assets which are seen as the lasting benefits of hosting the games, including improvements to the city facilities and infrastructure, which in Barcelona's case includes roads and a new airport. Turnover: An estimated dollars 4.7bn. The income is fixed, from sponsorship and pre-arranged media deals. Ticket sales add little to the bottom line. This makes it essential to estimate costs correctly. Employees: COOB's IT division employs 5,000 people. For development - four systems professionals from the Olympic Committee, plus 250 users, supported by 50 staff from Sema Group and T&amp;G for development. For facilities management - 16 Sema Group staff, two-thirds from the UK one third form the Group's Spanish operations.</p>

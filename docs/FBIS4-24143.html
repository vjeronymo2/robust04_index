			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Derek Keys, in the Cape </F> Town studio, by SABC announcer Max du Preez, WEEKEND STAR  correspondent Magnus Heysteck, and BEELD economic correspondent  Curt von Keyserlingk in the Johannesburg studio, on 22 June;  from the "Agenda" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Du Preez] Good evening and welcome to Agenda. This  is where we provide the background to the day's news. After  days of speculation, the government of national unity's first  budget was announced today. For some it brought good news, but  for others, definitely not. Earlier, together with two of my  colleagues in the media world, we spoke to the minister of  finance, Mr. Derek Keys, on the budget and its consequences.  With me I have two senior correspondents in the business world,  Magnus Heysteck from the WEEKEND STAR and Curt von Keyserlingk  from BEELD. Minister Keys is in Cape Town. Good evening, Mr.  Keys.    [Keys] Good evening, Max.    [Du Preez] Mr. Keys, let us begin. My first impression when  I listened to you this afternoon is that the more things appear  to change, the more they really stay the same. This is not  exactly a budget catering for reconstruction. It is not really  a budget for the poor, is it?    [Keys] Of course, it is. There is a large contribution  towards the Reconstruction and Development Program [RDP].    [First correspondent] Mr. Keys, I do not completely agree  with Max du Preez. The South African taxpayer is among the most  heavily taxed in the world. In the past it was said that  attempts would be made to lower its taxes, in other words to  lower direct taxation and to increase indirect taxation. Now  you went in the opposite direction with the financing of the  RDP...[pauses] of the transitional costs. Why?    [Keys] Well, this is an exceptional opportunity, something  we  have to deal with once and put behind us. The biggest factor I  had to contend with was to maintain a healthy structure -- to  try to accommodate the one-off tax.    [First correspondent] But would it not have been better to  raise revenue though privatization? It is a very healthy  principle. Throughout the world the emphasis is on  privatization, even in socialist countries. Why do we not  privatize, then the taxpayer would not have more burdens placed  on him?    [Keys] Yes, well there are arguments in favor of this and  there are arguments against. A few of my colleagues have stated  their opposition to this in the last few weeks. There are  certain reasons they consider it unwise to privatize at this  moment. This was not a practical option for me.    [Du Preez] Mr. Keys, could I just come in quickly. There has  been an increase in the defense budget. Why is that?    [Keys] Yes, the defense budget is up because it includes a  large part of the transitional costs, so in other words it is  just a problem of the transitional costs reflected there.    [Second correspondent] Minister, tell us a little more about  the Katz Committee you have just appointed. What are their  orders? What are they going to look at?    [Keys] Yes, they have a very wide task. One cannot exactly  restrict experts of that caliber. One should give them the  widest possible freedom of movement and this they do have. All  that we have asked them is -- to the extent that their  recommendations are applicable to the next budget -- they should  please give us those recommendations towards the end of November  this year. Thereafter, we will publicize it and then we will  accept public comment, and then decide in February '95 what  changes we want to make to the structure.    [Second correspondent] Will they, for example, look at  aspects like retirement planning, which is an uncertain stage  for many people?    [Keys] Yes, they are not prevented from doing this. In terms  of their brief there is a very wide clause, which almost says  that anything else they think they want to make recommendations  on, they should be allowed to do so. That is not excluded. I  am not sure if they would want to tackle that issue in this  commission.    [Du Preez] Minister, the last few years the general  complaint  by the ordinary taxpayer like me has been, that if each of us,  the ordinary PAYE [pay as you earn] people, if each of us  employs a tax lawyer then the state income will shrink  considerably, because the wealthy already have the lawyers.  Will this problem be addressed in the new South Africa?    [Keys] I think we have been addressing this now for a number  of years. We had a situation that was totally unacceptable,  with schemes -- I think the schemes concerning film production  was the scheme that attracted a lot of attention -- and that  sort of approach towards tax commitments, etc, was totally  unacceptable. We did a lot of work over the last few years to  remove those schemes. We have progressed well, and throughout we  are attempting to put in place the simplest possible system.  The reason for this is that the more complicated your systems  get the more opportunities you create for these tax engineers  who were so successful in the past.    [First correspondent] Minister, you said that the additional  tax is a one-off levy, and you promised that it would not be  continued. Now your predecessor also said a few years ago that  the tax on imports would be phased out, and today you said that  this would also be referred to this commission. This means that  this is also in the balance. You also spoke about the RDP. It  seems that there is 8 billion per year, it seems that much will  be spent annually on the RDP. Where will this come from? Will  it not come from this tax increase?    [Keys] No, the 8 billion is probably the average you have  taken from this increase in contribution.    [First correspondent] Yes, that is so.    [Keys] No, this will come from the current level of  expenditure from the various departments, and since we have a  long period in which to plan this -- the canceling of funds is  equal to about 3 percent of expenditure -- it is a very  practical objective. So this will take place. As far as the  surcharge is concerned, if I can just answer that question --  the reason we left the surcharge on consumer goods, is that if  you ask a commission to look into the issue of VAT [value-added  tax], which is imposed to a large extent on consumer goods, and  where the possibility exists that they could encounter different  rates on different types of goods, then it is better that they  also -- concerning the effect of the surcharge on the same type  of goods -- that they also take that into account.    [Second correspondent] Minister, there was a lot of  speculation that you might have referred to the abolishing of  the financial rand. You did not refer to it. That is my first  question.    [Keys] I did mention it briefly.    [Second correspondent] What is the government's program in  connection with this?    [Keys] The government's program is exactly the same as it  was a year ago when the president of the Reserve Bank spelt out  his guarantees, and they are simple: The margin between the two  types of rands must be narrowed. The finrand's balance in the  banking system must be narrowed, and the Reserve Bank must have  certain methods, in the form of foreign reserves, enabling it to  organize bridging finance. These three guarantees are healthy,  they are still valid, and our policy is to stay within the  framework of those three guarantees.    [Second correspondent] A second question in connection with  interest rates. The budget is somewhat surprising in the manner  in which the budget deficit will be financed. What is your  opinion about a possible lowering of interest rates seen against  the background of the relatively low inflation rate and low  pressure on state finances?    [Keys] Well, naturally if one speaks only of our internal  factors then I would say there should be a slight decrease in  the interest rate -- the long-term rate -- but we should also  take into account that we are already part of the international  world, and in the international world as you well know, the  interest rates increase in different countries. We cannot  remain immune as far as those tendencies are concerned, so it is  very difficult to determine which of those two tendencies will  actually affect us more.    [Second correspondent] A final question, Minister. The  foreign exchange markets are characterized by a weakening  dollar, but despite this the rand is terribly weak against the  British pound and the American dollar. What is the reason for  this sudden weakening in our currency?    [Keys] Well, it is not that sudden. There has been a steady  decline now for the past few years. There is a basic underlying  reason -- that is, that for years we have had a higher rate of  inflation than our trading partners, and this is still true  today although the difference is, of course, much smaller. That  is the underlying reason, but added to this there has been a lot  of speculative activity affecting us, and this has increased in  the course of the last few years. Those two factors together  have had this effect.    [First correspondent] Minister, if I can come back to the  Reconstruction and Development Program. It seems as if you said  -- well, you did not actually say this -- but it seems as if you  do not want to increase taxes to finance this. This will mean  then that it will be financed mainly from savings in state  expenditure. Now state expenditure to a large extent concerns  loans for state officials. What are your expectations of the  total number of people in the civil service over the past three,  four, or five years? Do you think there will be a decline, or  as is the case in the Department of Defense, it will increase?    [Keys] Do you mean...    [First correspondent, interrupting] The number of people in  the civil service.    [Keys] I think one must bear in mind that in the program  managed by Minister Naidoo that there is no question of him  developing a bureaucracy of his own. In other words, that money  will be applied in different directions and it could be that the  current state departments, in many instances, will have to play  a larger role in this respect. So, while they have to cut down  on existing, or normal, or routine activities, there will be  some developments. It is not as if we are going to decrease the  total expenditure in those two programs together. The total of  the two programs together, from the RDP and from the normal  departmental expenditure, will stay the same. As long as there  is a reasonable measure of flexibility among the personnel, I  see every possible chance that through reallocation of personnel  the problem will not be very big. Then one should also take  into account that we are talking here of an annual decrease of 3  percent of the total rate.    [Du Preez] Can I ask you a general question? Years back in  the apartheid era we had the expectation that when apartheid was  dismantled our bureaucracy would be reduced, we would reduce  wastage because we would not have homelands. Could you tell us  at this stage if this will really happen or if we have created  new bureaucracies with the provinces, and will our civil service  waste just as much money as before?    [Keys, laughing] Without answering the allegations hidden in  your question, I will just say that we are replacing 17  administrations with a total of 10. I think the nine provinces  will operate more effectively and efficiently as was the case  with the old ones, and their relationship with the central  government will be a healthier one. All the civil servants in  the provinces are also members of the same public service who  will lighten the load of management to a great extent. There is  every reason to believe that the new system will be much more  effective.    Having said this, I do not want to hide the fact that there  could be transitional problems, where for a while people will  have to sit with other administrations and where they will only  be absorbed slowly as time goes by, in compliance with the new  administration. So in the short-term it may be true that there  may be a certain measure of ineffective management, but  long-term I am hopeful that this will not be the case.    [First correspondent] Minister, you have made an interesting  comment in your budget speech, that the needy should not look to  the budget for assistance but to the RDP. That is an  interesting statement. When can the destitute look forward to  assistance from this RDP?    [Keys] Well, this can begin immediately through the  announcements made by the president in his opening debate in  Parliament. He announced the feeding scheme for schools,  medical services for certain classes of the needy, etc. So the  process has already begun, but it is true that assistance to the  poor will actually have to come from the expenditure side of the  budget. You cannot help a person not paying tax by giving them  tax concessions.    [Second correspondent] Minister, as you well know, in every  other country it was proven that indirect taxation is a more  effective way of collecting revenue. Now I know that there are  political objections to this but in the future, if tax has to be  increased, do you think it will be direct tax increases or  indirect tax increases?    [Keys] Well, it is of course a hypothetical question. You  must remember that the current interest rates, the current  structure, did bring about a smaller deficit. So in other words  it is actually very healthy. If we can control the expenditure  side of it then it will remain healthy. So the chances that we  will need it is small and we must keep it small. When it comes  to a choice between the systems of taxation -- these we  exercised last year already. You remember the VAT rate was  earlier at 10 [percent]. We put it at 14 because of the reasons  you mention.    [Du Preez] Could I quickly ask you, in terms of the  corporate  tax rate being reduced by 5 percent, is it not something of a  surprise element?    [Keys] Well, it is something that worked very well last  year.  We noticed that the lowering of the rate from 48 to 40 had a  very good effect. We are taking it now, if I can put it this  way, to its limit, or rather, to its eventual resting place at  35, with the dividend calculated rate at 25. We think it will  work well. It's very good for smaller companies and for new  companies and it helps any company wanting to reinvest it  profits.    [Second correspondent] Minister, in relation to that  question, what do you think foreign reaction will be to your  budget?    [Keys] Well, I think that as far as one can make predictions  on market developments and so forth, I think that the general  approach and reaction will be favorable, but there is a measure  of skepticism. The president spoke about getting rid of  Afro-pessimism, and I want to add to that Afro-skepticism, a  very widespread occurrence. We should not expect everything we  say and do to have an immediate effect.    [Du Preez] Minister Keys, in Cape Town. Than you very much.  Colleagues, thank you for your time.</p>

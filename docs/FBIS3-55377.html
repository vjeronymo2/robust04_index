			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry Grigoriy  Karasin has described the latest developments in the zone of the  Azeri-Armenian conflict as more bloodshed and another attempt to  settle the conflict by force. This is taking place in  conditions when the world community, including Russia, proposed  real possibilities for the bloodless solution of disputed  problems by peaceful means, the spokesman told a briefing in  Moscow January 6.    Karasin said that over the past two weeks the Azeri armed  forces were fighting to liberate some of the republic's regions  earlier captured by units of the Karabakh Armenians. There are  widespread hostilities around Nagorno-Karabakh with heavy  casualties.    The spokesman drew the attention of journalists to the two  sides' mutual accusations of responsibility for the resumption  of fighting, shelling and new offensives. This is not  infrequently close to manipulating the public opinion and  non-critically reproduced by the media causing misinformation,  said the diplomat. He believes the propagandist war only  aggravates the profound mutual mistrust between the conflicting  sides.    The spokesman has voiced regret that Baku rejected the  proposals of its Russian mediator put forward on December 16 and  20 on a temporary cease-fire which would create more favorable  conditions for signing an agreements on ending hostilities.</p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FORMER ASSEMBLYMAN KEYSOR JOINS RACE FOR L.A. COUNCIL SEAT  </P> <P> A familiar face from San Fernando Valley politics has emerged in downtown Los  Angeles as a long-shot challenger to veteran Councilman Gilbert W. Lindsay.  </P> <P> Jim Keysor, a northeast Valley assemblyman from 1971 to 1978, was among seven  people who filed papers by Saturday's deadline to oppose Lindsay in the April  11 municipal election.  </P> <P> "Who is he?" was Lindsay's reaction Monday. "He's got a constitutional right to  run against me, and I got a constitutional right to slay him."  </P> <P> After losing his 39th Assembly District seat to Republican J. Robert Hayes in  1978, Keysor, a Democrat, ran unsuccessfully in 1981 for the northeast Valley's  old 1st City Council District seat won by the late Howard Finn. He also lost a  bid to become Los Angeles County assessor in 1986.  </P> <P> Keysor, 61, is board chairman of the family-owned plastics firm Keysor-Century  Corp. in Saugus.  </P> <P> Lindsay, 88, was appointed to the council in 1963, becoming its first black  member. He has easily won reelection ever since.  </P> <P> To qualify for the ballot, candidates must collect 500 signatures and pay $300  by Feb. 4. Candidates can avoid paying the fee by gathering 1,000 signatures.  </P></p>

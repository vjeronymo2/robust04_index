			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Recession, but not all doom and gloom On present evidence, the third quarter of 1992 will be the ninth one of falling production since output reached its peak in the second quarter of 1990. This makes it the longest - but not so far the deepest  - recession since the second world war. There are no up-to-date estimates for the most comprehensive measure, GDP. In its absence there is more than one way of making the comparison with last time round. The simplest is to update the official index of manufacturing production by the survey-based CBI estimate. This suggests a drop of 10 per cent between the 1990 high point and the third quarter of 1992. For comparison it fell by 17 1/2 per cent between the earlier 1979 peak and the 1981 low point. Contrary to popular belief, construction output has not been more severely hit than last time. The difference is that, at the corresponding stage of the last recession, it was poised for recovery, while today it is bathed in gloom. There is still no hard evidence that the recession has touched bottom - only that activity is weakening at a slower rate. The least bad indicator of final demand is probably retail sales, where volume in the second quarter was slightly up on a year before. Motor trade sales volumes are still well down on a year ago. Investment intentions reported to the CBI are also well down. Where the present and previous recessions clearly differ is that the present one has made much further inroads into inflation than that of the early 1980s. The July CBI survey shows unit cost increases were the lowest since the survey began in 1958. The CBI survey also finds that more firms have cut prices than increased them for the fifth quarter in a row. No one is suggesting that stable prices are a guarantee of growth either in the short or the long term. But they provide a much better background for an enduring recovery when that does come, and it will be folly to throw away the prospect in return for fool's gold. In the words of CBI staff economist Mr Sudhir Junankar, writing in the previous month's CBI Economic Situation Report: 'With productivity set to increase strongly, the competitive position of UK manufacturing is likely to improve significantly.' Even the CBI survey is not all gloom. A clear majority of firms expects to increase their expenditure on product and process innovation. A majority also expect to spend more on training and retraining - even more than did a year ago. A great deal of evidence that the economy's supply-side potential did increase as a result of the competitive shake-up of the 1980s is given in the new summer Treasury bulletin. But because this was a quietly argued article, which stuck to the evidence and neither proclaimed a miracle nor prophesied doom, it did not gain the attention it deserved. An optimistic long-term interpretation is also supported by a paper by Peter Spencer of Kleinwort Benson, who makes a good case that, in contrast to the last recession, 'the surge in investment seen during the Lawson years has allowed manufacturers to cut costs without cutting capacity'. My mere citation of this paper will enrage the doomsters, especially those working for rival firms. The snag is that manufacturing and construction together account for only about 30 per cent of GDP. An illustration of the distance we have to go in eradicating inflationary psychology from the whole economy, and the difficulty of so doing, is the fact that only now is action being taken against the 25-year commercial property leases which provide for upward-only rent reviews every five years. The chief executive of Littlewoods, Sir Desmond Pitcher, has written to the UK's biggest retailers to suggest joint action against this iniquitous practice; and a meeting will take place in the autumn to plan the campaign. Do you think these belated efforts to stand up to this bullying manifestation of the inflationary mentality would survive if the government gave in to the siren voices demanding that it should throw in the towel - a better metaphor than abandoning the ERM strait-jacket  - and slash interest rates or abandon all control over public spending, irrespective of what happens to sterling or prices? If it did this, all the pain of the recession  -as on so many previous occasions  - would have been for nothing, and some future administration would have to start again from square one. The CBI has kept its nerve better than many Tory MPs and newspapers, confining its policy demands to some mildly useful palliatives, as well as reiterating some hardy annual grouses. I see no evidence that the government is sacrificing the real economy on the altar of a literally zero rate of inflation. If you look, not at ministerial speeches, but at the public expenditure projections made available last week and reported in my column on July 27 ('Public Spending: A New Try'), you would see that medium-term spending plans now assume an average annual rate of increase of 2 1/4 per cent on the GDP deflator - about the widest of available price indices. This is about the highest rate compatible with the Greenspan definition of stable prices - when inflation does not enter as a serious factor into business calculations. If we are to get that low in an average year, prices overall may have to fall in an occasional recession year - and certainly in particular sectors - without a rush to the money printing press because of cries of 'deflation'. There is no genuine deflation while the UK national income in money terms is still rising by 4 to 5 per cent a year. A look around the world should be sufficient to dispel the belief that the British recession is a peculiar, insular disease caught from membership of the ERM. The Japanese economy is this year teetering on the brink between zero growth and an output drop. But the Japanese authorities are not constrained by any international agreements in running their monetary policy. In the US, interest rates are the lowest for a generation, yet still the recovery is obstinately reluctant to take off. If there is a distinction around the world between the more and the less recession-prone countries, it is not to do with exchange rate arrangements. It is rather the distinction between those - mostly the English-speaking countries plus Japan - that experienced a massive credit boom in the late 1980s and which are now suffering from a debt overhang, and those that did not. The distinction is visible even within the UK. The recession is at its worst in the south-east, where the credit boom went furthest and where the financial talking classes are to be found. The gloomiest prognoses are to be found in this part of the country. When the green shoots of recovery are eventually seen, they are likely to come from areas well to the north and west of London, which should surely be welcome to those who have been lecturing us on regional imbalance for several decades.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kooijmans Waiting For EU Talks on </F> Bosnia"]    [Text] The Hague -- Foreign Minister Kooijmans is in favor  of NATO bombings on positions outside Sarajevo. However, he  made a final decision dependent on the meeting of the European  Union's foreign ministers in Brussels today, and on a decision  of NATO's permanent council this afternoon.    This was stated by a Foreign Ministry's spokesman this  morning. According to Dutch diplomats in Brussels, Kooijmans  reportedly is willing to endorse a French plan to impose an  ultimatum on the Bosnian Serbs, urging them to take up positions  further away from Sarajevo, so that they can no longer shell the  city. The Bosnians' and Serbs' heavy weapons must be collected  in one place. If they refuse, air strikes will follow. In  Brussels, it is expected that NATO's foreign ministers will also  talk about air actions above Bosnia.    The Netherlands has taken this position of "action wherever  necessary" since the Security Council's resolution of 4 June  1993 to protect the "safe areas" from the air, and since NATO's  decision of 2 and 9 August last year, when NATO decided to  provide air support and to proceed to air strikes, if the  population in the "safe areas" was threatened by bombings or  armed attacks. NATO can also provide air support, if UN troops  can no longer perform their task in the "safe areas."    Kooijmans said that he was deeply shocked by the bloodbath  in  Sarajevo. On Thursday, he called for a greater effort from the  United States to give the peace negotiations on Bosnia a new  impulse. He told Parliament, that he fears for new outbursts of  violence, unless a peace settlement is reached soon. The  Netherlands also appealed to its allies not to withdraw the UN's  peacekeeping forces for now. In March, it will be decided how  the UN troops' mandate can be adjusted.</p>

Their speeches noted that the talk should now be  not only about future prospects but also about specific ways to  implement the conversion of Russia's defense complex.    The American side showed an interest in assisting Russia's  conversion plans, not just with advice but also with hundreds of  millions of dollars. In particular, William Perry emphasized  the wish of the Americans to organize in Russia the manufacture  of prefabricated housing for servicemen's families, and noted  the mutual benefit of cooperation between the two countries on  this issue.</p>

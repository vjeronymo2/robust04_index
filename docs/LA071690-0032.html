			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PLANS OKD FOR NEW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL;  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS: CONEJO VALLEY OFFICIALS SAY THE $4-MILLION FACILITY WOULD BE THE  MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED IN THE DISTRICT.  </P> <P> The Conejo Valley Unified School District has approved initial plans for a  $4-million elementary school in Thousand Oaks that would accommodate up to 600  students.  </P> <P> The school, to be built at Knightsbridge Avenue and Whitechapel Place would be  the most technologically advanced in the district, officials said.  </P> <P> "It will be equipped for computers in each classroom so that we don't have to  go back later and tear up everything to put them in," said Dolores Didio, a  member of the school board.  </P> <P> Representatives of the Los Angeles-based architectural firm of Flewelling &amp;  Moody last week presented the board with blueprints that call for a  52,000-square-foot, U-shaped building with 21 classrooms and a central  courtyard. More detailed plans will be presented once board members decide next  spring when to build the school.  </P> <P> The school will also contain an oversized classroom with capacity for about 30  computers and science lab equipment, said Scott Gaudineer, the project's  principal architect. An in-house cable system, which would allow teachers a  choice of various educational programming simply by changing the television  channel, will also be installed.  </P> <P> "We're trying to anticipate what they will need for the next 50 years,"  Gaudineer said. "The hardware may come later, but the building will be wired  for it."  </P> <P> Ideas for the new school were compiled from a committee of nine school  officials who met three times to discuss the plans.  </P> <P> Officials anticipate the need for a new elementary school in central Thousand  Oaks -- possibly as soon as September, 1992 -- to educate 600 kindergarten  through sixth-grade students who are expected to move into the Lang Ranch  housing tract.  </P> <P> Construction of the 2,257-unit tract has started, but a completion date will  depend on supply and demand, according to officials of the Lang Ranch Co.,  which is donating a nine-acre site for the new campus.  </P> <P> Developers' fees will pay for the school, officials said.

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (8): Moslems get a fairer deal - Thrace: the government is directing EC funding to the province IF THERE is one campaign promise that prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis has lived up to, it was to address the problems of Thrace, the farthest-flung Greek province and the least-developed area of the European Community. It was not so much its remoteness that cut Thrace off from the mainstream of Greek development as the presence there of a large Moslem minority, mainly of ethnic Turkish descent. The Moslems mostly belong to a farming community left behind when Greece and Turkey carried out an exchange of populations in 1923, after Greece's attempt to invade Asia Minor had been thwarted by Kemal Ataturk. The Treaty of Lausanne spelled out the rights of both the ethnic Turkish minority in Thrace and its Greek equivalent in Istanbul. But while asserting that the terms of the treaty were being observed, successive Greek governments quietly pursued a policy of economic discrimination against the Moslems. This, it is argued, was justified retaliation for Turkish pressure on the Greek shopkeepers and businessmen of Istanbul, where the minority has shrunk from 220,000 in the 1920s to under 4,000 today as a result of economic harassment and periodic anti-Greek violence. The size of the Moslem minority in Greece, about 110,000, is much the same as in 1923. In fact, a high birth-rate in the villages of Thrace has effectively disguised the steady stream of departures to Turkey and, since free movement of labour was permitted in the European Community, to Germany. The hostile climate of Greek-Turkish relations in recent years was also reflected in Greek policy towards the minority, with Thrace remaining firmly at the bottom of the agenda for regional spending. Mr Mitsotakis's government is reversing the pattern of neglect, directing European Community funding for regional development specifically to Thrace. It is trying to change ingrained attitudes among local officials so that obstacles to active Moslem participation in the local economy are removed. The government is also well aware that its new approach is likely to give Greece's image abroad on human rights issues a considerable boost. Moslems no longer find it hard to get tractor permits or driving licences. They do not have pay kickbacks to get permission to open a shop or make improvements to their homes. Most important of all, Moslems can buy and sell property freely and obtain loans from the state-owned banks that control local financing on the same terms as Christian residents of Thrace. 'The bureaucracy has grown much more responsive to the minority in the past year. You put in your application for whatever it may be and get an answer in days, instead of the endless delays and prevarication there used to be,' says Mr Abdulhalim Dede, secretary of the mufti's office in Komotini. The government has launched a Dr80bn (Pounds 247m) programme of infrastructure improvements, up to 70 per cent of which is to be funded out of EC structural funds. The main priority is to bring the road network up to international standards and expand the province's two small ports, with a view to attracting investment. The current investment-incentives law offers especially favourable treatment for investors who set up in Thrace, including generous grants and sharply reduced tax rates. According to Mr Dimitris Karahalios, governor of the Komotini district, more than Dr4bn of new investment has arrived in the past two years, creating jobs in textiles, timber processing and metalworking plants. 'Thrace used to miss out on private investment, so it is encouraging to see confidence developing. Once we get the infrastructure into shape, we can expect bigger inflows,' Mr Karahalios says. Several projects will directly benefit the minority. The mountain villages along the border with Bulgaria, home of the Pomaks - Moslem sheep- and cattle-breeders whose ethnic origins are fiercely debated - are at last being linked to the electricity grid. Plans for expanding irrigation, upgrading telecommunications and improving school facilities will also have a greater impact on the Moslem villages. However, for the Moslems, whose first language is still Turkish, the inadequacies of the educational system set up for the minority are now of pressing concern. Teaching in Turkish at the village schools is of a low standard as the educators are trained in Greece, not Turkey. Attendance at Turkish high-schools is declining, because textbooks approved 40 years ago under the Lausanne treaty are too out-of-date to equip students for university entrance exams in Greece or Turkey. 'The most important problem the minority faces now is how to get the schools up to an acceptable level. It's a big test for the government's new policy,' says Mr Dede.</p>

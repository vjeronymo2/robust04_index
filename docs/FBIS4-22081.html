			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pinhas 'Inbari] </F>   [Text] The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squads yesterday  clarified for the first time that they will stop fighting Israel  when it withdraws from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. This  is the first time an 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam leaflet has featured  such a statement.    The belligerent leaflet announces that Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] is not intimidated by arrests. On the  contrary, the recent spate of arrests will inspire it to  escalate its struggle. The leaflet warns Shin Bet officers that  their fate will be similar to that of No'am Kohen and Hayim  Nahmani.    The leaflet goes on to point out, however, that the movement  will pursue its war on "terrorists Rabin and Baraq" as long as  even a single Israeli soldier remains in the West Bank and Gaza.  Until now, the leaflets of the military branch of Hamas have  always referred to an all-out war, and not to a war until the  end of occupation.</p>

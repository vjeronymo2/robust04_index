			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont to lobby on unitary taxation MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, will this week raise the stakes in the long-running battle over California's system for taxing foreign companies by raising the prospect of possible retaliatory action, David Owen and George Graham write. Mr Lamont will use a visit to Washington for a series of high-level meetings to raise the matter with Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary. The chancellor will be bearing the tough message that Britain's ultimate sanction could be to invoke retaliatory clauses in bilateral double tax treaties that would bar tax credits to the parent companies of US groups with subsidiaries in the UK. The move follows this week's decision by President Bill Clinton not to file a brief in support of a suit brought by Barclays Bank against California's worldwide unitary tax law. It is widely felt the situation could produce the first confrontation over the US's tough new approach to the taxation of foreign multinationals. Although the Clinton administration has decided not to support Barclays' suit, as previous US governments have done, the US Supreme Court would probably require the White House to express its view if it heard the case. Lawyers involved do not believe it is a foregone conclusion that the administration would side with California. However, California, which estimates it stands to lose Dollars 800m if the decision goes against it, believes the administration is motivated by the desire to ease its fiscal difficulties.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / After the Summit: Russian outburst against Ukraine RUSSIA, emboldened by the Vancouver summit, yesterday issued a barrage of attacks on Ukrainian prevarications on giving up control of nuclear weapons stationed on its territory. 'Ukrainian representatives openly state the weapons are the property of the Ukraine. This can only be viewed as Ukraine's claim to own nuclear weapons,' the Russian government said. Mr Grigory Berdennikov, deputy foreign minister, said the US and Russia had provided such exhaustive security guarantees for giving up the weapons that 'we can't even comprehend what other guarantees could be provided'. General Boris Gromov, deputy defence minister, said Russia was put in an impossible situation where it was not supposed to own the weapons but guarantee they were secure. 'Nuclear weapons cannot have two masters,' he said. In reaction to renewed American and Russian pressure, Ukrainian leaders yesterday reiterated their commitment to becoming non-nuclear. 'I am convinced that Ukraine will give up its nuclear weapons,' said Mr Leonid Kuchma, the Ukrainian prime minister, after a meeting between top Ukrainian cabinet ministers and a US congressional delegation. However, Ukrainian officials did not specify when and insisted the final decision was a grave step which it could not take lightly. 'At stake is the future of the Ukrainian state and its people,' said Mr Borys Tarasiuk, deputy foreign minister and top arms negotiator. House majority leader Mr Richard Gephardt said he had received assurances Ukraine would eventually give up its nuclear weapons.</p>

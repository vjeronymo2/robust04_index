			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Funding an endowment MY QUESTION is of special relevance to those parents with young children - say, 18 to 25 - who have been hit hard by the collapse in the UK housing market. In many cases, these children have been forced by high interest rates to sell their homes and to cancel their mortgages and the associated endowment policy. Is there any virtue in parents taking over these endowment policies and funding them on the childrens' behalf, thus exploiting the regular gift allowances under the Inheritance Tax regulations while at the same time taking advantage of the relatively low premium on young lives and securing some life cover? What would be the attitude of a building society if a young adult who was applying for a mortgage presented a policy on which the premiums were paid by his or her parents? Could the parents continue to pay the premium in this case? I have in mind an open arrangement, for example the premium is paid from the parents' bank account, but at some stage the offspring would become responsible. An endowment is one form of saving and could therefore constitute a suitable gift from parents. Neither a building society nor any other mortgage lender need be concerned with exactly who pays the premium on such policies, as long as it is paid. Whether endowment policies are the most suitable way of providing parental assistance is open to question. If the aim is to provide life assurance then low-cost term assurance gives much more cover for a minimal premium, leaving the balance of each year's gift to be invested more efficiently as a small capital reserve. This can be accessed when required without the surrender value penalties and high insurance mark-up on endowment policies. However, this is unlikely to be what an insurance salesman will tell you because a lot of this mark-up will be paid in commission. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

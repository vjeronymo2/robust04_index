			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten condemns NUT boycott MOVES by the National Union of Teachers to boycott national curriculum tests were condemned by Mr John Patten, education secretary, yesterday. He warned: 'Any boycott would do great damage to the teaching profession.' Mr Patten said that the NUT wish to oppose tests was shared by Labour MPs who wanted to make it party policy. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, disputed Mr Patten's assertion that pilot tests for stage three English had been carried out in more than 500 schools. She said: 'The tests have actually been piloted in only 32 schools involving the wrong age of pupils - 15 year olds and not 14 year olds.' Mr Patten replied that careful preparations for the tests had taken place over a longer period than for any other public examination. There are over 4m adult illiterates in Britain and this made critical the establishment of a bench mark against which improved performance could be judged, he said.</p>

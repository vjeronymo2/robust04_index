			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian diamond samples disappoint SHARES OF companies involved in the diamond stampede in Canada's Northwest Territories tumbled yesterday after a group of major players announced that eight drilling targets have yielded only three tiny stones. Aber Resources, Commonwealth Gold and SouthernEra Resources described the results from their joint venture properties in the Lac de Gras area as 'encouraging.' They noted that micro-diamonds have been found in three of seven kimberlite deposits and that 30 targets remain to be tested. But SouthernEra's share price fell 70 cents on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday morning to CDollars 4.10. Dia Met Minerals, whose discoveries triggered the Northwest Territories' diamond rush last year, lost CDollars 1.50 on the Vancouver stock exchange to CDollars 37.50. Mr John Hainey, analyst at Canaccord Capital in Toronto, said the latest drilling results were 'clearly disappointing' and bore no comparison to Dia Met's encouraging gem diamond discoveries. He noted however, that the results were unlikely to quell the enthusiasm of companies that had flocked to the remote Canadian Arctic in an exploration frenzy rivalling any in North American mining history. Exploration work is continuing at a feverish pace with international mining groups such as De Beers and Teck Corporation continuing to stake new claims. De Beers has declined to disclose the results of its work. Mr Lee Barker, vice-president at SouthernEra, said he had been told that one of two targets drilled by the South African group drilled last autumn intersected a kimberlite pipe. Mr Barker put a brave face on Aber and SouthernEra's latest results. He said: 'We've proven that the cluster has the potential to host some diamonds. I'm as bullish about this as I was a year ago.' The Aber group plans to resume drilling in the spring. Mr Hainey said that surface samples obtained recently by two other companies, Pure Gold and Lytton Minerals, had also been encouraging.  ----------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------- Aluminium     +51,975   to   1,578,625 Copper         -26,62   to     315,775 Lead          +14,650   to     227,200 Nickel         +3,468   to      71,382 Zinc          +30,075   to     487,600 Tin               -20   to      15,365  -----------------------------------------------</p>

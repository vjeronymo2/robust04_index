			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Wearing the horsehair cap of a civilian-led  government, the present regime in South Korea runs counter to  the unanimous desire of the 70 million fellow countrymen by  advancing on the road of dependence on outside forces and  North-South confrontation, thereby further revealing treacherous  colors with each passing day. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is  further clinging to outside forces while looking for a way to  perpetuate the present national division.    This is exemplified by traitor Kim Yong-sam's promise to  provide $3 billion every year for the upkeep of the U.S.  imperialist aggression forces occupying South Korea in the two  rounds of summit talks with the United States and the annual  South Korean-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting held in July and  November last year in which he begged for the U.S. imperialist  aggression forces' permanent occupation of South Korea.    In a bid to nail the U.S. imperialist aggression forces down  in South Korea at all costs, the Kim Yong-sam clique not only  allowed the United States in last April and May to utilize ports  in South Korea freely in an emergency according to the  aggressive and treacherous Wartime Host Nations Support  Agreement, but also took the treacherous step of allowing the  U.S. 7th Air Force continuous use of the U.S. Air Force's  installations and facilities which had been returned to South  Korea.    Particularly, we cannot overlook the fact that the Kim  Yong-sam clique has given the South Korean rice market to its  U.S. masters in order to seek an international cooperative  system to crush [apsal] their own fellow countrymen despite the  South Korean people's unanimous objection. This is a  treacherous act that can be committed only by traitors who have  inherited the dirty blood of the five enemies of the Ulsa Treaty.    Caught up in its maneuvers to perpetuate division, the  puppet  clique is clinging to the forces of Japanese military aggressors  without hesitation in order to find a way to survive. During  secret talks with the Japanese prime minister who visited South  Korea in early November last year, the Kim Yong-sam clique  promised that he would forget past nefarious atrocities  committed by Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in  return for Japan's cooperation in the settlement of the nuclear  issue.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet government is much more vicious than  previous puppet governments in aggravating North-South  confrontation. The warmaniacs of civilian government incite the  spirit of war and northward invasion by making indiscriminate  and violent war remarks like the so-called military  countermeasure or full readiness, under the pretext of  non-existent nuclear development in the North.    The Kim Yong-sam group have appropriated a great amount of  money from the budget, over ten trillions, for military  expenditures this year, as never before attempted by any  previous dictators, thus revealing their true nature as  warmaniacs.</p>

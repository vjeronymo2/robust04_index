			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / PIA presses advisers to announce ties Plans to ensure that consumers are more aware of whether they can expect to receive independent financial advice - including the placing of large signs in banks and building societies and more information in advertisements - were published yesterday. The Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect the private investor, issued a consultation paper to the organisations it regulates on how to make clear to customers whether they give independent advice or only advice on a particular company's range of products. Under the previous regulatory system independent financial advisers had a separate regulator from organisations which sold only their own products or were linked to just one life company. The PIA now regulates both types. In spite of opposition from banks and building societies to the proposals that they should have to disclose the limits of their advice in posters or signs in branches, the authority is intending to press ahead. Plans to extend the disclosure requirements to broadcast advertisements as well as printed advertisements for mortgages - unless these refer only to repayment mortgages - will also create antagonism among banks and building societies. The plans would add to the length of broadcast advertisements, making them more expensive. Some estimates put the cost to mortgage lenders at millions of pounds a year. Another suggested change would slightly reduce the cost for independent financial advisers - many of whom are very small organisations - of telling the consumer the status of the advice being given. Under previous arrangements they had to give customers a letter setting out the terms of business and a separate 'buyer's guide'. The authority proposes that in future they would simply have to hand over a 'terms of business' letter. It estimates this could save organisations about Pounds 900,000 a year. Comments have been requested by late September. Subject to views received, the authority hopes to introduce the new regime at the start of April next year.</p>

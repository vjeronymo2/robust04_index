			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ADOPTED CAT CORNERS RATTLER NEAR CHILD'S BEDROOM  </P> <P> When a 4-foot rattlesnake slithered into Holly Lenz's home Sunday afternoon,  apparently headed for her 2-year-old son's bedroom, it was Lucy the adopted cat  that sounded the alarm.  </P> <P> Lenz was outside in the sun, reading a book, when Lucy began hissing loudly.  Lenz rushed inside and found the snake in a hallway, face to face with the cat,  apparently trying to escape to the boy's bedroom. As Lucy kept the snake  cornered, Lenz called police, who in turn alerted animal control authorities.  </P> <P> When the ordeal was over the snake was dead, Lucy was being examined at an  animal clinic and all the humans -- Adam the toddler, three police officers and  an animal control worker -- were safe.  </P> <P> "These three large, burly policemen stood well away and this little tiny woman  from animal control went right in," Lenz said. "This little woman was fearless.  She went right at it with one of those poles with a noose on it and got him by  the head.  </P> <P> "I don't think they pay these people enough."  </P> <P> Lenz, 36, said the snake thrashed around when it was captured. Once it was  taken outside, she said, a sheriff's deputy clubbed it with a shovel, chopping  off its head.  </P> <P> "Where are you going to relocate a 4-foot rattlesnake?" Lenz said. "I mean it's  sad but what were they going to do with him? So they buried the head in my back  yard because it is poisonous for 24 hours, and they took the body away."  </P> <P> Ronald Wheeler of the Orange County Animal Control office said snakes are  commonly seen this time of year in the coastal desert areas such as Laguna  Niguel, as well  </P> <P> as in other areas of the county.  </P> <P> The reptiles usually don't move into people's homes, Wheeler said, but they are  more active during spring and summer when temperatures are warmer, often  entering lawns and sunning themselves.  </P> <P> Rattlesnakes usually strike only when they have been approached and challenged,  Wheeler said.  </P> <P> "Typically, the people who get bit are those who are surprised by the snake."  </P> <P> As for Lenz, she said she won't keep the sliding glass door to her bedroom open  any more and will be more aware of the wildlife that abounds in South County.  She said Lucy the cat, while fearless with the snake, needs a few lessons on  dealing with people.  </P> <P> "The minute the police showed up, my cat went under the bed," Lenz said. "She's  not afraid of the rattlesnake but she's afraid of other people."  </P></p>

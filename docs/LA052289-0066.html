			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A major storm forced the Air Force to postpone the launch of an advanced  navigation satellite for a second time at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station  in Florida. The launch of the Delta 2 rocket was rescheduled for Tuesday at  4:43 p.m. PDT. Lt. Col. Ron Rand, an Air Force spokesman, said: "There is a  thunderstorm, an anvil cloud and lightning within five miles of the launch pad.  The lightning requires a shutdown of the rocket guidance computer." The launch  was first postponed Saturday night because of strong winds. The $65-million  satellite will enable military units to determine their location within 50 feet  anywhere on the globe.  </P></p>

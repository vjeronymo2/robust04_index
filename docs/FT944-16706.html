			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Misguided protectionism in defence Sir, Your feature on the forthcoming order for military helicopters from the British government ('Helicopter makers in a spin', October 6) shows that protectionism lives on in British defence procurement, despite the ample evidence of its harmful and even disastrous effects on costs and performance in the past. The instruction to bidders that as much of the work as possible should be placed in the UK is misguided on two grounds: that it involves protection, and that it does so in an inefficient and ill-considered way. As to the first and fundamental point, there is no valid reason to grant a subsidy to British rather than overseas elements of system costs. Each bidder could in any case be expected to place as much work in Britain as was consistent with minimising these costs. To require a higher British content would increase the prospective costs, and would mean an inefficient use of British resources. In the competitive market that the government claims to believe in, and which it has been fostering in some areas, resources will move where their output is worth most. If resources can be used in a helicopter programme only because a subsidy is paid, they can be expected to produce less than they could in other uses. The apparent willingness to pay a subsidy in this case may be accounted for by (1) the still-prevalent belief that products identified as 'high-tech' have some semi-mystical value of their own, over and above what people are willing to pay for them, and/or (2) a tacit assumption that the resources in question would otherwise be unemployed. But the first argument is mistaken, and the second highly improbable for the skilled resources involved. If there is a problem of labour mobility, it is better dealt with by general measures than by ad hoc subsidies. Why should helicopter production be treated differently from coal mining? The requirement to place as much of the work as possible in the UK is a recipe for needless inefficiency unless the relative costs of different mixes, British and foreign, are clearly brought out. It is important that in each case the bidders should have to specify which mix would minimise costs, and what increases in costs would be caused by different ways of increasing the British contribution. Finally we hope that Bernard Gray is mistaken in supposing that it is unlikely that orders could be placed for both the Lockheed C130J and the Apache helicopter system, because buying both would be one American purchase too many for the Ministry of Defence. If the present government allowed such nationalistic sentiments to determine its decisions on defence procurement, whatever the evidence on costs and performance, it would show that it is as willing as its predecessors to waste taxpayers' money. It would also give the nation defences which are weaker than they need or ought to be.

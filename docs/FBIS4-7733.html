			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "u.s." and commentary by Adam Michnik: "Simple </F> Program of Recommunization"]    [Text] One of the side effects of the Mass Privatization  Program [PPP] will probably be good-paying jobs for the economic  dignitaries of the Polish People's Republic [PRL], instead of  young and well-educated people, as it was planned.    The first stage of the selection of the candidates for the  members of the National Investment Funds has already been  completed. These funds will manage a few hundred companies that  have decided on privatization under the PPP.    The selection is being carried out by a commission dominated  by people appointed by Prime Minister Pawlak. The commission  has defined the selection criteria and has not agreed to reveal  them.    As we have learned unofficially, an especially important  factor is "long work at a managerial post." This criterion is  met only by former heads of the socialist economy.    "It is not important whether a guy has led a company to  bankruptcy or not. What is crucial is the fact that he managed  it," we were told by a cooperator of the Selection Commission.  "This weakens the chances of young and well-educated people."    "When the Law on Mass Privatization was being passed, there  were rumors that the posts in supervisory boards would be  occupied first of all by well-educated and young people," we  learned from an economist linked to the commission. "However,  the commission has worked out a code that favors people with  strong connections with PRL companies. They simply score more  points only because they managed the giant socialist companies."    We did not like such discrimination: when the citizens were  divided into "equal" (nonpartisan) and "more equal" (members of  the Polish United Workers Party and the satellite parties).    This is why we rejected decommunization ideas as contrary to  the logic of a democratic state. Therefore, it is with utmost  concern that we have heard about the attempt to recommunize the  state by giving privileges to the people of the communist  apparatus of power.    This is inadmissible. This must have negative consequences  not only for the Polish economy but also for those who conceived  these ideas.</p>

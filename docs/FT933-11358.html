			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Israel ignores US plea for ceasefire ISRAEL yesterday brushed aside US efforts to arrange a ceasefire in southern Lebanon, sending another armoured column of tanks and motorised infantry into the area and continuing its bombardment of Lebanese civilians for a fifth day. Last night Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, again condemned Israel's offensive and called for an immediate ceasefire and a halt to the hostilities in Lebanon which have left at least 119 dead, 500 wounded and more than 250,000 people homeless. However, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, ignored mounting international and domestic pressure and said the operation would go on until the pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas, responsible for attacks on Israel, were neutralised. Mr Rabin spoke after Lebanon's information minister said Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, had telephoned Mr Rafik Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, and told him he was working to arrange a ceasefire to start yesterday evening. Mr Rabin said: 'As long as the operation's goals are not achieved we won't cease Israel Defence Force actions. Hence all news about a ceasefire today at 6pm are baseless.' Aides to Mr Rabin said later that Israel was ready to halt its onslaught if the US guaranteed Hizbollah would stop firing Katyusha rockets into northern Israel - a seemingly impossible task for the US. Yesterday army spokesmen said at least 43 rockets had landed in Israel - an increase over Wednesday's figure of 28 and a sign that Hizbollah showed no sign of giving in in spite of overwhelming Israeli firepower. In Jerusalem, Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, said he hoped Israel's onslaught would be over by the time Mr Christopher arrived in Jerusalem on Sunday on his Middle East visit. Israel's army said yesterday it had fired more than 17,500 shells since Sunday in an operation aimed at creating a refugee crisis which would force the Lebanese government to act against Hizbollah. But a senior official in Beirut has said the government is neither politically nor physically able to take action against the Iranian-backed group, or voice opposition to Hizbollah's 'resistance' to the Israeli presence in Lebanon. The official said: 'In the eyes of public opinion we would be doing the work of Israel, which no government in Lebanon can afford to do.'</p>

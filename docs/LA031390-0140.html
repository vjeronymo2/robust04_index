			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> VATICAN RE-EMPHASIZES ROLE OF CHASTITY FOR PRIESTS AND NUNS  </P> <P> Men and women studying to be priests or nuns should not be allowed to take  their final vows if they cannot control their sexual urges, the Vatican said  today.  </P> <P> "Those who do not seem to be able to overcome their homosexual tendencies or  who maintain that it is possible to adopt a third way, living in an ambiguous  state between celibacy and marriage must be dismissed from the religious life,"  it said.  </P> <P> The instruction was contained in a 70-page document written by the Vatican  department in charge of religious life and approved by Pope John Paul II.  </P> <P> Cardinal Jerome Hamer, the department's head, evaded questions at a news  conference on how widespread the problem of homosexuality was. "The problem is  very clear. (Members of religious orders) are men and women who take a vow of  chastity. We cannot accept that those entering the religious life are not able  to respect this vow," he said.  </P></p>

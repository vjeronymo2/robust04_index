			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Bid to sue Turkish bank rejected A 17-MONTH bid by Touche Ross, the administrators of Polly Peck International, to sue the Central Bank of Turkish Cyprus for Pounds 45m was rejected yesterday by the Court of Appeal, John Mason writes. The claim was part of the administrators' attempt to recover between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m allegedly misappropriated from the collapsed fruit and electronics group. Touche Ross had claimed that the bank had knowingly assisted Mr Asil Nadir, the former Polly Peck chairman, in committing an alleged fraud or had received the Pounds 45m knowing it was being paid in breach of Mr Nadir's fiduciary duty to PPI. Touche Ross had been given permission by the High Court to issue a writ against the bank in northern Cyprus, outside the jurisdiction of the UK courts. However, the appeal court judges ruled that the case was not strong enough to justify allowing the writ to be served in a foreign country. Touche Ross said it would seek leave to appeal in the Lords.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Golub takes over from Robinson at American Express MR HARVEY Golub, president of American Express, the large US travel and financial services group, was yesterday named by the board of directors as the new chief executive, replacing Mr James Robinson, the group's embattled chairman and chief executive. The 53-year-old Mr Golub, a low-key manager who is respected mainly for his technical skills, was Mr Robinson's hand-picked heir. Mr Robinson, however, managed unexpectedly to retain his position as chairman of American Express and - in a surprising development - was also named chairman and chief executive of Shearson Lehman Brothers, the investment banking and brokerage subsidiary. In doing so the 57-year-old Mr Robinson replaced Mr Howard Clark, Jr, the previous chairman and chief executive he had installed at Shearson at the height of its losses two years ago and who was instead named vice chairman of Shearson. Shortly after the management upheaval was announced last night, American Express also disclosed that its fourth-quarter 1992 net profits before accounting charges had crashed by 65.4 per cent to Dollars 82m, incorporating a net loss of Dollars 166m from Shearson in the quarter. American Express also unveiled that its full-year 1992 net profit before accounting charges had slumped to Dollars 436m from Dollars 789m in 1991, with Shearson suffering a Dollars 116m loss for the whole of 1992. Mr Golub, who said yesterday that 'Jim and I will continue to work together as a team', has been Mr Robinson's chosen candidate since the American Express board last autumn asked him to form a search committee to seek his own successor. Mr Robinson last month denied that he was being forced out of the chief executive's job because of losses at the company's credit card business, reduced profits and pressure on the stock price. Analysts said they were struck yesterday by Mr Robinson's ability to survive at American Express, both as chairman and in his new job running a subsidiary that previously reported to him. Mr Robinson said yesterday his prime mission was to work at Shearson Lehman; he did not rule out the sale of Shearson stock in a public offer. Results on Page 23</p>

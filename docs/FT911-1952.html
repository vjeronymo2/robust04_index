			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (30): A bout of schizophrenia - What has happened to Solidarity?  FT writers trace the evolution of the movement and discuss the future of trade unions / The right to set up and join a trade union is retained in legislation now before parliament THE WORKERS, mobilised into the Solidarity movement, brought down Poland's so-called 'workers state'. Yet, as the country reverts to capitalist free markets and unemployment threatens to exceed 2m, the future of the trade union movement is in dispute. Both Solidarity and the communist-created OPZZ union federation, set up during martial law to counter its influence, are, for differing reasons suffering an identity crisis, and it could be some time before new unions emerge. Ironies abound. Solidarity, in its heyday in 1981 was a worldwide symbol of free trade unionism. Now it is wracked by its dual role as it seeks to defend the immediate interests of its 2.5m members and support the Government's austerity policies. The OPZZ had similar problems in the past. Under the Communists it made militant gestures but was bound in the end by its party affiliation to support the government. Now the OPZZ is in opposition and could face the confiscation of its property, as once happened to Solidarity, should the next parliament have a strongly right wing hue. The OPZZ has 5m members on the books, but only a fifth pay dues, and its credibility is low, even though its expertise on bread and butter issues is better than Solidarity's. Opinion polls show that its leader, Mr Alfred Miodowicz, a former Communist Politburo member, enjoys little popular confidence. In the factories Solidarity, although sometimes smaller is often more effective. Both movements want to play a more overt political role trade unions, putting up candidates at the next elections and hoping to put together coalitions to defend their interests. Solidarity is now headed by Mr Marian Krzaklewski,a scientific researcher from Silesia. He replaced Mr Lech Walesa at February's Solidarity congress and is wary of his union allowing itself to be used by the fledgling political parties now seeking his support. Solidarity is suffering from a severe bout of schizophrenia. Its activists feel responsible for the success of the economic reforms which they initiated but which are now causing discomfort to their members as real incomes fall. On the other hand, the 20,000 or so full-time Solidarity officials at the national and factory level feel they are the new establishment and are becoming accustomed to giving orders. 'Remember, lady, this is Solidarity calling' an irate shop steward told a minister's secretary when she informed him he could not be put through on the telephone. But 'sometimes they know they have to threaten strike action because the members want something done, but they're loathe to do it because they see strikes as being aimed at themselves,' an official in Gdansk says of his colleagues. Strikes are not popular. Fear of unemployment and the precarious situation of state sector companies mean that on the whole people do not see the point. Instead Solidarity has had to rely on influencing the Government through private channels while the OPZZ has organised a series of rallies against Government economic policies. Neither method has been very effective. Indeed, the ballot box has been a better instrument of making people's views known. At the presidential election last autumn, the defeat of Premier Tadeusz Mazowiecki and a strong vote for Stanislaw Tyminski, a vehement critic of the Solidarity establishment, showed many people's attitudes. Despite the decline of the strike as a weapon, the right to set up and join a trade union, as well as to strike, is retained in trade union legislation now being amended by Parliament. This could cause embarrassment to foreign employers like the Marriott hotel chain which has a policy of not permitting employees to organise unions. But the maximum fine for the offence is a mere Zl 5m (USDollars 537). Still to be decided is whether employers will have the right to lock workers out in the face of a wildcat strike. During the debates in parliament the Solidarity leadership from Gdansk was reduced to passively asking deputies and senators for support. This has enhanced Solidarity's perceived need to get its own limited parliamentary representation and led some to argue that it should go further and seek to become part of future governments.</p>

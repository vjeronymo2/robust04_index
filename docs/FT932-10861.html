			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (8): Tensions on cultural divide - Languages form a 'Swiss Iron Curtain' THE city of Fribourg, with its Medieval cathedral and a historic quarter of Gothic and Renaissance facades, is one of the main battlegrounds of Switzerland's Franco-German linguistic rivalry. The division was dramatically exposed when Switzerland split along language lines and rejected gradual integration with the rest of Europe in a referendum last December on membership of the European Economic Area. A quaint, riverside mixture of architectural treasures and 1960s town planning, the majority French-speaking Fribourg is no Cold War Berlin. However, the city does have its own version of the Iron Curtain, knowns as the Rostigraben - an imaginary trench running through the Swiss psyche and along the geographical boundary between the some 70 per cent of Swiss who speak German and the 20 per cent who have French as their mother tongue; in the south-east of the country, another 9 per cent are Italian speakers and a tiny minority keeps alive the fourth national language, Romansch. The Rostigraben takes its name from the fried potato cake of rural origin, which the Swiss French mischievously perceive as the German-speaking majority's most imaginative contribution to the country's cuisine. There is also a natural boundary running through Fribourg, situated about 30 miles south-west of the federal capital, Bern. The River Sarine, known in German as the Sanne, forms an uneven border between German Switzerland to the east and the main francophone regions to the west. But it is the Rostigraben which is referred to by all Swiss when they talk of the cultural divide. In recent years, however, the Rostigraben of linguistic separation has become increasingly symbolic of political divergence as well, with the largely pro-European Swiss French seeing their desire for a more open foreign policy, including membership of the United Nations, being crushed by the inherent conservatism of the Swiss Germans in the rural heartlands. Fribourg is the capital of the canton by the same name. With the 22 other mini-states of the Swiss Confederation it enjoys constitutionally-guaranteed autonomy on all local matters. While Swiss Germans exercise virtual domination over their francophone co-citizens in such areas as the economy, the federal public service and the army, the cantonal system allows the seven cantons with French-speaking majorities, or large and vociferous minorities, jealously to guard their cultural independence. In Fribourg, the Swiss Germans are left in no doubt that their status is one of a minority. Fribourg is two-thirds French-speaking and one-third Swiss German, almost the reverse of the position nationally. The Fribourg French are predominantly Roman Catholic and the German-speakers Protestant. The arrival in recent years of the large Basle-based chemical companies has provided much-needed employment, but also has brought about demographic changes as many Swiss Germans have come with them to settle in the area. While many ordinary Swiss Germans are in general willing to speak French, the opposite is not the case. The sentiment prevails among French-speakers that l'allemand n'est pas beau ('German is not a nice language'). The francophone majority in Fribourg has been grudging in its acceptance of the influx, to such an extent that only in 1991 was German allowed to be an official language in the canton. The French-speaking majority also reacted slowly in providing Swiss German, non-Catholic schools, even in areas where German speakers were in the majority. Many Swiss German families have had to opt for private education. While many of the country's multilingual business and intellectual elite prefer to play down suggestions that Switzerland is anything other than the spiritual home of ethnic harmony and social cohesion, the political and cultural gap between ordinary Swiss may be widening. Professor Ulrich Kloti, a politics lecturer at the University of Zurich, said Swiss leaders are under-estimating the linguistic divide - 'the man and the woman in the street feel more serious about this problem. They regard each other as foreigners if they have a language difference,' he says. He adds that attitudes of linguistic superiority were not just confined to the majority French-speaking areas, but also worked in the opposite direction. 'In the canton of Zurich, when it started to introduce early French in schools, there was really important opposition. The linguistic divide is more serious than the authorities would admit.' The Swiss Franco-German relationship was characterised by Professor William Ossiepow, lecturer in politics at Geneva University, as one of 'co-existence'. He also believes that the Swiss French have to share the blame for their under-representation in some centres of power. 'That the federal government administration is mainly in the hands of German-speaking people is not entirely their fault. The French-speakers are very reluctant to speak German because of their own attitude of cultural superiority.' The battle for hearts and minds of divided Fribourg is conducted by rival newspapers, the Freiburger Nachrichten and La Liberte. They share the same offices in the centre of Fribourg but are under separate ownership. Neither makes language concessions to break down barriers between the canton's 210,000 citizens. Editor of the Freiburger Nachrichten, Mr Erich Camenzind, has been one of the main defenders of Swiss German rights in the city. Years of campaigning by Mr Camenzind and other prominent Swiss Germans finally bore fruit two years ago when their language was recognised. Previously court cases involving German-speaking parties were conducted in French. Ordinary monolingual Swiss Germans also had difficulty dealing with the local authority. Now the canton is obliged to communicate in both languages. However, a campaign by Mr Camenzind and others to make street signs bilingual in Freiburg (as he calls it) resulted in only limited success. A compromise was agreed that allowed just 24 streets to have bilingual signs, but the limit of francophone concessions had been reached. A request to have bilingual Fribourg-Freiburg signs on the platforms of Fribourg station was turned down flat. Cultural and religious divisions in Switzerland have only degenerated into violence in modern times over one particular region. A car-bomb exploded in the centre of Berne in January, killing the driver and injuring passers-by. Police identified the man as a French-speaking nationalist from canton Jura who had planned to bomb Bern town hall. Raids by police in Jura canton recovered some 50 grenades and quantities of explosive they said had been stolen from the army for a renewed Jura nationalist campaign of violence similar to one in the 1970s. No other local disputes are likely to lead to violence. Cantonal power is the safety valve for the ethnic divide in Switzerland. So long as each canton, particularly in francophone Switzerland, is allowed to fait sa propre petite cuisine (get on with its own petty affairs) on the political level, that border trench, the Rostigraben, will never be filled, in the imagination of the Swiss, with anything more threatening than fried potato cakes.</p>

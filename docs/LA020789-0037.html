			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO END TO THE SCROUNGING  </P> <P> The people have spoken. They have, in fact, screamed like midday targets of  pickpockets and purse-snatchers. House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) has heard  the screams. As a result, the wages of public service on Capitol Hill will  consist, for at least two more years, of one part salary and one part checks  written by people who like elected officials to feel obligated to them when the  roll is called.  </P> <P> Some of the wages, $89,500 a year, will go on reaching senators and  representatives directly from the U.S. Treasury, which gets the money from  taxes. The rest will come from the same Americans who pay the taxes, but it  will take more circuitous routes. It will come from honorariums for speaking to  business people or union officials at lunch or lecturing on campus or making  any appearance that can justify some special interest paying a fee and hoping  for the best the next time it is particularly interested in which way a vote  will go.  </P> <P> That is the meaning of Wright's decision to let members of the House, who heard  the screams long before Wright acknowledged them, vote against a pay raise that  they probably deserve to demonstrate that they can and do respond to pressure  -- an issue that never was in doubt. The raise, which would have amounted to a  51% increase in paychecks, was to be accompanied by new rules forbidding  members to take money on the side.  </P> <P> The amount of the proposed raise was chosen by a White House commission,  supported by President Reagan and then endorsed by President Bush. Members of  the executive branch and the judiciary would have shared in the raises. The  commission said that higher pay was essential if government was to compete with  industry for top talent, partly because there have been no major jumps in  government pay for nearly 20 years. There have been none for the same reason  that there will be none this year: Members of Congress, who can speak without  notes for hours on virtually any other subject, choke when they have to explain  to voters that they need raises.  </P> <P> Having choked for so many years, Congress has made catching up with inflation  sound enormously expensive, and it is. Just to reach the buying power of salary  levels of 1969, government officials would need 35% raises. It might have  worked better if the commission had recommended catching up in stages rather  than all at once. But Wright proposed something like that when he suggested  that members settle for a 30% increase, and the public seemed not to find that  any more palatable.  </P> <P> It may well be, as cynics would have us believe, that members of Congress love  what they do and will cling to office no matter how few groceries their checks  will buy in yet another 20 years. It also may well be that the nation would  survive.  </P> <P> But government loses people at all levels from science to Cabinet officer  because they cannot afford to put their children through college on federal  pay, and that cannot be considered healthy.  </P> <P> Nor can the nation take comfort from anticipating that Congress will continue  to scrounge on the side to make ends meet, as exemplified in the financial  arrangements for a retreat in the West Virginia hills made by Democrats over  last weekend to discuss salary and other issues.  </P> <P> About two-thirds of the expenses for transportation, room and board were picked  up by the National Legislative Educational Foundation, a group made up of  lobbyists for corporations and labor unions. Where did they get the money? From  the American public, in the form of profits and dues, which probably would come  closer to getting its money's worth from its taxes if congressional salaries  were high enough to put an end to the scrounging.  </P></p>

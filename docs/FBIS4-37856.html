			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Severe Crisis Erupts Among </F> Traditional Fatah Leaders"]    [Text] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- While eyes are focused  on knowing when Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat is going to  leave Tunis for Gaza and Jericho to assume the self-rule  authority there, well-informed Palestinian sources have told  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that a severe crisis has erupted among the  main Fatah leaders: Yasir 'Arafat, Mahmud 'Abbas [Abu-Mazin],  Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir), and Faruq Qaddumi [Abu-al-Lutf].    The sources said that Abu-Mahir, head of the Mobilization  and  Organization Department [MOD] and member of the Central  Committee, has decided to quit political action and that he  intends to reside in Amman or Damascus or remain in Tunis.    According to the sources, the Palestinian president, who has  close social links with Abu-Mahir, tried early in the week to  persuade him not to resign, but his attempts failed, although  'Arafat personally visited the MOD head's office last Sunday and  had lunch with Abu-Mahir the day before yesterday.    Other information indicates that Abu-Mazin too has expressed  to the Palestinian president his wish to quit organizational and  political action -- which some people have interpreted as  resignation from Fatah.    Meanwhile the new appointments made by 'Arafat have provoked  angry reactions among numerous Palestinian leaders, especially  Abu-Mahir, Abu-Mazin, and Abu-al-Lutf. Some circles say that  they now regard themselves as merely formal leaders in the  movement and that the ship's helm is now steered by hidden hands.</p>

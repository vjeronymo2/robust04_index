			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / The FT Interview: Deals fall out of fashion - Giorgio Armani Giorgio Armani the fashion designer re-mains calm; but Giorgio Armani the entrepreneur is shaken. Admittedly it has been a bad week for Italian fashion. On Monday, the close-knit Milan community learned that bad-boy designer Franco Moschino had died at the weekend, aged only 44. Then it emerged that an inquiry into bribes paid to Italy's tax police had spread to the fashion world. Big names, such as Santo Versace, brother of designer Gianni and chairman of the Versace group, and Krizia (designer Mariuccia Mandelli), have already been questioned by Mr Antonio Di Pietro, Italy's best-known investigating magistrate - although the interviews were described as routine. Mr Armani is more worried, however, about the problems of Simint, a Modena-based clothing company in which he holds a 22.5 per cent stake. On Saturday, the company reported a loss of L222bn (Pounds 90m) for the year to April 30 on turnover of just L266bn. A boardroom row about how to restate previous accounts to reflect previously hidden losses ended in the resignation of Mr Massimo Varazzani, Simint's chairman since March. For Mr Armani, the man who pioneered loose suits, it has come as an unpleasant surprise to find his name associated, albeit indirectly, with allegations of loose accounting. His business reputation and his carefully tended image have both been dented, and the Simint affair has cast a shadow over celebrations of his 60th birthday and 20 years in business. But it could also represent the next phase in the maturing of Armani the entrepreneur, which began when his partner and best friend, Mr Sergio Galeotti, died 10 years ago. 'I've lived through some pretty critical moments recently,' says Mr Armani. 'I found myself faced with problems I'd never come across - problems with lawyers, newspaper articles which say things about you which aren't true. That shocked me.' Simint's problems began in late 1992, a year after its US subsidiary launched a new concept called A/X Armani Exchange. The stores were aimed at the mass market, unlike the existing Giorgio Armani boutiques and second-line Emporio Armani stores, and were supposed to sell Armani jeans and other casual clothes, manufactured by Simint, from top locations across the US. Simint was not the first example of Mr Armani putting his money where his designs were. He also has a stake in Luxottica, the successful Italian spectacle manufacturer quoted in the US. But in the case of Simint, Mr Armani appeared to relax his famously strict control over any venture connected with his name. 'A/X was born with a very precise concept of salespoints for A/X products and Armani jeans, but locations were very badly evaluated,' the designer now says. 'The personnel structure was also very heavy, with too many people - exaggerated for the type of work we were trying to do.' Simint's investment costs in the US bore down on the group's profits, and last February Mr Francesco Micheli, the Milan financier who took control of Simint in the late 1980s, sold his 22 per cent stake, claiming that the US venture had become too risky. Mr Armani now says he regrets the investment, and points to Simint as an object lesson in what can go wrong if you fail to keep control of a concept. 'It's the first time this has happened to me. I delegated a lot because I heard people talking with great fluency and competence about the problem and I said, well, OK, they know what's what, I'll use them.' He is cagey about allocating blame for the Simint debacle, but feels a responsibility to do as much as possible to keep the company afloat. Armani business now accounts for 90 per cent of Simint's turnover, following the loss of other licences. The designer has allowed Simint to defer L50bn worth of payments due to Armani and committed many of his own staff to help rescue the company. Simint's survival also hinges on the outcome of negotiations to sell the US subsidiary to Mr Ong Beng Seng, another shareholder, for L20bn, which Mr Armani says should be concluded shortly. None of this means the designer is himself short of cash. Giorgio Armani SpA, founded with Mr Galeotti in 1975, is in the best of health in spite of the international recession. Armani clothing and accessories, from scent to suitcases, turned over L1,130bn last year, up 31 per cent on 1992. Armani style ('fashion which helps people live better, not fashion which is done for the mass media, for the petits bourgeois, to shock') seems to have become a staple part of the wardrobes of the well-off. That said, it seems unlikely that he would now be described - as Forbes magazine did in 1991 on the eve of the A/X launch - as 'one of the sharpest businessmen you are ever likely to meet', without at least some qualification. The Simint affair has instilled a once-bitten-twice-shy caution into the designer. For example, he is co-operating with CVC Capital Partners  - the European venture capital arm of Citicorp - on undefined plans to rescue GFT, another troubled Italian supplier of Armani clothes, and prop up Simint. But Mr Armani insists that his group would be an industrial partner and not a shareholder in GFT. 'If you asked me now whether I wanted to take a shareholding in any type of company, I would say no,' Mr Armani says. The episode has also reinforced Mr Armani's wish to exert absolute control over a fashion empire. 'It's obviously been illuminating for me,' he says. 'In our business, you absolutely cannot delegate to anyone, unless you decide simply to exploit your name, take a lot of money and forget about it: that means, however, not lasting long, not having a future and deciding to wrap things up. I'm still very young to want to wrap things up.' Such an attitude raises the inevitable question about what will happen to the designer's business creation 'after' Mr Armani, an issue which he admits he is only just beginning to consider in any detail. 'I'm not so egotistical to think we have to close the business down just because I close my eyes,' he said this week. But the lesson of Simint, his 'first professional problem', seems to be that there will have to be some very careful planning if Giorgio Armani SpA is successfully to outlive its founder.</p>

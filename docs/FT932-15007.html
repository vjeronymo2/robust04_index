			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound rallies against D-Mark STERLING rose one-and-a-half pfennigs against the D-Mark in yesterday's European trading, following the release of more strong data for the UK economy, writes James Blitz. After rising 1 1/4 pfennigs against the D-Mark on Tuesday, yesterday's industrial production figures, showing a 1.6 per cent rise in February after a fall of 0.1 per cent in January, enhanced the bullish mood. The pound rose from about DM2.4650 to peak at about DM2.4775 at lunchtime in London, immediately after the figures were released. Sterling later closed at DM2.4700, a net rise of  3/4 of a pfennig on the day. The currency's trade weighted index, which compares sterling with its 1985 value against a basket of currencies closed at 80.8 per cent, up 0.4 percentage points on the day. Several dealers suggested the pound could move higher from current levels. However, Mr Mike Gallagher, Director of Economic Research at IDEA in London, cautioned that sterling may be capped by the Bank of England's purchase of currencies in the foreign exchange market. He noted that UK reserves had fallen by Dollars 1.7bn in March when the Bank is thought to have repaid loans received to support its currency in the run-up to Black Wednesday last year. Mr Gallagher said there were rumours that the Bank had been buying foreign currencies in recent days to make up the loss. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America in London, also cautioned that the pound might fall back today when the Maastricht treaty is debated in the House of Commons. After several weeks of consistent strength, the yen weakened against the dollar yesterday following Tuesday's announcement of a Y13,200bn economic package aimed at reviving Japan's troubled economy. After hitting a new record high of Y112.58 against the US currency on Monday morning, the yen depreciated to a close of Y113.95 in Europe last night. According to Mr Hawkins of Bank of America, this week's fiscal stimulus is the first indication from the Japanese that they will reduce their huge trade surplus with the US by boosting their economy and sucking in American imports rather than by letting the yen appreciate. The yen may also have weakened with the passing of the financial year-end in Japan, which saw much repatriation of the Japanese currency. The dollar gained a pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, despite a very small cut in the interest rate at which the Bundesbank offers wholesale funds to commercial banks. The cut in the repo rate by 2 basis points to 8.11 per cent failed to stop the dollar rising to a close of DM1.5915 from a previous DM1.5790. One analyst said there had been profit- taking by dealers with short dollar positions following the recent sell-off of the US currency.</p>

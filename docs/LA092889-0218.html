			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> JUDGE ORDERS EX-BLACK PANTHER TRANSFERRED FROM FOLSOM PRISON  </P> <P> A federal judge today ordered former Black Panther Elmer (Geronimo) Pratt out  of Folsom Prison for his own safety and accused state prison officials of  retaliatory action in moving him to the facility.  </P> <P> Pratt, 41, challenged his hasty transfer out of San Quentin Prison to Folsom  Sept. 12, contending he feared for his life from Folsom guards. Pratt made it  clear he was even willing to go back to solitary confinement at San Quentin  rather than face possible harm at Folsom.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Stanley Weigel ordered Pratt removed from Folsom and  returned to San Quentin stating, "I find the transfer to Folsom was retaliatory  and that there is sufficient basis for a preliminary injunction against his  stay in Folsom."  </P> <P> Weigel rejected a request by California prison officials to stay the order long  enough to appeal the ruling.  </P> <P> Pratt contends his prison files contain false allegations that he was engaged  in plots to kidnap the children of Folsom guards and that he planned to kill  Folsom guards with poison darts in 1974.  </P> <P> The courtroom, crowded with Pratt supporters, erupted into applause at the  judge's final ruling.  </P></p>

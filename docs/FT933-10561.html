			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities take their cue from Europe Wall Street US SHARES rebounded yesterday after Friday's heavy selling, and prices posted solid gains in the wake of sharply firmer overseas equity markets, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 21.52 at 3,560.99. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 2.02 higher at 450.15, while the American SE composite gained 0.88 at 437.88 and the Nasdaq composite was up 2.96 at 707.66. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 230.4m shares. After last week's late sell-off, which knocked nearly 30 points off the Dow, the markets opened in an upbeat mood. Early morning gains in London, Paris and Frankfurt stock markets, which reacted positively to the European Community finance ministers' decision to ease restrictions in the European exchange rate mechanism and allow currencies more room to fluctuate, boosted prices from the start. US investors hope the relaxing of the ERM bands will allow European governments to lower their interest rates to boost local economic growth. Stronger growth in Europe should mean stronger demand for US exports, a part of the US economy that investors have been worried about lately. There was also some, admittedly modest, good news at home, in the form of a rise in the National Association of Purchasing Management's July index of manufacturing activity. Although the index remains weak by normal post-recession standards, the increase was seen by investors as a welcome move in the right direction. Among individual stocks, blue chips and cyclicals, which took the hardest battering last Friday, rallied. Caterpillar gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 78 1/8 , Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing put on Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 106 3/8 , Eastman Kodak firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 54 1/4 and Coca-Cola added Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 43 1/2. Motor issues continued to outperform the market. Chrysler climbed Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 44 3/8 , Ford Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 54 5/8 and General Motors Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 49 5/8. Semiconductor shares were also in demand, lifted by positive comments about the sector in the Wall Street Journal. Motorola advanced Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 94 3/8 , Texas Instruments Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 71 5/8 and National Semiconductor Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 16 3/4. Boeing lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 39 on reports that the company may cut aircraft production if it fails to land an important order from Saudi Arabia. On the Nasdaq market, Dell Computer firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 21 in volume of more than 1.6m shares on hopes that the company's performance will improve following the introduction of new products and a new marketing strategy.

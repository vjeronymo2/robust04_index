			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Party rejects call to link pensions with earnings with delegates responding to appeals for realism by rejecting a call for the restoration of the link between earnings and the level of pensions. An amendment by Mr Archy Kirkwood, the party's chief whip and spokesman on social security, advocated the restoration of the link removed by the Thatcher government. Mr Kirkwood contended that in the present stage of the political cycle it would be premature for the party to abandon its commitment to improving the living standard of all pensioners. 'I do not want to release the earnings linkage until I am absolutely convinced it is unaffordable,' he said. He estimated that the initial net cost of the move would be Pounds 250m a year. Mr Mike Bell, a member of the party's federal policy committee, insisted: 'We sniff the scent of real power and realise that these policies may have to be implemented.' He suggested that the real cost of restoring the link between pensions and earnings would be Pounds 3bn a year. Mr Bell said it would 'rip the heart out' of the recently published consultative document in which the party outlined costed proposals for providing dignity in old age for all pensioners. Sir William Goodhart, chairman of the tax and benefits working group, agreed that a forthcoming policy paper should include a commitment to establish a separate 'pensioners index' which more accurately reflected their living costs than the retail price index. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, seized on the fact that the debate had shown Mr Kirkwood to be at odds with Earl Russell, Liberal Democrat spokesman on social security in the House of Lords. The minister said this had demonstrated the 'anarchic confusion' in Liberal Democrat ranks.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS, VIKINGS WON'T SHOW THEIR CARDS IN EXHIBITION TONIGHT  </P> <P> The Rams and Minnesota Vikings, wild-card playoff opponents last winter but  less than wild Super Bowl notions this summer, meet tonight at Anaheim Stadium  in the 44th annual Times-Rams Charity Game.  </P> <P> The game is:  </P> <P>  -- A showdown? Well, no, that won't come until Nov. 5, when the teams play for  keeps at Minneapolis.  </P> <P>  -- A sneak preview? Well, no, it wouldn't make sense to throw down your best  cards in August when there's no money in the pot.  </P> <P> "I don't think you try any strategy things," Ram Coach John Robinson said this  week. "If you've got a good idea against them, you'd hate to use it now. And  have them ready for it.  </P> <P>  -- A grudge match? Let's just say the goal posts are safe should the Rams try  to gain a measure of revenge for last December's 28-17 playoff loss.  </P> <P>  -- An exhibition game that few will remember when the teams meet again in  three months? You're getting warmer.  </P> <P> Tonight's game is comparable to the first round of most title fights, not the  last. Secrecy and camouflage are the concerns; the big punches come later.  </P> <P> More than a few experts are picking these teams to play in the championship  game in January, based on past performances and potential.  </P> <P> But just now, both coaches have enough problems filling out starting lineups.  </P> <P> Viking Coach Jerry Burns concedes this much:  </P> <P> "I think if you take the top 10 teams in football, I think we're one of them. I  think the Rams are one of them. When you get to that point, anyone can go all  the way -- somebody gets the hot hand, or gets to believing in themselves, or a  break in the schedule. But I don't think you can look at anybody and say here  are the two teams that are going to go all the way to the Super Bowl."  </P> <P> Both teams are still without big guns. The Vikings are missing safety Joey  Browner, receiver Anthony Carter, tight end Steve Jordan and linebacker Jesse  Solomon -- all holdouts. The Rams are without tailback Greg Bell, tackle Robert  Cox, tight end Damone Johnson and first-round fullback Cleveland Gary.  </P> <P> The quarterback controversy in Minnesota is over. At least Burns says it's  over. Wade Wilson made the Pro Bowl in 1988 and signed a four-year,  $4.35-million deal in the off-season. He has moved ahead of veteran Tommy  Kramer for good, though Kramer still has the touch.  </P> <P> He replaced Wilson last week against Washington and completed 13 of 23 passes  for 245 yards and a touchdown. Wilson had connected on just four of 10 for 52  yards and thrown two interceptions.  </P> <P> Naturally, Kramer's performance drew headlines and rekindled the controversy.  </P> <P> "They're trying to stir one up," Burns said of his local reporters. "But  there's none as far as I'm concerned. Wade is our No. 1 guy. Tommy is two, and  (Rich) Gannon is three."  </P> <P> The decisions Robinson faces at quarterback are all in the lower ranks. Backup  Mark Herrmann's cracked rib sent panic waves through the organization that  beamed clear to Atlanta, where Steve Dils was selling commercial real estate.  </P> <P> The Rams plucked Dils from retirement and have asked him to hold a clipboard  until Herrmann can take a deep breath. Dils may even get a few snaps tonight  and could play the second half against Detroit next week.  </P> <P> "I don't want him to embarrass himself," Robinson said of Dils. "But I want him  to get a taste."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Reserve guard Mark Schmidt, hospitalized briefly after suffering a concussion  in practice last week, will be out an estimated eight weeks with a herniated  disk. . . . Viking defensive tackle Keith Millard makes his first appearance of  the season tonight after returning from an ankle injury. . . . As of Friday,  there were 54 holdouts remaining in the league, including six first-round picks  and 21 Pro Bowl players. Only four teams -- Buffalo, Chicago, Pittsburgh and  Washington -- had all their players in camp.  </P> <P> Injury update: Viking defensive ends Doug Martin and Curtis Greer will miss  tonight's game with knee injuries. Guard Randy Rasmussen is out with a back  injury. . . . For the Rams, Pro Bowl left guard Tom Newberry and receiver Aaron  Cox make their first appearances after returning from hamstring injuries. . . .  Ram starters will play into the third quarter tonight. . . . Guard Duval Love,  who signed Friday, will be in uniform and may play a little.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSBITES: LAGUNA'S LAS BRISAS TO RESUME SERVING BREAKFAST  </P> <P> Las Brisas in Laguna Beach recently resumed serving breakfast Mondays through  Saturdays from 8 to 11. It's buffet style, with an omelet station, eggs  Benedict, Mexican-style eggs, fresh fruits and muffins, for $6.95.  </P> <P> Owners Tony and Janina Musci have changed the name of Adriano's in Santa Ana to  Armonia (Italian for peace and happiness). The Muscis say they wanted to avoid  a battle over the use of the name with Lancia Inc., which has a restaurant  called Adriano's in Los Angeles. But, they promise, nothing else about their  restaurant has changed.  </P> <P> It's Mardi Gras at Remick's in Irvine Tuesday, beginning at 5 p.m. with a  complimentary buffet of Cajun and Creole specialties. There'll also be a cold  seafood bar and wine-tasting; a Dixieland band will play, and souvenir photos  will be snapped. Information: (714) 553-1305.  </P> <P> Sapori in Newport Beach has a new lunch menu, designed to try to move you in  and out quickly. It includes pizzas, vitello tonnato for $6.75 and seafood  salad. Reservations: (714) 644-4220.  </P> <P> Il Ristorante Bagata in Newport Beach has started offering a pre-theatre menu  between 6 and 7 p.m.: Italian mixed salad, fresh pasta and choice of entree for  $25 per person. Reservations: (714) 675-4020.  </P> <P> Le Meridien in Newport Beach is packaging an evening's entertainment on March  10. For prices starting at $259, you'll get dinner for two, two tickets to the  ballet "Romeo and Juliet" at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, two  after-the-theatre cordials and overnight accommodations.  </P> <P> GOINGS AND COMINGS: Just Like Perry's in Mission Viejo has closed. . . . Paul  and Judy Astbury have opened Gibson's Food Emporium in Irvine at the former  site of Irvine Ranch Farmers Market, in the Walnut Village Center at Culver  Drive and Walnut. There's a salad bar with 40 selections and 10 house-recipe  dressings; a deli case, and hot dishes.  </P></p>

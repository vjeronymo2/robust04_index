One of the  shortcomings of membrane extraction is the low reproducibility  of quasi-liquid membranes. This may be overcome by increasing  the contact surface of the phases by multiple emulsification or  by using a different type of module. However, there are other  ways. When metals are passed through an extraction quasi-liquid  membrane, maxima are frequently observed on curves representing  stream size as a function of the concentration of  carrier-extractant. These maxima represent the presence of  parallel processes accompanying metal-carrier interaction.  Basically, these are solution processes having an effect on the  system viscosity when the coefficient of distribution of the  metal in the aqueous and organic phases becomes a function of  both the carrier and the concentration of the solvent. However,  it is entirely possible that a change in the mechanism of the  metal transfer takes place within these maxima. In the present  work IR- Fourier spectroscopy was used to study the extraction  of cobalt (II) from a hydrochloric acid solution with a  tri-n-octylamine in decane solution. A marked increase in cobalt  (II) transport over a narrow interval of extractant-carrier  during membrane extraction is explained as being due to a change  in the transport mechanism, hypothetically differing from either  a diffusion or ``relay'' type mechanism.

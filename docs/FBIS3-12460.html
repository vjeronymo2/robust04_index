			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has stated that  the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuk is a grave  development that aims to push Lebanon into very dangerous and  negative security and political problems.    He accused Israel's intelligence service of arranging the  crime, which was meant to divert attention from the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre and involve Lebanon again in the cycle of  violence. He added that this requires more vigilance, caution,  and unity to confront such grave challenges.    In an interview with AL-SHARQ, Fadlallah said: In the  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, we cannot help but see the ugly  American face, because the United States has provided Israel  with every means of protection against international moves to  condemn it. He said the U.S. President's call to the  Palestinians and Israelis to move the negotiations to Washington  is meant to save the Palestinians' face and to insinuate that  the Palestinians have broken down the Zionist barrier placed by  Israel between the United States and the Palestinians. This  gives the impression that the U.S. President's direct  sponsorship of the negotiations might give the Palestinians the  unrealistic dream that Washington will pressure the Jews to  accept what they have rejected in Taba. But the issue is this:  The United States will exert more pressure on the Palestinians  by claiming to discuss the need for peace and for opposing the  extremist Jews.    Fadlallah said there should be a Palestinian stance that  reflects respect for the blood of the Palestinian people and  there should also be a firm Arab stance mobilizing all the Arab  factors of strength that will confront this massacre and its  implications so that the world can know that the Arabs have  broken the mold of ineffectiveness.    On what prompted Clinton to meet Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad, Fadlallah said: It was the feeling that President  al-Asad has highlighted Syria's Arab role. This success enabled  him to make the Syrian stance rebel against all the internal and  foreign factors of weakness. Syria was meant to remain weak in  the post-Gulf war changes. But the political surprise was  President al-Asad's success in benefiting from all the Islamic,  Palestinian, and Arab strengths and exploiting them to highlight  the Syrian stance. Syria emphasized its strength in its recent  position and this made the Americans feel that the Syrian role  was indispensable. This role has remained strong despite all  the pressures on it. He noted that there was no change in U.S.  policy after the Geneva conference but a change in tactics.    Fadlallah stressed that the resistance will stay if there is  a limited Israeli withdrawal from the south and might stay even  if there is a withdrawal from all of the south. He said: I  believe President al-Asad understands the value of the  resistance in restoring Arab dignity and in pressuring Israel  and the U.S. stance.    Regarding reports of U.S. fears of possible Israeli  operations in the south, Fadlallah said: The method of  discussing fears is the strongest form of threat.    He said he does not believe the pope's scheduled visit to  Lebanon is of any unusual importance. He said: I do not  believe it will have any important political impact on Lebanon's  major issue, namely, the Israeli occupation. As we can see, the  pope's gift to the Lebanese and Arab peoples before his visit  was the quick recognition of Israel. We do not believe this  gift encourages the Lebanese to think that this visit will  greatly benefit their ambitions.</p>

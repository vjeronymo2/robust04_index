			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Letter: Budget - impressive conjuring trick and real PEP picture (2) Sir, The article on the effect of the changes in Advance Corporation Tax on PEPs is misleading, especially with regard to unit trust PEPs ('ACT changes may hit PEP sales', March 18). The changes will not 'make PEPs particularly unattractive to basic-rate taxpayers'. If nothing else changes, the yield on a PEP might fall from 5 per cent to 4.69 per cent. That yield would still remain competitive with building society rates and is received gross by any taxpayer. To suggest that these hypothetical changes at the margin will suddenly mean that PEP changes will neutralise the benefits of PEPs is wrong, certainly so far as unit trust PEPs are concerned. The yield on unit trust PEPs is quoted after charges. More importantly, the article is wholly hypothetical. We do not know how companies will react; we do not know how fund managers will react. As Lex pointed out, companies may come under pressure to increase dividend payments; fund managers may switch into higher-yielding shares, such as utilities; PEP managers may increase the weight of bonds in the portfolio. Any of these changes would undermine the premises of the article. Indeed, they could increase the yield of PEPs. Investors should continue to consider unit trust PEPs wherever they are concerned with long-term saving. Indeed, for higher-rate taxpayers the advantages of PEPs have been enhanced. They should ignore the worst-case forecasts and watch the reaction in the real world. Philip Warland, director-general, Unit Trust Association, 65 Kingsway, London WC2</p>

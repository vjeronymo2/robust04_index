			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Profit-pay cut angers unions at LWT Unions at London Weekend Television, a subsidiary of the Granada Group, yesterday expressed anger at the imposition of a sharp cut in profit-related pay at the London ITV company. Staff were told 3 per cent of LWT's 1994-95 profits would be divided among staff as profit-related pay for the financial year starting on October 1. The pool for the current year is 7 per cent, and it was 8 per cent last year. The cut in profit-related pay comes less than two months after Granada integrated the non-programme making activities of Granada Television and LWT, causing the loss of between 150 and 200 jobs from a combined staff of 2,000. To sweeten the pill, staff will be paid monthly 'on account' 4 per cent of their qualifying salary from the eventual total of profit-related pay. LWT staff were warned by Mr Michael Southgate, deputy managing director, that the longer-term aim was to work towards a common Granada/LWT profit-related pay scheme. LWT staff fear this may cause a further erosion. There is also concern that possible cuts in management bonuses at LWT will adversely affect a forthcoming issue of employee shares. Top LWT managers, many of them millionaires from a management share scheme, agreed to make money available to fund an employee share scheme. Not all the money has been handed over and reduced bonuses may hinder the process.</p>

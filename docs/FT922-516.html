			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Letter: Too risky Sir, Members of Lloyd's facing increasing catastrophe loss cannot be expected to pay into ever mounting reserves for the continuing US asbestos and pollution claims. These risks cannot be reinsured at Lloyd's since they could not have been perceived at inception many decades ago and they are outside the scope of insurance. A moratorium should be put on increasing open syndicate reserves as these are now far in excess of those required by other insurers with whom we compete, and have dissipated in running costs. As there is to be no rescue, only a levy on all names, a moratorium could only encourage some of us to continue underwriting.

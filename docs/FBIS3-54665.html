			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Latvia intends to clearly formulate its proposals  connected with the possibility of letting Russia maintain its  radar station in Skrunda in the near future. Riga hopes that  negotiations on this issue will continue, Foreign Minister  Georgs Andrejevs told Interfax.    He deplored the circumstance that in 1993 Latvia and Russia  did not succeed in reaching agreement on the main issue --  Russian troops withdrawal from Latvia.    However Russia's new initiatives aimed at stepping up the  withdrawal of the remaining military units are a positive  factor, the minister said. (Interfax's note: Russia proclaimed  its willingness to withdraw its troops from Latvia before August  31st, 1994, if it maintains control over the radar station in  Skrunda for another six years).    Andrejevs also expressed concern about the circumstance that  most Russians living in Latvia cast their ballots for Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party and for communists. "We  have no illusions in regard to the sentiments of many Russians  living in Latvia. Our practice shows that what motivates them  is the desire to reverse the course of history and return to the  recent past, not the striving for democracy," he said.</p>

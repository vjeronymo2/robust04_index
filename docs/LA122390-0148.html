			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLASSICS ON CASSETTE: 'SHORT STORIES OF KATHERINE MANSFIELD'  </P> <P> Born Kathleen Mansfield Beauchamp in 1888 in Wellington, New Zealand, Katherine  Mansfield, as she chose to call herself as a writer, became one of the shapers  of the modern short story.  </P> <P> This collection of 15 unabridged titles has been skillfully chosen to show her  development from her first experiments to her final triumphs. They are read  perceptively in a sensitive variety of voices by Rosemary Harris, who won an  Emmy for the role of George Sand in Masterpiece Theatre's "Notorious Woman" and  a Tony for her portrayal of Eleanor of Aquitaine in "A Lion in Winter."  </P> <P> Mansfield's work is so closely linked to her own life that at times it is  impossible to separate them. Sent in 1903 to Queen's College, London, by her  upper-middle-class parents -- her father was a successful banker -- she learned  something of the larger world during the next three years and returned  reluctantly to her home only on the insistence of her family. She already had  begun to publish brief sketches and finally persuaded her father to give her a  small allowance that let her return in 1908 to London and the free-spirited  life that she was determined to experience.  </P> <P> Married on March 2, 1909, to George Bowden, 11 years her senior, she left him  on the following day. By May, she was pregnant by another man, a Polish  musician, and retreated to Bavaria, where she first read a selection of  Chekov's stories, in German translation. They led her to the discovery of her  true bent, giving her a form and a technique to handle the sudden flashes of  perception that characterized her earliest work. Following a miscarriage, she  returned to London and began publishing seriously in the New Age, a socialist  journal.  </P> <P> After living briefly with her husband, she left him again, had an abortion in  the spring of 1911 after another affair, and published her first collection,  "In a German Pension," most of its harsh, satiric material based on her  Bavarian stay. In the following year she met and began living with John  Middleton Murry, an eccentric critic and editor, whom she was to marry in 1918  after her divorce from Bowden. She and Murry spent the winter of 1913-14 in  Paris, where she wrote her first long story, "Something Childish but Very  Natural," a delicate, dreamlike treatment of an adolescent love affair,  tenderly read here by Rosemary Harris. Another turning point in Mansfield's  life came with World War I, when her younger brother Leslie arrived in London  during February of 1915 to join his regiment. The brother brought back to his  sister both happy and not so happy memories of their childhood. On Oct. 7,  Leslie was killed in action, and Katherine deliberately turned to writing about  their early family life in New Zealand, ultimately producing three of her  greatest stories: "Prelude," "At the Bay" and "The Garden Party," all included  in this collection.  </P> <P> Never entirely comfortable in the established literary circles of London,  Mansfield was both attracted to their members and at the same time felt  socially insecure among them as well as critical of their work. A friendship  with Virginia Woolf started out promisingly only to end in mutually wary  dislike. Mansfield confided to Murry that she felt Woolf's "Night and Day" "a  lie in the soul," and Woolf said of "Bliss," one of Mansfield's treatments of  the intelligentsia, that "the whole conception is poor, cheap, not the vision .  . . of an interesting mind." After listening to Harris' sympathetic reading  here, you are free to make your own judgment, and perhaps suspect that  something as uncool as jealousy, from the point of view of the Bloomsbury  Group, might be involved. Whatever your decision, the stories of the two show  striking similarities at times, with the New Zealand upstart frequently the  leader in experiment.  </P> <P> Her health always precarious, Mansfield spent most of her winters on the  Continent, leading to frequent separations from Murry. In "The Man Without a  Temperament," she creates a reunion in which the husband, outwardly attentive  to the needs of his wife's illness, lives inwardly altogether in their past. In  actual life, however, their marriage endured through all the difficulties they  had to face, even after Mansfield clearly was in the advanced stages of  tuberculosis.  </P> <P> In her exploration of the human condition, Mansfield is most effective in her  treatment of the sudden revelations of everyday life, frequently those  experienced by women and children. Though dealing in both the imagined and  given worlds of isolated and lonely figures, she never would have risked on  paper a climax as dramatic as her own.  </P> <P> Losing faith in the radium treatments prescribed by her doctor, she eventually  entered the Gurdjieff Institute at Fontainebleau, believing she could cure  herself under the Russian mystic's care. Here she experienced what is called in  Medical Latin spes phthisica, "consumptive hope," a false belief in complete  recovery, leading to radiant optimism about the future.  </P> <P> Murry was able to visit her on Jan. 9, 1923, and they spent a happy afternoon  and evening together. Then, as she started upstairs to her room, a massive  hemorrhage felled her and she died in a matter of minutes.  </P> <P> WHERE TO ORDER TAPES: Produced by Listening Library, Inc., distributed by G.

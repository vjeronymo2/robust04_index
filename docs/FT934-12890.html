			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Regional campaigners quick to learn electoral tricks AS Russian President Boris Yeltsin's allies lay their plans for the coming elections, Mr Boris Mizrakhy, a pro-Yeltsin official in the distant city of Chelyabinsk, has been poring over electoral maps. For, as the campaign for the December parliamentary elections gets under way in Russia, pro-Yeltsin forces in cities such as Chelyabinsk are already using every electoral trick for the battle. 'We (in the government) have the right to set the electoral boundaries. So we will set them in a way that is good for the Yeltsin parties,' says Mr Mizrakhy, who works in the local pro-Yeltsin administration and is himself planning to stand as a candidate. Judging from the political climate in Chelyabinsk - an industrial region in the Urals 1,800km east of Moscow, with 3.6m people and many key nuclear missile sites - it seems that the pro-Yeltsin forces may not need to resort to such ploys to win. Following Mr Yeltsin's crackdown on anti-Yeltsin officials in recent weeks, his opponents in the regions are in disarray. The chief opposition to Mr Yeltsin in Chelyabinsk, and in most of the 88 regions and autonomous republics of Russia, has been the regional council, which was elected four years ago at the same time as the now-defunct Russian parliament, and dominated by Soviet era officials. The Chelyabinsk council has vociferously supported parliament - during the recent battle in Moscow it thrice passed resolutions condemning Mr Yeltsin's actions, and has repeatedly demanded economic autonomy for the region. And although Mr Yeltsin appealed to the regional councils last week to dissolve themselves, the council has so far defied the decree. 'We will fight on. You in the west have one standard for democracy for the west and one for Russia - where else would you allow a president to sack all its elected councils?' says one council leader. But in spite of the bitter words, the anti-Yeltsin forces are in confusion, with many claiming that they have been 'betrayed' by extremists in the Russian parliament. A decree from Mr Yeltsin has stripped the council of most of its powers and budget. And although the council plans to participate in the elections, the local media remains pro-Yeltsin, and most of the anti-Yeltsin parties banned. Some in the council hope the Unity and Accord party, founded by Mr Sergei Shakrai a week ago, will provide an alternative platform, particularly since Mr Shakrai's party is now organising in the provinces. In recent months, Mr Shakrai has been at pains to cultivate support from regional councils and repeatedly telephoned the Chelyabinsk council last week. But though the Chelyabinsk council believes that a large proportion of the population still supports it, it will have an uphill fight against the pro-Yeltsin forces, who have already organised themselves around the 'Russia's Choice' party - the party headed by Mr Yeltsin's close ally, Mr Yegor Gaidar. In the last year Mr Gaidar has taken pains to court Chelyabinsk's administration - he twice made the two-hour flight from Moscow to visit the local governor, Mr Vadim Solovev. Meanwhile, the Russia Choice group has already started selecting its candidates and providing finance for their campaign. 'I am taking part to defend my business and defend the reforms,' says one candidate, who fears that if the Communists came back to power they would strip him of the private meat factory he owns. But, as in most other regions of Russia, the ideological labels of 'communist' or 'democrat' conceal a host of private rivalries. The 'democrat' side, headed by Mr Solovev, for example, is far from 'democratic' in some of its attitudes. Mr Solovev, for example, believes that if too many Communists are elected to the parliament, Mr Yeltsin must dissolve it, and strongly opposes elections for his own post as governor. 'If we had elections an old Communist might win. Would America and other countries want a Communist controlling a region with thousands of nuclear warheads?' he says. Meanwhile, Mr Solovev - like so many of his counterparts across the country  -has a personal vendetta to wage. His main rival, Mr Pyotr Sumin, the head of the local council, was originally an ally of Mr Solovev. Until the end of the 1980s the two men worked in the local Communist party, and were such friends they built their dachas next door to each other. However, when Mr Solovev was selected by Mr Yeltsin to be governor, the men became deadly rivals, with Mr Sumin taking the anti-Yeltsin side. The political rivalry has now led to the two men building a two-metre-high wall between their gardens. And as the bitter battle for the elections get under way across the country, it seems that personal power struggles such as this one - rather than ideological abstractions - could yet be the key force in much of the election.</p>

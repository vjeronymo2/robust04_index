			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Few defend Lyell as lawyers bet on his successor It could have been worse. Sir Nicholas Lyell's appearance before the Scott inquiry yesterday did not end in calls for his head from Conservative MPs. But as the dust settled, few of the attorney-general's colleagues were rushing to defend him. Downing Street indignantly denied suggestions that Mr John Major's lukewarm defence of the attorney-general at question time in the Commons suggested that he was preparing to sacrifice Sir Nicholas. But it was noted on the Tory back benches that the prime minister had failed to take an ideal opportunity to reinforce his beleaguered minister. Some MPs said Sir Nicholas's best hope was that he would be protected by the sheer complexity of the issues involved in his advice to ministers on the rules covering public interest immunity certificates. Few MPs profess to understand the legal subtleties; most say their postbag confirms that the general public is no better informed. However, both MPs and voters understand that innocent men could have gone to prison in the Matrix Churchill case because ministers suppressed evidence on Sir Nicholas's advice. MPs were also drawing a contrast between Sir Nicholas's refusal to answer Commons questions, and his decision to give a raft of interviews on the eve of his inquiry appearance. One Conservative backbencher said: 'If he wanted to defend himself he should have been doing it on the floor of the Commons, not in front of the TV cameras.' Underlying the issues is a widespread feeling that Sir Nicholas is out of his depth; a pleasant man who is not really up to the job. Many Conservative MPs say that he can probably benefit the government more by going. One said: 'I think his position is becoming untenable. I don't think he will go before the summer, but I can't see how he can escape being one of the fall-guys for Scott.' Perhaps the best indication of the attorney-general's weak position came from the law courts, where his legal friends were taking bets last night on his successor. Some were tipping Sir Derek Spencer, the solicitor-general, who looks like a strong contender because of his position as deputy to Sir Nicholas. Mr Douglas Hogg, the Foreign Office minister, was also being mentioned by leading barristers as a candidate. However, the well-bred legal fraternity was too well mannered to say that Mr Hogg might command more respect from both his political and legal colleagues than the beleaguered incumbent.</p>

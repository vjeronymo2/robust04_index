			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOLAR PLANE ALMOST COMPLETES RECORD-SETTING FLIGHT  </P> <P> A Riverside County man nearly completed a record-setting, transcontinental  flight in a solar-powered airplane Monday, but was forced to land nine miles  short of his final destination.  </P> <P> Pilot Eric Raymond, 33, of Lake Elsinore, set his homemade aircraft down in a  farmer's field after an ominous storm front rolled in and blocked out the sun.  </P> <P> Klaus Savier, a member of the flight crew, said conditions were so poor Monday  that Raymond was flying just 1,500 feet above the woods of coastal North  Carolina.  </P> <P> "It is treacherous terrain," Savier said. "There's a lot of swampland and a lot  of trees and Eric says he can swim but he can't climb trees."  </P> <P> Raymond is expected to complete the final leg of his landmark journey and land  today at Kitty Hawk, N.C., the birthplace of engine-powered aviation.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 12, RIA -- Russia is determined to  increase its arms exports in 1994 by 50 per cent and raise their  value to 3.5 billion dollars.    This was revealed in an interview with RIA today by Viktor  Glukhikh, head of the State Committee for Defence Industries.    The main budget receipts, according to him, are expected to  come from spare parts for and service maintenance of sold combat  equipment.    At the same time, Russia intends to export tanks, aircraft  and small arms.    The main markets for Russian military equipment are Eastern  Europe, China, India and Syria, said Glukhikh, assuming that up  to 50 per cent of Russian arms exports will go to China and  India.    At the same time, he noted that Russia will supply MIG-29  warplanes to Hungary as repayment of the former USSR's external  debt.    As for Syria, the matter mainly concerns, according to him,  spare part supplies.    He also said that a contract is soon to be signed on the  delivery of 18 MIG-29 planes to Malaysia. The negotiations have  lasted almost two years.    In Glukhikh's opinion, recent media reports that Russian  warplanes may be sold to Pakistan are too optimistic. He thinks  this deal will be very difficult to conclude because of the  opposition of Western competitors. The same kind of opposition  exists in the United Arab Emirates.    Glukhikh noted that Russia also feels opposition in  promoting  military and technical cooperation with South Korea. But  despite this, talks are under way on the joint development of  anti-missile systems.    Notable progress has been achieved also in conversion, in  the  establishment of joint ventures in optics, electronics and  engineering.</p>

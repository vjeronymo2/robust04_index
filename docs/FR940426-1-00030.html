			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Stabilization Alternative <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An alternative regulatory framework for stabilization is provided by the rules of the United Kingdom Securities and Investments Board (``SIB Rules''). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 130 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The SIB Rules provide a safe harbor from charges of violating U.K. antimanipulation law only to the ``stabilizing manager,'' who is analogous to the U.S. managing underwriter. The other syndicate members are neither protected nor restricted by the SIB Rules. The stabilizing manager may bid for or purchase the offered security for the purpose of ``stabilizing or maintaining the market price of the security being offered'' during the ``stabilizing period,'' which can run to the 60th day after the date of allotment made to subscribers and purchasers, potentially much longer than the period covered by Rule 10b&hyph;7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 130 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Chapter III, part 10 of the SIB Rules, 2 Fin. Serv. Rep. (CCH) &para;&para;184.314&hyph;184.401.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SIB Rules are more flexible than Rule 10b&hyph;7 in permitting bids and purchases to closely follow the market, moving up or down, at or below the initial stabilizing price. In addition, the bid may be raised to the last independent sale price even if that price is higher than the initial stabilizing bid. As under Rule 10b&hyph;7, however, no stabilizing price may exceed the offering price. The stabilizing manager also is permitted to overallot the offered securities to ``subscribers or purchasers'' or sell short the securities to facilitate its subsequent stabilizing purchases. Moreover, the SIB Rules permit the stabilizing manager to buy in the market to cover a syndicate short position, and to cover such short position without regard to the general price limits otherwise imposed on stabilizing transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 6.6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Is the SIB stabilizing structure, or some adaptation of that structure, a useful alternative to Rule 10b&hyph;7? What difficulties would be associated with such an approach?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Tiered Modifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted in the body of the release, the manipulative incentives associated with a distribution may vary depending on the type of offering and the nature of its participants. Accordingly, in discussing these alternatives, commentators are requested to consider whether the alternatives could be tiered to address these matters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 6.7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Could an alternative be applied effectively to a limited class of securities? How would such a class be defined, e.g., market capitalization and trading volume of the security?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 6.8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Could an alternative be applied effectively to a limited class of institutional investors? How would such a class be defined?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 6.9.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Could an alternative be applied effectively to a limited class of transactions? How would such a class be defined?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 6.10.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Could an alternative be applied effectively to a limited class of transactions involving a limited class of institutional investors? How would such transactions or investors be defined?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Deregulatory Alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some may believe that the general antifraud and antimanipulation provisions of the federal securities laws are sufficient to deter conduct during distributions that is designed to artificially condition the market for the offered security, and the Trading Practices Rules could be rescinded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 6.11.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Should the Trading Practices Rules be rescinded?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 6.12.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> What difficulties, if any, would arise in applying the concepts identified in this release, if only the general antimanipulation provisions applied to distribution participant conduct during offerings? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 131 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Would there be viable methods for the Commission and its staff to provide guidance as to lawful and unlawful activity?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 131 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> One commentator has remarked: ``Through its very precise and mechanical nature, Rule 10b&hyph;6 is a tradeoff against the possibly more pernicious risk to the issuer or underwriter of an unfocused prohibition against undefined manipulative conduct.''

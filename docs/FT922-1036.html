			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: BfG Bank returns to the black for 1991 BfG Bank, the former German trades union bank which has been through a painful restructuring process in recent years, yesterday reported a group partial operating profit - before trading profits - of DM120.5m (Dollars 76.2m) for 1991. This represents a turnround of DM302.8m over 1990 when the bank reported a loss of DM182.3m. If own-account trading results were included, the turnround was more dramatic: the bank reported profits of DM221.1m last year compared with a loss of DM389.9m. The better performance at this level reflected interest income up DM267m to DM976.5m and administrative and staff costs down by DM47.9m to DM1.13bn. However, at the parent bank, losses at the partial operating level amounted to DM277m last year, compared with a profit of DM338m in 1990, reflecting extraordinary costs associated with the bank's restructuring. Stripping out the one-off items, the partial operating profit was DM60m, compared with a loss of DM259m a year earlier. Speaking in Frankfurt yesterday, Mr Paul Wieandt, chief executive since early 1990 and architect of the bank's subsequent restructuring, said that in the first five months of the year the parent bank's profits were DM48m, DM23m up on the comparable period last year. Mr Wieandt reiterated that a capital increase was likely next year or in 1994 and that the bank was considering raising a total of DM450m, partly to meet tougher capital adequacy rules in Germany. It was likely also that the bank's majority shareholders would have to contribute further capital to the bank this year. Provisions against doubtful sovereign debt rose by DM3.2bn at the end of last year. Mr Wieandt did not say what the total provision was, but indicated that some 20 out of a total of 32 countries accounted for the total.</p>

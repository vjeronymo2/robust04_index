			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Iranian Ambassador to Azerbaijan 'Ali Akbar </F> Nahavandian by Gulsafa Ahmadova;date and place not  given--recorded; first paragraph is introduction]    [Text] Following Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev's  televised address to the nation [on 12 April], the people,  various international organizations, and foreign embassies in  Baku have declared that they are not indifferent to Armenia's  aggressive policy. Our correspondent Gulsafa Ahmadova  interviewed the Iranian Ambassador to Azerbaijan 'Ali Akbar  Nahavandian for our program:    [Ahmadova] In his address to the nation, the republic's  president, Geydar Aliyev, called on international organizations  and neighboring states to express their firm stance and views on  ending the recently intensified aggression by Armenia.    [Nahavandian] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. Yes, both sides asked for the views of the  Islamic Republic of Iran. The Islamic Republic of Iran has  exerted efforts on this issue and, as you will remember, our  foreign minister, Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati, has worked hard on  this case. Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi visited and  held talks in Azerbaijan, Armenia and this region for a month.  But regrettably, at that time certain forces both in Azerbaijan  and Armenia were waging a political struggle against their own  people and used the sacrifice the people's lives and their  countries' stability for their own political interests. And so  those endeavors got no results.    There would have been fewer losses had there been peace two  or three years ago. This war should end peacefully, but it  should be a just peace, that is, these aggressive forces should  withdraw from the territory they have occupied. I think that  violations of borders and changing of geographical boundaries  should definitely not take place in our era. Therefore, from  the very first day the Islamic Republic of Iran has opposed this  aggression, issued many statements against it, announced its  firm position on it, and proposed to constrain this aggression.  It will continue doing so.</p>

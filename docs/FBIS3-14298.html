Maj. Gen. Mufaz told correspondents that so  far three bodies were found in the building in which the  terrorists barricaded themselves. Mufaz says these terrorists  were involved in a long series of attacks, including the murder  of Mordekhay and Shalom Lapid in Hebron, and the murder of  Avraham Zarbiv near the Cave of the Patriarchs.    Maj. Gen. Mufaz said that following the operation in Hebron  only 10 Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad  terrorists remain operating in Judaea and Samaria. Mufaz added  that the Hebron operation was made possible by strenuous Shin  Bet efforts. According to Mufaz the house in which the  terrorists hid served as a storehouse and a launch pad for Hamas  terror acts.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Maria Elena Gil] </F>   [Text] Bridgetown, 6 May (PL) -- Nongovernment  organizations (NGO) have become a very powerful force in  international policy, Cuban President Fidel Castro said today  during the first World Conference on the Sustainable Development  of Small Island States.    During an informal meeting with Caribbean, Pacific,  Mediterranean, and Atlantic NGO representatives at the  Sherbourne Center in Bridgetown, Castro said these organizations  did know about environmental policy and many other fields.    "Perhaps roles will be switched one day; perhaps the NGO's  will organize a world conference, and the presidents will hold  like forums," Castro said to the audience's delight.    At the beginning of the dialogue, Caribbean NGO Coordinator  Joan French cited the support for Cuba during the recently  concluded forum these organizations held.    On that occasion, they issued a resolution to defend the  Cuban people's right to choose their own development model and  to condemn the U.S. Government for the economic and financial  blockade against the island.    Castro appreciated the expressions of support and solidarity  and said "we need to change the negative atmosphere the United  States has created around us with the blockade, which is causing  us serious supply problems in the areas of food, medicine, and  many other products that are fundamental for our development."  In this regard, he said, your support fills us with enthusiasm  because we not only need physical strength, but also moral  strength.    "Many people have approached us to tell us marvelous things  about the Cuban revolution, Che Guevara, things that demonstrate  a spirit of justice, freedom, and dignity that are present in  many delegations to this island conference."    Castro drew a great round of applause when he said: "I feel  as if I am among friends, among brothers. That is why I will be  leaving this country and conference with great joy."    During the discussion of another topic of the informal  meeting, the Cuban leader joked about speculations regarding his  health, speculations that appeared today in the local media and  which journalists from a Miami television station who traveled  to Bridgetown last night insisted on asking him.    "They are constantly asking me about my health, if I sat  down  before or after the speech delivered during the plenary session.  Actually, I can no longer do the things I did during the days of  Sierra Maestra, but I still walk around much and swim for  several hours," Castro said.    In his final statements, the Cuban head of state talked  about  the importance of the meeting to draft an action strategy to  allow for the defense of the islands from the serious problems  threatening them, such as pollution, radioactive wastes, and  climate changes.    Castro will meet with the 15 other heads of state present  here at a round table behind closed doors this afternoon to  discuss the latest version of the Barbados Declaration and the  action program that will be the basis of this world conference.    The meeting began in the capital of Barbados on 25 April  with  the attendance of delegations from 21 countries, which are  members of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS).</p>

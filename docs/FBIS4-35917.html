			<p>BFN     [Text] Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman asserted  today that the recent escalation of Israeli aggressions on  Lebanon is part of Israel's policy of organized state terrorism  against Lebanon's sovereignty.    In an statement to Radio Monte Carlo, Dr. Salman said the  timing of these aggressions is part of Israel's continued  attempts to undermine the peace process and obstruct U.S.  efforts that aim at ending the stalemate in the peace talks,  which were launched in accordance with the Madrid frame of  reference. He noted that the cause of the stalemate is Israel's  hard-line approach that rejects full withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories in return for full peace.</p>

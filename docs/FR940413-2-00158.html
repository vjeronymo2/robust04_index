			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission believes that the proposal's provisions are sufficiently specific to permit compliance with its terms. The Commission also understands that industry efforts are currently underway to draft proposed guidelines to assist dealer compliance with the proposal. In addition, the MSRB will provide continued interpretive guidance to assist dealer compliance with the proposal. The Commission, in accordance with its statutory mandate, will continue to monitor the implementation of the proposal and the effects the proposal may have on the market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> I. Amendment No. 1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission finds good cause for approving the MSRB's Amendment No. 1, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the amendment. As originally submitted, the proposal's prohibitions on municipal securities business would arise from contributions made on or after April 1, 1994. The MSRB filed the amendment to change the April 1, 1994 date to a date 10 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the order approving the proposal. The MSRB also amended the proposal to change the effective date of the proposal's disclosure and recordkeeping requirements to a date 10 days after publication of the approval order in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Thus the proposal's prohibitions will arise from contributions made on or after April 25, 1994. The proposal's disclosure and recordkeeping requirements also will not be effective until April 25, 1994. The Commission believes that the amendments will facilitate compliance by municipal securities dealers. The amendments, in conjunction with the proposal's notice and comment period, will provide municipal securities dealers sufficient time to adopt and implement procedures to comply with the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI.

Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the MSRB and, in particular, section 15B(b)(2)(C). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is therefore ordered, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change and Amendment No. 1 described above be, and hereby are, approved, and shall be effective April 25, 1994. <FOOTCITE>99</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 99 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission simultaneously issued an order relating to this matter, ``Order Preliminarily Declining to Issue Stay Sua Sponte and Establishing Guidelines for Consideration of Stay Applications.''

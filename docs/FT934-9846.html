			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Technology: Rising up from Dresden's rubble - German engineers are rebuilding a 250-year-old church destroyed by allied bombing Hans-Joachim Jager leads the way through the piles of sandstone rubble wedged between the remains of the wall anchor which once supported the high altar of Dresden's Frauenkirche and a solitary column. 'I promise you, we will rebuild the Frauenkirche,' he says determinedly. Jager, an engineer from the east German state of Saxony - the capital of which is Dresden - heads the team charged with restoring the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) to its former glory. Construction took 21 years and was completed in 1743. Allied bombing destroyed it on February 13, 1945. That night, the inner city of Dresden was destroyed. Yet the Frauenkirche, designed by George Bahr, survived the impact of the bombs. It was only when fire engulfed its interior, causing the steel supports in the construction to expand and the stone surfaces of the columns to chip that the 97m-high edifice caved in. The former East German communist regime decided not to restore the Protestant church or remove the remaining rubble, to symbolise the futility of war. But after unification, the people of Dresden decided to rebuild the baroque church. 'It symbolises a new beginning,' says Jager. The task of rebuilding the Frauenkirche appears immense. Jager and his 80 engineers and construction workers intend to rebuild the eight columns in the interior and the remaining 16 columns flanking the aisles and sides of the church. The columns were structurally connected to the walls of the portals and corner towers by wrought-iron anchors. Bahr, who left copious notes on the construction and design of the church, wanted to distribute the load across the 24 columns, with the four corner towers absorbing the weight from the dome. The dome, carved in sandstone and weighing 12,200 tonnes, was Bahr's crowning engineering and architectural feat. With the dome in place, Bahr wrote that the church would have the effect of 'a single stone right from the bottom to the top', like the structure of a pyramid. The weight of the stone dome had caused problems. When the cupola had been first mounted, cracks appeared in the masonry of the supporting structure and modifications were made. Further efforts to strengthen the columns and stone work were carried out in the inter-war period when damp and cracks were discovered. Between 1939 and 1942, significant reconstruction work was undertaken to reinforce the columns with flat rolled steel hoops. Jager betrays no anxiety about the challenge of hoisting the dome on to the reconstructed pillars. He says the church will be stronger and more stable than the original, thanks to modern technology. Reinforced steel girders, stronger than the wrought-iron anchors, will support the dome. The reconstruction of the church will be carried out in phases. Initially, all archive material on the original design and construction of the Frauenkirche is being gathered. 'We have many of the original plans and designs, as well as numerous photos,' says Eberhard Burger, director of the site. Once this material has been collected, the team will move to the second phase which involves removing 21,200sq m of rubble spread over 3,220sq m. This will take several months. Jager reckons about a third of the rubble (about 210,000 pieces) can still be used. The rest is too badly burned or reduced to small stones or dust. As each stone is removed, it is measured, numbered, described and its location recorded. The information is then fed into a computer. 'Slowly, we build up a picture of what stone fits where,' explains Burger. One of the many computer print-outs depicts how a column will be partly reconstructed with the stones pulled out of the rubble. Any missing stones can be replaced by local sandstone quarries. Many stones, however, are chipped, if not badly damaged by the fire. Again, Jager says this problem can be overcome. 'There is a great craft tradition in Germany. Indeed, I believe the craftsmanship tradition has survived longer in eastern Germany because we did not have access to modern technology.' He and Burger have been involved in restoring churches in Saxony since the early 1980s. Both engineers say they will not restore any blackened stone to its former light colour. 'These burnt scars will serve as a memory,' says Burger. Some of the stones and beautiful ornate work on the Corinthian columns and vases which served as stabilisers and decoration are repaired on site or in workshops throughout Saxony. The craftsmen rely on photographs and designs of the Baroque period on which the Frauenkirche was modelled. They also rely on extensive diagrams from the inter-war years, when repairs were undertaken. Jager points to some finished sandstone vases. 'Depending on the complex nature of the restoration, we can complete some of these repairs within two days.' Once the rubble has been cleared and catalogued, the team will know what is missing and the extent of the damage. The engineers will have a clear idea about the technological problems involved in rebuilding the structure. 'The aim is to secure as much original material as possible so that we can reconstruct nearly an exact replica,' says Burger. The team will then start rebuilding, financed, he hopes, by a worldwide fund-raising campaign to collect DM300m (Pounds 122m). Jager says work should be completed by 2002, four years ahead of Dresden's 800th anniversary. But there are still decisions to be made, particularly for the interior. The organ, played by JS Bach when it was installed in 1736, cannot be replaced. The planners think they will reduce seating accommodation from 2,500 places (in addition to 2,000 for standing) to about 2,000. They dismiss any idea it will be difficult to fill the seats given the fall in attendances. 'The people of Dresden will come,' says Jager. 'That is the least of our problems.'</p>

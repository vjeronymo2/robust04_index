			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Technology: Tractor takes on a heavier load Battered by the vagaries of the weather and the Common Agricultural Policy, Europe's farmers are demanding ever-increasing efficiency and productivity from their tractors. That means larger, heavier implements at both ends, and hence heavier engine blocks and transmission cases to carry the load. But, with the conventional block design of a tractor, this leads to a disproportionate increase in the overall weight, raising energy consumption and soil compaction. Deere, the big US tractor group, is now tackling the problem with its new 6000 and 7000 Series tractors, which incorporate an independent steel frame that forms the tractor's structural backbone. The full-frame design is intended to give better weight distribution, improving the performance and making it easier to fit front-mounted implements. John Deere: UK, 0949 60491.</p>

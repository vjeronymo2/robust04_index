			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the late 1980's, various EPA officials began taking the position that Section 3001(i) could be interpreted to exempt ash from Subtitle C. They also expressed the opinion that ash could be managed safely in nonhazardous waste disposal facilities. The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed citizen suits in two separate U.S. District Courts to enforce the 1985 interpretation of the statute against two specific waste-to-energy facilities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EDF  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Chicago,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 727 F. Supp. 419 (N.D. Ill. 1989);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EDF  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wheelabrator Technologies, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 725 F. Supp. 758 (S.D.N.Y. 1989). Both courts held that Section 3001(i) exempted ash. On appeal, the Second Circuit ruled in favor of the exemption, but the Seventh Circuit reversed, finding that the statute did not exempt ash.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EDF  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Chicago,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 948 F.2d 345 (7th Cir. 1991);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EDF  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wheelabrator Technologies, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 931 F.2d 211 (2d Cir. 1991), cert. denied 112 S.Ct. 453 (1991). The City of Chicago, which operated the facility adversely affected by the 7th Circuit's decision, appealed to the Supreme Court. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also in the late 1980's, Congress considered a number of bills that would have explicitly exempted ash from Subtitle C requirements. In November 1990, Congress enacted an uncodified amendment to the Clean Air Act prohibiting EPA from regulating ash as a hazardous waste under Section 3001 of RCRA for a period of two years. Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub.L. No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to these events, a number of states authorized to implement Subtitle C programs in lieu of EPA began treating ash from waste-to-energy facilities as exempt. Some interpreted their own regulations virtually identical to Section 3001(i). Others promulgated specific ash exemptions. Many of these specific exemptions were accompanied by detailed regulations for the management of ash as a nonhazardous waste. Consistent with the evolving federal position on the regulation of ash, EPA took no action affecting these state programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in September 1992, just before the expiration of the Clean Air Act ash ``moratorium,'' EPA Administrator William Reilly signed a memorandum announcing that the Agency now interpreted Section 3001(i) to exempt ash from waste-to-energy facilities burning household wastes and nonhazardous wastes from Subtitle C requirements. This memorandum also announced that EPA believed that ash could be disposed of safely in landfills meeting new standards for municipal solid waste facilities promulgated in 1991 and codified at 40 CFR part 258. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Findings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA finds that the events above have created substantial confusion about the status of ash under the rule EPA wrote to codify the exemption in Section 3001(i). Although EPA's 1980 and 1985 preambles indicated that there was no exemption for ash from combined sources, later events suggested that ash was not regulated. Persons may have relied on the two District Court decisions, the 1990 ash moratorium, or the 1992 Reilly memorandum to conclude that Section 3001(i) and 40 CFR 261.4(b)(2) were ambiguous about the status of ash from combined sources. They could quite reasonably have concluded that they could manage ash from combined sources without obtaining hazardous waste permits. If EPA did not act to extend the Part A deadline, however, these facilities would be unable to obtain interim status because the Court's action is not a statutory or regulatory change establishing a new period for obtaining interim status under RCRA section 3005(e). Such facilities would have to cease handling hazardous ash until EPA took final action on their completed permit applications_a process that typically takes several years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 270.10(e)(2) was written to prevent such harsh results. EPA is today invoking its authority to provide a reasonable opportunity for persons managing combined ash to satisfy RCRA's permitting requirements. Applying the substantial confusion approach to facilities managing this ash is consistent with previous precedents. See, e.g., 52 FR 34779&hyph;81 (Sept. 15, 1987) (notice of substantial confusion for big city cement kilns). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Persons handling ash from the combustion of 100% household waste could have relied with even greater justification on the Agency's 1980 interpretation of the household waste exemption to handle such waste without a hazardous waste permit. They are also entitled to an opportunity to satisfy the permit requirement. Since they are becoming subject to Subtitle C without the enactment of a statute or the promulgation of a rule, they do not technically qualify for the normal 6 months provided for persons newly subject to Subtitle C regulation. See section 40 CFR 270.10(e)(1). Section 270.10(e)(1)(ii), which provides 30 days for filing a Part A after a facility ``first becomes subject to the [Subtitle C] standards'' could apply to these facilities. EPA, however, interprets this provision to apply to facilities whose own actions subject them to Subtitle C rather than to facilities affected by regulatory events. (An example would be a generator that exceeded the small quantity generator monthly waste generation limit.) See generally 45 FR 76630, 76633 (November 19, 1980). Consequently, EPA believes the ``substantial confusion'' approach is also appropriate for persons who manage 100% household waste. Moreover, it reduces confusion by establishing a single deadline for both types of ash from waste-to-energy facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, EPA today establishes that facilities that are handling hazardous ash from waste-to-energy facilities that wish to continue to do so may file Part A applications anytime before December 7, 1994. See the discussion of state authorization below for guidance on where to request and submit an application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

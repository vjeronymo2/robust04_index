			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> YOSEMITE;  </P> <P> WORKERS DISMANTLE HALF DOME STAIRWAY  </P> <P> Workers at Yosemite National Park will climb high above the floor of Yosemite  Valley to dismantle a ladder-like system of cables used as a stairway to the  summit of Half Dome, one of the world's most recognizable rock formations. The  two shoulder-high cables stretch straight up a cliff near the top of the  8,842-foot granite dome. The cables are dismantled every fall because it is too  dangerous for inexperienced hikers to visit the summit during winter.  </P></p>

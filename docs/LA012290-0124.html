			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> STAKES RACE FEB. 3 WILL BE SHOEMAKER'S FINAL RIDE  </P> <P> Santa Anita officials have scheduled a special $100,000 stakes race on Feb. 3  for Bill Shoemaker's final ride.  </P> <P> The track announced Sunday that the race, called "The Legend's Last Ride," will  be one mile on the turf for 4-year-olds and up. Shoemaker, 58, has won 8,833  races in a career covering six decades.  </P> <P> Shoemaker and his agent will choose his mount.  </P> <P> Racing Secretary Tom Robbins talked to trainers before determining that the  mile on grass for older horses was the most likely category available to form a  full field.  </P> <P> Nominations close Jan. 26 with weights to be assigned on Jan. 30. The race,  with pari-mutuel betting, will be run as the fifth race on the program. The  regular feature that day is the $200,000 La Canada Stakes for 4-year-old  fillies.  </P> <P> Shoemaker's final appearance required orchestration by track officials because  the farewell date was selected in advance in order to be televised by ABC.  </P> <P> In 1966, former champion Johnny Longden rode his final race with a victory on  6-1 shot George Royal in the San Juan Capistrano Handicap, an annual Santa  Anita feature.  </P> <P> When Shoemaker bids farewell, the conditions for his only race of the afternoon  will carry an unusual contingency clause.  </P> <P> "This race will be Bill Shoemaker's final ride," the nomination blank reads.  "In the event that his mount is withdrawn prior to the running of the race, any  one of the remaining entrants' jockeys will be subject to replacement by Bill  Shoemaker. The undersigned agrees to the aforementioned conditions that the  undersigned's horse may be ridden by Bill Shoemaker."  </P> <P> The contingency of a backup mount extends up to the start of the race, Robbins  said. Shoemaker will be on his first choice at entry time but also will  indicate his second and third choices, which will be made known to the public  at that time.  </P> <P> There were no such special conditions for Longden when George Royal provided  his last ride and last winner. Longden made the decision to quit riding earlier  that week but didn't announce his retirement until after he won with George  Royal.  </P> <P> Longden's final race was voted by the media as the most memorable event in the  track's history.  </P> <P> Shoemaker has been on a farewell tour that has taken him to three continents  and 49 tracks. On Saturday, Shoemaker won the $50,000 Hallandale Handicap at  Gulfstream Park, his final race on the East Coast.  </P></p>

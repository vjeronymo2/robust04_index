			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Chunky Monkey invasion - A look at the speedy arrival of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream in Britain Only four months after its launch in Selfridges, a top London store, Ben &amp; Jerry's, the popular US ice cream, seems well on the way to becoming the 'other' premium brand in the UK. Since May, flavours such as Chunky Monkey, New York Super Fudge Chunk and Rainforest Crunch have leapt into more than 300 independent speciality food shops, convenience stores and news agents within the greater London area and more than 60 J Sainsbury supermarkets around the country. The company's socially-conscious, wacky image, combined with its recent decision to compromise its idealistic pay policy as it searches for a new chief executive, has propelled Ben &amp; Jerry's into the limelight during one of the hottest UK summers on record. But the company's quick success in penetrating the premium, or adult, ice cream market has come largely at the instigation of Britain's Loseley Ice Cream, currently the second largest brand in the sector after Haagen-Dazs, though with a declining share. Loseley is the sole importer and main distributor for Ben &amp; Jerry's in the UK. Through its established relationships with specialist food shops in London and the south-east, plus department stores and supermarket chains, Loseley has been able to help Ben &amp; Jerry's break into the Pounds 113m premium market. The decision to act as distributor for a product which at first glance appears to be a direct competitor may seem foolhardy. But Tudor Dairies, a non-dairy ice cream manufacturer which acquired Loseley in January, believes that Ben &amp; Jerry's complements, rather than competes with, the Loseley brand. Where Loseley produces quintessentially English, fruit-based flavours, Ben &amp; Jerry's concentrates on chunks, preferably chocolate. 'As far as I am concerned, the only way I get into fruit is if you mix it with some chocolate,' says Ben Cohen, co-founder and chairman. Loseley's ready-made distribution network gave Ben &amp; Jerry's a leg up on Haagen-Dazs, which built its retail relationships from scratch when it entered the UK in 1989. 'In order to come in as Haagen-Dazs did five years ago would have cost a fortune and taken a considerable amount of time,' says David Rapkins, managing director of Loseley Ice Cream. 'We could offer immediate access.' For Loseley, selling Ben &amp; Jerry's is the best way to become an important player in the premium ice cream market. 'This is part of our strategy to become a specialist ice cream distributor as much as a manufacturer,' says Rapkins, a member of the original management buy-out team which bought Tudor Dairies in 1990. 'Whilst there was a lot of potential for the Loseley brand, we thought we needed to compete directly with Haagen-Dazs by developing the American end of the market, and we knew Ben &amp; Jerry's was its closest competitor in the US.' For Ben &amp; Jerry's, 'it is not possible for us, being based in the US, to physically get the ice cream direct to grocers, so we need to work through a distributor,' says Cohen. Selfridge's negotiated an exclusive launch deal for the month of April but Loseley took over as the roll-out continued through independents, convenience store chains and Sainsbury's, which is currently the only supermarket chain to carry Ben &amp; Jerry's. Loseley has contracted out the distribution of the ice cream to convenience stores such as Europa, Cullens and 7-Eleven to Regale Foods, a Kent-based food distribution company. But Loseley's six-person sales team has made all the deals with independently owned shops. Haagen-Dazs leads the UK premium sector with more than 30 per cent of the market, with Loseley coming in second at around 9 per cent. Loseley believes that Ben &amp; Jerry's will hit sales in excess of Pounds 3m and, having expanded to the Midlands in the next few months, command around 4 per cent of the UK market by the end of the year. Nicola Chilton, marketing manager for the UK and Scandinavia at Haagen-Dazs, says it is much too soon to assess the Ben &amp; Jerry's effect. 'We are having one of our best summers yet,' she says. In the US, Ben &amp; Jerry's 'caring capitalist' image has helped increase business. The company donates 7.5 per cent of its pre-tax profits to non-profit organisations. It is already transferring that policy to the UK, where Sainsbury's yesterday launched a campaign to donate 10 per cent of the profits from sales of Ben &amp; Jerry's during the next two weeks to the Children's Society. 'The charity element is what has got them a lot of coverage and we are happy to share Ben &amp; Jerry's commitment,' a Sainsbury's spokesman said. 'But I suspect it is not a real motive for buying ice cream. It is just ice cream without the guilty conscience.'</p>

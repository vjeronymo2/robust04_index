			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Zaire has begun looking for a home for deposed Ugandan dictator Idi Amin,  saying his presence could harm relations with neighboring Uganda. "Zaire will  do everything to find a solution to this, to say the least, embarrassing  presence in an attempt to safeguard its good neighborly relations," a Foreign  Ministry statement said. Amin, 61, was deported by Zaire on Thursday, but  returned when Saudi Arabia, where he had lived in exile since his overthrow in  1979, refused to readmit him. Uganda wants to question Amin about thousands of  deaths during his 8-year regime, but Zaire has declined to send him there.  </P></p>

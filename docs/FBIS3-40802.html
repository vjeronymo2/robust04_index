Oman's Deputy Prime Minister for Financial and Economic  Affairs Mr. Qays Bin-'Abd-al-Mun'im al-Zawawi said that the  volume of estimated spending for 1994 was nearly 2.033 billion  Omani rials [RO] (or nearly $5.285 billion) as against almost  RO2.263 billion (about $5.883 billion) last year. This is a  decrease in public spending of RO230 million (about $598  million).    Despite this drop, which the Omani official attributed to  the  delicate and complex economic conditions resulting from the fall  in oil prices, the Omani budget's estimated deficit will  approach RO301 million (or a little closer to $800 million).    The estimated budget deficit is 17.4 percent higher than  total revenues. This, an economic source told AL-HAYAH, "exceeds  the limit set by the current five-year plan (1991-95), which is  that the deficit between total revenues and services may not  exceed 10 percent of total revenues as a maximum."    Estimated revenues for 1994 will amount to about RO1.732  billion (about $4.532 billion), a small increase over 1993's  revenues, which did not exceed $40 million [sic].    The oil sector occupied its traditional place in the  structure of Omani income, with 76 percent of revenues, with all  other non-oil sectors making up the remaining 24 percent.  <H5>  Defense Outlays </H5>   It was striking that despite the sizeable drop in general  expenditures, the defense and national security sector by itself  commanded nearly a third of spending, with 30 percent of  allocations of more than $1.5 billion. AL-HAYAH has learned from  a foreign diplomatic source that, despite economic  rationalization measures, the Omani Government will not cancel  arms deals signed last year with several countries, chiefly the  deal to purchase 36 British Challenger-2 tanks.    Oman had to cancel a deal for the purchase of Tornado planes  after the "mid-1980s crisis," which saw oil prices fall to less  than $10 per barrel.    Also, despite the marked decrease in current and recurring  expenditure for ministries and civil departments, its share  amounted to about 37.6 percent of spending. The goverment's  commitment to the basic provision is guiding these expenditures;  this is the government salary provision, of which the Omani  deputy prime minister said when he announced the budget, "it is  a right possessed by citizens, guaranteed under the law, and  cannot be violated."    The decrease in "investment expenditure" spending was  extended, with 21 percent of total spending, estimated at $1.1  billion, or nearly $700 million dollars less than estimated  investment expenditures in last year's budget.    But Qays al-Zawawi believes that the drop in investments  will  not severely affect the volume of the program authorized in the  five-year plan, especially for priority projects; nor would it  affect the ability of ministries and government offices to start  projects and enter into new commitments and contracts this year.  <H5>  Announcement of Austerity Decision </H5>   Economic sources, however, expressed to AL-HAYAH their fears  that the drop in government spending, especially in its  investments, would lead to a slowdown in economic growth, and a  return to the economic recession, as occurred in the wake of the  1986 oil crisis, from which it took the Omani economy nearly  three years to recover.    The sources alluded, in this regard, to the "indirect  decrease" not shown in the budget numbers, but confirmed by the  first official government confirmation, reflected in the  austerity decisions the government made in 1993 to deal with the  public budget deficit.    Oman's deputy prime minister said in an exclusive AL-HAYAH  interview last October that the government had adopted fiscal  policies that included a cut in senior officials' allocations, a  drop in compensation for work specialties that some groups in  the government receive and in payment of 75 percent of the cost  of employees' annual travel tickets, plus the cancellation of  government rental of expatriate housing, granting [expatriates]  instead a "lower rental allowance."    Economists tell AL-HAYAH that these measures might save the  government more than $100 million, but could lead to a recession  in the country's flourishing contracting and furniture sectors,  which primarily depended upon the government's rental and  furnishing of housing for its expatriate employees.  <H5>  Maintaining Reserves </H5>   Omani officials pointed out what seems to be a major source  of concern to economic authorities here: that the scope of the  deficit could lead to the exhaustion of the state's financial  reserves, the reserves in the reserve fund, to which 15 percent  of all oil revenues are transferred annually.    The huge tremendous excess in real expenditures in 1991 and  1992 on one hand and the nearly one-third drop in oil revenues  in 1993, after the fall in oil prices on the other hand, could  lead to a greater drawing down of the reserve accounts than was  estimated in the five year plan for the first three years of the  current plan (1991-1995).    In the current year, despite the fact that the basic  principle "heeded in the budget was the creation of a balance,  as much as possible, between resources and spending, and  narrowing the gap between them. This would reduce dependence on  drawing down the state's current reserves." More than 70 percent  of the methods of funding and ending the budget deficit (nearly  $575 million) will come from making withdrawals from the state's  reserve accounts."    Economic policies and Omani budget indicators are in line  with the policies and indicators adopted and announced in the  budgets of the other Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and  Kuwait, who reduced their budgets by nearly 10 percent as a  result of the retreat in oil prices and revenues.</p>

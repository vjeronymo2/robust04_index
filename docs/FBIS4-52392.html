			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Japanese and Russian  governors meeting in Tokyo were at odds Tuesday [10 May] on how  to refer in a planned joint statement to a long-standing  territorial dispute over four Russian-held islands off Hokkaido,  Japanese officials said. Tokyo Gov. Shunichi Suzuki said the  Japanese delegation wants to incorporate a paragraph on Japan's  demand for the return of Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the  Habomai group of islets.    However, the Russian delegation refused the request,  pointing  to an estimated 8,000 cases of territorial violations by  Japanese fishing boats near the southern Kurils in 1993 alone.    Both sides will study further the wording of the statement,  Suzuki said.    Twelve governors headed by Moscow Gov. Anatoliy Styazhlov  and  17 governors and vice governors from Japan are discussing  measures to expand bilateral trade and other relations at the  13th conference, which opened earlier in the day and will run  through Thursday next week.    Styazhlov told participants that Russia will have to dispel  fears about political and social instability if it is to  convince hesitant Japanese companies to join in exploiting the  country's rich natural resources.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Amax to omit June dividend AMAX, the integrated US metals and mining company, announced yesterday that it would omit its June quarterly dividend on its common shares. The Amax board voted to omit the payout as a result of the impact which low aluminum prices, and the prices of other metals, have had on corporate earnings. Mr Allen Born, chairman, said that the board acted prudently in order to conserve cash and to improve financial flexibility. Amax in 1992 suffered an operating loss of Dollars 148m, or Dollars 1.71 per share, on sales of Dollars 3.7bn. Mr Born has said that, with metals prices little improved, first quarter results will also prove to be poor.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: REMARRYING? ONLY FOR RIGHT REASONS  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My first wife, a woman I was married to 10 years ago, and I  are thinking of marching down the aisle again. Are we crazy? We've both tried  living with other people -- in and out of marriage -- and it didn't work. We  finally decided there's no one else we like as much as each other. Will we have  a better chance at happiness next time? -- K.F.  </P> <P> DEAR K.F.: It depends upon how honest you've been with each other and with  yourselves about your past mistakes. If you're both the kind of people who can  change and learn from error, if you're flexible enough to be able to try doing  things in a different way, if you're able to take responsibility for your share  of what went wrong in your earlier marriage and if you both have a lot of  common interests and want to get back together again, then I'd say your chances  for success are pretty good.  </P> <P> Unless you take stock of personal inventories or if you're both just bored and  disappointed with your lives at the moment, you will be apt to make the same  mistakes in the future and the same problems will reappear.  </P> <P> Marriage takes hard work. This is especially true of remarriage because there  are bound to be old wounds and old resentments that must be explored in order  to be resolved. Both partners need to be able to forgive and admit guilt.  Before you remarry, make sure you're doing it for the right reasons, not  because of convenience, finances or to please children.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My daughter-in-law and son constantly encourage my little  6-year-old granddaughter to flirt with men who visit. They also think it's  "cute" to parade her around the living room naked after her bath because she's  so pretty. One night they put her up on the piano and posed her nude while  friends and neighbors looked on. Is this healthy? Something in me disapproves.  -- G.W.  </P> <P> DEAR G.W.: There's a rather fine line between enjoying, loving and taking  delight in the innocence and beauty of a child and exploiting that child. I'm  afraid this falls rather heavily in the direction of exploitation. Children are  extremely sensitive and catch on quickly to what will win approval from adults.  I suspect your son and daughter-in-law would be both surprised and disappointed  if this little girl became pregnant or was sexually promiscuous at 13 or 14.  However, they are actually training her to be sexually precocious and to use  her body to tantalize and to manipulate others.  </P> <P> Children need time to be children. Perhaps without knowing it, or even  intending to do so, these parents are turning their daughter into a sexual  object.  </P></p>

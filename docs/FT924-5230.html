			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: National Bank hit by O&amp;Y loan write-downs THE recession and a heavy write-down of loans to the Olympia &amp; York group reduced final-quarter profits at National Bank of Canada. Net income in the quarter was CDollars 39m (USDollars 30.4m), or 23 cents a share, against CDollars 41m, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Return on equity was 9 per cent, against 9.4 per cent, and return on average assets 0.38 per cent against 0.45 per cent. For the year ended October 1992, net income was CDollars 1m, equal to a loss of 29 cents a share after payment of preferred dividends. This compares with net income of CDollars 186m, or CDollars 1.20 a share, in 1990-91. The drop was due to Dollars 570m in loan losses, including a CDollars 350m write-down in loans to O&amp;Y taken in the third quarter.</p>

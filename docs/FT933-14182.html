			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Growing thirst for cider lifts Bulmer to Pounds 19.6m THE CONTINUED growth of cider market in the UK, Australia and Belgium helped HP Bulmer to a 15 per cent increase to Pounds 19.6m in pre-tax profits for the 53 weeks to April 30. The increase from Pounds 17.1m was achieved on sales ahead 13 per cent to Pounds 251.8m (Pounds 221.9m), including Pounds 6.84m from Cidrerie Stassen, the Belgian branded cider maker acquired in September. Sales were underpinned in the UK by volume gains achieved by Bulmer's leading brands, Strongbow, Woodpecker and Scrumpy Jack. Earnings per share improved 15 per cent to 22.89p (19.96p); a proposed final dividend of 6.4p (5.55p) makes a total for the year of 10.15p (9p). The shares gained 13p to close at 419p. Mr John Rudgard, chief executive, said the UK cider market had 'continued to grow in all sectors,' including the private label business for supermarket chains which expanded by 28 per cent last year. In the UK Strongbow continued to dominate the mainstream cider market, capturing 28.3 per cent of the on-trade business and adding 5,400 new taps. Strongbow draught volumes grew by 17 per cent last year while in the premium sector Scrumpy Jack volumes jumped 54 per cent. The Australian operations achieved 10.8 per cent volume growth and a 34 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 2.37m on sales of Pounds 14.4m. In Belgium, Stassen achieved a 30 per cent volume growth in the 8 months to the end of April and contributed Pounds 771,000 to total group operating profits of Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 20.5m). In soft drinks, both Kiri and Orangina achieved volume gains while Volvic, the second largest mineral water brand after Evian, managed to increase volumes by 25 per cent to 34.6m litres. However, the beer portfolio had 'a difficult year' because of depressed demand with sales of Red Stripe down slightly. The pectin operations also suffered from reduced demand and fierce price competition and operating profits fell by 61 per cent to Pounds 972,000 (Pounds 2.5m) on turnover of Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 14.5m). Mr Rudgard said a strategic review of the business was nearing completion. COMMENT Bulmer's great strength is the depth of its brand portfolio across all the market segments built through hefty marketing and solid investment expenditure. The loss next year of the Perrier and Buxton distribution contract - representing 14 per cent of secondary distribution tonnes - should be covered within a year by volume growth in the rest of the product portfolio. UK operating margins, although increasing, are still held back by the lower margin beer and soft drinks operations, but would benefit from the disposal or closure of the pectin business. This year pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 21m, equivalent to earnings of 24.7p and producing a prospective p/e of just under 17. Investors have a choice in how to play the rapidly growing cider market: for certainty, they can chose Bulmer's established depth of brands and management; for a bit of excitement, they can pick up and coming Taunton Cider's ability to capture share with new brands.</p>

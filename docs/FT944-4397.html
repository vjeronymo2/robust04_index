			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hill Hire float delayed again Market conditions forced Hill Hire, the commercial vehicle hire company, to postpone its share placing yesterday for the second successive day. Renegotiation between the vendor, Birkby, and institutions devalued the market capitalisation by an estimated 2 per cent. Birkby, the business property manager, had hoped the float of 60 per cent of its equity in Hill Hire would value the company at more than Pounds 26m. If the placing goes ahead today as planned, it is likely to be valued at about Pounds 25.5m. Hambros, the adviser, was still bullish about the float despite the delay. Mr David Ewart-James, a director, said: 'It's a very difficult market out there, but it shows you can still do good issues in it.' The float follows Birkby's March acquisition of In Shops, the retail space rental business. Hill Hire became a non-core operation. 'With the success we have had we can stand on our own,' said Mr Jeffrey Chapman, Hill Hire chief executive. 'We won't be competing for capital in the group.' Hill Hire operates 2,050 vehicles at seven commercial vehicle rental sites in the M62 corridor, including five under its Ember arm. It aims to open a Manchester branch in April 1995 and is confident of expanding its fleet. Pre-tax profits in the half year to September were Pounds 900,000. Trading in the shares is now expected to begin on December 29.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Dr. Ibrahim Dasuqi Abazah] </F>   [Excerpts] Who owns the radio and television in Egypt? Why  does the government monopolize these media and prevent the  opposition from using them? These media are the property of the  Egyptian people. They established them and are paying for them.  It is the right of all the political and social forces in the  country to use these media to air their programs and expound  their views without any discrimination. How can the government  deprive the opposition of the right to use these media on the  pretext that it possesses newspapers that express its views?    The opposition papers, no matter how great their  capabilities  may be, are only a small fraction of the government-owned press.  If we add to this the fact that the government also owns seven  radio stations and seven television channels that transmit day  and night, we realize the enormous monopoly that the government  has on the media and can discover easily the major things that  are paralyzing political activity in Egypt and are weakening the  parties' ability to appeal to the broad masses of the people.    It is not true that the parties in Egypt are weak. What is  true is that the ruling regime does not want strong parties and  that it is devoting all its efforts to prevent these parties  from reaching the people. The regime achieves this through its  control of the major information media and the minds of millions  through beamed programs and distorted news. We do not need  proof about the extent of the daily propaganda and money used by  the government media. It is sufficient to note that the  Information Ministry's budget is considered the largest in the  Third World. No one has exceeded us in this area except the  regime of Kim Il-song, who spends a quarter of North Korea's  budget on propaganda for itself and the celebration of his  birthday.    We are tired of repeating these facts. There is no other way  but to find the means to enable the political forces to bring  down this media wall and correct the defect that is affecting  the freedom of expression and publication and shrinking the  ability of the opposition to undertake effective political  action.    The first solution is for the government to give up its  monopoly on the media and allocate equal time for all the  political parties to air their programs and views. This is a  basic right demanded by democracy and repeatedly advocated by  the parties, but to no avail. The second solution is for the  government to allow the parties and the political forces to  establish radio and television stations at their expense.  [passage omitted]    If the government rejects the two solutions, the political  opposition will have no alternative but to rent satellite  television channels or transmission hours to air their programs,  even if they have to transmit from outside the country. There  are no technological barriers to prevent this. [passage omitted]</p>

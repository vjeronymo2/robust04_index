			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Technology: A new image for data storage - Worth Watching Holograms stored on photorefractive films of polymer could replace hard disc drives as a means of storing computer data within the next decade. So believe researchers at IBM's Almaden Research Centre in San Jose, California, where a polymer film has been developed on to which holograms can be recorded and then erased - a feat previously only possible using expensive crystalline material. The holograms are made by exposing an image on to the film using intersecting laser beams: no subsequent development process is needed. Because the recording material is thicker than the light wavelength, several holograms can be stored in the same spot, so that several billion bits of information could be stored in the area of a 10 pence coin.

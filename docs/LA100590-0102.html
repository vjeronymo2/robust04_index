			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 28 HOSPITALS SERVING THE POOR ASK TO RENEGOTIATE CONTRACTS  </P> <P> Because of major cuts in government funding, all 28 hospitals that take care of  the county's indigent have notified county officials that they want to  renegotiate their contracts, which means many of them may stop providing  indigent care.  </P> <P> The notification is the latest move in the escalating problem of providing  health care to the poor in Orange County.  </P> <P> In August, despite impassioned pleas from doctors, the County Board of  Supervisors cut the 1990-91 budget of the Indigent Medical Services program by  about 55%, an amount expected to reach $13.6 million.  </P> <P> This week, the chief negotiator for the 28 hospitals mailed letters to Tom  Uram, director of the County Health Care Agency, and Supervisor Don R. Roth,  chairman of the board, saying that the county now has 60 days to negotiate a  new contract with each hospital.  </P> <P> The hospitals in the Indigent Medical Services program provide health care to  24,000 "working poor" who do not qualify for Medi-Cal.  </P> <P> Uram and Roth were unavailable for comment Thursday.  </P> <P> David Langness, vice president of the Hospital Council of Southern California,  said Thursday that if the county doesn't offer more money, the hospitals must  either absorb major financial losses, cut back services or drop out of the  indigent-care system.  </P> <P> "We believe by the end of the 60-day period, at least several of the hospitals  will drop out," he said.  </P> <P> The county's payments to the hospitals dropped by 45% in August and September.  Under the terms of the existing contract, whenever the payments drop by more  than 5%, the hospitals can force the county to renegotiate.  </P> <P> The reduced payments to the hospitals were the result of a state budget cut for  which the county supervisors refused to compensate with extra local funding.  The supervisors said they had too little money to go around, forcing them to  say no to the health-care providers. The total county budget is $3.39 billion,  a $320-million increase from last year.  </P> <P> "The problem is Orange County has never really funded health care," Langness  said. "The county doesn't put any of its own money into it."  </P> <P> Russ Inglish, Orange County vice president of the hospital council, said that  the number of hospitals that drop out of the indigent-care system will depend  on what new payments or conditions the county health agency offers over the  next 60 days.  </P> <P> "This has the potential for having a major effect on the indigent public," he  said.  </P> <P> If hospitals drop out, the indigent would face longer lines at clinics and  fewer services. Doctors worry that it could cause an increase in infectious  diseases such as measles.  </P> <P> Also, some hospitals may close their emergency rooms, an impact that would be  felt by all residents, not just the poor, Inglish said.  </P> <P> Officials at UCI Medical Center in Orange, which provided care to 10,000  indigent people last year, estimate that the hospital could lose $4 million in  the next year as a result of the budget cuts.  </P></p>

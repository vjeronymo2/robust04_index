			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibeth Vega] </F>   [Text] The National Assembly's Narcotics Commission  yesterday approved a draft law establishing stiffer penalties  for drug-related crimes and updating the type of activities  considered to be money laundering.    The Commission unanimously approved the draft and passed it  on to the Assembly plenum for its second debate as an emergency  bill.    The bill defines the strategy for fighting the production,  consumption, and trafficking of drugs, money laundering,  possession of goods and assets obtained from drug trafficking,  and related crimes.    The document is a combination of proposals presented by  Legislator Leo Gonzalez and Acting Attorney General Jorge Ramon  Valdes. It also includes recommendations made by the UN  International Narcotics Convention held in 1988 in Vienna.    The draft improves the current description and adds several  types of criminal activities to the list, including covert  operations and controlled deliveries.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCGRATH LEVELS ATTACK OVER YAROSLAVSKY FUNDS  </P> <P> Assuming the role of political provocateur in the Los Angeles City Council's  sluggish 5th District race, Jack McGrath accused Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky of  violating campaign finance laws and dodging debates at a freewheeling press  conference Thursday in front of Yaroslavsky's City Hall office.  </P> <P> McGrath, a former Yaroslavsky campaign manager and aide, said the councilman  has failed to return $1.8 million collected when he considered running for  mayor. McGrath also said Yaroslavsky has yet to repay a $100,000 loan he  received when he was promoting Proposition O, the successful citywide ballot  measure that outlawed oil drilling in Pacific Palisades.  </P> <P> "Zev has serious financial problems," McGrath said. "Have any of these checks  been returned? . . . I think that Zev is in deep doo doo."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky's office immediately rebutted McGrath's charges. Campaign manager  Karin Caves said McGrath is "absolutely off the wall." She said Yaroslavsky has  already started returning his mayoral campaign money.  </P> <P> "More than 4,000 checks have to be hand written," Caves said. "That's  unprecedented. No one has had to do that before. Everyone has been working on  it. We've been working on it for a week, and we're moving as fast as we can."  </P> <P> Ironically, McGrath was one of Yaroslavsky's 4,000 contributors. He has asked  that his $500 be forwarded to the Salvation Army, Caves said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Loan Outstanding  </P> <P> On the matter of Yaroslavsky's $100,000 loan, Caves said the money came from  Bill Haber, an entertainment agent who is a longtime supporter.  </P> <P> Caves confirmed that the loan is still outstanding. She said Yaroslavsky  intends to repay it out of his "Friends of Yaroslavsky" campaign treasury.  Caves would not say how much money Yaroslavsky has on hand, not counting the  funds raised for his mayoral bid, but she denied he is in financial trouble.  </P> <P> McGrath, however, said Yaroslavsky needs to be more forthcoming with the  voters. He said thecouncilman has ignored invitations to a series of forums.  </P> <P> "Mr. Yaroslavsky has got to come out of the Rose Garden," McGrath said. "Zev  has got to come and meet his maker."  </P> <P> McGrath, who ran Yaroslavsky's first campaign, said he was referring to himself  as Yaroslavsky's maker. "I made him in 1975," McGrath said. "And I want to tell  Zev that it's time for him to return to the private sector."  </P> <P> Once again, however, Caves said McGrath was playing fast and loose with the  facts. She said Yaroslavsky has agreed to debate his four opponents whenever he  can make the time. "We have priorities, but we do expect to engage in debates  whenever Zev's schedule permits it," Caves said.  </P> <P> McGrath, 43, a late entry in the 5th District council race, is seen as a long  shot. Yaroslavsky's other opponents include Westwood activist Laura M. Lake,  traffic consultant Ryan Snyder and artist Henry Hill.  </P> <P> At his Thursday press conference, McGrath said he has raised about $7,000 so  far, most of which has gone to pay for a political advertisement on cable  television. The North Hollywood resident, who is on leave from his real estate  job during the campaign, said he expects to run a grass-roots campaign.  </P> <P> McGrath said the 5th District has gone to seed under Yaroslavsky. He pledged to  slow commercial growth and generally improve the quality of life for 5th  District residents who are burdened by heavy traffic congestion and commercial  development. McGrath said he would limit himself to two terms.  </P> <P> "My message is obvious," McGrath said. "It's time for a change."  </P></p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Shell However lawyers and accountants try to inflate the importance of compliance bureaucracy, the security of dealing rooms will always be dependent on the honesty of the people who work there. A sufficiently determined individual can subvert almost any system. So it is hard to go along with the standard denunciation of Shell's Japanese debacle. It is more interesting to trace the reasons for the failure. Shell has a decentralised management structure which, while much admired, may well have contributed to the problem. It also has only a 50 per cent stake in Showa Shell Sekiyu - limiting its control. Japanese political sensitivities may have meant that the refiner was run even more at arm's length than usual with such ventures. The large volumes of low margin transactions which such refining and marketing operations handle as a matter of course may also have made it easier to hide the unauthorised deals. Even so, the scale of the operation is breathtaking, and it is no tribute to Japanese accounting standards that the irregularities seem to have gone undetected for several years. Shell may now correct specific errors and take a firmer grip on its subsidiaries. Yet the episode only highlights the increasing dependence of large oil companies on sophisticated treasury operations. Even when the trading is authorised, it carries risks which few investors bother to contemplate. Fortunately in this case the company can afford the hit.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Leading Article: Europe needs free trade YESTERDAY'S report on Euro-pean Community trade policy by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is refreshingly robust. Though few will be surprised by the thrust of the report's criticisms of the EC, it can only be healthy for the trading system that they should be brought into the open. On the positive side, the Gatt is right to point out that the EC has so far resisted the temptation to build a trade fortress round its single market. Tariffs are relatively low in the Community and third countries are able to share, through trade, in the benefits created by its internal liberalisation. Yet the Gatt's misgivings about EC trade policy are also valid. They deserve to be taken all the more seriously given the fragility of the trading system following last year's failure to complete the Uruguay Round on time, to which the EC contributed so much. The EC does, as the Gatt complains, suffer from a tendency to respond to particular trade problems with targeted bilateral solutions - abuse of its anti-dumping rules, for example, or recourse to voluntary restraint arrangements. It does also operate a complex web of discriminatory preferential arrangements with the European Free Trade Association, Mediterranean countries and developing nations. The EC's reply that it is still a large importer, even of the most heavily restricted products such as farm goods, textiles, steel and cars is lame. Nor is it any excuse to defend one's own barriers on the grounds that others have restrictions too. The true message underlying the report is that there is a culture of protectionism at work in the EC. Whatever the record on Fortress Europe until now, there is a danger that this culture will come to dominate as the Uruguay Round grows more difficult. Increased protection Already, there are unpleasant signs of protection gaining ground. After a period of apparent restraint, the Commission's traditional sleight of hand is reappearing in calculating dumping margins on video cassettes and tapes. The number of dumping cases in the pipeline has swollen, while the granting of such procedural forms of protection remains too obscure in both its underlying rationale and its results. To its shame the EC has also baulked at opening up its borders to farm products, textiles and steel from the emerging market economies of eastern Europe. There could scarcely be a better way of undermining the political reforms so earnestly sought by the west for more than four decades. Higher stakes When its country reviews were launched two years ago, the Gatt trumpeted them as means of exerting pressure against the worst protectionist tendencies of its members. Until now the Gatt's timidity has made the weapon largely ineffective. Its suddenly more outspoken style reflects a world where the stakes have grown immeasurably higher. The hopes in Brussels and other European capitals that the Uruguay Round can be wrapped up this year are still just hopes. There is as yet no sign of the necessary breakthrough on farm subsidies, something that only the EC can provide. The worst the EC could do would be to add a willingness to cave in to its other protectionist lobbies to its failure to come up with a satisfactory offer on farming. This would produce the kind of vicious cycle of action and retaliation that the Uruguay Round was supposed to prevent, rendering the chance of completing the talks ever more remote. There is a striking contrast between the push for internal liberalisation of Europe's markets and the way its industries prefer to cling to external barriers. The external walls must be broken down too to secure the full benefit of the single market. Europe must stop looking to the practices of others as justification for its own shortcomings and start to fight the rot from within. It can start by improving its farm offer in the Gatt, by eliminating barriers to imports from eastern Europe and by increasing its determination to resist the cries of its protectionist lobbies.</p>

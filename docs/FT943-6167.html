			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / A prize for paring: Pentagon policy is encouraging companies to restructure One of the first questions facing the bosses of the defence giant created yesterday will be how much money they can reasonably demand from the Pentagon as 'reward' for their contribution to streamlining the industry. For the past year the Pentagon has followed a controversial policy of subsidising restructuring moves in the overcrowded defence sector by passing back to industry a share of the benefits that accrue to the public purse. At least in theory, one the first beneficiaries of the industry's efforts to cut costs should be the Pentagon and hence taxpayers. The Pentagon has acknowledged this by being prepared to pass back to the companies involved a part of the benefit it receives when arms makers are able to quote lower prices for their products as a result of streamlining. The onus is on the companies to provide the Pentagon with detailed evidence that they can deliver particular weapons more cheaply as a result of reduced overheads. But when mergers or acquisitions are planned, the chances of a reward have become an important part of the financial calculations. Mr Norman Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta, has been one of the most prominent advocates - and beneficiaries - of the Pentagon's policy, whose architect is Mr John Deutch, the deputy secretary for defence. The policy has its critics on the political right - which views it as interference with the market - and on the left, which accuses the administration of encouraging big lay-offs. Mr Larry Korb, a former Pentagon official who now works for the Brookings Institution think-tank, is one of the harshest right-wing critics of the policy. He believes that on the basis of past 'rewards', the giant corporation created yesterday could ask the Pentagon for about Dollars 1bn in help with restructuring costs. Other experts are expecting a much lower figure. Mr Korb maintains that the Pentagon should respond sceptically, and is dismissive of arguments from Mr Deutch that the policy promotes rational streamlining. 'Who is to determine what's rational other than markets?' he asks. However there are some observers who see the Pentagon's policy as the only alternative to a disastrous free-fall in the sector. 'You either have managed downsizing this way or you have unmanaged downsizing, which is essentially companies going out of business,' says Mr Richard Bitzinger of the Defense Budget Project, a Washington research group. However, the fact the Pentagon is prepared to encourage mergers does not mean that it has abandoned all concerns about anti-trust issues. There was disappointment in the US defence industry last spring, when the Pentagon, in a review of anti-trust procedures, pointedly avoided calling for any special treatment for the sector. Anti-trust enforcement officials at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have traditionally been reluctant to treat defence companies any differently from civilian manufacturers. They have successfully challenged mergers such as the proposed acquisition in 1992 of Olin Corp's ammunition division by Alliant Techsystems, on the grounds that the deal would create a monopoly supplier of certain shells and ammunition. But in practice, few defence mergers have been blocked. Some industry experts say the Alliant-Olin link-up was a transparent attempt to merge pre-emptively so that the two companies would not have to bid against each other on a large ammunition contract that was known to be imminent. Anything less blatant than that has generally escaped challenge. 'Defence is special. But we also concluded that it is not so special that current law and guidelines ought not to apply,' said Professor Robert Pitofsky, an anti-trust expert. As a monopsony or single buyer, the Pentagon has the clout to look after its own interests, and its use of subsidies is an example of this. In the case of Lockheed and Martin Marietta, there is, in fact, remarkably little overlap of the kind to raise anti-trust concerns except perhaps in the field of satellites. 'Other than that (satellites), I don't see any difficulties in big (weapons) platforms,' says Mr Erik Pages of Business Executives for National Security, a Washington defence think-tank. The real anti-trust dilemmas for the US defence industry will emerge at a later stage in the down-sizing of the sector, a process which shows no sign of abating.</p>

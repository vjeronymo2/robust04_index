			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THANKSGIVING;  </P> <P> THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO STUFF A TURKEY  </P> <P> Next Thursday, eight out of 10 Americans will sit down to a turkey dinner. To  supply the demand, 45 million birds will meet their maker in the weeks leading  up to Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> Our national bird might well have been the turkey. Benjamin Franklin thought it  "a much more respectable bird, and withall a true original native of America."  The bird was already domesticated when the Spanish reached Mexico in 1518. The  Aztecs ate it with a sauce made from chiles and unsweetened chocolate. (The  preparation survives in the Mexican dish mole poblano.) Europeans, usually  finicky about New World foods, adopted the bird with gusto: A 16th-Century  German cookbook listed 20 turkey recipes.  </P> <P> One of the problems with turkey is that it's a party animal. You need at least  10 people to eat a small one. If you have a smaller group, you might want to  serve a game bird, such as partridge, pheasant and quail. They are loaded with  flavor and perfect for celebrating Thanksgiving when you have only four to six  guests.  </P> <P> Game birds include, in descending order of size, wild turkey, goose, duck,  pheasant, partridge, grouse, squab, dove, thrush (the alouette of the French  children's song) and, the most delicious of them all, woodcock. Game is leaner  than chicken or duck, which makes it a boon with dieters. Prone to drying out,  it does best with a moist cooking method, like stewing or braising. Another way  to keep game birds moist is by wrapping them in bacon or other fat.  </P> <P> Game used to be available only to hunters, but more and more of it can be found  at specialty markets and butcher shops. True wild game has the richer (and in  many cases, muskier) game flavor. The pen-raised birds, on the other hand, are  free of such inconveniences as feathers and wayward buckshot. Game farms have  proliferated around the United States; many sell their wares by mail order.  </P> <P> Looking for something different for this Thanksgiving? Here are some offbeat  ways to prepare turkey and some game bird recipes for serving small crowds.  </P> <P>  In pre-Columbian times, chocolate was consumed as a spice, not a sweet. Its  bitterness goes well with the pungency of chiles. This recipe comes from "The  Complete Book of Mexican Cookery" by Elizabeth Lambert Ortiz (Bantam Books:  1968).  </P> <P> MOLE POBLANO (Turkey With Chile-Chocolate Sauce)  </P> <P> 1 (8-pound) whole turkey  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> 1/4 cup oil or lard  </P> <P> 6 ancho chiles  </P> <P> 4 pasilla chiles  </P> <P> 4 mulato chiles  </P> <P> 2 onions, finely chopped  </P> <P> 4 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 3 sprigs fresh cilantro  </P> <P> 1 tortilla or toast slice, diced  </P> <P> 1 pound (3 medium) tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped  </P> <P> 1 cup blanched almonds, lightly toasted  </P> <P> 1/2 cup raisins  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon anise seeds  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander seeds  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sesame seeds, lightly toasted  </P> <P> 1 1/2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped  </P> <P> Cut turkey into individual serving pieces and place in pan along with salted  water to cover. Simmer 1 hour and drain, reserving 2 cups turkey stock. Blot  turkey pieces dry.  </P> <P> Heat oil in large skillet. Brown turkey pieces, batch at time, on all sides.  Transfer turkey to platter and reserve fat.  </P> <P> Wash chiles. Tear in halves and remove stems, veins and seeds. Soak chiles in  cold water to cover 1 hour and drain. Place chiles, onions, garlic, cilantro,  tortilla, tomatoes, almonds, raisins, anise seeds, cloves, cinnamom, coriander  seeds, black pepper and 2 tablespoons sesame seeds in blender and puree to  smooth paste.  </P> <P> Heat reserved fat in turkey pan. Add pureed chile mixture and cook over medium  heat 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and stir in reserved turkey  broth and chocolate. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Gently simmer 10  minutes. Sauce should be very thick.  </P> <P> Return turkey to sauce and cook over low heat 30 minutes, stirring  occasionally. Correct seasoning. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons sesame seeds  over mole poblano and serve at once. Makes 8 to 10 servings.  </P> <P>  Partridge is the game bird for people who like dark meat. This recipe comes  from the Hermitage Inn in Wilmington, Vt.  </P> <P> ROAST PARTRIDGE WITH DIJON MUSTARD SAUCE  </P> <P> 1 partridge, cut in half  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons butter, melted  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Freshly ground pepper  </P> <P> 1 shallot, minced  </P> <P> 1/2 cup dry white wine  </P> <P> 3/4 cup whipping cream  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard  </P> <P> 2 strips crisply cooked bacon, finely chopped  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon chopped parsley  </P> <P> Brush partridge with 2 tablespoons melted butter and season to taste with salt  and pepper. Roast bird, skin side up, in oiled pan at 500 degrees 10 to 12  minutes, or until cooked to taste.  </P> <P> Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in heavy saucepan. Add shallot and sauce  over medium heat until tender but not brown. Add white wine and boil until  reduced by half. Add whipping cream and cook until reduced by half. Stir in  Dijon mustard, bacon and parsley. Correct seasoning to taste. Pour sauce over  partridge and serve at once. Makes 2 servings.  </P> <P>  "When I devised this stuffing, I thought of all the things a quail would eat  in the fall, or at least the things I wished it would eat," says Greg Parks,  chef of the Four Columns Inn in Newfane, Vt.  </P> <P> ROAST QUAIL WITH WILD RICE STUFFING  </P> <P> 8 quail, preferably fresh  </P> <P> 1 lemon  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Freshly ground pepper  </P> <P> 1/4 cup olive oil  </P> <P> Stuffing  </P> <P> Wash quail inside and out and dry with paper towels. Sprinkle few drops lemon  juice, salt and pepper into cavity of each bird. Set aside.  </P> <P> Fill each quail with Stuffing. Season birds with salt and pepper. Arrange quail  in lightly oiled roasting pan, breast side up. Tie drumsticks of each bird  together and baste skin with olive oil. Roast at 450 degrees about 20 minutes,  or until cooked to taste. To test for doneness, insert slender skewer into  cavity of bird -- it should feel very hot to the touch. (Parks likes to serve  quail slightly pink.) Untie legs and serve quail at once. Makes 8 appetizer  servings or 4 entree servings.  </P> <P> Note: This stuffing would also be good in Cornish game hens or guinea fowl.  </P> <P> Stuffing  </P> <P> 1 cup wild rice  </P> <P> 1/4 cup butter  </P> <P> 1 large onion, finely chopped  </P> <P> 6 shallots, finely chopped  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped  </P> <P> 1 sweet red pepper, finely diced  </P> <P> 1 green pepper, finely diced  </P> <P> 2 stalks celery, finely chopped  </P> <P> 1/4 cup pine nuts  </P> <P> 1 large apple, peeled, cored and chopped  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage or 1 teaspoon dried  </P> <P> 3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Rinse wild rice in strainer with cold water and drain. Place rice in large  saucepan with 8 cups water. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 40 to 50  minutes, or until grains are just tender. Drain rice.  </P> <P> Melt butter in skillet over medium high heat. Add and saute onion, shallots,  garlic, red and green peppers and celery over medium heat 6 to 8 minutes, or  until tender.  </P> <P> Toast pine nuts at 350 degrees 5 minutes, or until lightly browned. Mix  together wild rice, onion mixture, pine nuts, apple, sage and Parmesan cheese.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  </P></p>

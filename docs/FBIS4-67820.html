			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Mirny, Arkhangelsk region April 13 TASS -- The  setting up of a unique system of control for missile flights at  the command post of the range has been copmpleted, ITAR-TASS was  told by General Nikolay Yudin, chief of staff of the state range  of strategic rocket forces in the Arkhangelsk region.    He said the range has become a major scientific center in  Russia. Officers manning the command post are candidates of  technical sciences. A computer system for flight control has  been created at the initiative of one of them,  Lieutenant-Colonel Yashchenko.    From 1992 the range has been serving the task of insurance  and monitoring of the observance of treaty-governed obligations  between Russia and the United States for the exchange of  telemetric information on missile launchings, General Yudin  said. The Russian Strategic Rocket Forces now have at their  disposal a unique and Russia's only experimental base for  testing all kinds of missiles, for processing and analysys of  the information strictly in accordance with the treaty on  strategic offensive arms.    As is known, a large group of journalists arrived at the  secret garrison in Mirny on April 11. The journalists were  given an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the latest  equipment, specifically with the pilot sample of the missile  complex Topol which will be adopted for service in several  years. The arrival of journalists coincided with the  celebration of Cosmonautics Day. It is broadly celebrated in  Mirny as much has been done here for space exploration. ``We  keep no secrets from the Russian and world public, but our  openness does not lower our sense of responsibility for Russia's  security. Russia can be confident on its security,'' General  Yuriy Zhuravlev, chief of the range, told repoters.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / International Company News: TWA reaches agreement with PBGC TRANS World Airlines, the bankrupt carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, has reached agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the US federal agency which guarantees the payment of basic pensions, over the proposed sale of TWA's Travel Channel subsidiary, writes Nikki Tait. The PBGC had argued the subsidiary was 'jointly and severally' liable for TWA's pension underfunding, which it puts at Dollars 933m. It claimed the money should be set aside to meet the pension deficit and should not be swallowed up by TWA's operating losses. Under the deal, the PBGC's position is essentially satisfied. Travel Channel is prohibited from dividending or giving the sale proceeds to TWA and if TWA seeks to borrow the cash, Travel Channel will have a fully-secured position and 'a super priority claim' on behalf of its creditors. Monies involved in the Travel Channel sale are relatively small - although they are material in the context of TWA's distressed financial condition. According to documents filed in the bankruptcy court, TWA had an operating loss of Dollars 37.1m in January and an after-tax loss of Dollars 51.6m. TWA filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on January 31. The PBGC is pursuing claims at Continental Airlines, which has been in bankruptcy since late-1990. The bankrupt airline is seeking to sell Air Micronesia - in which Continental holds a controlling stake - for Dollars 290m. But the PBGC argues that the proceeds should be applied to the underfunded pension plans at Eastern Airlines, now defunct but once the sister carrier to Continental.</p>

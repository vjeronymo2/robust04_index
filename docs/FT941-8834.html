			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Co-operative spirit fades as world bauxite prices languish - Canute James talks to the president of the industry association Producers of bauxite have reacted with disappointment to the US's decision to reduce its strategic stockpile of the aluminium ore, which it has built up since the early 1960s. Mr Nenad Altman, secretary-general of the International Bauxite Association, warns that the move will affect all bauxite producers in an industry already depressed by falling demand because of the weak international aluminium market. 'It is not just the quantity which is being sold, which is about 3m tonnes over two years,' Mr Altman says. 'Producers are also being affected by the price, which is about Dollars 8.50 per tonne. This will push prices further down. It is a small proportion of world production but the psychological impact on the market will be severe.' The waning fortunes of the world's bauxite producers have coincided with some soul-searching among the IBA's members and within the organisation. When the association was created 20 years ago, metals companies were worried that it would attempt to build an industry cartel - some even made highly unrealistic comparisons to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. But the IBA has steered clear of such activity, acting primarily a data bank and forum for its members. In better times the association's members have accounted for about 85 per cent of the western world's bauxite production, while contributing 54 per cent of alumina (aluminium oxide) production and 18 per cent of primary aluminium output. The loss of two founding members - the Dominican Republic and Haiti - in the 1980s, because their industries folded, had no effect on the IBA. But Australia'a decision two years ago not to renew its membership seriously reduced the organisation's weight and influence. Australia is the world's largest bauxite producer. 'Given the state of the market and the problems facing bauxite producers, now is the time they should be getting closer together to defend their common interests,' says a representative of the Jamaican industry. 'But this is not happening. There appears to be less interest now in the IBA, even among some members which have been delinquent in meeting their financial obligations to the organisation.' With members' financial support to the IBA based on volume of production, Australia's departure deprived the association of 40 per cent of its budget. 'This has inevitably affected the association's budget,' says Mr Altman. 'The majority of the member countries are facing financial difficulties, and so we could not operate as before because of a reduced budget.' There seems to be little enthusiasm among the world's major producers to join the IBA. Attempts to recruit Brazil only led to the country adopting observer status. Expansion may have to await to resolution of a political conundrum. The association lists its members as Ghana, Guinea, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Sierra Leone and Surinam, but also Yugoslavia, which no longer exists. 'The IBA is willing to extend membership to all parts of the previous Yugoslavia if they wish to continue,' says the secretary-general. 'There is bauxite in Bosnia, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia, but the major producer is Bosnia.' Contributing to the IBA's relatively low profile has been its inability to negotiate a commodity pact between bauxite producers and consumers under the aegis of the United Nations Committee on Trade and Development. The attempt was abandoned because of lack of support from either side, and because bauxite could not be organised in pacts similar to those for other commodities such as cocoa and coffee, Mr Altman explains. 'There is now an attempt to find common ground for a forum of producers and consumers - a loose body to discuss the state of the industry,' he says. 'This would involve all three levels of the industry - bauxite, alumina and aluminium. There have been ad hoc meetings to see if such a forum can be established. . . but there is still reluctance by some to be part of this.' However, the IBA secretary-general maintains that the association's main role is to provide its members with information on the industry - a role that is increasingly important when the market is languishing. Bauxite producers are 'between a rock and a hard place', he says, and have to decide whether it is better to sell more ore at lower prices or less at higher prices. And he warns that ore producers have no basis on which to anticipate an improvement in the market over the next two years. 'These factors are not within the direct influence of bauxite producers,' Mr Altman admits. 'What they need is a healthy economic recovery in the industrialised countries. The market is now heavily oversupplied and any hopes for a significant increase in consumption to soak up the surplus will not be realised soon.'</p>

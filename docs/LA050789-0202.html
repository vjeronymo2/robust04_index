			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZOO TEAM OMISSION  </P> <P> Sheryl Kornman's article (April 30) on the new Children's Zoo was both accurate  and informative. Throughout the article she developed the theme of a  well-coordinated team consisting of the owner, architects and specialty  contractors. Unfortunately one key member of the team was not mentioned,  specifically the general contractor, Ray Wilson Co.  </P> <P> We are very proud of the accomplishments of the group assembled by Greater Los  Angeles Zoo Assn., and we are very proud of our contribution to the Adventure  Island project.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER J. DURKEE  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P> <P>  Durkee is vice president of marketing of the Ray Wilson Co.  </P> <P> </P></p>

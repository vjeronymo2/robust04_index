			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Ladbroke makes Pounds 103m commercial property sale Ladbroke Group yesterday took the first step in disposing of its commercial property holdings by announcing that it is selling 15 properties to Burford Holdings for Pounds 103m. The acquisition should springboard Burford - the company acquired by Mr Nigel Wray's tipsheet group Chartsearch in 1988 - into the top 10 UK-listed property companies by market capitalisation. Burford is to raise Pounds 100m through a rights issue, and plans to use the new properties as collateral to fund lower grade property purchases, where it can add greater value. Burford approached Ladbroke several months ago in the hope of securing the deal, but it was only after the recent management changes that the hotels, betting and DIY group would consider a quick sale. Mr John Jackson, Ladbroke chairman, and Mr Peter George, chief executive, who took over at the beginning of the year have made clear their intention to take Ladbroke out of the commercial property business. After the sale to Burford, Ladbroke's property portfolio will be worth about Pounds 700m. Ladbroke said it would receive a non-refundable deposit of Pounds 5m, with a further Pounds 78m on April 8. The remainder will be received in deferred payments. The portfolio had a net asset value of Pounds 95.5m at the end of December. Burford has expanded at an extraordinary pace. Listed in 1987 with a market value of Pounds 8m, it went into the recession in a net cash position, following some fortuitous property sales. The management has now decided the time is right for expansion. In the past year it has acquired close to Pounds 120m worth of property. This was funded by a Pounds 42m rights issue last June, and the issue of mortgage debenture stock. Burford is now proposing a 3-for-5 rights issue at 92p a share. The shares closed yesterday at 121p, having risen 14 per cent in the previous six trading days. This compares with a net asset value of 72.3p prior to the acquisition. After completion of the rights issue, the company will have a market capitalisation of Pounds 327m. About 70 per cent of the value of the new portfolio is accounted for by four properties: Dalmore House in Glasgow, City Plaza in Birmingham, an office block in Leadenhall Street, London, and a retail development in Falkirk. The latter purchase is subject to the fulfilment of certain construction and leasing requirements. The portfolio holds average unexpired leases of 20 years and a rental yield of 8.2 per cent. Following the acquisition and rights, Burford's gearing will be reduced to 37 per cent. The company has a self-imposed ceiling of 100 per cent gearing and could invest a further Pounds 148m within this limit. Burford yesterday announced preliminary results for the year ended December 31, with pre-tax profits rising sharply to Pounds 5.93m (Pounds 52,000) on turnover of Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 10.3m). Earnings per share came out at 3.42p (0.27p losses). The company will pay a final dividend of 0.75p, lifting the total for the year from 1.15p to 1.4p.</p>

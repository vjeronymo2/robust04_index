This action requires modification of the electrical connections in a certain relay panel. This amendment is prompted by a report that, as a result of a previous modification, certain electrical wires with a positive voltage were connected to an electrical connector that is also wired to the liftdumper system, which could negatively affect the liftdumper system. The actions specified in this AD are intended to ensure protection against uncommanded deployment of the liftdumper. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective July 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before August 26, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 94&hyph;NM&hyph;47&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Fokker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aircraft USA, Inc., 1199 North Fairfax Street, Alexandria, Virginia 22314.

The RLD advises that certain Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes were modified to increase air conditioning airflow at higher altitudes by augmenting the airflow through the turbine bypass valves. These airplanes were modified in accordance with Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;026. On some airplanes, this modification resulted in the installation of electrical wires with a positive voltage into an electrical connector that is also wired for the liftdumper system. Incorporation of this modification on these airplanes could negatively affect the liftdumper system, since only electrical wires that are directly connected to a ground should be installed in this connector. This condition, if not corrected, could result in reduced protection against uncommanded deployment of the liftdumper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fokker has issued Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;045, Revision 1, dated November 17, 1993, that describes procedures for modification of the electrical connections in a certain relay panel. This modification entails disconnecting certain electrical wires from the connector in the number 2 relay panel and connecting these wires to a different connector. Accomplishment of this modification must be performed after or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in conjunction with Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;026, in order to ensure that only electrical wires that are directly connected to ground are installed to the electrical connector that is also wired for the liftdumper system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RLD classified Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;045, as mandatory and issued Netherlands Airworthiness Directive BLA 92&hyph;079/2 (A), dated December 24, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the Netherlands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fokker has also issued Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;056, Revision 1, dated November 24, 1993, which supersedes Fokker Service Bulletins SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;026 and SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;045. Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;056 describes procedures for augmentation of the flow through the turbine bypass valves of the air conditioning system to increase the air conditioning airflow at higher altitudes. The RLD classified this service bulletin as optional; however, the service bulletin incorporates the provisions of Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;21&hyph;045, including the instructions necessary to correct the wiring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent reduced protection against uncommanded deployment of the liftdumper. This AD requires modification of the electrical connections in a certain relay panel. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with either of the service bulletins described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

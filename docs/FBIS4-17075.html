			<p>BFN     [Text] The sole right to independently maintain foreign  economic relations envisioned in the power-sharing treaty with  the Russian Federation is insufficient to attract foreign  investments, Tatar Vice Prime Minister Ravil Muratov said in  Kazan Wednesday. He added that Tatarstan needed to win over the  right to independently set export and import duties taking into  account its own strategic interests and the right to set export  quotas for oil for no less than five years. At present, the  quotas are set for one year only. Otherwise, the Tatar  government will be unable to guarantee foreign investors return  on their capital.    Besides its external problems, Tatarstan needs to solve  internal ones such as the introduction of private ownership of  land in accordance with the Constitution, heal the credit and  financial systems, create market institutions -- private  enterprises, leasing agencies, insurance companies, banks --  capable of maintaining direct contacts with foreign partners.    Muratov said the present state of Tatarstan's economy was  critical and needed immediate drastic reforms.</p>

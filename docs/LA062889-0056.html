Johnson, 39, and  Griffith, 31, exchanged vows about 6:30 p.m. in the woods near Johnson's rustic  ranch 10 miles northwest of Aspen, Colo. Roads leading to the marriage site  were closed, but two helicopters carrying paparazzi and reporters from tabloid  press hovered over the scene as about 30 guests witnessed the brief,  nondenominational ceremony.ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TEAM BREAKS 51-GAME LOSS STREAK  </P> <P> The Sparta High School boys' basketball team broke a two-year, 51-game losing  streak by defeating the same visiting team that had provided their last  victory, and by the same seven-point margin.  </P> <P> The 65-58 win Tuesday was the Spartans' first since Dec. 16, 1986, when they  beat Newaygo High 66-59.  </P> <P> "This is a big relief," Sparta coach Paul Owens said. "The streak had a lot of  pressure in and of itself."  </P> <P> Newaygo coach Mike Pumford said he had had a premonition that the Spartans  would beat the Lions.  </P> <P> "The cards were stacked against us when we came in," Pumford said. "They've  been pointing to this game. It was parents' night. They had the little kids  play basketball at halftime."  </P> <P> "It was in the air. We wanted to call and say we were snowed in," he said.  </P></p>

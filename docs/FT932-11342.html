			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Workers face cut in injury payouts EMPLOYEES who are injured at work as the result of a crime could have the amount of compensation they can claim cut by at least half because of government plans to reform the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, one of the largest firms of trade union solicitors said yesterday. A worker who is physically hurt or suffers psychological damage following an assault or any other crime can at present claim compensation under the scheme for loss of earnings as well as for the injury itself. Claimants include assaulted teachers and firefighters hurt in fires caused by arson. The government is expected in a white paper this summer to propose a new 'tariff' system for compensation. Victims would no longer have the severity of their injuries assessed by experts; instead there would be a standard scale of payments administered by civil servants. Actual loss of earnings or the individual's personal circumstances would not be taken into account. Robin Thompson &amp; Partners, a firm of solicitors which handles injury claims for most public-sector unions, said it estimated that at least half of current awards to employees under the scheme consisted of loss-of-earnings payments. The Home Office, which oversees the scheme, said there had been complaints about delays in payments. The white paper would put forward ways of streamlining the system and payments would in future 'reflect the seriousness of the injury in round terms'. A Sikh police officer yesterday accepted Pounds 25,000 compensation after Nottinghamshire Constabulary admitted he had suffered racial discrimination. Mr Joginder Prem told an industrial tribunal that he had suffered abuse since joining the force in 1983 and that he had been passed over for promotion to sergeant.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Bush attends Toys R Us opening in Japan President Bush yesterday pressed home his campaign to champion US interests during his visit to Japan by attending the opening of a second outlet of Toys R Us in Kashihara City. The US retailer, after years of fighting government restrictions, opened its first shop last month. It has become a symbol of US efforts to crack open the Japanese marketplace. 'We have much to learn from the three-year battle waged by Toys R Us to open the Dollars 6bn Japanese toy market,' said Mr Bush, pictured with the chairman, Mr Charles Lazarus. Shopper Fukada Eiji bought a computer game for his son and said: 'I guess the trade problem must be very serious for the president to come to the opening of a toy store.' The Asahi Evening News reported that the US store had put local toy shops 'in a state of panic'.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC SYSTEM ADMISSIONS POLICIES  </P> <P> As a 1990 graduate of UCLA I felt compelled to respond to the University of  California admissions policy articles ("Should UC Admissions Set Ethnic and  Racial Goals?" Opinion, July 1). John H. Bunzel ("Standards Must Remain High")  is right on target while Raymond Paredes ("UC Diversity Critical Goal")  perpetuates the ever-growing cycle of reverse discrimination prevalent at UCLA.  </P> <P> As Bunzel states, the minority students are exactly those who drop out despite  special enrollment and tutoring privileges.  </P> <P> These students who are clearly less academically qualified and often prove  themselves scholastically incompetent at the university level are being chosen  over white and Asian students with 4.0 grade point averages who are exactly the  people who graduate due to their drive to succeed. It is a crime that qualified  students are being turned away due to their race.  </P> <P> Paredes assumes all whites are rich and privileged while all Latinos are poor  and deserving of special treatment. This is blatantly false. People of all  races span the gamut of wealth. The admissions system should help students of  poverty overcome their hardship regardless of race. Excellent students of all  racial and economic backgrounds should be sought. UC admission should be a  search for those motivated to succeed and be the future leaders.  </P> <P> UCLA has become a racial battleground due to the UC system's pandering to  minorities. They get special treatment on entry, while enrolled and on entry to  graduate school. When does it stop? When is the UC system going to strive for  excellence and stop lowering academic standards in order to obtain the  so-called correct proportion of minorities? What happened to our values of  individualism and self-determination or are these too destroyed in the name of  diversity?  </P> <P> LISA M. HATTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Israel's hopes for closer EC ties fade THE European Community told Israel last night that its prospects for closer economic ties with the Twelve were dim until Israel proved more conciliatory in the Middle East peace talks and more appreciative of the EC's role in the peace process. Israel objects to full EC participation in the talks on disarmament. The atmosphere for last night's meeting of the EC-Israel Co-operation Council was further soured by Israel's boycott of a parallel meeting in Brussels of the peace conference's working group on regional economic development, chaired by the EC. Mr David Levy, Israel's foreign minister, repeated his government's objection to meeting, in this group, Palestinians from outside the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, Portugal's foreign minister, said he hoped that at least Israel would attend future sessions of this working group. For his part, Mr Levy expressed dismay that the Community had recently pressurised its neighbours in the European Free Trade Association (Efta) into refusing to sign a free trade accord with Israel. EC leverage on Efta is considerable, because many Efta members have applied for full EC membership. Israel has been pushing for its trade and financial agreement with the EC to be updated and expanded, particularly in the light of the commercial concessions Brussels is granting to the countries of Efta and central Europe.</p>

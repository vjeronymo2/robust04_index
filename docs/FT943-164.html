			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Carlton Comms in Dollars 21m sale Carlton Communications is selling Immix to Scitex Corporation for Dollars 21m (Pounds 13m). Immix, which supplies video editing equipment, reported operating losses of Dollars 1.7m on sales of Dollars 7.3m in the six months to March 31. Immix was a start up company within Carlton's video and sound division set up to develop the editing technology aimed at the smaller end of the market including in house corporate videos and independent production companies. Scitex, the Israel-based company which makes electronic pre-press systems, approached Carlton as it wanted to get into the market. The price, which Carlton said offered a fair profit on its investment, was thought acceptable for a company which was considered to be on the edge of the division's activities.</p>

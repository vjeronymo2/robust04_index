			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei slips back on index-linked selling THE Nikkei average, which gained 1.8 per cent on Tuesday, failed to sustain its strength, and share prices edged down yesterday after fluctuating on arbitrage-related trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue Nikkei lost 28.26 to 21,362.26. A higher futures market and the overnight strength on Wall Street encouraged buying at the start, and the index firmed to the day's high of 21,581.02 on small-lot bargain hunting. However, buying interest failed to continue, and index-linked selling by arbitrageurs later pushed the Nikkei to the session's low of 21,218.06. Volume rose slightly to 180m shares from 160m, but remained below 200m shares for the fourth consecutive trading day. Overall advances led declines, however, by 469 to 408, with 218 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks was left with a minor gain of 1.26 at 1,584.73, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 3.29 to 1,222.04. Foreigners turned net sellers, but some traders said European fund managers were waiting to commit funds into the Tokyo market. 'Foreign investors want to see an end to the volatility before they come in,' said Mr Chris Newton at James Capel. Bio-technology issues were sought on a government survey released on Tuesday indicating the number of people infected with Aids in Japan grew last year by 2.5 times the previous year's level. Revived popularity in companies developing Aids drugs pushed Meiji Milk Products ahead Y17 to Y897 and Meiji Seika up Y47 to Y845. Buying spread to other pharmaceuticals, with Takeda Chemical firming Y10 to Y1,260 and Dainippon Pharmaceutical appreciating Y30 to Y1,380. Mitsui, the trading company, gained Y10 to Y690 on news that it had won a contract to explore and develop oil and gas reserves off Sakhalin with two US concerns. Other resource-related issues were also firm, with Teikoku Oil advancing Y19 to Y754 and Arabian Oil Y120 to Y5,160 on reports of their acquisition of oil deposits rights in Vietnam. Some high-technology issues were lower on profit-taking. Sharp, a component stock of the Nikkei 225, dipped Y30 to Y1,320 on arbitrage unwinding. Hitachi fell Y9 to Y911 on light selling by foreign investors. Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, climbed Y300 to Y12,900. Investors were encouraged by the company's estimated 60 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for this fiscal year. Nintendo rose Y200 to Y10,600 on the Osaka market. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 84.80 to 22,789.70 in volume of 133.4m shares. Buying of small-capital issues pushed up the index, but turnover jumped due to heavy cross-trading ahead of the March book-closing. Roundup HONG KONG remained active, while other Pacific Rim markets were mixed. Australia was affected by inflation figures. HONG KONG took heart from a statement by Chinese premier Li Peng that China was proceeding with economic liberalisation, although this was not reflected in the market's close. The Hang Seng index ended 15.20 off at 4,571.13 after an early rise was reversed by profit-taking. The banking sector was lifted by strong fourth-quarter results from Marine Midland Bank, a US subsidiary of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, which added 50 cents at HKDollars 37.25. Bank of East Asia results are due today, with a 22 per cent profits rise expected. AUSTRALIA had the All Ordinaries index down 3.8 at 1,622.1. The bond market, weak for the last two weeks, was sold lower in spite of news that December's consumer price index rose only 0.9 per cent, taking the annual rate to 1.5 per cent, the lowest increase for 28 years. A portfolio of some ADollars 50m, 15 to 20 per cent of total turnover, also hung over the market. The banking sector weakened after ANZ announced its long-awaited rights issue: it dropped 17 cents to ADollars 4.20, while Westpac declined 7 cents to ADollars 4.10. SEOUL fell again on profit-taking. The composite index dipped 6.68 to 659.28 in turnover of Won363bn (Won417bn). Trading was quiet ahead of next week's Chinese new year. KUALA LUMPUR saw interest in Telekom Malaysia which pushed the composite index up 3.44 to 573.28. Telekom rose 30 cents to MDollars 10.50. BANGKOK finished mixed, although there was heavy buying in property shares which pushed the SET index 1.84 higher to 768.57 in turnover of Bt6.32bn. The banking sector was also active, with two banks reporting better than expected annual results. TAIWAN was boosted by a strong financial sector. The weighted index moved up 77.38 to 5,390.05 in turnover of TDollars 53bn, after TDollars 49.8bn. The plastics sector was active on news that a petrochemical project had been approved. NEW ZEALAND was untouched by Wall Street's gains. The NZSE-40 was down 8.25 to 1,468.55. Fay Richwhite, which is backing New Zealand's America's Cup entry, rose 4 cents to NZDollars 98. BOMBAY recorded its fifth record high this month. The BSE rose 42.11 to 2,214.22. JAKARTA closed sharply higher on a strong industrial sector. The Jardine Fleming index gained 2.9 or 5.1 per cent to 59.45. KARACHI continued to fall, the 100-share index dropping 46.57 to 1,395.74.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (7): Conservatism can be a source of strength - A non-bank faces a tough year WHETHER through accident or design, the Japan Consumer Credit Services company (Jaccs) has emerged relatively unscathed by the rise and fall of Japan's speculative bubble economy of the late 1980s. During the bubble years between 1987 and 1989, when stock and real estate prices soared, bank lending expanded prodigiously and consumer spending surged, Jaccs was regarded as a stable but rather unexciting company. Since the bubble was punctured in 1990 the group's conservatism has become one of its main strengths. Avoidance of many of the problems which have hit its competitors is a revealing reflection of the mounting difficulties of the Japanese non-banks. Jaccs, which is listed on the Tokyo stock market, is a leading Japanese non-bank. The non-banks lend money for house purchases, real estate development and consumer credit. But they do not take in deposits from savers. They generally finance themselves by borrowing from larger financial institutions, mainly commercial banks, and then lend this money on to borrowers. About 80 per cent of non-bank finance comes from other financial institutions. The legions of non-banks - about 37,000 are registered, with about 17,000 actively trading - have been a vital outlet for bank lending into consumer markets with which the big commercial banks were themselves unfamiliar. The banks also used the non-banks to get round finance ministry restrictions on lending, especially to real estate. The non-banks were thus among the most active inflators of the bubble economy. They more than trebled their lending, from Y31,000bn in 1987 to Y97,000bn in March last year (the most recent figures available). But in the past two years the non-banks have become a serious problem for their backers among the big commercial banks, especially as real estate lending turned sour in the late 1980s. Many of the bad loans which are mounting up at the big banks are coming in from the small non-banks. Jaccs managed to escape this fate. In the six months to last September its total revenues went up by 4.4 per cent to Y913,989m, compared with the same period the year before, with credit card income up by 13.2 per cent. In contrast, bank lending is only growing by about 2.2 per cent. The group's income before taxes was Y3.4bn, up 21.6 per cent. and its interim net income was 54 per cent up, at Y1.4bn. Several factors have contributed to Jaccs' resilience. It began life in 1954 in the northern island of Hokkaido, as a consumer credit company pioneering the use of special tickets allowing department store customers to buy products by paying in instalments. By 1976 it had established a national network. Since then it has built up its business, with 7m card holders, 210,000 participating retailers, about 180 automatic cash machines and access to a further 6,000 operators co-operatively with other financial institutions. It steered clear of all corporate lending, including lending to real estate developers. Non-bank profits margins have been helped by recent cuts in the Bank of Japan's official discount rate, which has lowered funding costs. These costs have not been fully passed on to consumers. Besides adopting a conservative approach to lending, sticking to core business and avoiding adventures into real estate development, the company's management is addressing its future aggressively - at least by the standards of the Japanese financial system. Jaccs is spending more than Y15bn to develop a new computer system to process transactions. Mr Naoe Sugimoto, general manager of Jaccs' planning department explains: 'The old computer system was purely administrative. The new system will provide us with more management information.' Mr David Atkinson, Tokyo banking analyst with Goldman Sachs, the securities house, says: 'Consumer credit is largely a high volume processing business, so it is vital to drive down costs. The Jaccs computer investment could help to do just that.' The group is tightening up its credit assessment to avoid adding to personal bankruptcies. which are growing, from getting out of hand. Much of the lower rate of consumer lending is because of tighter credit surveillance, especially at its initial stages, Mr Sugimoto says. Jaccs is also taking a relatively tough approach to writing off bad loans. Most Japanese institutions want to prolong paying for bad loans over a long period. Jaccs wants to move swiftly to cover bad loans. It says about 2 per cent of its loans are being rescheduled. Personal bankruptcies are rising, although it is difficult to get precise figures. Nevertheless Jaccs provisions against bad loans have risen abruptly. Provisions against bad loans rose from about Y2.6bn last year to Y7bn in the six months to September. Analysts expect that provision will rise to perhaps Y12bn next year. Mr Sugimoto explains: 'We want to deal with bad loans as fast as possible.' Perhaps most importantly, Jaccs is backed by the conservative Mitsubishi Bank, which is likely to emerge from the in the Japanese financial crisis system stronger than many of its rivals. Jaccs will face a difficult year. Consumer spending is deeply depressed, especially for expensive items such as cars. Personal bankruptcies will continue to rise, a trend which may perhaps accelerate. But Jaccs seems well placed to compete by lowering its costs in a declining market, to raise both profit margins and market share. Mr Atkinson comments: 'Competition in the consumer credit market is shrinking. Competitors are pulling out because they need to deal with the problems of their corporate lending.' For the foreseeable future, companies such as Jaccs are likely to find that their conservatism becomes the financial fashion.</p>

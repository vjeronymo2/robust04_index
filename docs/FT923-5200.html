			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (29): Consolidation is the key to economy and progress - The rising costs of developing business jets are forcing manufacturers to pool their resources COSTS ENTAILED in developing a new generation of business jets are reaching the point at which some manufacturers are unable to fund such a project from their own budgets. Consolidation among manufacturers is the way ahead, many in the industry agree, as companies pool resources in the interests of economy and progress. In 1990, Bombardier, the Canadian transport conglomerate, acquired Learjet in the US, adding that company's portfolio of smaller, shorter-range business jets to Bombardier's Canadair Challenger, a larger model with intercontinental range and a full-size cabin. In March this year General Dynamics, the second-largest US defence contractor, sold its Cessna civil aircraft division to Textron, the aerospace and financial services conglomerate. Cessna, formerly best known for its range of single-piston engine trainers and tourers, has in recent years concentrated on turboprop and jet aircraft and has over the past couple of decades developed its Citation range of business jets into a best-selling series of models. Now British Aerospace is offering much of its Corporate Jets division for sale rather than find from its own pocket the finance needed to develop and build its NBJ - New Business Jet - project, intended as a follow-on to its BAe 125 range of executive aircraft, which has been a steady money-spinner for 30 years. Mr Ian Woodward, acting director of public affairs for BAe, points to the 125 models' 'excellent reputation in the market', but notes: 'We are looking at what is needed in the future.' New projects demand new cash. 'If we find a joint venture partner, it would be to raise funds.  .. The size of the partnership has yet to be determined.' Mr Alan Piper, public relations manager at Corporate Jets, elaborates: 'We need investment running up to Dollars 1bn to develop a new aircraft.' At present, BAe's 125 production plant at Chester is producing two models: the 125-800, which has transatlantic range, and the 1000, built to cross the US from coast to coast. The original 125 was designed around a cabin with enough headroom for passengers to move about, but on the 1000 the cabin is extended, making more room for seating. All told, BAe has sold 820 125s of all models, of which, recently, 802 had been delivered. Explaining Bombardier's purchase of Learjet, Mr Bryan Moss, president of the Challenger division of Canadair, says: 'Canadair with the Challenger had only one production option - although it was a successful programme. We wanted to be able to offer a family of products.' The smaller Learjets make an elegant fit with the larger Challenger. Bombardier salesmen make the point that for the roughly Dollars 27m cost of a Gulfstream IV - the business jet market leader, offering the greatest size and range so far - a company can buy a Challenger and a Lear. The Challenger remains a highly successful product, with deliveries of the latest model, the 601-3A, from the Montreal plant running at roughly two a month, a rate consistent with that achieved over the past couple of years. Canadair's present development effort is going into the Global Express, designed as a business jet capable of flying eight passengers and a four-person crew distances of up to 5,650 nautical miles - true trans-Pacific range, enough to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo or from Tokyo to London. The 48 ft cabin will be the same length as that on Canadair's Regional Jet airliner, also in development. The company expects the Global Express to make its first flight in 1996. Learjet, which in the first quarter of this year sold nine of the smaller model 31A and two 35As, together worth Dollars 48.9m, is test-flying its model 60, a step towards bridging the size and range gap between the 35A and the Challenger. Although slightly smaller, the Lear 60 represents direct competition for the BAe 1000. Learjet disclaims any interest in buying into BAe. It comments, though: 'The cost of developing (a new business jet) runs into millions of dollars. You are going to see consolidation in the future because of the high cost of new development.' Cessna's switch of ownership from General Dynamics to Textron is explained by the company more as a matter of tidying up. Cessna describes itself as 'a much more commercially oriented company' than GD, which 'is going into military and aerospace manufacturing'. Textron, in contrast, has decided 'to intensify its commercial business'. Textron owns the Lycoming aero-engine business, which powers several Cessna models, and Bell, the helicopter manufacturer. Cessna also foresees further consolidation in the business jet building industry. Its own marketing and development effort centres on the five models in the Citation portfolio, the smallest the CitationJet - which will be available from December this year - to the larger and higher-performing model VII. Company philosophy is 'to cover every market niche, so that we can start (a customer) at the bottom end of the market and increase in size as their needs grow'. With its Citation X, Cessna is moving into the topmost levels of height, speed and range performance for this size of jet. In France, Dassault Aviation also disclaims any interest in buying into BAe. Dassault, like BAe, has a long history of building military as well as business jets. Its large tri-jet Falcon 900B is at the top end of the market, competing against the Challenger and the Gulfstream IV, and the Falcon 2000, due to fly next spring, is essentially a shorter, twin-engine variant of the 900B and will provide competition for the BAe 1000. BAe shrugs off Dassault's disparagement of its models. It is talking to several prospective partners, more than one a non-British concern, and remains confident. 'You have only got to look at the (125's) track record,' Mr Woodward says. 'It is second to none.'</p>

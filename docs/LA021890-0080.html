			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAURA LAKE IS NOT A 'VOICE' FOR ALL  </P> <P> As a loyal resident of Westwood and an earnest reader of The Times and its  Westside section, I find myself no longer able to stomach the seemingly  relentless flow of infantile claims, interpretations and general political  nonsense from Laura Lake and her Friends of Westwood Inc. Far too often this  community has been misrepresented by this self-proclaimed "voice" of the  people.  </P> <P> Make no mistake, several of Lake's views and aspirations for Westwood do not  reflect those of the bulk of its people.  </P> <P> These "people" include established homeowners, renters and a diverse group of  business operators as well. Virtually all are devoted to the socioeconomic  prosperity of the Westwood area and, therefore, are concerned about the real  elements and issues affecting its future. This practical stance has led many of  us to the brink of nausea as we listen to Lake's latest petty crusade against  the UCLA Medical Center's proposed Guest House.  </P> <P> Lake is fond of using the term "credibility" in her efforts. Might I suggest  that she take a moment to ponder her own. Perhaps she will come to the  realization that her misdirection makes her, at best, an "acquaintance" of  Westwood.  </P> <P> MARK S. LISCIO  </P> <P> Westwood  </P></p>

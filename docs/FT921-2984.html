			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Italians reveal 6% Fokker stake THE SCRAMBLE by European aircraft manufacturers to consolidate their position in the cut-throat regional jet market took a new twist yesterday with the disclosure that Finmeccanica of Italy had accumulated a 6.02 per cent stake in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft group. Fokker said it had been taken by surprise by the disclosure that the Italian state-controlled company had acquired the stake, worth Fl 71.5m (Dollars 38.1m) at Fokker's current share price. The announcement coincides with a flurry of negotiations between European aircraft groups to try to rationalise the loss-making European regional aircraft industry. It comes only a week after Fokker announced it was in discussions with Deutsche Aerospace to expand collaboration in regional jets, including the participation of the German company in Fokker's plans to develop a smaller version of its Fokker 100 jet. The Fokker stake appears to reflect an effort by the Italian group to hedge its position in the current restructuring of the industry to ensure it will play a role in the development of a new regional jet. Finmeccanica declined to comment yesterday. It was caught off-balance by the disclosure of its Fokker stake. The disclosure comes at an embarrassing moment for Finmeccanica and its aerospace subsidiary Alenia. The French authorities have been pressing the Italian group for an early decision on injecting Dollars 250m to increase the capital of SGS-Thomson, the semiconductor venture in which Finmeccanica has a 45 per cent stake. However, Finmeccanica has been playing for time, arguing it lacks funds while at the same time seeking some counterpart from the French for going ahead with the capital increase. But its secret acquisition of a stake in Fokker is unlikely to please the French. Its Alenia subsidiary is currently a partner with Deutsche Aerospace and Aerospatiale of France to develop a family of 90 and 120-seater regional jets. But the German group appears increasingly reluctant to launch the new Dollars 2.5bn programme at this stage. Instead, it is considering forging closer links with Fokker while encouraging the European Airbus consortium, in which it has a 37.9 per cent stake, to develop a smaller 130 seat version of the A320 airliner. Such a move risks isolating Alenia. Finmeccanica's investment in Fokker came to light as a result of a new Dutch law introduced last month requiring shareholders to disclose stakes of 5 per cent or more in quoted Dutch companies. Fokker would not comment on whether it believed the Italian stake was a long-held investment or a more recent purchase. But some industry officials suggested Finmeccanica had held an undisclosed stake in Fokker for some time.</p>

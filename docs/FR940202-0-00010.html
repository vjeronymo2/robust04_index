			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two of the three requirements of a final regulatory flexibility analysis (5 U.S.C. 604), (1) a succinct statement of the need for and the objectives of the rule and (2) a summary of the issues raised by the public comments, the agency's assessment of the issues, and a statement of the changes made in the final rule in response to the comments, are discussed above. The third requirement of a final regulatory flexibility analysis is a description of significant alternatives to the rule that would minimize the rule's economic impact on small entities and reasons why the alternatives were rejected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule, however, should not have an economic impact on small entities. The rule will apply only to entities with financial contracts of $1 billion in gross notional principal amount or gross mark-to-market positions of $100 million over a period of 15 months. Entities with a smaller level of market activity would not be covered by the Board's expanded definition of ``financial institution.'' Many small market participants are included in the Act's definition of ``financial institution'' and thus are already covered by the netting provisions. The Board limited its expansion of the Act's definition to entities with a relatively large volume of activity because the lack of netting coverage for small entities is unlikely to affect overall market efficiency or systemic risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 231  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Banks, banking, Financial institutions, Netting.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Board adds a new part 231 to Title 12, Chapter II of the Code of Federal Regulations to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 231_NETTING ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REGULATION EE <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=70 g=1 f=1 --> Sec.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 231.1&blank;Authority, purpose, and scope.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 231.2&blank;Definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 231.3&blank;Qualification as a financial institution.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  12 U.S.C. 4402(1)(B) and 4402(9).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;231.1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Authority, purpose, and scope.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Authority. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This part (Regulation EE; 12 CFR part 231) is issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under the authority of sections 402(1)(B) and 402(9) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (12 U.S.C. 4402(1)(B) and 4402(9)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose and scope.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the Act and this part is to enhance efficiency and reduce systemic risk in the financial markets. This part expands the Act's definition of ``financial institution'' to allow more financial market participants to avail themselves of the netting provisions set forth in sections 401&hyph;407 of the Act (12 U.S.C. 4401&hyph;4407). This part does not affect the status of those financial institutions specifically defined in the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

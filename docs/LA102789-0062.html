			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ALLEGEDLY FUNDED SALVADOR DEATH SQUADS  </P> <P> U.S. military advisers in El Salvador knew of political assassinations carried  out by a Salvadoran army unit and helped bankroll the death squad activity, a  former Salvadoran army commando was quoted as saying Thursday.  </P> <P> In an interview on the CBS Evening News, the former commando, identified as  Cesar Vielman Joya Martinez, said he and others in his unit -- the intelligence  section of the army's 1st Brigade -- acted under orders as a clandestine death  squad as recently as three months ago.  </P> <P> Joya Martinez added that the death sentences he helped carry out were passed  down by his commanders and that he reported back up through the chain of  command.  </P> <P> He was quoted as saying that two U.S. military advisers attached to the unit  were aware of the assassinations but that details of the killings were  deliberately left out in reports to them.  </P> <P> He also claimed that the U.S. advisers supplied money to his unit that helped  maintain two civilian vehicles used for death-squad operations and a safehouse  that served as a secret base of operations.  </P> <P> Joya Martinez has fled El Salvador and is now seeking asylum in the United  States, CBS said.  </P> <P> It quoted Col. Francisco Elena Fuentes, commander of the 1st Brigade, as  calling Joya Martinez an "assassin, a deserter and a thief" who had acted  strictly on his own.  </P> <P> William Walker, the U.S. ambassador in El Salvador, denied in a separate CBS  interview that American advisers knew of any assassinations.  </P> <P> The Pentagon, in a statement issued Thursday, called claims of U.S. complicity  in death-squad activity "patently absurd."  </P> <P> "We know of no instances in which U.S. military personnel have been even  remotely associated with such morally repugnant activities," the statement  said.  </P></p>

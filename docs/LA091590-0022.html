			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OPEN SERVES TENNIS WITH POTENTIAL PROBLEM  </P> <P> Thanks to Jim Murray for his "Saliva Test" article on the Andre Agassi  decision. We all saw and heard what Agassi did and were revolted by the obvious  fear of the supervisor to throw Agassi out of the tournament. We were all made  co-defendants of a system that upholds uncontrolled, disgusting behavior for  the sake of money.  </P> <P> LEILA McDERMOTT  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Loss at Den Norske Bank increases to NKr1.162bn DEN NORSKE BANK, Norway's biggest bank, yesterday revealed an increase in first-half net losses to NKr1.162bn (Dollars 201m) from a loss of NKr921m in the same period last year. DnB's A-shares plunged 22 per cent to NKr4.30 on the Oslo bourse, following the news. The bank admitted that increasing losses will make it difficult to comply with the state's demand that it break even in 1992. The demand was made in connection with a NKr5.9bn state cash injection received by DnB last December which gave the state a 55.6 per cent stake. Non-performing loans increased to NKr10.7bn by the end of June, from NKr10.3bn at end-March and NKr10.2bn at the end of last year. Gross non-performing loans rose to NKr19.7bn by end-June from NKr19.1bn at end-1991. DnB's first-half figures for this year and last are not directly comparable because this year's figures include Realkreditt, a mortgage company, acquired by the bank last December in connection with the state rescue package. Realkreditt, in the first half, accounted for nearly NKr200m of DnB's overall losses. The bank warned that loan losses to the shipping industry would be higher this year than last. The bank's shipping portfolio is estimated at NKr22bn and first-half loan loss provisions reached NKr181m, which the bank said would materialise into losses. On the bright side, first-half net interest income was up slightly to NKr2.332bn from NKr2.254bn in the same period last year. Operating expenses in the period were cut to NKr2.408bn from NKr2.450bn. The bank has set a goal of maintaining annual operating expenses at NKr4.5bn. Credit losses fell by NKr241m to NKr1.978bn. 'Although loan losses . . . are at an unacceptably high level, developments are pointing in the right direction,' said Mr Finn A. Hvistendahl, group managing director.</p>

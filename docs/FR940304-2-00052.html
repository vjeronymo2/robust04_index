The agreement would settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission that Columbia's proposed acquisition of 100 percent of the voting stock of HCA would have violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act if it had been carried out. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or issue and serve the agreement's proposed order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both Columbia and HCA (the ``respondents'') own and operate acute care hospitals in various states, including acute care hospitals in a three-county urban area that includes the cities of Augusta, Georgia, and Aiken, South Carolina (``Augusta-Aiken''). The complaint accompanying the proposed consent order concerns the proposed acquisition's impact upon competition for acute care hospital services in Augusta-Aiken. According to the complaint, Columbia owns and operates Augusta Regional Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia. HCA owns and operates HCA Aiken Regional Medical Center, located about 15 miles northeast of Augusta, Georgia in Aiken, South Carolina. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Russian banks closed today in protest at wave of killings Leading Russian commercial banks will close for part, or all, of today in protest against the murder of a senior banker, the latest in a wave of killings of businessmen in Russia. Mr Nikolai Likhachev, the 54-year-old chairman of Rosselkhozbank, which finances most of Russian agriculture, was shot in the head on Friday night in front of his home. His killer, as in the murder of 12 other bankers this year, has not been found. The murders are usually blamed on extortion gangs, or disputes between semi-criminal businessmen, or on rows between banks and clients in a country which has few tools for assessing banking risks and solving commercial disputes. 'Some borrowers prefer to pay Dollars 5,000 to a hired gunman than to repay a billion rouble bank loan,' said Mr Vladimir Okhlopkov, chairman of Delovaya Rossiya Bank. Some Russian banks are set up by criminals for money-laundering and fraud, while the authorities are seen as weak, corrupt, and unable to either supervise or protect the banking sector. Mr Andrei Makarov, a lawyer who used to head the government's anti-corruption commission, said the inability of police to solve a single murder was partly due to their feeling that businessmen deserved what they got because private enterprise was basically a criminal activity. 'After seven decades of Communism, which taught class hatred of the bourgeoisie, there is a lot of resentment against the small minority of the population which is now really rich,' said Mr Okhlopkov. 'We have practically no middle class and lots of people who feel hard done by.' Some Russian banks have private armies and dozens of bodyguards to protect their top executives. But colleagues said that Mr Likhachev, a former deputy chairman of the central bank, had no bodyguard. His murder was seen as particularly shocking because of Rosselkhozbank's reputation as a conservative bastion of the state-owned economy. Commersant newspaper, however, speculated that one source of resentment against Rosselkhozbank was the recent elimination of subsidised farm agricultural loans, which had overnight increased the financial difficulties of many of the bank's clients. Rosselkhozbank is mostly owned by state-owned enterprises such as the country's biggest exporter of mineral fertilisers, with around 10 per cent of its shares held directly by the state. The government recently announced plans to sell off the remaining shares it still holds directly in institutions such as Rosselkhozbank. The Association of Russian Commercial Banks said it had asked all the country's banks, of which there are more than 2,000, not to open today. Such a protest would express their anger at the 'inactivity of law enforcement agencies' and 'demonstrate to the criminal world their determination not to leave unpunished a single attack on any bank employee'. Incombank, whose St Petersburg branch chief was killed last July, said it would remain closed all day. Another leading commercial bank, Mosbiznesbank, said it would close for an hour during the funeral service. Miners call off strike after winning concessions, Page 2</p>

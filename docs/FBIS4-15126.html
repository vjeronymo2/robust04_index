			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Cristian Nita from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] The eighth round of Moldovan-Russian negotiations  on the statute of the 14th [Russian] Army, and on ways and terms  for this Army's withdrawal from the territory of the Republic of  Moldova was concluded in Chisinau today.    This afternoon, the leaders of the two delegations held a  news conference. I would like to mention that this is the first  news conference since the beginning of negotiations between the  Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation on the issue of  the 14th Army's withdrawal.    Summing up the results of this eighth round of negotiations,  the leaders of the delegations, that is, Ambassadors Anatol  Taranu and Vladimir Kitayev noted the importance of continuing  negotiations and emphasized the constructive attitude of both  sides toward finding optimal solutions regarding the terms of  the 14th Army's withdrawal. The sides appreciated the presence  in the negotiations of the representatives of the  self-proclaimed Dniester Republic as a favorable element. The  leaders of the two delegations announced that they have  initialed the draft accords on granting judicial assistance on  issues connected with the temporary stationing of the 14th Army  on the territory of the Republic of Moldova as well as on  granting social guarantees and pensions to former soldiers and  members of their families.    Military experts signed a document drafted jointly on  technical requirements for the withdrawal of the 14th Army and  on the issue regarding the transportation of the military  property of the Russian Federation from Moldova.    Unfortunately, the sides could not overcome disagreements  regarding the terms for the withdrawal of the 14th Army. The  sides presented new variations to Article No. 2 of the basic  accord, which includes the withdrawal of the 14th Army and  agreed to continue discussions on this issue during the ninth  round of negotiations to be held in mid-May in Moscow.    In connection with the presence of the CSCE observers in  these negotiations, Ambassador Vladimir Kitayev declared that  Russia respects the activities of this international body, but  since it has not been specified how the negotiations should be  followed, the Russian side considers it reasonable to inform the  CSCE at the end of each round of negotiations.    Ambassador Anatol Taranu stressed that on this issue the  Republic of Moldova continues as before to express the opinion  that the presence of the CSCE observers in the negotiation would  make a constructive contribution to the unfolding of the  respective negotiations.    Regarding the synchronization of the withdrawal of the 14th  Army with the granting of a special legal status to Dniester,  the Russian side continued to support this idea. The leader of  the Moldovan delegation, however, expressed the view that if  this condition were accepted, the negotiations would virtually  have not made one single step forward. Therefore, it would be  reasonable to reactivate the previous four-party mechanism to  solve this problem.</p>

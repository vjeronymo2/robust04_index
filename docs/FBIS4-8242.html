			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 7 (ATA) -- "Albania is grateful to  the Council of Europe [CE], its member states, and the European  institutions for the assistance it has received from them,"  President Berisha said in a meeting he had yesterday at the  presidency with the Council of Europe delegation headed by Lord  Finsberg.    President Berisha said that as it has been asserted "the  reforms in Albania have been advancing quicker than in other  countries in the past two years," adding that Albania fulfills  all the conditions for becoming a member of the Council of  Europe: free elections, observation of the human rights and the  rights of national minorities. "Albania is determined in  further cooperation with the Council of Europe and its  integration into Europe," President Berisha emphasized.    Lord Finsberg appreciated the profound changes made in the  course of reforms and said he would like to see Albania be as  soon as possible a full member of the Council of Europe.</p>

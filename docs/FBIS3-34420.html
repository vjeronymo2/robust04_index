The report states that checkposts  have been set up on intersections and vehicles are regularly  checked. Repressive patrols are conducted on the streets. In  order to tighten control, at times, the regime's agents block  the streets or announce that they are one-way streets. The  ruling clerics, who are still gripped with the fear of last  year's heroic uprising by the Mashhad residents, are  implementing these repressive actions in an attempt to control  the mounting protests of the people of Mashhad.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The effects of credit restrictions have begun to be  felt in the financial system. The measures adopted more than a  month ago are resulting in slower growth of the loan portfolios  of credit institutions and an increase in interest rates for the  loans.    While the portfolios (financial sector loans) had been  growing by 3.3 percent between 12 March and 10 April 1993, the  increase was 2.5 percent during the same period of this year.    According to EL TIEMPO's estimates the system would have  loaned approximately 100 billion pesos more if credit were  increasing at the same rate as last year.    The impact is expected to be greater in the coming weeks  because, by means of the measures, the Central Bank's Board of  Directors seeks to achieve a rate of growth in credit of only  2.2 percent per month.    In addition, Decree 673, which was issued by the government  and requires the financial system to increase its net assets  [patrimonio], is expected to have a noticeable impact in May.  <H5>  The Impact </H5>   The growth in bank portfolios [between 12 March and 10  April]  decreased from 3.5 to 2.4 percent. However, the impact has been  most evident in the portfolios of commercial financing  companies. The growth rate dropped from 6.6 percent in April of  last year to only 2.1 percent [for the period 12 March-10 April,  1994].    The president of the National Association of Financial  Institutions (ANIF), Javier Fernandez, said the lower rate of  increase could be attributed, in large part, to the drop in the  volume of loans granted by the commercial financing companies  for automobile purchases.    Despite the measures to restrict internal and external  credit, the means of payment (money in circulation and current  accounts) continue to grow at a rate of 40 percent, considerably  above the target fixed by the Central Bank which is between 21  and 28 percent. An excessive increase is detrimental for  achieving the inflation goal. This explains monetary  authorities' concern with controlling the increase in money in  public circulation.  <H5>  Interest Rates Increase </H5>   Another consequence of the credit restrictions is the  increase in the investment (colocacion) interest rates.    While loans were granted at an average interest rate of  36.09  percent in March 11 of this year (prior to the measures), by 15  April the rate had increased to 38.08 percent.    The credit system had foreseen an increase of two or three  points as a result of the measures.    The highest interest rates are found in the banks and  commercial financing companies which charge, on average, 38 and  39 percent, respectively.    The difference between what is being charged for loans and  what savers are receiving averages 13 percent.    However, contrary to what was expected, interest rates for  savers have not dropped noticeably. Prior to the measures,  earnings of 25.60 percent were being received. Today earnings  average 25.35 percent.</p>

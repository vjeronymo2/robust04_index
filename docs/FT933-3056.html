			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Taiwan puts pressure on France to buy BAe jets TAIWAN, which recently formed a joint venture with British Aerospace, is putting pressure on France to buy regional passenger jets from the company in return for its own purchase of Dollars 3.8bn (Pounds 2.5bn) worth of French Mirage jets and missiles. Air Inter, part of the state-owned Air France group, is planning to buy up to 15 regional jets and is understood to be considering the Boeing 737-500, the new Airbus A319 launched at the Paris air show in June, the Dutch Fokker 100 and the BAe 146RJ. BAe is currently attempting to finalise the details of its joint venture to build regional jets in Taiwan, rting with the 146RJ. Taiwan Aerospace will hold 50 per cent of the new company, Avro. The French deal, which could be worth between Dollars 300m and Dollars 400m, would represent a significant breakthrough for BAe's regional jet business in the mainstream European airline market. BAe has until now sold the four-engine 146 mainly to smaller regional carriers. However, the British company has been facing especially fierce competition from Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker controlled by Germany's Deutsche Aerospace, for the Air Inter contract. The Dutch authorities are also understood to have put considerable political pressure on the French government, suggesting that selection of the twin-engine Fokker 100 by Air Inter could clear the way for a Dutch purchase of Franco-German Cougar military helicopters. Taiwan has now stepped in by raising the threat of retaliation over the big Mirage deal if Air Inter does not choose the BAe 146. The sale of 60 Mirage fighters and 1,500 missiles to Taiwan is regarded as a lifeline for the French Dassault aerospace group, which has not won a military export order for four years. The pressure by Taiwan on the French government also appears to confirm Taiwan's determination to complete the joint venture deal with BAe and develop a presence in the world civil aircraft market. After hectic negotiations in Taiwan last month, BAe and Taiwan authorities finally agreed on the financial structure of Avro. But Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, confirmed yesterday that the two sides were still negotiating technology and development issues in an effort to complete the deal. A senior Taiwanese delegation was in London last week, but the two parties failed to reach final agreement. However, BAe appeared confident yesterday that the issues would eventually be ironed out to clear the way for completing the deal.

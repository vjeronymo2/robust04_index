			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jiang Enzhu, Chinese deputy foreign minister </F> responsible for European affairs and in charge of negotiations  on Hong Kong, by Josette Alia; date and place not given: "The  Americans Better Watch Out"]    [Text] [Alia] Minister, what practical results do you  expect from Mr. Balladur's visit to China?    [Enzhu] This visit marks the normalization of relations  between France and China following the recent vicissitudes.  This normalization should improve our economic and commercial  relations, which I welcome.    [Alia] Why did you react so harshly to France's sale of  planes to Taiwan? The United States, which did the same thing,  has not been ostracized by you in the same way.    [Enzhu] Selling arms to Taiwan when you have diplomatic  relations with us amounts to an attack on our sovereignty, to  interference in our internal affairs. It is a matter of  principle, and on this point we treat everybody in the same way.  If unofficial or nongovernmental organizations do trade with  Taiwan, we obviously cannot object. But we are opposed to any  official contact between the countries which have recognized us  and Taiwan.    [Alia] Warren Christopher's recent visit does not seem to  have done much to ease tension in Sino-American relations. Do  you not think that the problem of human rights is casting a  shadow over your international image?    [Enzhu] Sino-American relations have improved markedly since  the two presidents met in Seattle in November 1993. But it is  obvious that our relations with the United States are not based  on ideology or common values. They are based on the two sides'  interests. We have close, if not identical, views on the  settlement of regional and world conflicts. And Warren  Christopher reaffirmed to us that the existence of a strong,  stable, and prosperous China was in America's interests.    [Alia] What would you do if the United States did not renew  the most favored nation clause for China?    [Enzhu] That would be a serious matter. Of course, China  would suffer as a result, but so would the United States: Most  exports of Chinese products to the United States are carried out  by businessmen in Hong Kong and Taiwan, or by Sino-American  joint ventures. If the clause of most favored nation was not  renewed, American businessmen would be the first to suffer.    [Alia] You have not given me an answer on the human rights  question...    [Enzhu] We refuse to link this question to other questions  which have nothing to do with it, like the renewal of the most  favored nation clause or our entry into GATT. It is a domestic  problem.    [Alia] Well, do not link it to anything, but let us discuss  it nonetheless. Why do you refuse to bow to international  pressure? Is China so weak that it cannot release a few  dissidents and introduce greater democracy into its regime?    [Enzhu] I would like to discuss this problem in general and  not in the framework of the visit by an American leader. As you  know, China has more than 1.2 billion inhabitants and our level  of economic development is still fairly low. We have 30  provinces which are not all equally rich, and each represents  virtually the equivalent of a West European country in numbers  of inhabitants. Each year, there are 16 million new babies born,  in other words the equivalent of the population of the  Netherlands, 16 million additional citizens to whom food,  healthcare, housing, education, transport, and jobs must be  supplied! It is a very difficult task. We have already improved  the living standards of hundreds of millions of Chinese and  eradicated famine. And yet 80 million people still live below  the poverty line in some remote regions of China.    How can these many huge problems be tackled? We have decided  that the main priority would be the economic development of the  whole country. This is because improving the population's  standard of living means ensuring the most basic of human  rights, because we want above all to meet the mosts basic needs  of 1.2 billion inhabitants. But this can only be done with  order and political stability. Like any government, ours must  strive to implement the law and maintain social order. This  obviously leads to our punishing those who violate that law.    That is why we hope that the Western countries, particularly  the West European countries, far from ignoring it, will propose  specific initiatives for China's stability. It is in their  interest too: Between now and the end of the century, Chinese  imports of machinery, consumer durables, transport equipment,  energy, telecommunications equipment, and advanced technology  are bound to increase. In all these spheres, France and the  other West European countries have many assets...    [Alia] At present, you seem to be excluding Britain, with  which you are having discussions on the subject of Hong Kong.    [Enzhu] Britain claims to want to develop democracy in Hong  Kong, but it has dominated that territory for 150 years without  practising any democracy: Until 1991, London directly appointed  the members of the Hong Kong councils, and then only some of  them were elected. Why is Britain so suddenly concerned to  introduce a political system it has hitherto rejected? Why is  it not honoring its pledges? To be able to continue to exert  its influence. But, whatever happens, China will regain  sovereignty over Hong Kong, as planned, on 1 July 1997, and what  has happened before will be nul and void.    [Alia] Will you change Hong Kong's political system?    [Enzhu] We will carry out peaceful reunification according  to the formula "one state, two systems" on which we have given a  promise, in other words Hong Kong will continue to be an  international financial center and a free port, and foreign  commercial investments and interests will be protected by law  there.    [Alia] You have just signed similar protection agreements  with Taiwan. Is this not tantamount to recognizing Taiwan?    [Enzhu] Not at all. We have just given guarantees to the  Taiwanese businessmen investing in China. Taiwan is still an  integral part of Chinese territory.    [Alia] Last October, you carried out a nuclear test, whereas  France, Russia, and the United States had just decided to extend  the moratorium on tests. Were you trying to issue a political  warning or did you have technical reasons for acting in that way?    [Enzhu] We carried out an underground nuclear test because,  for a long period, we had stopped testing, which was a kind of  de facto moratorium. Indeed, of all the nuclear countries, it  is China which has carried out fewest tests. But we are still  in favor of a total ban, if an agreement to this effect can be  signed.</p>

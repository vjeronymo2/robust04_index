			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Inevitability of pit closures and tax rises on oil and gas Sir, In a letter published in the FT on March 31 I bemoaned the unequal treatment given to oil and gas exploration and production and the coal industry. At that time, in order to appease public opposition to pit closures, Pounds 400m of taxpayers' money had been given to British Coal, in a move said to 'provide dramatic opportunities', while taxes on North Sea production were being increased to prevent 'subsidising sub-optimal investment'. How inevitable, six months later, that government sources are now suggesting that not one of the pits at risk may be saved. How equally inevitable that increased taxes on oil and gas, albeit to consumers, are now being mooted to help the government out its present difficulties, which continue to be made worse by throwing cash down holes in the ground with no economically recoverable coal in them. Plus ca change. James S Cobbett, 4 Arundel Close, Passfield, Liphook, Hampshire GU30 7RW</p>

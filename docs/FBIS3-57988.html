In the council's opinion, membership cannot be  implemented on that basis. At this point, however, the MTK does  not want to break off the negotiations, but it is taking a more  critical view of them than before.    The MTK's seven southernmost district organizations in  Finland's so-called grain belt had submitted a statement at the  executive council meeting, in which they expressed their  annoyance with the fact that the MTK had in many ways played a  cooperative role in the negotiations with the EU. In it they  asked the council to consider the organization's withdrawal from  the membership negotiations.    They were not given a chance to vote on the proposal. MTK  acting chairman Toivo T. Pohjala (Conservative) saved the  organization from an embarrassing situation due to the prestige  he enjoys among grain farmers. He took a position on the  statement before it was discussed as an agenda item.  <H5>  Haavisto Has No Rival Candidate </H5>   If the MTK had withdrawn from the EU membership  negotiations,  it would have been impossible for Heikki Haavisto (Center Party)  to be the foreign minister, who heads the negotiations with the  EU on agriculture, and MTK chairman at one and the same time.    The MTK chairman elections are to be held today. By Thursday  [2 December] it had already become clear that there was no  candidate to run against Haavisto. It is said that Haavisto runs  the MTK in such a sovereign manner that, according to some of  the council members, a vacuum has been created about him.    According to the plans that have been made, Pohjala is to  take over from Haavisto as chairman of the MTK after the end of  the year.    Foreign Ministry trade councillor Esa Harmala (Center Party)  explained the situation with the negotiations to the council. He  maintained that the Commission's statement is in part so  confusingly written that he did not understand every point on  even his fifth reading of it.  <H5>  Only Annoyance With and Council Members for EU Negotiations </H5>   According to Harmala, they will enter into discussions on  points open to interpretation with the Commission on Friday.    Harmala had interpreted the statement as meaning that  producer prices will not have to be lowered to EU price levels  immediately, but that farmers might be paid price supplements.  On the other hand, as he sees it, it is perfectly clear that the  Commission wants to lower consumer prices to EU levels  immediately.    Harmala said that the system will be costly for the Finnish  Government.    Farmer Harri Finnila of Pohjanmaa said that the EU  negotiations have produced nothing but annoyance and new council  members. Harmala stated that he, at least, would take a cut in  salary when he becomes a council member following his duties as  special advisor to the prime minister.    Antti Franssila, who is leaving his duties as third MTK  chairman, kicked up more of a row than usual for him and  insisted that, instead of negotiations, Harmala dictate  Finland's demands to the EU since the EU is already bound by the  Rome Treaty to protect member countries' food production.    Attention was focused at the meeting on the fact that rural  communities' economy would collapse if Finland were to join the  EU on the terms proposed by the Commission.    Several council members deplored the fact that many of the  nation's special-interest groups have taken up a position behind  the Commission's statement and against the farmers. MTK leaders  have been obliged to negotiate with the labor union movement,  among other groups, so that we Finns would form a united front  behind Finland's agriculture goals.    According to an opinion poll presented at the meeting, fully  92 percent of all farmers oppose EU membership on the terms set  forth in the Commission's statement.</p>

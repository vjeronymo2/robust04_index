			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking at the session of the Crimean parliament  today, Valeriy Kuznetsov, the new interior minister, described  Kiev's actions as an attempted coup d'etat.    In his turn, Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy [Volodymyr  Kryzhanovskyy], Ukrainian ambassador to Russia, commented on the  developments in Crimea of last night and today as follows:    [Begin Kryzhanovskiy recording] What coup can they be  talking  about in the Crimea? A parliamentary session is being held  there today, it is working calmly and taking decisions which may  be right, or not quite right, or wrong. You know, special  purpose troops can be sent to any part of Ukraine at any time --  but do I, as an ambassador, need to know about these things?  Crimea is Ukrainian territory in the same sense as  Ivano-Frankovsk, or Donetsk, or Zhitomir, or Odessa. All right,  supposing special troops did go there -- so what? Do you think  I am very much concerned about the movement of a mere 10 or 15  servicemen from the special troops around Ukraine? All is quiet  in Ukraine, a session is in progress in Crimea -- so what coup  d'etat are we talking about? [end recording]</p>

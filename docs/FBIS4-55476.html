			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "TA SR, do": "A Precedent That Is Without </F> Parallel in the World; Ministry of Culture Demands That the  Daily SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA Change Its Name"]    [Excerpts] Bratislava--On 28 April 1994, SALUS Ltd.  registered with the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic a  daily newspaper called SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA [SLOVAK REPUBLIC],  states the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic in a  statement it made available to the TA SR yesterday.    The press law, as amended by subsequent regulations, does  not  stipulate any restrictions regarding the names of periodicals.  On the other hand, the name in question is the official name of  a state that, as transpires from the Constitution of the Slovak  Republic, must not be used by any other domestic or foreign  entity. Slovakia is registered under this unique name with the  United Nations and other international organizations and was  internationally recognized under this name. In other words, the  name of the state is protected by international legal  regulations, and its use by other entities is out of the  question, also because it could be mistaken for another  entity--for example, abroad. Speaking about the name of the  state having been abused is possible on the theoretical plane  only. In the specific case of the daily SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA,  such an abuse in the legal sense did not occur. In a letter on  12 May 1994, the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic, as  the registering authority, asked the publisher, SALUS Ltd., to  register a change in the present name of the daily so as to make  the name of the periodical conform with the Constitution of the  Slovak Republic and international legal regulations.    "Giving a daily or another periodical the name of a state  can  be considered a precedent that is without parallel in the  world," Lubomir Fogos, chairman of the National Council of the  Slovak Republic Mandate and Immunity Committee, who is one of  our foremost experts on international and constitutional law,  said yesterday. In his opinion, the Constitution of the Slovak  Republic lacks stipulations that would apply to such instances  of the name of the state being used for commercial purposes. He  considers it unusual, however, when state symbols, to which the  name of the Republic undeniably belongs, are used in ways that  actually debase them. [passage omitted]    [Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 13 May on page 2 carries  a  100-word "zl"-signed report on a briefing given by the  Democratic Union on 12 May. According to the report,  "Democratic Union Deputy Chairman Roman Kovac expressed  astonishment at the fact that the Ministry of Culture registered  the daily SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, which carries the name of the  state. He said that the government would ask that the  circumstances under which this happened be reconsidered and that  it would draw conclusions from this."]</p>

The six yards rushing is an all-time low for the  Tide. The previous low was 11 yards in a 27-7 loss to Tulane in 1955.  </P> <P> Alabama, which has gone 11 quarters without scoring a touchdown, lost its only  scoring opportunity when Philip Doyle missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt in  the first quarter after Fayak had given Penn State a 3-0 lead with a 34-yard  field goal.  </P> <P> Syracuse 26, Army 14 -- David Walker scored on a three-yard run and Mark  McDonald connected with Rob Carpenter on a 43-yard touchdown pass play as the  Orangemen (4-2-2) came from behind to beat the Cadets (3-4) at West Point, N.Y.  </P> <P> McDonald, who completed 17 of 22 passes for 229 yards, drove the Orangemen 80  yards to set up Walker's touchdown run with 7:47 left, giving Syracuse a 14-13  lead.  </P> <P> Mike Mayweather, Army's all-time leading rusher, carried 32 times for 131  yards.  </P> <P> Boston College 27, West Virginia 14 -- Kevin Pearson returned an interception  31 yards for a touchdown and the Eagles (4-3) converted three other Mountaineer  turnovers into scores in a nonconference game at Morgantown, W.Va.  </P> <P> Entering the game, West Virginia (3-4) had forced 18 turnovers and surrendered  the ball four times -- the best turnover ratio in the nation.  </P> <P> Rutgers 20, Akron 17 -- Shaun Smith intercepted a pass in the end zone with 36  seconds left to preserve the victory for the Scarlet Knights (3-5) at  Piscataway, N.J.  </P> <P> Akron (3-5-1) had driven from its own 29 to the Rutgers' nine, but quarterback  Wayne Wade's pass intended for Marcus Reliford was picked off by Smith.  </P> <P> James Madison 16, Navy 7 -- The Dukes (5-3) sacked Navy quarterback Alton  Grizzard seven times to take command of the Midshipmen (3-4) at Annapolis, Md.  </P> <P> Senior fullback Willie Lanier gained only nine yards, but scored on two  two-yard touchdown runs for the Dukes.  </P> <P> Temple 30, East Carolina 27 -- Bob Wright kicked a 24-yard field goal with 1:16  left to help the Owls (4-3) overcome two touchdown runs by Dion Johnson and  defeat the Pirates (3-6) at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Johnson returned a punt 53 yards for a touchdown and had a 90-yard kickoff  return for a touchdown -- both in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Dartmouth 17, Harvard 0 -- Shon Page rushed for a school-record 222 yards and  scored two touchdowns to lead the Big Green to an Ivy League victory over the  Crimson at Hanover, N.H.  </P> <P> Page, who scored on a 49-yard run in the first quarter and a 29-yard run midway  through the second quarter, broke David Clark's school record of 219 yards set  against Penn last year.  </P> <P> Dartmouth, 4-2-1 overall and 3-1 in the Ivy League, shut out Harvard (4-3, 2-2)  for the first time since 1965.  </P> <P> Columbia 17, Princeton 15 -- Bruce Mayhew passed for one touchdown and scored  another as the Lions (1-6, 1-3) earned their first victory by defeating the  Tigers (2-5, 1-3) at New York for the second time in three seasons.  </P> <P> Yale 27, Pennsylvania 10 -- Darin Kehler passed for 128 yards and rushed for 69  yards and a touchdown as the Elis (4-3, 3-1) defeated the Quakers (2-5, 2-2) at  Philadelphia for the first time since 1980.  </P> <P> Cornell 34, Brown 7 -- Linebacker Mark Broderick broke a 43-year-old school  record with a 99-yard interception return for a touchdown to lead the Big Red  (4-3, 3-1) over the Bears (1-6, 1-3) in an Ivy League game at Ithaca, N.Y.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 9 (YONHAP) -- Cases of tax evasion by  some foreign firms in Korea are feared to escalate into  diplomatic squabbles as their home governments come to their  rescue showering the Seoul government with a barrage of protests.    The National Tax Administration has found out in its  year-long tax inspection that ICI Korea Co. of the United  Kingdom and six to seven other foreign firms doing business in  Korea has dodged large amounts of tax.    "The taxes dodged by ICI Korea, BASF Korea and Hoechst Korea  are especially large, running to the 10- to 20-billion-won level  each," a government official said on Sunday. Both BASF and  Hoechst are German firms.    The tax inspection was launched in February last year into  25  major foreign firms.    The official said the tax office will soon wind up the probe  and formally notify them of the amount of penalty taxes to be  collected.    The foreign firms involved react furiously against the tax  office's move, lodging protests with the government and  threatening, in some instances, to withdraw from Korea unless  the penalty taxes are withdrawn.    British Minister of State Alastair Goodlad called on Vice  Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong during his recent visit to Seoul  asking him to see to it that the penalty taxes on ICI Korea be  reassessed downward.    Germany and the Netherlands have filed letters of protests  to  the Foreign Ministry and tax administration against the penalty  taxes on their firms in Korea.    Besides, the head of the European Chamber of Commerce (ECC)  in Korea visited the Foreign Ministry to express protest. He  has gone so far as to flash a petition to the OECD (Organization  for Economic Cooperation and Development) headquarters at last  year end against the penalty taxes, a source said.    He suggested in the petition that South Korea has been  imposing undue taxes on foreign firms and should therefore be  kept from joining the OECD, the source said.    An ICI Korea official complained, "foreign trading firms are  supposed to pay tax only on commission fees they received on  foreign commodities imported. But, the Korean tax office is  trying to assess tax on the whole sales of imported goods."    He said his firm would have no choice but to seriously  consider pulling out of Korea if the huge penalty tax is  actually assessed.    South Korean officials say the foreign firms involved have  expressly dodged taxes in breach of the law of the land and also  international practices.    "Since these firms are fixed business concerns under the tax  law which directly marketed imported goods locally, they should  naturally pay taxes on their whole sales," a tax administration  official said.    He said that in light of tax laws both at home and abroad,  there is no problem at all in the collection of penalty tax  retroactive to five years before.    "It is proper for the tax administration to collect the  penalty taxes. This is a customary practice done in foreign  countries as well," a Foreign Ministry official said.</p>

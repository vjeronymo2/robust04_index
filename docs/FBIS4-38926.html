			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Etibar Mamedov Demands Apology"] </F>   [Text] "My return to the National Assembly will be  possible only after the authorities deliver to me an apology for  their insults. But if the parliament accepts my resignation,  the interests of the Party of National Independence of  Azerbaijan [PNIA] in the National Assembly will be represented  by two deputies--Shadman Guseynov and Firudin Dzhalilov," PNIA  leader Etibar Mamedov told journalists immediately after  relinquishing his deputy credentials and leaving the house of  parliament on 25 May. He stated at this session that the  monopolies that control Azerbaijan's oil industry were presently  not affording any opportunity for a contract to be signed with  the consortium of Western oil companies in the shortest time  frame.    With respect to establishment of the opposition National  Resistance Movement [NRM], E. Mamedov stated that this movement  was organized with a single aim--to prevent Russian troops from  coming into the republic. "Had President Geydar Aliyev announced  18 May the inadmissibility of this action, no one would have  created the NRM," the opposition leader noted. He also refuted  information to the effect that the NRM had called upon the army  and students to engage in civil disobedience. "Intransigence of  the opposition or of the authorities in Azerbaijan is today  intolerable," the parliamentarian stated.    Regarding the question of signing the Bishkek Protocol, E.  Mamedov noted that a unified point of view had not been  formulated among the structures of power. In particular, the  president and speaker of the parliament supported its adoption,  while the prime minister, minister of foreign affairs, and  deputy speaker categorically rejected such a possibility.  Etibar Mamedov stated that the return of 15 people's deputies  to the parliament was at their own initiative, since no one from  the leadership entered into negotiations or tried to reach  compromise with them. On the contrary, they were subject to  sharp criticism.</p>

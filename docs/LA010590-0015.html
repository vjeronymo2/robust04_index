			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOST COMMON TYPE OF BLOOD DANGEROUSLY LOW, BANK SAYS  </P> <P> The supply of O-positive blood is at half the minimum safety level, the San  Diego Blood Bank reported Thursday.  </P> <P> "Two traumatic accidents would be it for us," blood bank spokeswoman Stephani  Casenza said.  </P> <P> Based on daily demand, the safety level for O-positive, the most common blood  type, is a minimum of 250 pints, Casenza said.  </P> <P> As an example of how quickly the blood supply can be drained, Casenza cited the  case of a stagehand who was critically injured when a steel beam fell on him  after a rock concert in August.  </P> <P> His first operation required 100 pints of blood and blood components. He died,  but, during his hospitalization, he used more than 200 pints of blood and  components, Casenza said.  </P> <P> The blood bank supplies San Diego County's 27 non-military hospitals and  Imperial County, Casenza said, adding, "We need 300 volunteers a day to keep  the hospitals supplied."  </P> <P> Donations fluctuate daily, but "we have less than half the safety level now for  O-positive. We are experiencing a severe shortage of all blood types," she  said.  </P> <P> The blood bank makes an appeal to bolster supplies two to three times a year,  "but during the holiday season we have a real tough time keeping the blood  supplies up," Casenza said.  </P> <P> Starting in November, potential donors become both busier and sick more often.  At the same time, increased traffic and drinking-related accidents mean  increased demand for blood, Casenza said.  </P> <P> Historically, about 9% of the population in San Diego has donated all of the  blood supply, she said.  </P> <P> Donors can give blood at the San Diego Blood Bank's Hillcrest facility at 440  Upas St. Hours are 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays and 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.  weekends.  </P> <P> At the North County Donor Center, 1845 E. Valley Parkway in Escondido, hours  are 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays and 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> At the North Coastal Donor Center, 161 Thunder Drive, Suite 108 in Vista, hours  are 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., Wednesday through Friday and 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.  Tuesday and Saturday.  </P> <P> For the bloodmobile schedule, call 296-6393.  </P></p>

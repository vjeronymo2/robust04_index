			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / EC hopes for trade reforms accord this year ESSENTIAL elements of the Uruguay Round world trade reforms can still be agreed before the end of the year, according to EC officials. But they expect hard bargaining with Japan when across-the-board negotiations resume in Geneva next week. In Bonn, meanwhile, President Francois Mitterrand of France insisted yesterday he wanted a wide-ranging Gatt agreement on trade liberalisation as soon as possible, though he continued to reject the terms of the recent farm trade deal reached by negotiators from the US and the European Community. In spite of supportive words from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on the need for a viable agricultural sector, delivered after their Franco-German summit in Bonn, the two sides were still clearly divided on the farm trade element. A joint statement said Germany accepted that the US-EC compromise was possible to implement within the agreed reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. But France asserted: 'The results of Washington are not acceptable, because they are not compatible with the CAP.' EC officials in Brussels conceded it would not be possible, by the end of the year, to finalise details of liberalisation in 15 sectors of world trade being negotiated by the 108 participants in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). But by then, 'we will have to be able to say to heads of government that this negotiation is now going to be completed,' a senior EC negotiator added. Only now that the EC and US have settled their row over farm trade and farm subsidies can there be a start on wider Gatt negotiations about cutting tariffs by an average 30 per cent, opening up trade in services and amending the Uruguay Round draft 'final act', the official said. On tariff reduction in particular, 'we are really starting from scratch,' he added. He said Japan's proposals on tariffs were 'honourable on paper. . . but the way in which the (Japanese) system really works is not like that,' because of their dense networks of non-tariff protection of their market. 'Japan seems to avoid getting wet in every multilateral negotiation, but this time they're going to have to come on board,' the EC official said. 'We have to try to corner them this time on non-tariff barriers.' The EC itself wants more flexibility in the Gatt code restricting subsidies, and revisions in the Uru-guay Round chapters on intellectual property and dumping. But the official indicated the EC would be cautious on pressing its concerns, for fear of unravelling the Gatt package tied up so far and missing the deadline for overall agreement. The expiry of the US administration's 'fast track' authority in March - after which Congress could seek detailed amendments to a deal - means a political agreement must be in place by the end of this month. The danger of France attempting to veto a Gatt deal to defend its farm exports is being played down in Brussels. Paris is likely to reserve its position until a full Uruguay Round agreement is ready, unless it is cornered at next week's Edinburgh summit of Community leaders. The French government wants the European Commission to investigate whether the US-EC deal can be implemented without going beyond CAP reforms in terms of cuts in farm output and acreage. In Washington, meanwhile, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, formally announced she had cancelled the threat of punitive tariffs on EC food and wine exports following the farm trade accord reached by US and EC negotiators. The US had threatened to impose the tariffs from today. Tim Coone in Dublin adds: The Irish government yesterday appeared to be backing away from the EC-US agreement. Mr Joe Walsh, Irish agriculture minister, told farm leaders the agreement 'did go beyond what was contained in the CAP reform agreement, particularly in the case of beef'. He said the restraints on export volumes were a barrier to Irish acceptance.</p>

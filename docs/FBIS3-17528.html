			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 27 Mar -- Kazakhstan President Nursultan  Nazarbayev and his wife arrived in the capital of the Russian  Federation today. He arrived a day earlier than expected, but  his talks with Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin will  begin tomorrow, as previously agreed. The Kazakh chief of state  intends to prepare himself better for the official part of his  visit, and he will begin the appropriate consultations as soon  as he arrives in the Kremlin residence set aside for him.    On his way to Moscow, Nursultan Nazarbayev gave an exclusive  interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. He noted that  Kazakhstan and Russia are tied by stable links of friendship and  fraternity going back centuries. The president of Kazakhstan  said the key factors cementing these links are a common economy,  historical and cultural traditions, and a common mentality,  therefore nobody will ever manage to sow discord between our  peoples, "although such attempts have already been made and are  still being made by some irresponsible politicians."    As to the essence of the forthcoming talks, the Kazakh chief  of state said the main purpose of the meeting with Boris Yeltsin  is to remove the problems which have accumulated in relations  between the two countries. Experts have worked throughout the  year on ways of resolving many of them, and there is no doubt  that a mutual understanding will be found.    Nursultan Nazarbayev stressed in particular that he would  like matters to be conducted in such a way that there are never  any problems at all in the dialogue between Russia and  Kazakhstan. The two sides are fated, in the best sense of that  word, to be together always, therefore, the Kazakh president  said, how far that succeeds depends to a large extent upon the  situation in each of them individually and in the CIS as a whole.    The leader of Kazakhstan also said that the exchange of  opinions on the situation in the CIS and on ways to give the  Commonwealth a more concrete and effective content will occupy  an important place in his conversation with Boris Yeltsin.</p>

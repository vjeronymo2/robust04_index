			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREAT TO TORTOISE CANCELS 2 DESERT MOTORCYCLE RACES  </P> <P> The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, invoking for the first time federal  protections recently provided the desert tortoise, has canceled two off-road  vehicle races because of the potential threat they posed to the endangered  reptiles.  </P> <P> BLM officials said Friday that permits for the two motorcycle races, scheduled  for Sunday, were denied because biologists did not have time to evaluate their  impact on the tortoise and its habitat.  </P> <P> "We sympathize with the racers, but we also sympathize with the tortoise and we  have to follow the law," said Barbara Maxfield, a BLM spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Off-road vehicle enthusiasts, who predicted the Aug. 4 listing of the tortoise  as a federally endangered species would restrict their use of the desert,  decried the decision, with some predicting it could be an omen of things to  come.  </P> <P> "This is very unfortunate," said Ed Waldheim of the American Motorcycle Assn.  "These are controlled, totally authorized events on existing trails in areas  designated for what we do."  </P> <P> But Sierra Club activist Elden Hughes said: "Certain activities considered  normal in the past will, and should, be affected by the listing. If off-road  races destroy tortoises and tortoise burrows, then that's a no-no."  </P> <P> The races, expected to draw 300 riders apiece, were to be held in Johnson  Valley near Barstow and in the Spangler Hills near Ridgecrest. Both areas are  open to off-road vehicle use.  </P> <P> But under provisions of the "emergency" federal listing the tortoise now  enjoys, the BLM must consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service before  permitting races or other events that might harm the state's official reptile.  Maxfield said there was not time for biologists to conduct that review before  Sunday.  </P></p>

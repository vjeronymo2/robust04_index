			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Profit dive for non-ferrous metals THE NON-FERROUS metals industry put up its worst financial performance for 10 years in 1992, according to the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy group. 'If 1991's results were poor, those for 1992 verged on the disastrous,' it said. Its analysis showed net profits of 184 publicly-quoted corporations, after all taxes and charges, virtually disappeared last year, falling from Dollars 2.9bn in 1991 to only Dollars 38m. At 5.8 per cent, last year's aggregate return on capital employed by MMRS's sample of mineral producers was below 5.9 per cent of 1982 and the worst recorded in 16 years. Return on shareholders' equity, however, nil last year, was not quite as poor as the -0.1 per cent seen in 1982. Debt was also on the increase last year, and gearing, which had stood at 39.6 per cent in 1990 reached 43.7 per cent in 1992, the worst figure recorded by MMRS. Companies cut back on capital expenditure, which was reduced from 12.2 per cent of sales to 11.1 per cent, but spending on exploration and research and development remained at 2.1 per cent. MMRS pointed out that the bottom-line or net profits were badly affected by two new accounting standards widely adopted in the US last year: SFAS 109 (which relates to the calculation of deferred tax liabilities) and SFAS 106 (which states that balance sheets should show accrued liabilities for post-retirement benefits other than pensions). The standards virtually wiped out the industry's profits - MMRS's regional analysis shows that in the US aggregate net earnings of Dollars 546m in 1991 became net losses of Dollars 2.55bn last year. The research showed the industry's operating costs were kept under control in 1992 and fell from an aggregate Dollars 151bn to Dollars 148bn, even though production was rising.

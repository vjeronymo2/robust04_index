			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (19): Information at your fingertips - David Tebbutt examines the latest ways to access business data via the computer terminal TIMELY access to information can mean the difference between success and failure, or life and death. At one extreme, the recent failures in the ambulance service computer system in the UK show the serious consequences of information loss. At the other end of the scale, a businessman may want to find out as much as possible about a client before extending a line of credit. In a more leisurely age, a 48-hour wait for a photocopied document would not have made much difference to a business relationship. Nowadays, a 48-minute wait could result in the business going elsewhere. The computer could well be the cause of life speeding up to today's hectic levels. But it has also provided the tools to help cope with new demands placed upon us. Worldwide, direct-dial telephone networks have not only transformed our ability to make contact, they have enabled computers to talk to each other, too. Any information residing in any computer anywhere on this planet could, theoretically, be passed to any other. The only requirement is a connection into the ever-expanding international telecommunications web. Many companies around the world have recognised the value of the information they own and have made it available to computer systems and computer terminal users. These on-line information services present callers with menus on their computer screens from which they can call up information which interests them. You can, on a news clipping service, for example, ask for all mentions of IBM, in the computer press, in western Europe, in the last three weeks. On a financial data service, you might ask for IBM's financial results for the last five years, and details of company officers during that period. These on-line services are useful for both rapidly-changing and historical information. Compact discs, just like those used to play music, hold huge amounts of digital information. A dozen songs is about the equivalent of 600m characters of information. Not surprisingly, therefore, discs have been seen as another publishing opportunity. Historical and slow-moving information is well-suited to this medium, so a regular information-browser might find it cheaper to get a year's worth at one go on a single CD-ROM, rather than repeatedly use expensive on-line databases. Some statistical data, such as the UK's 1981 Census, will never change, so the CD-ROM publication is more like an interactive book. Some CD-ROM publishers produce cumulative discs every month - or every three months - leaving the user to go on-line for any data in the intervening periods. The problem with all these different sources of information is that each provider has its own access methods. But knowing how to use one database is no guarantee that you can use another. To overcome this problem, a number of companies have developed access systems which are consistent across different databases. Subscribers to Dialog, for example, can gain access to other providers' databases through the same interface. They may not, however, be able to use some of the more esoteric functions, when connected. Some software companies will develop systems which automate access to remote databases. They can be triggered by the addition of, for example, a new prospect record. If the customer was an individual looking for a loan, the computer system might check address details, current loans, county court judgments, employer details, and so on. A lot of vital information can be brought to the user's attention in this way. None of these information products and services is cheap, although a fifteen-month archive of The Independent at Pounds 299 sounds pretty good value. If access is required only infrequently, the best advice is to sign up for an umbrella service, such as Telecom Gold or Dialog, where payment is for connection time to the service. Heavier users might instead subscribe directly to the service and seek a discount on access charges. Other ways of keeping costs down are to go for a fixed-fee, unlimited access arrangement, to buy CD-ROMs or to get periodic downloads of information directly into hard disk drives. Another area of expense is the telephone line. For heavy users, a dedicated line direct to the information provider may be worth while. The trick is to be as clear as you can about your information requirements before looking for a service, and then to make sure that any deal can be changed, should requirements alter. If competitors are using on-line and CD-ROM services to improve performance of their core business, then others have no choice. If they are not using the services, or are using them unimaginatively, then this is an opportunity to get one jump ahead. The Online Business Sourcebook claims to be the only evaluative guide to online database information. It deals with the full range of businesses in one volume, including US data, although the emphasis is on UK and European services. The Sourcebook describes and evaluates a selection of 57 hosts and 779 electronic databases, including 130 on CD-ROM. It also indicates the most recent connect time costs for Costs of the most commonly used hosts - Dialog, FT Profile and PFDS - and others where known. Updated twice yearly, the Sourcebook is available from Headland Press, Cleveland, Tel 0429 231902. Headland also publishes a monthly newsletter, Online Business Information; Online Business Sourcebook: ISSN 0953-5055. User reports on database services appear on the following three pages.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina and EC move closer to fisheries deal ARGENTINA and the European Community have come closer to a fishing agreement, negotiators said after a third round of talks ended in Buenos Aires at the weekend. The two sides are negotiating an accord under which community vessels would be allowed to fish in Argentine waters, at present closed to foreign ships, in exchange for reduced tariffs on its exports to EC markets plus an aid and investment package. A community diplomat said the two sides had 'reached a substantial level of agreement on the text and both sides are looking at the text with a view to initialling it before the end of the year'. An Argentine official was more optimistic, saying it should be signed by the end of this month. Negotiators have been searching for a form of words that circumvents Argentine law banning foreign fishing vessels from its waters. The treaty is expected to allow EC vessels to operate in Argentine waters on a joint venture, charter or temporary lease basis. The difficulty is that flying the Argentine flag would force EC ships to submit to restrictive local regulations. Under previous accords EC ships sail under their national flags. Another delicate item involve Argentina's claim to the Falkland islands, which are held by Britain. The British have apparently won concessions that exclude the Falklands' waters from the accord and limit the quota of Illex squid available under the community accords. Argentina last month announced that it would compete with the islanders for the lucrative squid catch, at present monopolised by the Falklands.</p>

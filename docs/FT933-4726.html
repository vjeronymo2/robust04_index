			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Mercury steps up mobile phones battle THE CREATION of a mass consumer market for cellular phones came closer yesterday with the launch of Mercury's One-2-One network. One-2-One, the third national cellular network, offered free local calls in the evenings and at weekends as the centrepiece of an aggressive Pounds 10m campaign. The network is available only in the London area, but it is planned to cover most of the UK by early 1996. A joint venture between Cable and Wireless and US West, One-2-One is a high-capacity digital network. Lord Young, Cable and Wireless chairman, said the 'main target' of One-2-One was British Telecommunications. But with peak-rate tariffs and rental and handset prices several times higher than BT's, competition is likely to be felt most by the existing mobile operators, Vodafone and Cellnet. BT said One-2-One was not a replacement for fixed-line phones. Mr Ian Ash, BT's marketing director, said: 'Apart from a marketing ploy for cheap-rate local calls, every other call will cost markedly more than BT's' Mr Terry Barwick, Vodafone's director of corporate affairs, said the company would not react with further cuts. 'Competition has got to be seen to work. If we reacted, we could kill them.' One-2-One has spent about Pounds 150m on the first phase of its network, and expects to be profitable within four to five years. Its focus on the private consumer market is a new departure for the eight-year-old cellular industry, most of whose 1.7m customers are business users. Free off-peak local calls are available only on One-2-One's 'PersonalCall' tariff, after 7pm on weekdays or at weekends. A Pounds 20 connection fee and Pounds 12.50 monthly subscription are payable (excluding VAT). Calls before 7pm cost 25p a minute, off-peak national calls 10p. A separate business tariff has a higher monthly subscription (Pounds 20) and an 8p a minute charge for all off-peak calls, but a lower peak-rate charge of 16p a minute. Handsets for the new digital network are retailing at Pounds 250-Pounds 300. The City views One-2-One as a serious challenger in the cellular market. Mr Bryan Van Dussen, analyst at the Yankee Group, said: 'It changes the ball game entirely. Until now Cellnet and Vodafone have stressed their national coverage, but the special tariff changes play to Mercury's strength as a local operator.' Five years ago, the UK had fewer than 200,000 mobile subscribers. Analysts expect the number to rise to more than 6m by 2000. The Telecommunications Users Association said One-2-One marked 'a new era in mobile communications'.

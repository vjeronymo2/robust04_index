			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'WINNERS' GET A BIG SPIN, GO DIRECTLY TO JAIL  </P> <P> For more than 200 suspected and convicted felons, the offer proved irresistible  -- 100 free lottery tickets, with a chance to win as much as $50,000 in cash.  </P> <P> But what was billed as a marketing survey to evaluate the state's lottery games  was in reality a sting operation run by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department. The "Big-Play winners" ended up old-fashioned losers -- booked at  the sheriff's Lakewood jail over the last five days on outstanding warrants  charging them with everything from probation violation to manslaughter.  </P> <P> "A while back, we were talking over what sort of an operation to set up,"  Sheriff's Sgt. John F. Andrews said Friday, the final day of the sting. "We  decided, let's go with greed. It works every time."  </P> <P> So the officers -- frustrated thespians all -- set up a storefront operation in  Bellflower, complete with balloons bearing the logo of a fictitious lottery  game called "Big-Play," posters of "$50,000 winners" (actually pictures of  undercover Sheriff's Department clerks), and lots of jolly "Southbay Marketing  Services" employees played by undercover deputies to welcome the "winners."  </P> <P> Even after being handcuffed, some of the stunned targets of the sting continued  to hope for good fortune.  </P> <P> "Some of them tell us they know they're under arrest, but they ask, 'Do I still  get my tickets?' " Deputy Bernadette Roberts recalled. "One gentleman, even as  he was being booked, still kept hoping he was on 'Candid Camera.' One woman  asked if we could send her winnings to Sybil Brand," the women's jail in East  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Luis Moreno, a 24-year-old Cambria resident wanted for failure to appear at his  scheduled arraignment on a drug-possession charge, was in many respects typical  of those invited to the tidy offices at 10042 Artesia Place during the five-day  sting.  </P> <P> Along with about 5,000 other Southern Californians wanted on outstanding  warrants, Moreno had received a letter in the mail a few weeks ago.  </P> <P> "Congratulations," the letter said. "You have been randomly selected by  computer as a WINNER! Your guaranteed prize includes 100 FREE lottery tickets.  Of course, this means ASH$ for you, and a chance to spin your way to a fortune.  . . . Simply call our Hotline at 1 (800) 468-PLAY as soon as possible."  </P> <P> More than 500 answered the letter. "We even got a call from a guy in prison in  Susanville," Sheriff's Sgt. Paul Scauzillo said. "He said he wasn't getting out  until Aug. 6. He wondered if he could come in then."  </P> <P> Moreno, too, called the number and agreed to come by 9 a.m. Friday.  </P> <P> Like about half of those who made appointments, Moreno showed up as promised,  to be greeted at the door by a group of friendly "Southbay employees." They  shook his hand, offered him some coffee and cookies and gave him a chair to sit  in while they checked his identification to make sure he was the right Luis  Moreno.  </P> <P> "We've had a lot of people who have tried to scam us," Scauzillo said. "They  walk in and try to pretend they're someone who's gotten one of the invitations.  We have to send them away."  </P> <P> While the deputies checked, Moreno rubbed elbows happily with a mob of news  reporters and photographers, all invited by the Sheriff's Department to watch  the sting. Like the other "winners," Moreno was told that the news media were  there to record his good fortune. The newspeople played along with the game.  </P> <P> A couple of deputies posing as winners wandered out the front door, receiving  the good wishes of all those gathered. Then a beaming Scauzillo burst noisily  into the room.  </P> <P> "Congratulations!" he shouted. "Luis, you're a winner!"  </P> <P> Offered a choice of Dodger or Angel tickets -- "good seats, for Saturday's  game, you'll be driven there in a limo" -- Moreno chose the Dodgers. If he knew  the Angels would be out of town, he never said anything.  </P> <P> And then, to a mounting crescendo of applause from an unseen audience in a room  at the rear of the building, Moreno was led around a screen and into the hands  of the law.  </P> <P> In the back room, to his chagrin, he discovered that the people who'd been  clapping and cheering were uniformed deputies. Instead of lottery and baseball  tickets, he got a set of plastic handcuffs and a booking slip.  </P> <P> Moreno seemed bewildered. Asked if he knew what was going on, he said he wasn't  sure.  </P> <P> Deputy Bob Mallon said that while most of those arrested glumly accepted their  fate, some tried to rationalize.  </P> <P> "A handful said they knew it was a sting operation all along," Mallon said. "So  why did they show up?"  </P> <P> By nightfall Friday, about 250 people had been suckered in by the scam, with  roughly 90% of them booked on felony warrants and the rest on assorted  misdemeanor counts.  </P> <P> Most were cases involving the Sheriff's Department, but a few stemmed from  efforts by the Beverly Hills Police Department, which joined in after planning  a similar sting.  </P> <P> In recent years, many police departments devised stings to bring in fugitives  and collect evidence against those suspected of criminal behavior who otherwise  had been able to elude arrest. Despite persistent publicity about these stings,  law enforcement officers say they remain effective. In the case of those  rounded up this week, deputies did not know the whereabouts of the fugitives  but generally were able to find addresses of a relative. They sent the  invitations to these addresses in hope that -- because of their appeal -- the  mail would be forwarded.  </P> <P> Deputies also consider stings relatively safe for all involved.  </P> <P> "It's a shotgun approach," Andrews admitted. "But it's economical, and no one  was injured -- no officers, no suspects. We consider it a success."  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department emphasized that the sting was not officially connected  to the California Lottery and said it had been cleared with lottery security  personnel before it was undertaken. Lottery officials, while not encouraging  stings using lottery materials, said they always cooperate with law enforcement  agencies.  </P> <P> Despite its current lack of enthusiasm for such operations, the California  Lottery once conducted a sting of its own. In March, 1986, 16 people suspected  of submitting phony tickets were arrested after being lured to a bogus  "second-chance" drawing in Sacramento that purported to offer prizes ranging  from ocean cruises to cash.  </P> <P> Officials said the Sheriff's Department had run at least one similar operation  in the past.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> _Maintain range-wide distribution of habitat to facilitate recovery. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several qualitative criteria were considered when determining whether to select specific areas as potential critical habitat. The following discussion describes the criteria and provides an explanation of their use in selecting specific areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Currently Suitable Habitat:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service concentrated on the existence of currently suitable Mexican spotted owl forested habitat (primarily nesting and roosting, but also foraging) that contains one or more of the primary constituent elements. The Service evaluated the quality of existing habitat based on available habitat maps and delineated the best available habitat (i.e., the least fragmented, most contiguous forest habitat) in the critical habitat units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Large Contiguous Blocks of Habitat:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service identified, where available, large, contiguous blocks of habitat or areas that mostly consist of Mexican spotted owl habitat. Areas were selected so that critical habitat units would include as little low-quality habitat as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dispersal Distances:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The widely-spaced nature of most Mexican spotted owl territory clusters generally determined the distances between proposed critical habitat units. However, where a unit was developed to provide additional unoccupied habitat to enhance the probability of cluster persistence, units were oriented to minimize inter-unit distances and facilitate potential dispersal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Occupied Habitat:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In evaluating potential critical habitat units, the Service gave primary consideration to habitat currently occupied by pairs or resident singles; however, some unoccupied areas were selected if they were important for other reasons (e.g., territory cluster contiguity and linkage). The Service may designate unoccupied areas when such areas are essential for the conservation of the species (section 3(5)(A)(ii) of the Act). Some units were selected based on habitat suitability although no surveys had yet been conducted. All areas selected, however, have potential for supporting Mexican spotted owls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rangewide Distribution:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service is proposing critical habitat units throughout the existing United States range of the Mexican spotted owl to maintain genetic variation and cluster linkage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Special Management or Protection:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3(5)(A)(i)(II) of the Act defines critical habitat as areas ``which may require special management considerations or protection.'' The Service evaluated the need for special management in terms of the existing situation (e.g., current quality of existing habitat), the relative importance of territory clusters, or current management activities, and threats. For example, the Fort Apache Indian Reservation is managed under an uneven-age timber harvest prescription, unlike the even-age management cited as a threat to the Mexican spotted owl. The White Mountain Apache Tribe has developed a conservation strategy that the Service believes will adequately protect the Mexican spotted owl on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. Thus, the Service has determined that additional special management consideration or protection is not needed, and the area is not proposed as critical habitat. All other areas selected are included in this proposal because of their need for special management or protection. However, the Forest Service and other Indian tribes have begun work with the Service to develop and implement conservation agreements or management plans to conduct timber harvests while providing adequate protection to the owl and its habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Service evaluated the adequacy of existing protection under the Act to determine whether critical habitat would provide a necessary incremental benefit to the species. For example, significant protection already exists under section 7 of the Act, such as the prohibition of jeopardy to the species, the minimization of project impacts through mandatory reasonable and prudent measures to minimize incidental take, etc. The Service considers commercial timber harvest to be the primary threat to the Mexican spotted owl, and thus identified areas (proposed critical habitat units) where commercial timber harvest is planned or authorized. In those areas, the designation of critical habitat can provide protection above the current protection under the Act by protecting unoccupied habitat. It is important to note, however, that other areas are essential to the species' recovery, and their exclusion from proposed critical habitat designation does not imply otherwise. Although other threats to Mexican spotted owls have been mentioned, such as oil and gas leasing, grazing, recreation, etc., the Service has been unable to find evidence that these threats are significant to the Mexican spotted owl population as a whole. Rather, these activities are best dealt with through section 7 consultation on the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service considered the existing legal status of areas (i.e., reserved areas such as wilderness or parks) and has not proposed reserved areas as critical habitat. In general, the current classification of wilderness areas and parks provides adequate protection against potential habitat-altering activities because they are primarily managed as natural ecosystems. These lands are often essential to the conservation of the species, as they provide important links and contain large areas of habitat in relatively pristine condition. However, these lands by themselves do not provide adequate habitat to support a viable range-wide Mexican spotted owl population. The Service considered their relative contribution to the Mexican spotted owl's conservation but generally did not include them in critical habitat because of their current classification unless they were inclusions within larger surrounding critical habitat units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Critical Habitat Designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has identified 112 proposed critical habitat units totaling 1,931,264 ha (4,770,223 acres) in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado. The approximate acreage of proposed critical habitat by land ownership is shown in Table 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Management Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Forest Practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Management direction for lands with Mexican spotted owl habitat varies within and between Tribal governments and Federal and State agencies. A management emphasis for timber production is in effect on much of Forest Service and tribally managed land. Some BLM Mexican spotted owl habitat is managed primarily for natural resources extraction, including timber, but is still available for wildlife and recreation. National Park Service lands are managed for recreation and preservation of natural values. State lands within owl habitat are typically checkerboarded with Federal lands and are usually not large enough to support owl territories of their own. State lands are managed with similar resource management emphases as BLM land. Management emphasis on private lands providing Mexican spotted owl habitat is unknown.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

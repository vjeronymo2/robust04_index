			<p>BFN     [Text] The government, which is pushing for a North-South  summit at an early date, had a cool reaction to the remarks of  Mrs. Mutsuko Miki, wife of former Japanese Prime Minister Miki,  on North Korean President Kim Il-song expressing the hope for a  North-South summit on 15 August. This is because President Kim  Il-song's remarks conveyed by Mrs. Miki are not an official  response to our side's proposal made on 20 June, even if his  remarks are true, and because 15 August is not an early date, as  President Kim conveyed to Carter.    This being the case, the government, paying no attention to  this for the moment, has begun to work out concrete plans for  realizing a North-South summit at an early date.    Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of  unification, met this morning with Chong Chong-uk, senior  presidential secretary for security and diplomatic affairs, and  shared the view that the government should strive to realize a  North-South summit by mid-July.    Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku then discussed measures for  the convocation of the summit with Song Yong-tae, vice  unification minister; and Chong Si-song, director of the  secretariat for North-South talks. They came to a conclusion  that the North Korean attitude of continuing to slander the  South without responding to our side's proposal makes us doubt  its true intention. However, our side should not necessarily  regard this as a pessimistic signal.    A relevant government official pointed out that considering  past practice, it is very likely that North Korea will make a  counterproposal and suggest a later date than the one we  proposed. This notwithstanding, if North Korea does not attempt  to drag on the issue of agenda items during a preliminary  contact, the convocation of talks before mid-July would not be  difficult.    This official also noted that either Seoul or Pyongyang  could  possibly be the venue for the talks rather than Panmunjom or a  third country. However, even if the North Korean side wants to  designate a third place within the Korean peninsula, this will  not work as a factor that would drag on time.</p>

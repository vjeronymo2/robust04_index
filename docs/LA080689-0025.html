			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARS  </P> <P> Regarding "Selling Mars," by Kathryn Phillips (June 25): Louis Friedman's  response to the argument that the moon, not Mars, should be the next goal of  our manned space program -- that the moon "bores the public" -- points out the  inherent risk of his focusing solely on a trip to Mars. What's to keep the same  public boredom from settling over a Mars mission? Witness the Apollo era:  Despite the fact that it included some of the most dramatic moments in the  history of mankind, it faded to an obscure close after the initial goal --  traveling to the moon -- had been met and the public's attention moved on to  other things.  </P> <P> Were it not for the space race, Apollo could have been structured as a series  of challenges that linked together to form an ongoing plan for the future. Each  element could have left behind an infrastructure of launch vehicles, orbital  platforms, industrial facilities and scientific outposts that could remain  useful and continue to grow once the symbolic "goal" had been met.  </P> <P> We shouldn't repeat the same mistake. Let's go to Mars, but let's make sure we  leave something behind for when we return.  </P> <P> DAN MOLITOR  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Held at least one public hearing to obtain the views of citizens on community development and housing needs; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Prepared its application in accordance with &sect;570.704(a)(1)(iv) and made the application available to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) It is following a detailed citizen participation plan which meets the requirements described in &sect;570.704(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The public entity will affirmatively further fair housing, and the guaranteed loan funds will be administered in compliance with:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;3619).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) (A) (For entitlement public entities only.) In the aggregate, at least 70 percent of all CDBG funds, as defined at &sect;570.3, to be expended during the one, two, or three consecutive years specified by the public entity for its CDBG program will be for activities which benefit low and moderate income persons, as described in criteria at &sect;570.208(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) (For nonentitlement public entities eligible under subpart F of this part only.) It will comply with primary and national objectives requirements, as applicable under subpart F of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) It will comply with the requirements governing displacement, relocation, real property acquisition, and the replacement of low and moderate income housing described in &sect;570.488 or &sect;570.606.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) It will comply with the requirements of &sect;570.200(c)(2) with regard to the use of special assessments to recover the capital costs of activities assisted with guaranteed loan funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ix) (Where applicable, the public entity may also include the following additional certification.) It lacks sufficient resources from funds provided under this subpart or program income to allow it to comply with the provisions of &sect;570.200(c)(2), and it must therefore assess properties owned and occupied by moderate income persons, to recover the guaranteed loan funded portion of the capital cost without paying such assessments in their behalf from guaranteed loan funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (x) It will comply with the other provisions of the Act and with other applicable laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) In the case of an application submitted by a State-assisted public entity, certifications by the State that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) It agrees to make the pledge of grants required under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;570.705(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) It possesses the legal authority to make such pledge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) At least 70 percent of the aggregate use of CDBG grant funds received by the State, guaranteed loan funds, and program income during the one, two, or three consecutive years specified by the State for its CDBG program will be for activities that benefit low and moderate income persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) It agrees to assume the responsibilities described in &sect;570.710.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD review and approval of applications.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) HUD will normally accept the certifications submitted with the application. HUD may, however, consider relevant information which challenges the certifications and require additional information or assurances from the public entity or State as warranted by such information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The HUD Office shall review the application for compliance with requirements specified in this subpart and forward the application together with its recommendation for approval or disapproval of the requested loan guarantee to HUD Headquarters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) HUD may disapprove an application, or may approve loan guarantee assistance for an amount less than requested, for any of the following reasons:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) HUD determines that the guarantee constitutes an unacceptable financial risk. Factors that will be considered in assessing financial risk shall include, but not be limited to, the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The length of the proposed repayment period;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The ratio of expected annual debt service requirements to expected annual grant amount;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

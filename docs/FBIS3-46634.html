			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["DAIYAMONDO Report" article by Susumu Saito, representative </F> director of Sankyoku Economic Research Institute: "Tokyo Stocks  Plunge! Government Should Do Its Utmost To Avoid Worldwide  Financial Uncertainty"]    [Text] Indicators, one after another, are showing a further  decline of the level of Japan's economic activities.    Among them, the Industrial Production Index [IPI] decreased  5.1 percent in October over the previous month, the worst rate  of decline in 40 years since the index has been taken. Based on  the forecast indexes for November and December issued by the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], the  seasonally adjusted index for the October-December period in  1993 declined 3.1 percent from the previous quarter's [the  July-September period's] 91.7, down 13.0 percent to 88.9 (1990 =  100) in terms of annual rate.    After the index hit 92.7 in the October-December 1992  period,  it reached 93.1 in the January-March 1993 period which is a  temporary increase of 0.4 percent from the previous period, but  then dropped 1.5 percent to 91.7 in the second quarter.    The forecast mentioned above for the production level in the  October-December period in 1993 is 4.1 percent lower than the  corresponding period of last year which was considered to be the  bottom. As far as the IPI is concerned, the current state of  economic activities can be described as "double dip" in terms of  both "level" and "trend." Now the actual statistics can be said  to start supporting this writer's warning that the economy in  the latter half of 1993 is in extreme danger, which was made  through this magazine in mid-June, a half year ago. Besides,  there is still no guarantee that the economy will stop to  deteriorate any further. .  <H5>  Effective Demand Policy Is Effective </H5>   The IPI trend has been on the decline for three years since  its peak 102.7 in the January-March 1991 period, and the index  may fall 13.4 percent in the October-December 1993 period.  Compared to the index's decline at the time of the first oil  crisis of 1973, which continued for nearly a year and a half,  the current decline in production has already lasted two times  longer.    Behind this strong contractionary pressure is the financial  system malfunction caused by the steep fall in the value of  assets such as stocks and real estate since early 1990. It not  only acted as a sudden break on the expansion of private  investment (plant and equipment investment plus investment in  housing) but also worked to largely push down the level of  private investment. The amount of private investment decreased  sharply from its peak in the January-March 1991 period to the  April-June 1993 period, approximately 13.6 trillion yen in  accumulation. The steep reduction in investment will cause a  contraction in production and income with a time lag.    However, the private sector is not the only one which makes  investments. The increase and decrease in public investment by  the government also causes fluctuations in production and  income, as private investment does. In the same period when the  above-mentioned private investment was declining steeply, public  investment, due to the implementation of an economic stimulus  package, indeed increased to about 10.4 trillion yen.  Nevertheless, the increase of seemingly extremely large-scale  public investment was still not enough to complement the amount  of private investment decrease. The fact is that the gross  investment, private and public investments combined, declined  approximately 3.2 trillion yen during the same period mentioned  above.    Private investment, like plant and equipment investment, can  be considered to have a larger multiplying effect on expanding  income than public investment. However, even if the multiplying  effects of private and public investment were regarded as the  same for the simplicity of discussion, there is no wonder about  the continuation of a negative growth trend in which the level  of production and income had a tendency to decline for the last  two years when the total amount of investment had decreased over  a long period of time.    It is clear from this observation that a further and rapid  expansion of public investment which does not conform to the  norm of so-called "economic measures" of the postwar period was  necessary to increase production and income by expanding the  gross investment during the private investment's decline. In  other words, we should think that the Japanese economy, affected  seriously by the decrease in private investment, would have been  in a more serious situation than it is now if the  above-mentioned public investment of about 10.4 trillion yen  were not made. Those who might simply claim that the Keynesian  effective demand policy has lost its validity should give enough  thought to this point.  <H3>  Why Is the Emergency Economic Stimulus Package  Unsatisfactory? </H3>   An immediate problem related to the sudden fall of stock  prices this fall is that there was the risk that the gross  investment may decline by about 6.3 trillion yen in accumulation  within fiscal 1993, even if business managers' own plans for  plant and equipment investment and the trend for a possible  public investment were taken into consideration.    Considering the risk of this sharp reduction in the gross  investment, it can be easily understood that the Hosokawa  cabinet's emergency economic stimulus package totaling  approximately 6.15 trillion yen announced on 17 September was  truly not enough to avoid the risk of further economic slump due  to the gross investment's decline. Not all of the emergency  pump-priming package's money lead to the increase in public  investment but most of it was just a loan plan taking over the  role of private financial institutions.    With the Hosokawa cabinet's emergency economic stimulus  package alone, not only the present decline in gross investment  cannot be stopped [but also there are some other problems].  Under the situation in which plant and equipment investment  might see a further decrease in the next fiscal year, a  prediction can be easily made that it is natural even if the  contractionary pressure on production and income, caused by the  decline in gross investment due to the insufficient increase of  public investment, continues throughout fiscal 1994, when the  time lag between the changes in investment and the changes in  production and income is taken into consideration.    It can be naturally expected under such circumstances that  there is the risk that corporate earnings may continue to  decline in fiscal 1994 from fiscal 1993. In early fall this  year, the prospective price-earnings ratio for the 225 listed  issues in the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange [TSE]  reached an unstable stage of around 90 times. To stabilize  stock prices by reducing the price-earnings ratio in such a  situation, the lowering of interest rates was required as a  matter of course, but it was more important to be able to expect  an increase in corporate earnings as the expansion of the  economy raises the sales of companies. However, such was  impossible under the emergency economic package that actually  came out. The only way left was the downward adjustment of  stock prices. The steep fall of stock prices can be said to be  inevitable. The release of private corporations' worsening  mid-term earnings reports in September and the listing of East  Japan Railway Co. stock in the TSE were just triggers.    In addition, what made the situation more serious was the  confused discussion of short-term economic stimulus measures and  policies that may increase the economic efficiency in the  long-term, such as deregulation, and measures to pass on the  exchange rate profits to consumers. It is only natural if such  governmental confusion were criticized as it created an illusion  that new corporations will be established immediately and  employment opportunities will increase once deregulation is  promoted, and therefore played a role in neglecting the  discussion of demand management to prevent the economy's "double  dip"  <H5>  Risk for Worldwide Simultaneous Low Stock Prices </H5>   The Nikkei average declined steeply since it marked a  recovery high of 21,448 on 13 September. Nevertheless, the  prospective price-earnings ratio for 225 issues listed in the  first section of the TSE has still been around 80 times lately.  Because of this, Japanese stock prices appear to be  significantly higher to the eyes of the cool-headed investors in  the light of Japan's profit and interest rate levels.    While a strong potential downward pressure is still being  applied on Japanese stock prices, the fact that Western stock  price levels have become abnormally high in light of Western  investment standards -- New York's prospective price-earnings  ratio increasing from 25 to 30 times, for example -- is  complicating the situation. As it is now reported in Japan,  even companies which are not suited for a stable long-term  investment are disclosing their stocks at the over-the-counter  market in New York. This kind of speculation in stocks can be  collapsed anytime, triggered by a slight increase in interest  rates. Such signs [to indicate the market is on the verge of a  crash] have been emerging rapidly since this fall.    Prior to the heavy fall of New York stock prices in October  1929, Joseph Kennedy, father of the late President Kennedy,  realized that the collapse of stock prices was approaching when  he saw that even a shoeshine boy was absorbed in playing the  stock market, and he was able to save himself from the stock  price fall by selling all of his holdings.    If the announcement of a concrete additional economic  stimulus package is delayed due to the confusion and delay of  the political reform debate in the Diet, then it can be easily  expected that the potential downward pressure on Japanese stock  prices will become more tangible. If it happens to trigger New  York stock prices to plunge at once, it could rebound to the  Japanese stock prices, initiating a vicious cycle. In that  case, it will be extremely difficult for the policy-making  authorities to stop the steep fall of Japanese stock prices.    Based on the steep decline of stock prices since late  October  this year, the 225-issue Nikkei average around 12,000, which is  said to wipe out the stocks' latent profits of most of the  Japanese banks, is within hailing distance. There is no wonder  if the failure of a bank which carries a huge amount of bad  loans comes to the surface. Without the help of the central  bank as "the last lender," the situation might cause a loss of  confidence in the financial system itself.    Banks which have virtually fallen into liability excesses  by the increase of bad loans due to the fall of stock prices  will not be able to raise funds from the short-term money  market. If there is not enough supply of liquidity from the  central bank, banks will be required to sell more of their  securities, whose liquidity is high, at markets both at home and  abroad. That will cause further turbulence in the capital  market both at home and abroad, and the fall in asset prices  will suffocate the banks, producing a vicious cycle. Because of  the depletion in asset prices, it will be difficult for the  banks to meet the demand for private corporations' operating  funds as the end of fiscal 1993 nears. Settlement accidents  resulting from a bank failure in Japan have a great risk of  immediately expanding to a worldwide financial uncertainty  through the international chain of credit.    If the decline in asset values, like stock prices, etc.,  cannot be stopped because of a delay in financial measures, the  bank failure scenario will no longer be unreal.    The government and financial authorities are required to  fully inspect the contingency plan, including unlimited special  lending measures, and to reconfirm the utmost level of political  leadership to carry out the plan to avoid the risk that a  domestic bank crisis, which may occur frequently at the same  time, may lead to a worldwide financial uncertainty.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEVERLY HILLS CHAMBER CHALLENGED;  </P> <P> MERCHANT PETITIONS SEEK MORE POWER FOR SMALL BUSINESSES  </P> <P> Members of two merchant groups have launched a petition campaign to eliminate  what they see as unfair domination of the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce by  large firms in the central business district.  </P> <P> At stake is control of the chamber, a 67-year-old organization that seeks  business for the city, promotes the city's image and plays an important role in  municipal planning.  </P> <P> "If the representatives of the large businesses keep voting themselves and  their close associates into the chamber directorship, they have no reason to  help us and we have no recourse for our grievances," said Russ Levi, a liquor  store owner on South Beverly Drive.  </P> <P> "Streets like Robertson that are not in the center Rodeo Drive-area of Beverly  Hills have gotten sort of forgotten and gotten sort of second-fiddle  treatment," said Tracey Lewis Darroll, secretary-treasurer of the Robertson  Boulevard Assn.  </P> <P> Levi, chairman of the South Beverly Drive Business Assn., said he sent a  petition to about 1,000 members of the Chamber of Commerce and to 450 civic  leaders last week.  </P> <P> Darroll said she plans to mail 5,000 copies of the appeal to business  operators, office tenants and property owners in the Robertson area next week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Votes  </P> <P> "When it came to light how the chamber is set up, it's not even possible for  smaller business people to have their concerns really looked after," she said.  "That's why we as the Robertson Boulevard Assn. joined in this protest."  </P> <P> The chamber is governed by a board of directors chosen at an election in which  organizations that pay more dues have more votes.  </P> <P> "It is a voting system that is very similar and adopted after the stock-market  model. If you buy shares of stock you get as many (votes) as you have shares,"  said Max Factor III, past president of the chamber.  </P> <P> The petitions call for limiting the number of votes of any one organization to  three and allowing votes by people and companies located outside the city that  belong to the Beverly Hills Chamber.  </P> <P> Factor said members pay dues according to different criteria, depending on  factors such as the number of employees in businesses such as hotels or  department stores, or the size of deposits in the case of banks and other  financial institutions.  </P> <P> Since the chamber promotes the city extensively across the country and around  the world, "the larger businesses pay more because they would benefit more from  that activity," Factor said. "The smaller businesses have lower dues so they  can participate on local issues."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Independent Voting  </P> <P> In any case, he said, there rarely is any block voting, because companies  generally assign their mandates to individual employees who cast their ballots  independently.  </P> <P> Factor said the Beverly Hills Chamber is awaiting responses from chambers of  commerce elsewhere in California that it has contacted to determine whether its  system is out of line with general practice.  </P> <P> Karl Schurz, president of the 1,800-member chamber, declined to comment on the  protest, saying: "I really don't think the story is newsworthy. I'm not going  to get in a verbal volleyball fight in the newspaper with anybody. I'm not  going to use the newspaper for an open forum with one or two people who are not  happy, and that's what it boils down to."  </P> <P> Ivan Elmer, director of small-business programs in the Office of Chamber of  Commerce Relations at the U. S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said fights  over control are not uncommon.  </P> <P> "I don't know that I could name a place where there wouldn't be disagreement,  because everybody would like a little more," he said. "The question is how you  deal with it."  </P> <P> The national chamber suggests in its model charter that individual firms get no  more than 10 votes each, but Elmer said the central business district of any  town will tend to dominate the Chamber of Commerce regardless of the voting  system.  </P> <P> "The aggregate voting power in your main retail district is going to be larger  than the other retail areas because of sheer numbers," he said. "That's what  you're seeing rather than a matter of big vs. small."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Less Prominence  </P> <P> To buttress their argument, Levi and Darroll said their areas have been  featured less prominently than the city's main business triangle in  chamber-sponsored promotions such as shopping maps and Christmas decorations.  </P> <P> The triangle is bounded by Wilshire Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard and  Rexford Drive.  </P> <P> Levi and Darroll also said that the chamber put little effort into winning more  city parking lots for areas outside the central business district and that it  disregarded them in its response to the city's recently proposed urban design  program.  </P> <P> "Every positive benefit that's been given to us has been through our own  activism, not through the chamber," Levi said.  </P> <P> But Factor said that South Beverly Drive and South Robertson Boulevard were  eventually included in the plans for the urban design project and that the  chamber is open to anyone in the city.  </P> <P> As for outside people and enterprises, Factor said "it makes no sense to allow  them to vote. They have business interests that are different than those of  Beverly Hills."  </P></p>

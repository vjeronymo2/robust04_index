			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INSURER TO CLOSE ORANGE OFFICE, LAY OFF 300  </P> <P> Citing excessive employee turnover as a result of Orange County's tight labor  market, Nationwide Insurance said Friday it has decided to close its Orange  office by late 1990 and eliminate 300 jobs.  </P> <P> The company will transfer the operation to Visalia in the Central Valley.  Employees will have to move or be laid off, officials said.  </P> <P> "High employee turnover rates make it difficult to maintain Nationwide's high  customer service standards," Vice President Bill Lee said. "The move to an area  with a more stable employment market will help us better serve policyholders."  </P> <P> Nationwide also announced that it will move its Northern California office from  Concord to Visalia in late 1991.  </P> <P> The company will keep a local sales staff in Orange County.  </P> <P> Nationwide Mutual -- the parent company of Nationwide Insurance -- is the  nation's fourth-largest auto insurer in the United States.  </P></p>

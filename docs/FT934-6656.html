			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Announcement on ITV ownership The ITV companies will find out at 8.30am today how the government proposes to change the industry's ownership rules. The expected liberalisation, which would allow some of the large ITV companies to take each other over, could lead to the launching of immediate bid battles. Carlton Communications, holder of the London weekday licence, is expected to bid for Central, the second largest company, in which it has a 20 per cent stake. Granada will move against either Central or London Weekend, in which it holds 20 per cent.</p>

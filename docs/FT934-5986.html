			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: EIB loans of Ecu516m for Portugal Portugal yesterday signed agreements with the European Investment Bank for eight loans totalling Ecu516m for transport, telecommunication and energy projects. The new loans raise EIB lending to Portugal this year to a total of Ecu1.5bn, up 20 per cent on lending in 1992. The loans represent 2.5 per cent of Portugal's gross domestic product. Portugal thus displaces Denmark as the biggest per capita beneficiary of EIB loans, receiving 9.5 per cent of the total EIB loan budget. The EIB plans to issue up to a further Es35bn in escudo-denominated Navigator Bonds this year to add to a previous three issues also totalling Es35bn.</p>

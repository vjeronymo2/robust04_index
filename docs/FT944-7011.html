			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / International Company News: Study starts into privatisation of French tobacco monopoly Credit Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, has been appointed to study the privatisation of Seita, the state tobacco monopoly which manufactures Gauloises and Gitanes cigarettes. The economy ministry said that no decree had yet been issued for Seita's privatisation and that Credit Lyonnais would study the mechanisms and technicalities of a possible privatisation. Seita is one of 21 public sector companies slated for sale, or already sold, by the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur. Industry observers played down the prospect of a rapid sale. The French government has already netted more than FFr60bn (Dollars 11.2bn) this year from its privatisation programme, compared with a target of FFr55bn. Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget minister, indicated last week that no further privatisations would take place in 1994. The government is, however, in the midst of the privatisation process for Groupe Bull, the computer manufacturer. Last week, it invited offers from potential investors seeking to take stakes in the company. The government is also eager to launch the privatisation of Assurances Generales de France, but is awaiting improved stock market conditions. Seita, which makes matches as well as cigarettes, reported a first-half net profit of FFr254m and predicted a rise in full-year profits, compared with the FFr585m achieved in 1993.</p>

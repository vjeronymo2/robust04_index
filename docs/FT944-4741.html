			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television You can share two very different trips tonight. In Great Journeys (9.30pm BBC2) the young Scots timpanist Evelyn Glennie travels through Korea in search of the country's musical roots. The Korean paradox - an ancient culture combined with a booming economy and ruthless western modernisation - leaves her with the suspicion of a tourist-conscious heritage industry artificially kept alive and swamping the real thing (it sounds familiar). After noting Confucianism and Buddhism, Glennie decides that Shamanism, the worship of spirits, embodies the true Korea. We leave her on the seashore with a beautifully photographed Shaman ceremony and an interview with 'the Kiri Te Kanawa' of Korean opera, where a song can last 12 hours. Specialised perhaps, but Glennie's unself-conscious enthusiasm gives it integrity. Travelog (8.30pm Channel 4) is as synthetic as its title. A former stand-up comic goes mechanically through the motions; whether in Cyprus or Hungary the cliches come thick and fast.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / World Trade News: A North American storm in a cereal bowl The much trumpeted virtues of integrating the North American market and harmonising commercial systems in the US, Canada and Mexico are turning out to be unproven in one sector at least - agriculture. The US and Canada are again on the brink of trade war - this time over wheat - and Mexico has launched countervailing duty investigations against wheat sales by both its North American trading partners. The US-Canada dispute could reach boiling point this summer if President Bill Clinton decides to use his powers under Section 22, an obscure provision of the US Farm Act of 1933, to impose tariffs or quotas on Canadian wheat imports. If he acts, as recommended last week by Washington's International Trade Commission, Canada will almost certainly retaliate with restrictions on imports of a variety of US food and farm goods. What would be even worse for trade liberalisation, the US and Canada could settle their differences without sanctions by allowing each other to continue the protection of favoured farm sectors - say US grain for Canadian poultry, dairy and eggs. Trade analysts say this chaotic state of affairs in the continent's newly minted free trade area stems from state intrusion in agriculture and differences in the nature of that intrusion. What the three North American governments are doing is arguing over whose intrusion is the most damaging. The US pays loans and subsidies which support domestic prices and export subsidies which depress external prices. Canada has a Wheat Board, which operates like a monopoly, and transportation subsidies. Mexico, now the least protectionist of the three, pays income support to poor and medium-sized farmers and plans to phase the payments out over the next 15 years. President Clinton is not required to protect the US farm programme, except that he has political dues to pay to northern plains senators and congressmen. Once the ITC had given the administration its first legitimate cause to act, Senator Max Baucus of Montana and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota lost no time in reminding Mr Clinton that he had promised last November to assist US wheat growers. The impact of the dispute may be temporary. If, as expected, Congress approves legislation to implement the hard-won Uruguay Round trade agreement, trade barriers under Section 22 would become illegal. The Clinton administration has sought sanctions against Canada under Article 28 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but this would have to be approved by Congress. The House Ways and Means committee has already turned its thumbs down to the proposal. In the meantime, the dispute could give US agriculture officials muscle to negotiate reforms in Canada's grain marketing system. They want increased transparency in the Wheat Board's export pricing policies - in fact, they say the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement appears to require more transparency. And, they argue, while Canada does not employ export subsidies, the Wheat Board regularly undercuts the subsidised prices of their competitors. The amount of bluster coming from both sides in the wheat dispute is surprising given the relative insignificance of the size of the wheat trade between the two countries. Of the food-quality wheat that crossed the border, large quantities were shipped back into Canada as part of the Dollars 77m pasta trade. In fact, the flow of raw and processed agricultural products could, if left alone, form a model for the Clinton administration's vision of the integrated North American market. Grain trade analysts view the wheat from Canada flow as a temporary adjustment to a poor crop in the US last year, and expect the volume of Canadian exports to ease of their own accord as the US feedgrain crop normalises with this summer's harvest. The 'dispute' they say, should be viewed in the context of politics between Washington and the northern plains states and the complicated manoeuvrings that are occuring as the world's largest grain producers jostle for position in a post-Gatt world.</p>

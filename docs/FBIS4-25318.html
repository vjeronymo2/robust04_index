			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Willy Wo-lap Lam from the "Analysis" page: </F> "Superman Zhu Goes Back to the Future"]    [Text] Very strange things are happening to China's  economic policy. First we have Zhu Rongji's statement last  weekend that everything was shipshape: according to the script  of the czar-turned-superman, the growth and inflation rates will  both be contained within 10 per cent this year.    Then comes the intriguing article in Monday's edition of the  pro-Beijing Hong Kong daily, WEN WEI PO, that the Communist  Party's Central Committee would later this year hold a fourth  plenum to in effect rectify the pro-market resolution of the  third plenum of just six months ago.    A dialectical materialist, particularly a reformist one such  as Deng Xiaoping, would spot this contradiction: if everything  in the economy is in order, as Mr Zhu claims, it's time for  another leap forward in reform, not retrenchment, which seems to  be the theme of the fourth plenum.    Let us first examine the feel-good campaign that Mr Zhu and  his cohorts, including senior cadres in the State Economic and  Trade Commission (SETC) and the People's Bank of China (PBoC),  have waged since the spring.    While visiting Tokyo in March Japan's favourite Chinese  politician waxed eloquent about the success of China's price  reform. "Price reforms are necessary to shift towards a market  economy," Mr Zhu said. "Once price reforms are in place,  inflation should fall to around 10 per cent this year and six  per cent next year." He made even more sweeping assertions in  his meeting with a Hong Kong business delegation last week. The  vice-premier contended that state-owned enterprises had turned  the corner: profit levels of the dinosaurs leaped 40 per cent  in the first four months of the year.    SETC minister Wang Zhongyu Mr Zhu's troubleshooter,  astonished domestic and foreign economists by maintaining twice  recently that barely 10 per cent of China's state enterprises  had either stopped operations or were operating below capacity.  "If we analyse the situation with a practical mind, we will  discover that these (state-owned) enterprises are developing in  the right direction," he told an economic planning conference  late last month.    No less audacious was the claim by Mr Zhu's deputy at the  PBoC, Zhou Zhengqing, that "the reform of China's monetary and  financial system has been going on smoothly". This series of  morale-boosters does not seem to square with the facts. Let's  turn first to inflation, the scourge of the nation.    There is no solid evidence to show that the spirals have  been  depressed. The latest statistics show the year-on-year increase  in the national retail prices for April was 21.7 per cent, which  was only down a mere 0.7 percentage points from the comparable  figure for March.    Meanwhile, fixed-asset investment, a major contributor to  inflation, is tipped to exceed the government-fixed ceiling of  1,300 billion yuan by 15 per cent this year, which was itself 13  per cent more than the 1993 figure. By May, such outlays by 14  major provinces and cities had overshot the state limit by 60  billion yuan.    The claims by Mr Zhu and Mr Wang about state enterprises  going in the "right direction" contradict scores of reports by  government statisticians, the official media, and Western  diplomats and businessmen that the government-owned sector is  mired in distress.    In an unusually frank dispatch last week, the semi-official  China News Service reported that while addressing the economic  conclave, Mr Wang was confronted with official figures showing  that losses incurred by state firms had increased by 80 per cent  and that at least 45 per cent of them were dripping in red ink.    All that the SETC minister said was: "This is a  misunderstanding."    Western financiers have cast doubt on Mr Zhou's contention  about the success of monetary reform, the main thrust of which  is to depoliticise the banking system by predicating credit  policy on economic norms, not executive orders.    However, as senior economist Dong Fureng said last month, a  major factor holding back the commercialisation of banking is  that up to 40 per cent of loans are tied up by so-called  "triangular debts". In fact, it was Mr Zhu who, as PBoC  governor, gave personal orders early last month to prop up the  anaemic dinosaurs.    Apparently oblivious of the anti-inflation campaign, the  czar  asked bankers to continue lending to money-losing concerns --  "provided the funds are being used for the production of goods  that can be sold".    Largely taking the cue from Beijing, the banks boosted loans  by 75 billion yuan in the first four months of the year. The  big question: why the concerted effort to paint a rosy picture?    One explanation is that to better position themselves for  the  post-Deng power struggle, Mr Zhu and his followers cannot afford  to come across as losers. The second reason is also political.  The central government cannot withstand pressure from two of  the potentially most destabilising forces in society: state  entrepreneurs and the unemployed.    By giving the impression that inflation is coming down and  state enterprises are on the mend, Mr Zhu hopes he can defend  his anti-market policy of lifting the tight-money regime in  favour of the country's least efficient sector. That the  economy is not under control is evident from the disturbing  measures being taken to "boost macro-level adjustments and  controls".    Conspiracy theorists have already termed the forthcoming  fourth plenum as an anti-Deng schema. As the Wen Wei Po put it,  "The third plenum of the 14th Central Committee posited a  structural framework for a socialist market economy. What the  fourth plenum needs to tackle is new management problems for  such a new framework." Translation: the pro-market initiatives  of the third plenum, which bore Mr Deng's imprimatur, need to be  contained by the proverbial bird cage of centralised control.    Didn't the propagandists hail the third plenum's  15,000-character Resolution on the Socialist Market Economy as  the Magna Carta for liberalisation? Analysts say it is rare for  even a Communist Party to practise such radical revisionism so  soon after the fact.    Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua confirmed the conservative twist in  policy when he indicated on Friday [3 June] that price reform,  about which Mr Zhu boasted so wholeheartedly in Tokyo, would on  a de facto basis be put on hold. Speaking somewhat  contradictorily, Mr Zou pointed out that "there will be (state)  control of prices in the midst of opening them up".    The fear among China economists, however, is if Beijing's  lily-livered efforts at market reforms fail to accomplish what  Mr Zhu has claimed, neither will a return to the  tried-and-untrue formulae of the past.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Discount retailers forecast to grow DISCOUNT retailing will remain the fastest growing sector of UK retailing even when the recession is over, according to a report by Verdict, the retail research company, Neil Buckley writes. Verdict says discounting will be a significant force in food retailing and clothing and general-purpose stores. Experience in the US and Germany suggests the UK is ripe for expansion. In addition to growing price sensitivity among consumers, Verdict says the demand for price-led retailing is underpinned by the massive expansion in retail floorspace in the 1980s, which has left excess capacity in the 1990s.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Sumitomo Bank chief murdered A 54-year-old executive of one of Japan's largest banks was shot dead yesterday outside his home. Mr Kazufumi Hatanaka was the director of Sumitomo Bank's Nagoya branch. The murder was the latest in a series of attacks on employees of the bank and its related companies. Between February and May last year 22 incidents were reported, including firebomb attacks on the home of a bank vice-president and shootings at branches in Tokyo and Yokohama. The president of the bank, Mr Sotoo Tatsumi, received three threatening letters containing razor blades at his home in Kobe during the same period. Police said yesterday there was no immediate suspect or motive, but they are understood to be investigating possible links between the attacks and problems the bank has been having with alleged organised crime members. Sumitomo is trying to collect bad debts from customers to whom it extended large numbers of property-related loans in the late 1980s. Other companies have reported a sharp increase in attacks on their employees in the last year. A vice-president of Hanwa Bank was shot dead in August last year, and in February this year, an executive of Fuji Film Co was stabbed to death in front of his Tokyo home. Companies have paid large sums to gangs to prevent them from disrupting shareholders' meetings. Yesterday, Kirin Brewing Company was ordered to pay more than Y90m (Pounds 582,000) in penalty tax for concealing income of Y180m in an extortion scandal, understood to be related to gangster activity.</p>

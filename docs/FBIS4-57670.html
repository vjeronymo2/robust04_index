			<p>BFN     [Text] On 19 May, Haitian provisional President Emile  Jonassaint, not recognized by the international community,  announced his government is going to take sanctions against the  clandestine departures of boat people for Florida. Jonassaint,  who was speaking during a news conference at the National  Palace, explained that a decree dated 1980, punishing  clandestine departures from the national territory, was still in  force. Furthermore, the provisional president said a U.S.  invasion of Haiti would be a crime. What can we do against the  Americans, against the United States? They can reduce us to  ashes in one minute, Jonassaint exclaimed during a news  conference.    On the other hand, he announced that a Council of Ministers  meeting would be held on 20 May to take immediate measures to  provide food to the population after the total trade embargo  goes into effect at midnight on 21 May. Sanctions were taken  against Haiti in violation of the charters of the OAS and of the  United Nations, Jonassaint exclaimed. He stated with indignation  that he especially opposed the fact that during the vote of  those sanctions against Haiti, the UN Security Council was  presided over by the delegate from Nigeria, a country where a  terrible coup d'etat recently took place while the international  community said nothing.    Asked about the diplomatic isolation of the country, he  pointed out that Haiti has always been alone, ever since its  independence in 1804, recalling that even the countries Haiti  had helped -- several Latin American countries -- excluded the  black republic from the Panama Congress in 1825. In addition,  Jonassaint warned that if the resigning prime minister commits  an infraction, he will come under the provisions of the law.  Jonassaint referred to the call for civil disobedience launched  last week by interim Prime Minister Robert Malval.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / First-half surplus at record Dollars 60bn JAPAN'S efforts to curb its politically troublesome trade surplus brought little result in the first six months of the fiscal year, when the balance widened to a record Dollars 60.07bn (Pounds 39.7bn). The balance, for the six months to the end of September, is the highest for a six-month period and 15.2 per cent more than the surplus in the first half of last year, according to a preliminary finance ministry report yesterday. This is entirely due to the Japanese currency's rise in value against the dollar, since the surplus for the first six months actually declined by 2.3 per cent in yen terms. Nevertheless, the record dollar surplus is likely to add to strains in talks between the US and Tokyo on improving access for foreign companies to several Japanese market sectors. Within the total, the surplus last month rose by 5.4 per cent year-on-year to Dollars 12.73bn, the 33rd month in a row in which it has increased. In yen terms, however, the trade surplus declined in September for the second month in a row, to Y1,330bn (Pounds 8.1bn), down 11.2 per cent on September 1992. In an encouraging sign for an improvement in previously sluggish Japanese consumption, imports last month rose by 6.4 per cent to Dollars 20.79bn, spread across most sectors. Within this, imports of machinery grew 20.6 per cent, food 4 per cent and textiles 16.9 per cent, though imports of fuel fell 12.3 per cent. Import demand should increase, thanks to the impact of the government's economic stimulation packages, finance ministry officials predicted. The September imports rise brings the total for the six months to Dollars 121.7bn, or 5 per cent more than the same period last year. Exports rose faster by 8.2 per cent over the same period to Dollars 181.77bn. However, the outlook for domestic demand is uncertain, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry warned. Industrial production in August fell a revised 1.2 per cent from the previous month, against its original estimate of a 0.7 per cent fall, Miti said. Output would continue to be sluggish because of the uncertainty of demand and the slowness with which companies are expected to be able to reduce inventories.</p>

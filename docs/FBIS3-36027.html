			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Moscow in Russian to  Tajikistan at 1700 GMT on 1 February, in its "Radio Slavyanka"  program of the Russian Defense Ministry, broadcasts a new  feature entitled "About the Air Force of the Russian Federation"  presented by journalist Sergey Kozlov.    Today's program begins with a recording made yesterday by  Kozlov at the air force press center. He introduces the  recording by saying:    "The press center of the Air Force of the Russian Defense  Ministry is on the air. A methodological conference for  generals and officers has taken place at the main staff of the  air force. It was addressed by Air Force Colonel General Petr  Deynekin, commander in chief of the Russian Air Force. A  special section of his address was devoted to the tasks of the  Russian air force in 1994 and the prospects for its further  development. The main thing for the air force, its commander in  chief stressed, is to maintain battle readiness and security at  a level which guarantees fulfillment of the tasks of the Russian  Federation's military doctrine. The major task of the Russian  Air Force for 1994 is creating air force groups in  operational-strategic sectors which have become dangerous,  improving the combat, mobilization, operational, and  professional training of personnel and reducing the effective  combat and numerical strength to the set levels while  simultaneously achieving optimum ratios between combat and  support constituents in the structure of the air force.    "Russia's Air Force has been enlarged by a new air  component.  By decision of Russia's president and in accordance with the  order of the defense minister the frontline air force  [frontovaya aviatsiya] has been set up. The decision to set up  this component was made in line with Russia's new military  doctrine which was announced in November last year. The  frontline air force will consist of 70 percent of MiG-29 and  Su-27 combat aircraft and also several types of fighter-bombers  who now are part of the air force of Russia's Defense Ministry.  The frontline air force will be subordinated to the command  formed on the basis of the air force staff of the Moscow  military district. Air Force Lieutenant General Nikolay  Antoshkin has been appointed commander of the frontline air  force".</p>

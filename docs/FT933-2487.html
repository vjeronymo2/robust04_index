			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Tecs an aid of great value Sir, I write in defence of London Training and Enterprise Councils ('London Tecs ranked as worst performers', September 14). Over the past 18 months our small company has undertaken a training course part funded by Centec. The course, and particularly our tutor, Colin Barrow, have helped the company to grow in the most difficult of markets. As we embrace Investors in People, I encourage more businesses to avail themselves of the valuable services provided by the Tecs. Ray Jones, managing director, Centre Stage, Refuge House, Old Rectory Gardens, Wilmslow Road, Cheadle, Stockport, Cheshire SK8 1DA</p>

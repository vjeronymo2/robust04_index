			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> First, the Bank requests modification of the language in Section I(f). This section provides in relevant part that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The value of the assets of the Plans or the CIFs to be transferred in-kind  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and the net asset value of the Funds receiving those assets  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in exchange for shares is determined in a single valuation performed in the same manner and at the close of business on the same day, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 17a&hyph;7(b) (Rule 17a&hyph;7) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time or any successor rule, regulation, or similar pronouncement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (Emphasis added). In this regard, the Bank indicated that the valuation procedures described in Rule 17a&hyph;7 were used to value the CIF securities transferred to the Funds in the ``conversion'' transaction that occurred on November 12, 1993, for which retroactive relief has been requested. Further, in connection with the determination of the net asset value of the Funds' shares to be transferred to the CIFs in that transaction, the trustees of the HighMark Group (HighMark) decided to use Rule 17a&hyph;7 procedures to value certain securities held in the portfolios of the Funds in cases where those securities were the same as the securities being transferred to the Funds by the CIFs. However, it is represented that Rule 17a&hyph;7 procedures were not used to determine the value of other securities held in the Fund portfolios where those securities were not the same as those held by the CIFs. The values of such other Fund securities were instead determined pursuant to procedures permitted under the Investment Company Act and normally followed by HighMark in determining net asset value. The Bank maintains that it did not intend as a condition of the exemption that Rule 17a&hyph;7 valuation procedures be used to determine the value of all of the Fund's assets for purposes of ascertaining the number of shares to be issued in connection with a conversion. The Bank believes that the best approach is to require both parties to a conversion (e.g., a CIF and a Fund) to use the same procedures to value any securities that are held by both parties, but that compliance with the valuation requirements of Rule 17a&hyph;7 should be required only with respect to securities held by a party (such as a CIF) that is not a registered investment company. In the opinion of the Bank, this would provide assurance that assets transferred in a conversion transaction are priced appropriately without interfering with the procedures normally employed by a registered investment company in determining its net asset value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this regard, the Department believes that the most important consideration is that the value of the securities transferred by the Plan or the CIF into the Fund equal the value of the units of the Fund received in exchange for such securities by the Plan. Accordingly, we believe that the securities transferred must be valued under the same procedures by both the transferee and transferor entity (e.g. a CIF and a Fund). In response to the comment, the Department has reviewed its policies concerning valuation in these types of transactions and has decided to implement the following changes. The word, ``are,'' before the word, ``value,'' should be deleted and the language of Section I(e) amended to read as follows: ``The Plans or the CIFs receive shares of the Funds that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> have a total net asset  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> value equal in value to the assets of the Plans or the CIFs exchanged for such shares  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> on the date of transfer <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .'' (The New language is italicized).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department concurs with the applicant's request that Section I(f) be amended by deleting the phrase, ``and the net asset value of the Funds receiving those assets,'' from the language quoted above to provide that Rule 17a&hyph;7 procedures are required to value only assets being transferred to a Fund, and not the assets of the Fund itself. In this connection, the Department has amended the language of Section I(f) to read as follows: ``The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> current market  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> value of the assets of the Plans or the CIFs to be transferred in-kind in exchange for shares is determined in a single valuation performed in the same manner and at the close of business on the same day,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> using independent sources  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 17a&hyph;7(b) (Rule 17a&hyph;7) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time or any successor rule, regulation, or similar pronouncement,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and the procedures established by the Funds pursuant to Rule 17a&hyph;7 for the valuation of such assets. Such procedures must require that all securities for which a current market price cannot be obtained by reference to the last sale price for transactions reported on a recognized securities exchange or NASDAQ be valued based on an average of the highest current independent bid and lowest current independent offer, as of the close of business on the Friday preceding the weekend of the Plan or CIF transfers determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry from at least three sources that are broker-dealers or pricing services independent of the Bank.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (The new language is italicized).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bank in another comment requests a modification of the language of Section II(i) and the parallel language in Section II(m)(1) and Section III(i). The language in these sections requires the Bank to sell Fund shares within one business day after receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery, facsimile, or other available means of the Termination Form or any other written notice from the Second Fiduciary terminating its authorization of investments in the Fund. The language of these sections provides that if due to circumstances beyond the control of the Bank, the sale cannot be executed within one business day, the Bank shall have one additional business day to complete such sale. The Bank believes that the circumstances that may prevent the Bank from completing a sale within one business day (e.g., natural disaster) may, as a practical matter, also prevent completion of such sale by the second day. Accordingly, the Bank suggests that the language be amended to make clear that a prohibited transaction will not be considered to have occurred in such circumstances, if the Bank, due to circumstances that could not be reasonably foreseen by the Bank, is further prevented from completing the sale by the end of the additional business day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that the two business day requirement provides ample opportunity for the Bank to execute sales of shares in the Funds, even in the event circumstances arise which could not reasonably have been foreseen by the Bank. Accordingly, the Department does not believe that the modification proposed by the Bank would be in the interest of the Plans, and has determined not to revise the exemption in this manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bank also requested a clarification of the scope of relief provided by Section II of the proposed exemption. In this regard, the language of Section II, as published in the Notice, provides relief from ``the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (D) through (F) of the Code.'' The Bank believes that the reference to section 4975(c)(1)(D) is a typographical error and requests that the exemption be corrected to include relief from section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (F) of the Code in order to conform with the scope of relief provided to other applicants for substantially similar transactions. The Department concurs and has amended the exemption accordingly.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

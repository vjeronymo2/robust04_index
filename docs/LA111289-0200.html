			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WALL CRUMBLES;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV SUPPORTS E. GERMAN CHANGES;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: A CABLE TO PRESIDENT BUSH IS APPARENTLY THE SOVIET LEADER'S FIRST  PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE OPENING OF THE BORDER.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent President Bush an "informal message"  expressing support for the spiraling political changes taking place in East  Germany, the White House said Saturday.  </P> <P> In the message, sent by cable on Friday, Gorbachev "underscored the importance  of the changes taking place there and expressed the hope that the situation  will remain calm and peaceful," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater  said.  </P> <P> While other Soviet officials have offered support for the dramatic moves in  East Germany, the disclosure of the message to Bush was apparently the first  public demonstration of Gorbachev's backing since the East German government  opened its borders last Thursday.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said the President probably would respond to the Soviet leader with  his own encouragement of political and economic reform in East Germany this  week.  </P> <P> For 40 years, East Germany has been a key member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact  military alliance. It has been among Moscow's strongest supporters, both in  facing off against the West and in maintaining a tight rein on its citizens.  </P> <P> But until last week, East Germany had refused to follow the reform path taken  by Gorbachev, who reportedly encouraged the country's new leader, Egon Krenz,  to press for change.  </P> <P> In Moscow, Gennady I. Gerasimov, chief spokesman for the Soviet Foreign  Ministry, on Thursday welcomed the formation of a new Politburo and other East  German leadership changes announced the day before.  </P> <P> Gerasimov said the Soviet Union would accept a non-Communist government in East  Germany and in other East European countries as long as they remain members of  the Warsaw Pact. But he offered no comment on the opening of the East German  borders.  </P> <P> The Gorbachev cable, relayed to Bush in Dallas, came as the superpowers watched  the unfolding events in Eastern Europe, capped by the rush of East Berliners  across the Berlin Wall in the wake of East Germany's decision to abandon travel  and emigration restrictions.  </P> <P> "We're seeing a disintegration of that form of totalitarianism in Eastern  Europe," Bush said in an interview published Saturday.  </P> <P> "I hope it's a contagious disease and Castro catches it and Daniel Ortega  catches it and perhaps Gen. Noriega catches it," he said. Fidel Castro is the  leader of Cuba, Ortega is the president of Nicaragua and Manuel A. Noriega is  the military leader of Panama.  </P> <P> But, reflecting the continuing unease, uncertainty and amazement with which  senior U.S. policy-makers view the situation in Eastern and Central Europe,  Bush said the low-key U.S. response stems from a desire to "not contribute to  an unforeseen disorder."  </P> <P> "It is very difficult to predict with certainty what is going to happen," Bush  said, while repeating his view that the change "is real."  </P> <P> Bush said he has no plans to visit Berlin immediately after his meeting Dec.  2-3 with Gorbachev on U.S. and Soviet naval vessels in the Mediterranean Sea  near Malta. But he did not completely rule out such a dramatic journey.  </P> <P> Asked whether he would fly to Berlin after the Malta meeting, he replied:  </P> <P> "No, no -- unless there were something that developed between now and then that  would make the presence of the U.S. President catalytic for peace or for  evolution of democracy. But just to go there -- I would not do that."  </P> <P> Despite Gorbachev's efforts to free the Soviet economy from 70 years of rigid  state control, Bush said the reforms are not occurring at a pace that justifies  inviting the Soviet Union to join the annual summit conference of leading  industrial democracies.  </P> <P> But, he said, "Should the Soviets want to discuss how to improve their  economy," the United States would be willing to participate.  </P> <P> The text of Bush's interview, conducted Friday by reporters from four Texas  newspapers shortly after the President arrived in Dallas for an overnight  visit, was made available by the news organizations Saturday.  </P></p>

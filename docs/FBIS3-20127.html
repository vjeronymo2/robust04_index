			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 28 (AFP) -- Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur on Monday [28 March] suspended a controversial plan to  pay young people less than the minimum legal wage, government  spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said.    Balladur suspended the plan for a week at a meeting with  youth leaders on Monday.    Sarkozy said the government would organise a conference,  which he called "a youth states-general," to restore dialogue.    A ministerial committee consisting of Education Minister  Francois Bayrou, Higher Education Minister Francois Fillon and  Youth and Sports Minister Michele Alliot-Marie, would organise  the conference, Sarkozy said.    He also said that Michel Bon, director-general of the  national employment agency ANPE had been charged by Balladur to  set up "a job-seeking system" for youths.    A youth leader walked out of the meeting because Balladur  did  not withdraw the jobs plan completely.    Cecile Amar, of the high school students' federation FIDL,  said she also walked out because Balladur said he did not have  the authority to grant two other demands.    These were that court cases against student demonstrators be  dropped and two Algerians who were deported last week for  alleged theft and throwing stones at police during a rally in  Lyon, eastern France, be brought back.    Amar said a planned national demonstration next Thursday  would still go ahead.    Also in the youth delegation was Philippe Campinchi,  president of the pro-socialist UNEF-ID students union, and Bob  Injey, leader of the pro-communist UNEF. Ad hoc groups  coordinating the protest campaign in technical universities and  nationally were represented by Helene Joubert and Christophe  Hode.    Speaking on Sunday after claiming victory for his  conservative coalition in local elections, Balladur had pledged  to move "to re-establish dialogue" over his jobs plan, following  a month of sometimes violent protests by students and trade  unions.    Balladur said that the plan had only been a government  attempt to fight unemployment, but it had been "interpreted as  showing a lack of attention" towards young people.    "It is my responsibility and duty as head of the  government,"  he added, "to respond to this appeal from our young people."    Balladur said said it was "the duty of society to offer  young  people a future. And for this we should start by  re-establishing dialogue with them and examine the various  possible solutions."    With Balladur were Labour Minister Michel Giraud as well as  Sarkozy.    Under the jobs plan, aimed at reducing unemployment, young  people under 25 with diplomas or university degrees were to have  been paid 80 percent of an ordinary salary for 80 percent of  working time, the remaining time being spent on training.    Unqualified youths would be paid 20 percent less than the  minimum wage of 5,900 francs (1,000 dollars) a month. [passage  omitted]</p>

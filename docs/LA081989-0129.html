			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOHNSON SAYS TRADE WON'T AFFECT HOLDOUT  </P> <P> Damone Johnson said Friday night that an end to his holdout is nowhere in  sight, despite the Rams' trade for Detroit tight end Pat Carter earlier in the  day.  </P> <P> "I knew they were going to do something," said Johnson, speaking publicly for  the first time since starting his holdout. "I wish they would have done  something to get me in here. He (Carter) probably makes more than me right  now."  </P> <P> Carter was the Lions' second-round draft choice in 1988, the 32nd choice  overall and he signed a million-dollar package with Detroit. Johnson, who had a  career-high 42 receptions for the Rams last season, is holding out in an  attempt to renegotiate his $200,000 contract.  </P> <P> "I guess they don't need me now," Johnson said. "They've got this guy in there  now."  </P> <P> Johnson said he finds it curious that some in the organization have been more  critical of his holdout than the one staged by guard Tom Newberry nearly all of  last summer. Newberry's ultimately ended in a hefty renegotiation for the Pro  Bowl guard.  </P> <P> "It seems like a double standard," Johnson said.  </P> <P> Johnson said he doesn't know how long his holdout will last; perhaps as long as  he can afford it. Johnson is subject to a daily fine of $1,000.  </P> <P> "It's tough," he said. "I want to be out there, but I have to stand up for what  I believe in."  </P></p>

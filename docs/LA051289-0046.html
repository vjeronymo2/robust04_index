			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANNUAL MEETINGS;  </P> <P> MOBIL SHAREHOLDERS REJECT CALL TO END S. AFRICA SALES  </P> <P> Although Mobil recently decided to sell its operations in South Africa, some  stockholders at the company's annual meeting Thursday complained that it has  not done enough to sever ties with the white-ruled nation.  </P> <P> While they applauded the sales, representatives of religious groups and an  official of New York City's pension fund pressed unsuccessfully for resolutions  that would cut Mobil's indirect economic ties with South Africa and end sales  of its petroleum products there.  </P> <P> "If Mobil is pulling out of South Africa, then let it be a clean break," said  Kenneth Sylvester, director of Investment Responsibility for New York's office  of the comptroller.  </P> <P> Mobil announced two weeks ago that it was selling its South African unit to  General Mining Union Corp. for $150 million in cash, ending its role as the  largest U.S. employer in South Africa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tax Bite, Loss Cited  </P> <P> Mobil Chairman Allen Murray said a punitive U.S. tax law aimed at discouraging  investment in South Africa had resulted, in effect, in 72% taxation. The sale  will result in a book loss of $140 million.  </P> <P> Mobil had long contended that its continued presence in South Africa would do  more to combat apartheid than its leaving the country, and Murray voiced that  sentiment again Thursday.  </P> <P> "We remain proud of what Mobil people have accomplished in South Africa in  their contributions to economic and social programs for nonwhites," he said.  </P> <P> Murray recommended that stockholders vote against the resolutions proposed by  the activists, and his advice was largely heeded. Only 14.3% of Mobil's shares  were voted in support of a resolution to sever all economic ties with South  Africa, while 15.5% were voted to end all petroleum sales to South Africa's  government.  </P> <P> Pressed by the activists, Murray said Mobil's trademark could be used by  Gencorp for as long as five years.  </P> <P> The activists also said Mobil had broken a promise to consult with its local  workers before the sale of the unit was arranged. Murray said that the workers  will enjoy the same benefits Mobil had provided, and he added that Gencorp has  promised not to lay off anyone for at least one year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Personnel Arrangements  </P> <P> Mobil has a staff of about 2,800 in South Africa, all but two of whom will  remain there after the sale is completed in June.  </P> <P> "An honest exchange of disagreement," Barbara Aires of the Sisters of Charity  of Saint Elizabeth said after the meeting. She was one of a group who  repeatedly questioned Murray about the terms of the sale and about Mobil's  indirect ties with South Africa.  </P> <P> The activists said they were asking Mobil to do more because its earlier  announcement was so significant.  </P> <P> "It will set a precedent in terms of remaining indirect ties and in terms of  consultation with local workers about divestment," said Donna Katzin, speaking  for the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Company Remains  </P> <P> Caltex Petroleum Corp, a joint venture of Chevron and Texaco, is the sole  remaining U.S. oil company doing business in South Africa.  </P> <P> In Cape Town, Jock McKenzie, chairman of Caltex Oil SA, said his company had no  intention of leaving South Africa.  </P> <P> He dismissed speculation that Caltex would follow the lead of Mobil and noted  in a statement that motions calling for the withdrawal of Texaco and Chevron  were overwhelmingly defeated in recent annual meetings of both companies.  </P> <P> Since 1985, more than 170 U.S. companies have left South Africa under pressure  from anti-apartheid groups.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CRIME OF HATE IN LAGUNA HILLS;  </P> <P> DARK CLOUDS OF BIGOTRY CASTING THEIR SHADOWS OUT TO NEWEST SUBURBS  </P> <P> Some victims may take modest comfort in hearing crime prevention officers  explain that burglars usually have no quarrel with their targets and are  looking only for quick cash. But when a black man and his family returned to  their dream house in Laguna Hills last week, they found a racial epithet  spray-painted alongside the staircase, a chandelier hauled down on an antique  oak table and tens of thousands of dollars worth of other destruction. What  could be said to address their special sense of violation?  </P> <P> Racism and intolerance have no place anywhere, least of all at a family's  doorstep. But in Westminster two summers ago, a black family was awakened by a  burning cross on their front lawn, the consummate symbol of racial intolerance  in America. Southeast Asian immigrants have been victims of prejudice ever  since arriving on these shores after the Vietnam War. Amber Jefferson's face  was ripped open in August. Earlier this month, vandalism was committed in the  home of an Anaheim gay-rights activist.  </P> <P> So where are we today? Officials say they are worried that hate crimes are  spreading to the newest suburbs, like dark clouds shadowing the spread of the  suburban dream. Orange County has increasingly urbanized, and in the process  has been transformed from a virtually all-white enclave to a place with real  ethnic mix. But the Sheriff's Department says the break-in at the De Silva home  was the first hate crime it has investigated in the southern part of the  county. So last week's incident stood as a regrettable milestone on the police  blotter.  </P> <P> Tuesday, the county Human Relations Commission held a news conference with  religious and community leaders to deplore what had happened. Crimes that are  sparked by bigotry, like this one, can and should be prosecuted as felonies.  </P> <P> And the public must resolve to root out racism wherever it shows itself -- in  the workplace, the neighborhood or along a victimized family's stairwell in  Laguna Hills.  </P></p>

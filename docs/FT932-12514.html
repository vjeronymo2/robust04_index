			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / People: Jonathan Charkham to retire Jonathan Charkham, a leading authority on corporate governance both in this country and abroad, is retiring at the end of June from his position as adviser on industry to the governor of the Bank of England A barrister by training, 62-year-old Charkham had been at the Bank for twelve years. His first task was a secondment to set up ProNed, the organisation aiming to promote the role of non-executive directors. He returned in 1985 to take up his current assignment. A member of the Cadbury Committee, his international reputation was underscored last year when he became the only foreigner to sit on the US President's sub-council on Corporate Governance and Financial Markets. After the Bar, Charkham spent 15 years at the family firm Morris Charkham, before moving to Whitehall where he was later responsible for setting up the Public Appointments Unit, the central advisory body service in this field for civil servants. He has written a book 'Keeping Good Company' dealing with corporate governance in Germany, Japan, France, the US and UK, which is due to appear at the beginning of next year. Charkham is not being directly replaced within the Bank. Instead, director Pen Kent will become the senior point of contact with industry, with both the new governor, Eddie George, and the new deputy, Rupert Pennant-Rea, also taking a keen interest.</p>

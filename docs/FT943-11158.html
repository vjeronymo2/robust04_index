			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Underwriting fees The heated debate about underwriting, which has been fanned by the latest OFT investigation, is ultimately a battle between lenders and borrowers. The big City battalions are determined to protect pre-emption rights and their risk premium for lending capital. Besides, they can argue that the current underwriting structure guarantees that a company will always receive its money. That is an advantage not to be discarded lightly. Companies respond that a fixed commission of 2 per cent is hard to justify in any conditions approximating a free market. Yet the biggest disadvantage of the current underwriting structure is the required discount to market price - typically 15-20 per cent. That risk cushion is too plump for all but the most extreme circumstances. Companies pay different prices for capital in the debt market depending on their financial strength. Why should the same considerations not apply in the equity market? Option pricing methodology certainly suggests that the discount could be narrowed in the vast majority of cases. The net result is that UK companies pay a higher cost for equity capital than competitors in most other industrialised countries. It means that earnings growth is consequently slower, yields are higher and the total returns to shareholders are likely to be less. Fees earned for guaranteeing companies receive capital may be justified. But institutional investors - as well as companies - would ultimately benefit if they were prepared to support a narrower discount.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / A question of trust and security: John Plender on proceedings that threaten to expose gaps in the regulatory framework While the Goode Committee presses on with its review of pensions law after the Robert Maxwell scandal, important questions about the security of pension rights are about to be raised in a smaller but no less contentious case in the High Court. This follows the Securities and Investments Board's recent decision to issue a writ against trustees of the pension funds of the unquoted Midlands conglomerate, Melton Medes. The proceedings threaten to expose further inadequacies in the regulatory framework, together with highly controversial advice from a leading firm of lawyers. The story starts with the acquisition in 1986 by Melton Medes from Imperial Group of two paper mills, Robert Fletcher (Greenfield) and Robert Fletcher (Stoneclough). Immediately after the takeover the acquiring company declared a pension fund holiday and suspended contributions into the funds. The trustees, who included Mr Nathu Ram Puri, chairman of Melton Medes, and Mr James Philpotts, chief executive, then sanctioned a Pounds 4m loan from the two pension funds to the parent company at a rate of interest of only 2 per cent. This was subsequently increased to National Westminster Bank base rate. Yet the terms still appeared to fall short of a commercial rate for an unquoted company, which offered a second charge on less than prime property for security. The pension funds were valued at just over Pounds 18m at the time. When employees discovered that pension money had been diverted into a cheap loan to Mr Puri's company, they were understandably concerned about the potential conflict of interest and loss of income. They were even more concerned when the loan was repaid, but not in cash. The settlement of the debt came in the form of a transfer of shares from Melton Medes in two small quoted companies, Delaney Group and Marling Industries, where Mr Puri's companies had large stakes. In the case of Delaney, Mr Puri was chairman and controlling shareholder. Since shares in both companies have plunged, the pension funds have suffered losses as a result. And an investigation carried out by SIB has resulted in an allegation in SIB's writ in the High Court that the trustees failed to keep complete, accurate or proper records in relation to the Marling Industries transaction. Asked by the employees to look into the case, the Graphical Paper and Media Union took advice from counsel on the investments in these companies. Melton Medes' Mr Philpotts, meantime, consulted a leading pensions expert and partner of solicitors Nabarro Nathanson, Mr John Quarrell. In an extraordinarily frank letter, Quarrell offered reassurance, saying: 'My advice would be to wait until matters develop because quite frankly it is almost impossible to pursue a trustee for negligence when it comes to investment. Most of the recent trustee cases in this area beggar belief. Unless you happen to be an alleged extreme left-wing union type person (namely Arthur Scargill) then you really have to have your fingers in the till and it must be clearly shown that whilst they are in there they are purloining large amounts of money, before anyone can bring a likely successful action. Clearly, your situation and that which I have just outlined are light years apart. Nonetheless I suggest you wait and be cautious and not over perturbed by the fact that the particular trade union concerned has managed to collect enough money to go and see Patrick Howell, QC.' The assertion that anything short of large-scale robbery would leave the trustees safe from an action for negligence, while falling short of a direct incitement to breach of trust, nonetheless looks remarkable advice - especially to a trustee who was also an officer of the company that had already borrowed at uncommercial rates from the pension fund. Equally striking is the absence of any reference to the rules of the self-regulatory organisation, Imro, which had authorised the trustee company to carry on investment business. The rules constrain investment where the trustees also have a personal interest, as Mr Puri had with Marling and Delaney. When approached by the Financial Times to comment on the legal advice received by the trustees in relation to the controversial transaction, Mr James Philpotts referred the call to Melton Medes' solicitors, D J Freeman. Mr Marcus Rutherford, a partner in the firm, said that in the light of the court proceedings over the pension funds it would be inappropriate to comment. As a description of the effectiveness of trust law, Mr Quarrell's letter looks realistic, particularly in the light of a current high court action initiated by the Graphical Paper and Media Union on behalf of pension fund members. Having spent Pounds 250,000 of union funds on court proceedings, the union was unable to pay for the next stage of a breach of trust action. So seven employees asked the court to grant an order to release part of the pension fund surplus to allow them to pursue their case. They proposed to challenge the validity of the trust deeds, seek an inquiry into losses on the funds' investments in Marling and Delaney, and demand the appointment of independent trustees. In January Mr Justice Vinelott showed reluctance to grant the order. He was no doubt conscious that the costs for both sides were expected to run to Pounds 1 1/2 m. The total value of the Fletcher pension scheme assets, now merged into a single fund, was little more than Pounds 23m at the last balance sheet date. The judge was also reluctant to remove Messrs Puri and Philpotts from the board of trustees since this would have amounted to a finding of guilt before the alleged improprieties had been properly investigated. For the moment the court proceedings are in stalemate, following a failure to reach a compromise between the two sides. Meantime Mr Puri and Melton Medes have found a new way of transferring money out of the pension funds into the company. The Financial Times has established that property in Luton owned and occupied by subsidiaries of Melton Medes has been sold to the fund at a valuation carried out by a small London firm of chartered surveyors. A controversial aspect of the deal is that the tenant-subsidiary, Balmforth Engineering, made pre-tax losses of Pounds 184,000 in the last year for which accounts have been filed at Companies House. At June 30 1992, the property was included in the pension fund's balance sheet at Pounds 1.4m and accounted for 6 per cent of the assets. Significantly, property is exempt from the 5 per cent ceiling on self-investment introduced under the Social Security Act 1990. The result of this loophole is that the fortunes of present and future pensioners of the Fletcher fund have become even more closely enmeshed in those of Melton Medes, which has substantial borrowings, despite the attempts of the employees to establish proper independence from Mr Puri in the courts. To the layman, the issues in the case look clear cut. The trustees appear to have been involved in a straightforward conflict of interest over the grant of the original loan to Melton Medes. The return on the loan was uncommercial and the pension fund has had no compensation for this. The losses on shares in Marling and Delaney were also incurred in unusual circumstances which involved potential conflicts of interest. In the light of the history, the case for removing Messrs Puri and Philpotts, and giving exclusive control to an independent trustee, looks overwhelming. But that is the ethical, not the legal position. And for SIB, pursuing a separate action, the case is not clear cut. For a start, it only regulates investment activity, not the trustee function as such. And because the 1986 Financial Services Act had not come into effect when the original loan was made by the Fletcher funds to Melton Medes, it has jurisdiction only over events that took place after the Imro rules and SIB principles came into operation. SIB thus alleges that the share transactions whereby the loan was supposed to be repaid were in breach of Imro rules and in breach of its own regulatory principle of integrity and fair dealing. Its writ asks for an order requiring the defendants to return the shares in Marling and Delaney to Melton Medes. It then calls for them to restore the sum of Pounds 4m, together with interest, to the pension fund. The question is whether the courts will accept this slightly convoluted approach. Either way, the protracted and tortuous nature of the employees' case clearly demonstrates how the odds are stacked in favour of the employer against the employees where pension scheme assets are in question. And if the Goode Committee calls for the retention of the trust law framework for pension funds, it will have to come up with radical proposals on enforcement if it is to carry any conviction with those whose pensions are threatened.</p>

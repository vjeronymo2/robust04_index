			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'MORNING ZOO' CHIEF IS SEATTLE BOUND  </P> <P> Bobby Rich, the head of KFMB-FM's (B100) popular "Morning Zoo," was expected to  sign a letter of intent Monday afternoon to become general manager of two radio  stations in Seattle owned by locally based Noble Broadcasting.  </P> <P> Rich, who also is B100's program director, is a native of Seattle. He will head  up KMGI-FM, which features the same type of adult contemporary format as B100,  and KIXI-AM, which has a nostalgic rock format.  </P> <P> "Basically it's my home turf," Rich said Monday. "When I grew up in Washington  state, it was always my dream to have a station in Seattle."  </P> <P> The Morning Zoo, with the "Rich Brothers," was the first group morning show,  featuring skits, sound effects and and non-stop jokes, to succeed in San Diego.  Since its debut in 1984, it has consistently ranked among San Diego's most  popular morning shows.  </P> <P> "I think he's one of the most charismatic programmers/managers within the  format," Noble Broadcasting President John Lynch said. "He's going to a market  where it is important to have roots."  </P> <P> Rich's last day with B100 is expected to be Aug. 11. Mike Novak, who has been  with B100 for three years, has been named acting program director.  </P> <P> "The Morning Zoo featuring the Rich Brothers will continue on," KFMB General  Manager Paul Palmer said. "We'll miss Bobby, but the three (remaining) guys  will do the show, and we'll probably add another Rich Brother soon." KEVIN  BRASS  </P></p>

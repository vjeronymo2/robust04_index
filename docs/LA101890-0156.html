			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> KELM PROBABLY WILL START SUNDAY  </P> <P> Larry Kelm, who resumed practicing last week after being out all season because  of a knee injury, is expected to be activated off the injured-reserve list in  the next few days and probably will start at inside linebacker Sunday against  the Atlanta Falcons at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> The Rams have cleared a roster spot by placing inside linebacker Fred  Strickland, who broke a bone in his left leg Sunday night, on injured reserve.  </P> <P> They are waiting to make sure Kelm doesn't aggravate the injury during workouts  before activating him.  </P> <P> Atlanta quarterback Chris Miller, who left last Sunday's 45-35 loss to the San  Francisco 49ers with a sprained right knee, was listed as questionable for  Sunday's game.  </P> <P> "We expect him to play, and that's no guarantee that he will," Falcon Coach  Jerry Glanville said Wednesday. "He's got to get better than what he is today,  but we're going to try to crank it up."  </P> <P> As of Wednesday afternoon, 9,500 tickets remained unsold for Sunday's game. If  there is not a sellout by 1 p.m. today, it will be blacked out locally. TIM  KAWAKAMI  </P></p>

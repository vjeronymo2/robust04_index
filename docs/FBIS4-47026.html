			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Selected questions and answers from the Far Eastern Customs </F> Directorate's press conference, by Vitaliy Mogil; place and date  not given: "The Customs: Figures and Facts"]    [Text] Since the time the Far Eastern Customs  Directorate [FECD] was set up, there probably has not been as  large-scale and representative a press conference as the one  held last Wednesday. All the top customs men, headed by FECD  chief Oleg Sviridov, came to the meeting with journalists.    There were many questions, and many people to answer them.  Therefore, without getting specific about particular persons, we  will relate the most interesting parts of what was said at the  press conference.    [Question] What return does the kray get from customs  activities?    [Answer] Since the time the decree came out allowing to  transfer 10 percent of the customs duties collected into the  local budget, Maritime Kray has received R6.664 billion and more  than $3 million.    [Question] What violations does the customs encounter most?    [Answer] In the Far Eastern region, the prevalent type of  violation is illegal export of foreign currency. Over the first  quarter of 1994 alone, the FECD uncovered such violations in the  amount equivalent to R1 billion. At the Russian-Chinese border  there are frequent attempts to take Russian currency out of the  country. Over the same period, the "catch" comprised R50 million.    [Question] We frequently hear about corruption in customs.  Is  there a struggle to "keep the ranks clean"?    [Answer] We have to admit that the customs has not avoided  this sad fate. Incidents of corruption have occurred in almost  all major FECD units. Over 1993 in the entire Far Eastern  region, criminal proceedings for abuse of official position were  initiated against six officers, and 299 persons were subjected  to disciplinary measures. This does not mean that "everyone is  on the take"--more often it is instances of violating the  Customs Code. By the way, we have set up a special unit to watch  over the work of customs units.    [Question] Bribe-taking is associated with low pay. How much  are customs officers paid?    [Answer] The average salary of a customs officer in Maritime  Kray is R290,000.    [Question] This is not a lot. Nevertheless, there is  competition for jobs in the customs organs.    [Answer] Competition is a mandatory condition in order to  get  a job at the customs. This is the directive of the Main Customs  Administration. It is true that in some specializations there  are up to 10 applicants for a job. Our goal is to make a  guaranteed social protection of our staff more valuable than  high salaries.    [Question] What effect has the increase in custom duties had  on the state of the automobile market? Who benefits from this  increase?    [Answer] With the introduction of new custom duties in  February-March, the automobile market in Maritime Kray went into  a lull. A pick-up began in April after a certain cable from the  State Customs Committee, which envisaged customs relief until 1  July for cars imported for the purpose of commercial activities.  We can predict that after this date the duty will at least  double. This undoubtedly will cause a slump in the automobile  business. Who benefits from it is anybody's guess, but it  certainly is not the treasury. After all, in the first quarter  of 1994 the Far Eastern customs alone delivered to the treasury  R6.792 billion in "car" money.    [Question] Did the customs participate in Operation Fishing  '94?    [Answer] Very actively. In cooperation with two border  protection districts, our organs uncovered 11 customs  violations. The work was done mostly in the area of the Kuril  Ridge and South Sakhalin and zeroed in on illegal export of  fish--as a rule, by the way, by our compatriots.    [Question] On the problem of plundering of the national fish  resources. Do the Japanese authorities show interest in this  issue? After all, illegal exports of fish also affect the  interests of that country.    [Answer] Alas, this problem has not been looked into on  either the government or any other level. Our Japanese  colleagues are more concerned about the smuggling of arms and  drugs, which is acquiring an increasingly larger scale.</p>

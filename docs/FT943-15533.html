			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Quiet investors find their voice  -Ciga's fund shareholders are flexing their muscle It will take a while for Italian fund managers to achieve the same worldwide recognition as Italian soccer players or opera singers, but certain bright sparks in the fast-growing sector are at least trying. At Wednesday's meeting of shareholders in Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group, a group of fund managers indicated for the first time how they might begin to take back some of the power accumulated by what one observer described as 'Italy's coterie of delinquent entrepreneurs'. If it was a revolution, then it was a quiet one. Ciga's dominant shareholder  -Sheraton International, the hotels subsidiary of ITT of the US - started by demonstrating that with its 17.4 per cent stake, it was likely to take effective control of the Italian group. A board meeting next Tuesday is expected to endorse a reshuffle of directors, bringing ITT representatives on to the board. So far, so Italian. In most UK or US companies, 'control' would only change hands if a stake of more than 50 per cent was accumulated. In Italy, it is possible to gain control at much lower levels. At the Ciga meeting, however, a number of fund managers, together holding some 15 per cent of the shares, indicated their disapproval of Ciga's old directors, under whose aegis the group slipped heavily into debt when it was controlled by the Aga Khan's Fimpar holding company. The same funds gave their backing to Sheraton, but abstained from a final vote on the 1993 balance sheet, showing they intended to keep a close eye on future management of the group. Mr Gherardo Spinola, of Akros, a financial services group which holds 4.3 per cent of Ciga, said after the meeting the fund managers would act as guarantees of transparency - a concept much abused by Italy's public companies - and in the interests of fund-holders. 'It isn't our objective to manage these companies, but we will be extremely diligent,' added Mr Vittorio Cazzulani of Fondigest, the fund management arm of the Milan savings bank, Cariplo, owner of a 3.8 per cent stake. In the past, Italian funds have maintained a very low profile. This is partly because most are owned by larger groups, some of which may have had an interest in preventing their fund managers interfering with the parent company's direct investment or credit interests. However, the funds' potential influence has been increasing, as ordinary investors have begun to put their savings into equities. In 1993, for example, equities managed by Fondigest funds increased to L6,536bn (Dollars 4.2bn) from L1,953bn; the Fiat-controlled Prime mutual funds, also Ciga shareholders, increased assets under management by 36 per cent to L6,929bn, while the value of the seven Akros funds rose from L1,874bn to L3,297bn. Ciga is still an exceptional case. The environment is, however, gradually changing. Privatisation provides one opening. Most objective analysts agree that the real problem is the lack of development in the Italian pension and mutual fund industry, representing ordinary investors. The funds are not absent - some 80 per cent of the shares made available to Italian institutions in last week's L5,000bn privatisation of Ina, the state-owned insurer, went to pension funds, investment funds and insurance companies - but they have not yet thrown their weight around. In that sense, the Ciga assembly could represent a first tentative flexing of Italian fund managers' muscle.  ---------------------------------------------------------- Ciga: principal shareholders  ----------------------------------------------------------                                          Stake                                            (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------- Sheraton International                   17.43 Bankers Trust International               6.65 Azimut (Akros funds)                      4.32 Fondigest (Cariplo funds)                 3.82 Arca funds                                2.72  ---------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ciga  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

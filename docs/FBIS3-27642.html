			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Why Did Lin Wenqiang Hijack the Plane to Taiwan </F> on 18 February?"]    [Text] Beijing, 21 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Today,  this reporter interviewed a responsible official in the PRC  Ministry of Public Security [MPS] about this year's first  hijacking of a plane to Taiwan from the Chinese mainland on 18  February, and was told that the hijacked Boeing 737/2599  passenger plane, of China Southwest Airlines, was on Flight 4567  from Guiyang to Changsha to Fuzhou. That day, the plane took off  from Changsha at 0928 and flew over Fuzhou at about 1020. At  that moment, hijacker Lin Wenqiang, carrying a fruit knife and  an "explosive," forced the crew to open the door to the pilot's  compartment, demanding that the plane fly to Taiwan. He  threatened to stab the pilot to death with the knife and to blow  up the plane if the pilot did not obey him. In order to  guarantee the safety of the passengers and the plane, the crew  accepted the hijacker's demand. Now, Lin has been detained by  the Taiwan police. Lin's wife, stepmother, and two children  have returned to the mainland on the same plane.    What kind of person is Lin Wenqiang? Why did he hijack a  plane to Taiwan? The official answered this reporter's  questions. According to the investigation by the mainland public  security organs, hijacker Lin Wenqiang, male, was born on 2 June  1958. He originally was a peasant in Huangshi Village, Baizhong  Township, Minqing County, Fujian Province. In 1982, he managed  the Wufengqiao ceramic tile factory, but the factory did not  achieve good business results owing to poor management. He  transferred the factory's management contract to other people in  1992. At that time, he owed banks 7,470 yuan and owed the  workers more than 70,000 yuan in wages. In July 1992, Lin went  to Changsha, in Hunan, and undertook the management of the  ceramic workshop at the Changsha fuse factory. As the quality  and quantity of the workshop failed to meet standards, Lin's  management contract was suspended by the factory in July 1993.  Then, together with some people, Lin undertook the management of  the household electrical appliance sales department of a labor  service company. As Lin took away more than 2,200 yuan of sales  income, the other partners stopped cooperating with him. These  consecutive business failures made Lin unable to repay his  increasing debts. He borrowed an armed police officer's uniform  from an officer's wife on the pretext of taking photos for fun.  He then used forged certificates and passed himself off as an  armed police officer in order to board the plane he planned to  hijack.    The official stressed: The frequent occurrence of hijacking  incidents between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits is not  accidental. This is related directly to the Taiwan authorities'  policy for handling such criminal cases. Although the Taiwan  authorities take certain legal actions against hijackers, the  punishments are too lenient for such a serious crime, and the  hijackers are not sent back to the mainland. Although the  Taiwan authorities take certain legal actions against hijackers,  the punishments are too lenient for such a serious crime, and  the hijackers are not sent back to the mainland. This has  abetted some lawless people in making the desperate move. Facts  demonstrate that if the hijackers are not sent back, there will  be no peace in the air above the straits. It is hoped that the  Taiwan authorities will consider the safety of civil aviation  and of passengers' property, and will assume a realistic  attitude to promoting the conclusion of an agreement on  returning hijackers between the two sides of the straits, thus  thoroughly eliminating the crime of hijacking.</p>

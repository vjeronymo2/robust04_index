			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HER HONOR OF THE DESERT BENCH;  </P> <P> MARGARET GRIGNON IS TOUGH, FAIR, ANTELOPE VALLEY COLLEAGUES SAY  </P> <P> There is only one Superior Court judge in the Antelope Valley, a desert expanse  of northern Los Angles County that is a tough blend of rural and urban  frontier.  </P> <P> Her name is Margaret M. Grignon, and she has a reputation for her own tough  blend of legal diligence and scholarship. The first and only woman judge in the  valley, she maintains a serene, almost gentle courtroom presence, even as she  hands down sentences that some defense lawyers criticize as severe.  </P> <P> But many prosecutors, public defenders and private attorneys say Grignon's  ability supersedes ideology. They point out that lawyers in a recent death  penalty case agreed to argue the case before Grignon (pronounced "Grin-yo") in  a rare non-jury trial.  </P> <P> "That indicates a tremendous level of respect for a judge," said Justice Armand  Arabian of the State Court of Appeal, Grignon's longtime mentor. "That only  happens when both sides have full faith in the judge. It is a badge of honor."  </P> <P> Grignon ruled that medical negligence had contributed to the death of the  victim but found the defendant guilty of murder and sentenced him to death. It  was only the second time in California that the death penalty had been imposed  after a non-jury trial.  </P> <P> Opinion on that sentence appears split between prosecutors and defense  attorneys. But regardless of where they stand, people who have worked with the  38-year-old Grignon say her handling of the case demonstrates her willingness  to take on challenges.  </P> <P> There was doubt and resentment in the valley's insulated legal community in  1984 when Gov. George Deukmejian appointed Grignon to the Antelope Valley  Municipal Court. She was 34, a little-known tax lawyer and a newcomer with  minimal courtroom experience and prominent allies such as Arabian, who swore  her in.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Nobody Knew Her'  </P> <P> "It was a complete surprise," one attorney recalled. "Nobody knew her. She  wasn't part of the local old-boy network. A lot of people thought of her as a  carpetbagger."  </P> <P> The doubts have given way.  </P> <P> "She came, she saw and she conquered," said valley defense attorney Eugene  Siegel, who described himself as a liberal at the opposite end of the political  spectrum from the judge. "She is one of the smartest, hardest-working judges I  have appeared before."  </P> <P> Grignon, her husband, James, a doctor, and their two children have lived in the  valley for six years. She is a former director of the Antelope Valley Domestic  Violence Council and recently cut down on her active public speaking schedule  to spend more time with her family.  </P> <P> "I love it up here," said Grignon, named Woman of the Year of the 34th Assembly  District by legislators. "There is a real sense of community."  </P> <P> Although critics are hard to find, some defense attorneys say Grignon's  hard-line sentencing philosophy is in the tradition of other Deukmejian  appointees and of her predecessors in the valley judiciary.  </P> <P> She is like other "Republican right-wingers who believe everyone should be in  jail," said longtime local attorney Dell Falls. "I think she is highly  intelligent, affable and well-read. The only thing I can find wrong with her is  that she's too heavy in sentencing."  </P> <P> In relatively minor cases in which defendants have plea bargained to receive a  sentence ranging from no jail time to 180 days, Grignon invariably imposes the  maximum, several lawyers said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Common Sense'  </P> <P> But she resists the label of rigid conservative, describing her philosophy as  "common sense."  </P> <P> Siegel said: "She believes strongly in punishment as a mechanism to deter  crime. However, that's tempered a little bit. She will step out of that role  when appropriate."  </P> <P> Attorney William A. Clark said: "She rarely gives a no-jail sentence. . . ."  </P> <P> Grignon said: "I think I follow the law. You would think a Superior Court judge  would have a lot more discretion, but in fact what we do is based on  determinate sentencing. If you apply the statutory parameters, you arrive at a  sentence."  </P> <P> Grignon said it was difficult to arrive at a sentence for James Scott of  Palmdale, charged in the murder of a woman who died in February, 10 months  after he raped her, beat her unconscious and set her bed afire.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Clark and Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Kent Cahill  agreed to try the death penalty case before Grignon rather than before a jury.  Clark thought it would be difficult for a jury to remain objective because of  the horrible nature of the crime. Both he and Cahill said their confidence in  Grignon played a role in their decisions to waive the right to a jury.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Negligence Moot  </P> <P> Grignon found Scott guilty in April. Clark requested a sentence of life  imprisonment without parole, arguing that medical negligence contributed to the  victim's death. But Grignon ruled during sentencing that aggravating factors,  such as use of a deadly weapon, outweighed any medical negligence. She  sentenced Scott to die in the gas chamber.  </P> <P> "She had the power not to impose the death penalty," said Deputy Dist. Atty.  Stephen L. Cooley, head of the Lancaster office. "She made the decision alone.  It's a lot harder for one person to make. The fact that she followed the law  does not mean that it was easy."  </P> <P> Clark, who continues to represent Scott on appeal, said he thought medical  negligence played a greater role in the victim's death than Grignon  acknowledged. But he said: "I don't think her imposition of the death penalty  was inconsistent with her verdict and her view of the facts."  </P> <P> A lawyer in the public defender's office, who asked not to be named, was more  critical of the decision.  </P> <P> "I thought the defense made a very valid showing," he said. "Once she found  that the hospital was negligent, to blame the defendant for the death was  inappropriate. . . . It shows she's not opposed to the death penalty and may  feel it should be used more."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Intellectual Exercise'  </P> <P> Grignon said she thought Clark made the right move in opting for a non-jury  trial because the case was an intellectual exercise.  </P> <P> Of the death sentence, she said: "It was one of the hardest decisions I have  made. I spent a lot of time, a lot of sleepless nights. Once it was made, the  angst, the anxiety went away. That's what judges do. We bring things to a  conclusion. You don't have to agonize after the decision because you have  agonized before."  </P> <P> The population and crime rate of the Antelope Valley have exploded during  Grignon's tenure. Palmdale, the fastest-growing city in the state for the past  three years, grew 17% last year, and Lancaster grew 10%. The number of reported  crimes in the valley went up 35% during the first six months of this year, a  per capita increase of 11%.  </P> <P> Two Superior Court commissioners handle family, probate and juvenile cases  while Grignon handles criminal and civil trials. A recent study of the workload  at the courthouse found that two more judges are needed. The district  attorney's office has filed more than 700 felony cases in Superior Court over  the past year, compared to about 250 four years ago.  </P> <P> Cooley said Grignon has improved the efficiency of the Superior Court and,  previously, the Municipal Court, when she was presiding judge.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Higher Goal  </P> <P> Grignon has her sights on a higher goal. She is among the applicants for the  seat on the state Court of Appeal vacated by Justice Joyce Kennard, whom  Deukmejian recently appointed to the state Supreme Court. Once the State Bar  Assn.'s Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation has rated applicants, the  final decision is up to the governor.  </P> <P> Grignon was born in New Jersey, raised in Riverside and studied law at Loyola  University Law School, where she graduated first in her class. After clerking  for Justice Robert S. Thompson of the state Court of Appeal, an expert in tax  law, she decided to pursue a specialty in that area.  </P> <P> Grignon later was the only woman in the tax departments of law firms in Los  Angeles and San Diego. Then, and as a newcomer on the Antelope Valley bench,  she said she has never been discriminated against because she is a woman.  </P> <P> "I didn't feel much resentment," she said. "It was more a sense of 'Can she do  it?' "  </P> <P> Although the judgeship does not require the 70-hour workweeks of corporate  practice, Grignon said: "It takes a toll. I have worked longer hours, but never  where it has taken more out of me."  </P></p>

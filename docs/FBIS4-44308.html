			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "hjh": "The SPD Wants To Form a Red-Green </F> Government in Magdeburg"]    [Text] Magdeburg -- The Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] in Saxony-Anhalt wants to begin talks with the Alliance  90/Greens immediately to create preconditions for a government  led by SPD leader Reinhard Hoeppner. A corresponding decision  was unanimously adopted yesterday at a joint session of the  party's executive committee and the landtag group. Since the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU] categorically rejects a  coalition under Hoeppner's leadership, the only solution is a  coalition between the SPD and the Greens. After the session,  Hoeppner stated that he will run for the minister-president's  position in any case. The SPD politician announced that in the  event of his election, he wants to form a "grand coalition  focusing on factual issues." To achieve this, he is ready to  discuss cooperation with the CDU. There will be no talks with  the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. However, the successor  party of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, which won almost  20 percent of the vote in Saxony-Anhalt, will also play a role.  A red-green minority government would have 41 of a total of 90  seats in the provincial government. The CDU holds 37 seats.    It has become known from Hoeppner's circle that he wants to  form a red-green minority government that would rely on  "vagabonding majorities" of the PDS and the CDU. Yet some  members of the executive committee and the landtag group who  participated in the session expressed concern about this course.  As early as in the runup to the meeting, Saxony-Anhalt's deputy  SPD leader and member of the Bundestag, Uwe Kuester, warned his  party against "misjudging the realities." He described the  grand coalition as the only realistic possibility of forming a  stable government in Saxony-Anhalt. At a closed session, the  SPD wants to determine its further procedure and its course for  coalition talks in the next three days. The model of a red-green  coalition was strongly rejected by the CDU. Acting  Minister-President Christoph Bergner announced that his party  will not tolerate a minority government led by Hoeppner. Those  who assume responsibility must bear it in all areas, Bergner  stressed. He described the various toleration models that were  mentioned as "absurd proposals." Bergner pointed out that he  did not understand why the SPD rejected a grand coalition with  the CDU categorically before starting official talks. The  minister-president announced that he will present a proposal for  talks to the Social Democrats before the end of this week.  Saxony-Anhalt's CDU leader Karl-Heinz Daehre wants to do the  same thing. During such exploratory talks, the balance of power  in a possible grand coalition might also be discussed, Bergner  suggested. However, he ruled out a renunciation of the CDU of  the minister-president's position. The head of government  expressed the concern that, in the runup to the Bundestag  elections, the SPD is no longer willing to hold serious talks,  as a result of which Saxony-Anhalt might drift into a  "decisionless phase." Thus, Bergner appealed to the SPD not to  form a minority government without any real need. The CDU  landtag group nominated Bergner, CDU Chairman Daehre, the  reelected landtag group Chairman Juergen Scharf, and the cabinet  members Walter Remmers and Wolfgang Boehmer as members of the  negotiating team. It was also decided that the PDS is to  receive the position of a vice president in the landtag.    Alliance 90/Greens confirmed their readiness for a coalition  with the SPD. Exploratory talks are to start at the beginning  of this week, Heidrun Heidecke announced. She stated that a  Red-Green government might be tolerated both by the PDS and the  CDU. Asked about the strict rejection of such a model by the  CDU, Heidecke stated: "Even the CDU will stop sulking one day."</p>

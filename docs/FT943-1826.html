			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / People: McCann-Erickson Michael Sennott is marking his 30th year with McCann-Erickson with a new job and a change of scenery. The advertising agency's 52-year-old vice-chairman is about to move from New York to London to become director of its largest regional operating arm, McCann-Erickson Europe. Beginning at the new year, Sennott will take over from Max Cusnir, a worldwide executive vice-president at the agency. Cusnir, a 62-year-old Belgian, will remain in Europe to work on international business development projects, reporting directly to John Dooner, president and chief executive of McCann Worldwide. The assignment is somewhat of a reprise for Sennott. In the early 1990s, the executive shared responsibility with Cusnir for managing the European operation, which currently manages Dollars 2.5bn in advertising accounts for its clients. After completing that assignment, Sennott was appointed to his current post, which carries the additional title of worldwide director of multinational accounts. McCann has not named his successor.</p>

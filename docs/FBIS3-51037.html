A press communique issued by the National Defense Ministry  reported there are 259 U.S. soldiers carrying out different  tasks in various regions of the country. The official  communique seeks to calm the strong controversy among country's  politicians and media over the recent arrival of U.S. Marines in  the area of the Colombian Pacific area, where -- according to  the government -- they are participating in the construction of  civil projects in the poor area of Juanchaco.</p>

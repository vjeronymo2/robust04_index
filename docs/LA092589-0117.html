			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> STEWART OKD TO RESUME COACHING  </P> <P> University of Missouri veteran basketball Coach Norm Stewart, who missed a  third of last season after surgery for colon cancer, has been given the final  OK by his doctor to return to coaching this season.  </P> <P> Stewart underwent extensive tests last week at Columbia Regional Hospital that  showed his body was free of cancer and the seven ulcers that plagued him in  February, according to his personal physician Jay Ward.  </P> <P> "Everything we did went extremely well," Ward said. "It was great."  </P> <P> Stewart, whose collapse on an airplane Feb. 9 triggered the discovery of  cancer, has regained almost all of the weight he lost during his recovery, Ward  said.  </P> <P> He said the tests completed last week were more thorough than the occasional  checkups Stewart had during the spring and summer.  </P> <P> Stewart, 54, will begin his 23rd season at Missouri Nov. 17 when the Tigers  host the Brazilian national team. His record is 429-225.  </P></p>

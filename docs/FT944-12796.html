			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / UK rates will need to rise The next in the monthly round of staged conversazioni be-tween the UK chancellor and governor of the Bank of Eng-land takes place this Wednesday. The timing of these meetings is a bit archaic, as they are loosely linked to the publication of the figures for M0 (cash balances) which are out today, but which are now only one limited part of the jigsaw of indicators which the Bank and Treasury examine. This time, however, much light has been shed by the publication of the flash estimate for third-quarter GDP. This estimate - for whose introduction the Central Statistical Office should be congratulated - itself summarises a large range of indicators. The GDP estimate was followed by the CBI quarterly Industrial Trends survey, still the least bad forward indicator we possess. In a speech in the West Midlands on Thursday, the governor, Eddie George, came as close to disclosing his advice to the chancellor as he is ever likely to do before the event. As usual, there is something for each side. To comfort the doves, he reminded the assembled businessmen - as he had earlier that day reminded a financial audience in London - that 'markets are currently exaggerating the inflationary dangers and the extent of the rise in interest rates that might ultimately prove to be necessary to contain them'. He detected some moderation in the output data and said that the personal sector might be less buoyant than it was in view of the flat housing market. He spoke of producers absorbing cost pressures in the early stages of the production process and of the intense retail competition, which was a powerful ally in keeping prices down. Last, but by no means least, he reminded people of the further fiscal tightening in the pipeline. Tobacco and road fuel duty rise this December. In April, not only does Vat on fuel more than double, but tax allowances for married couples and for mortgage interest are to be trimmed, even if nothing further is announced on Budget day on November 29. For the hawks, he referred to the re-entry problem - that is the eventual need to slow down the growth of output to a rate that can be sustained in the medium term. Moreover estimates of output growth tend to be revised upwards at this stage of the cycle. Any slowdown in consumer spending, so far from being a bad sign, will be much needed 'if we are to find room for stronger growth of exports and investment' of which he saw such encouraging signs. He was even more confident that the increase in base rates in September was right; and said 'you wouldn't expect me then to rule out the possibility of some further rise in interest rates at some point ahead'. For good measure he added: 'I don't expect you to cheer exactly when rates do have to go up. But I don't think you would thank us if we flinched . . .' The really tell-tale bits relate to his reasons for underlying optimism, such as the favourable outlook in overseas markets, British industrial competitiveness, and the historically high real pre-tax returns on capital. To a good central banker these are reasons for ensuring that things remain that way, rather than for simple-minded applause. As a connoisseur of Central Bank Speak, my interpretation is that Eddie George will either ask for a moderate increase in base rates - say to 6 1/2 or 6 1/4 per cent - at this week's meeting, or prepare the ground for such a request the following month. Further ahead I would guess that his crystal ball cannot so far see any need for interest rates above 7 per cent - compared with the 10 per cent over the next three years implicit in the yield curve for bond rates. Looking myself at the third-quarter GDP, I cannot see much sign of any slowdown. The top chart plots a two quarterly moving average of this measure excluding the volatile North Sea sector. It shows growth rising steadily since the end of the recession to reach an annualised rate of 3 1/2 per cent. There is some argument about whether the trend rate of growth is not much above 2 per cent per annum, as the Treasury and Bank seem to believe, or nearly 3 per cent, as Christopher Dow, a former Bank of England economic director, argues in the publication Leopold Joseph Economic Comments. In either case the margin of excess capacity is being quite rapidly eroded, which is confirmed both from the labour market figures and the CBI capacity utilisation survey. Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers has produced a chart showing capacity utilisation at a normal rate in Germany, well above normal in the US and somewhere in between in Britain. Faithful readers will know the arguments for taking nominal spending as the target variable for policy. Because of recent very low inflation rates, nominal GDP growth, when we get more recent estimates, might turn out to be at around 5 per cent per annum, perhaps even less. In itself this is entirely satisfactory. But if there is an overwhelming proportion of indicators pointing to upward pressures in the quarters to come, and moreover many of them come directly from the cost and prices component, it is time to sit up and take notice. CBI output expectations are the highest since October 1988, towards the peak of the last boom. Export deliveries reported are the highest since the series began in 1978. The balance of firms in the CBI survey intending to increase prices is now the highest since early 1991, before inflation began its plunge. The percentage increase in earnings due to pay settlements has edged up by around  3/4 percentage points in both manufacturing and services. And - most difficult to take into account in policy - the Economist commodity price index has risen, admittedly from a low point, by over 40 per cent in the last year measured in dollars, and by over 25 per cent measured in sterling. This last indicator points to the radical change in the international environment. Demand and output are rising vigorously from a varied series of starting points in the industrial, developing and post-communist worlds alike (apart from Japan). The UK has no painless way of escaping completely worldwide inflationary or deflationary forces. But every aspect of the conjuncture suggests that any movement in sterling ought to be modestly upwards, compared with the sideways movement of the last two years. The exchange rate must be a more important consideration in any base rate decision than the chancellor will find it politic to admit to his own backbenchers.</p>

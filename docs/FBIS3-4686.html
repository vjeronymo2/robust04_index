			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Naoya Tsujiya] </F>   [Text] Frankfurt, 27 Feb -- The rest of the G-7 [Group of  Seven] industrialized nations expressed strong discontent with  Japan's management of its economy at the meeting of the G-7  finance ministers and central bankers, leaving the impression  that a siege has been laid to Japan. European nations, which  have supported Japan's position of rejecting the U.S. demand of  introducing objective criteria at the Japan-U.S. framework  talks, did not conceal their irritation at Japan's unshrinking  current account surplus at the meeting. Japan has to speedily  work out a specific program to reform its economic structure to  avoid being isolated by the rest of the G-7 industrialized  nations and stand in step with the policy coordination of the  G-7 industrialized nations.    A Finance Ministry official lamented at the meeting room,  "We  have come here with a package of stimulus measures totalling  more than 15 trillion yen, but ...." He said tax cuts amounting  to more than one percent of the gross national product, though  they will last for only one year, can be expected to stimulate  the Japanese economy. But requests from the rest of the G-7  industrialized nations to Japan were difficult to address.    European nations have highly praised Japan for checking the  United States from moving toward protectionism by rejecting the  U.S. demand for introducing internationally criticized objective  criteria at the Japan-U.S. framework talks. Their praise has  led Japan to hope that it would be able to win support from  European nations at the meeting, but Japan's hopes were found to  be overly optimistic.    In a bid to reduce Japan's current account surplus, the  United States has so far attempted to strengthen the yen against  the dollar, but its efforts have left an impression of Japanese  strength. The United States is about to take a new approach:  that the Japanese market is different from those of the rest of  the G-7 industrialized nations because Japan has not increased  imports.    The Japanese Government plans to map out a package of  measures during March to open the Japanese market. The package  can be considered the first step in a specific program to reform  Japan's economic structure. Japan will be asked to make efforts  not only to open its market, but to revamp the conventional  bureaucrat-led system of policy formulation.    At the latest Japan-U.S. framework talks, the United States  expressed strong apprehension about the Finance Ministry's plan  to cut income taxes for only one year. Prime Minister Hosokawa  is said not to have mentioned a plan to cut taxes for many years  at the latest Japan-U.S. summit talks. At the G-7 meeting,  Finance Minister Fujii said that "Japan would continue to cut  taxes in the future." Taking into account the contradictions in  Japan's responses, other nations appear to have felt a sense of  incongruity regarding Prime Minister Hosokawa's leadership.    The meeting of G-7 finance ministers and central bankers  failed to reach a clear agreement on exchange rate stability in  the face of opposition from the United States. The U.S.  Government had no choice but to oppose such an agreement, for  which Japan has hoped to placate hard-line members of Congress  who do not want the U.S. Government to make any concessions for  Japan. Following the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework  talks, the present situation in the United States is such that  it is difficult for the U.S. Government to take any measures  considered by Americans to be soft on Japan.    The U.S. Government is neither giving up on exchange rate  stability nor trying to seek a strong yen. A steep rise in the  value of the yen and a correspondingly sharp fall in the value  of the U.S. dollar may lead to even higher interest rates on  long-term loans. High interest rates on long-term loans are  keeping stock prices low in the United States. Any fluctuation  in the currency exchange rate may shake financial markets, and  this would be a undesirable situation for the U.S. Government.    European nations, which have had bitter experiences  regarding  a currency crisis, have no reason not to hope for the stability  of the exchange rate. The G-7 finance ministers and central  bankers appear to have decided not to discuss the exchange rate  issue at their meeting out of consideration for the U.S.  domestic situation.</p>

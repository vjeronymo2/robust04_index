			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Plans To Build Ships and Submarines"] </F>   [Text] Admiral Sayyed M. Khan, commander-in-chief of the  Pakistan Navy, said that Pakistan is planning to build war ships  in cooperation with China within one year. He said that new  submarines are being bought to replace the old ones. The country  with which this agreement will be made will also be required to  transfer the related technology to Pakistan. Pakistan is  endangered by serious foreign threats now. Keeping this in mind,  we cannot be negligent about out national defense. The Pakistani  Navy especially needs naval war ships and submarines, because  India has increased its naval power extraordinarily, much more  than it really needs. This clearly indicates that India wants to  establish its monopoly in the Indian Ocean and to change it to a  "Hindu lake." In addition, India has made so much progress in  this area that it can block all trade and naval routes to  Pakistan if there is a war. In this era, the importance of  technology and modern war equipment has increased considerably.  Needs and demands change every few years. But it is deplorable  that we have not paid full attention to the Pakistani Navy's  needs for a long time. As a result, most of the ships and  submarines in Pakistan's Navy are old and useless . The war  ships that were leased from the United States of America have  been returned. The war ships loaned by Great Britain to replace  those do not have all the same capabilities and features. Thus,  it is a welcome development that the Pakistan Navy is not only  trying to purchase modern war ships and submarines from another  country, but also is preparing to build these here under the  technology transfer arrangement. In addition, naval war ships  will be built with the cooperation of China, which will help  Pakistan become self-sufficient in its defense. This will also  rid Pakistan of any blackmail efforts for procuring military  equipment in the case of a war.</p>

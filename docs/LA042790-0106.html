This is  Atlanta-based Cupp Design Inc.'s first golf course in California.  </P> <P> Some members of Pacific Land &amp; Golf developed the Marbella Golf and Country  Club in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> Sato Kogyo American is a U.S. subsidiary of Sato Kogyo Co., a large Tokyo  engineering and construction company founded in 1862. It has been involved in  the U.S. real estate market since 1987.  </P> <P> Cushman Realty Corp. of Los Angeles was financial adviser to the partnership  and arranged financing for the $150-million project.

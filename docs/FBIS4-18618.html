			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mock: `Make Free Elections </F> Possible'"]    [Excerpt] Vienna -- On the occasion of the visit by his  South African counterpart Roelof ("Pik") Botha to Vienna,  Foreign Minister Alois Mock has appealed to the political  leaders in Pretoria to make violence-free elections possible.  Austria is watching the events in South Africa with great  interest but also with considerable concern, Mock stressed in a  press release on Thursday [7 April].    The Austrian foreign minister said that the meeting between  President De Klerk, African National Congress President Mandela,  Zulu King Zwelithini, and Inkatha Chief Buthelezi is decisive  for the preparation of the general elections on 27 April and for  containing the wave of violence in South Africa.    Mock called on the participants in the meeting to do  everything in their power to make it possible for all South  African citizens to participate in the elections without fear of  intimidation.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Biznews" program] </F>   [Text] Russia can sell 3,000 tonnes of natural uranium per  year on the American market for the next two years. This  amendment to the anti-dumping agreement for uranium has been  adopted by Moscow and Washington. However, the present  amendment has a number of restrictions. In particular, the  Russian side has the right to sell only 50 percent of the volume  indicated in a contract. The remainder of the supplies are  carried out by American producers. In addition to this, Russia  can sell 500 tonnes of natural uranium on the U.S. market per  year at a price of not less than $13 a pound. At present the  price of natural uranium on the American market is approximately  $10.</p>

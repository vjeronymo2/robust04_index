			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADMONITION TO OFFICEHOLDERS  </P> <P> We want to commend The Times' editorial "Zeal and Politics" (June 6) for its  response to Archbishop Roger M. Mahony's recent declaration that all Catholic  officeholders in government "have a positive moral obligation" to work for the  repeal of laws permitting abortion."  </P> <P> The Catholic Church has every right to express itself on public issues,  including abortion. As does every citizen, religious group, and voluntary  association, it has the right to urge a change in the constitutional law of  abortion, and to call for a re-examination of those public policies which allow  reproductive choice. In a democracy necessarily committed to freedom of  expression, no other rule is conceivable. But Archbishop Mahony's recent  statement that government officials who are Catholics "have a positive moral  obligation" to work for the repeal of laws permitting abortion stands on a  different footing.  </P> <P> The Archbishop has a legal right to say what he did. In a pluralistic society,  however, calls for public officials to act as believers are improper. Public  officials owe all citizens -- and not just those who share their religious  views -- a duty to exercise their own best judgment, even though colored by  religious beliefs -- not blind obedience to ecclesiastical authority, whether  it be a bishop, a pastor or a rabbi.  </P> <P> If the Catholic Church, or any church, can persuade a public official, of  whatever religious persuasion, that its position on abortion is more consistent  with the vision of a just society, that official is free to act on that view to  the extent the law allows. What no church or synagogue should do is demand that  its adherents holding public office respond in lock step to its religious  teachings.  </P> <P> Twice in this century, Catholics running for the presidency have faced strong  opposition from bigots who argues that no Catholic could be trusted with public  office because they would inevitably take orders from the Vatican. Once that  opposition defeated an able Catholic candidate, Al Smith; the other time, the  candidate, John F. Kennedy, overcame that opposition by stating that, in his  capacity as a public official, he was not subject to the authority of any  church official. Notwithstanding the sympathy one must feel for those  confronted with a clash between their most deeply held beliefs and their duty  to the public to exercise their independent judgment, the balance must be  struck in favor of the public interest.  </P> <P> DOUGLAS E. MIRELL  </P> <P> Vice President  </P> <P> American Jewish Congress  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Arts: Drosselmeyer steals the show Productions of The Nutcracker come and go. Mostly they do not go soon enough, and among the tribulations of the festive season - like hideous Christmas cards from forgotten relations - are those misbegotten stagings with which innocent children are introduced to 'the ballet'. English National Ballet's version by Ben Stevenson, brought among us two years ago, has won few plaudits from me. Its party scene is a rough and tumble in which tots are given alcohol, an old man falls over several times, and small boys behave like miniature terrorists: true to life, no doubt, but no fun to watch on stage. Much of the dramatic signposting in the score is crassly ignored. Later scenes are somewhat better, though much infested with child performers. What virtues the affair possesses are owed to Desmond Heeley's designs (which just manage not to go over the top in seasonal winsomeness) and, this year, to the disciplined and buoyant dancing of the company - the fruit of Derek Deane's policies after less than a year as artistic director. I saw the piece on Wednesday evening, and was content to sit through the early mayhem because of the promise of Yelena Pankova and Thomas Edur in the grand pas de deux. Pankova remains the enchanting ballerina we knew with the Kirov. Her dancing is as light as ever, frosted and sweet as a Sugar Plum should be, and unfailingly charming. I wish the version of the pas de deux were better, but Pankova persuaded me at moments that it was real choreography. So did Edur, with his aristocratic manner, the lift and clarity of his style, and the beautiful quietness - that absence of vain display and empty bravura - which touches his grandest, most serious moments as a dancer. He also partnered Susan Jaffe, very secure and polished, in the snow scene, both of them giving its ice-skating curlicues something like academic seemliness. For the rest, I salute the corps de ballet, who appeared strong and sure of themselves, and note that Philip Arrona's Drosselmeyer looks very like Talleyrand. I could not, though, take myself to this version unprepared, and on Monday night I went to Covent Garden to be reminded by the Royal Ballet's wise and sensitive staging of what a Nutcracker should be. Here sentiment, and the musical aptness of the dance, are paramount attractions - and the choreography does not insult its players. I saw Miyako Yoshida as the Sugar Plum, clear and bright in step, and Tetsuya Kumakawa as her cavalier, cutting astonishing shapes in the air. But it was Stephen Jefferies as Drosselmeyer who made the evening glorious. Jefferies, as we have known for 20 years, is a dance-actor expressive, original, profound. He made Drosselmeyer a contemplative, almost melancholy figure, at once mysterious and benign. The entire action seemed to spring from his will, and he moved through it as a truly Hoffmannesque figure. In its concentration, its dignity and commanding intelligence, this reading rivalled anything I have seen Jefferies do throughout his career - even his tremendous Rudolf in Mayerling. Such artistry speaks of theatrical genius: we are privileged to watch him. The Nutcracker continues at the Royal Festival Hall until January 22.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 12 May--Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej  Olechowski presented the main directions and principles of  Poland's activity in the international arena in the Sejm today.  Here are the most important themes of the speech:    The treaty with the Republic of Lithuania signed by  President  Lech Walesa closed a fundamental stage of Polish foreign policy  devoted to establishing the foundations for partnership  relations with neighbors and to defining the strategic goals of  the foreign policy of the sovereign Polish Republic. We can be  satisfied with the results achieved. There are no foreign  troops in Poland--a rare fact in the history of the past 300  years. We are the only country under transformation that has  concluded treaties on good-neighborly cooperation with all of  our neighbors. (...)    Poland is also a country of agreement between all serious  political forces and in public opinion on the basic goals of  foreign policy. We owe appreciation to the authors of these  important achievements, in particular to my predecessor,  Professor Krzysztof Skubiszewski. We are building our place in  the world on the solid foundations created by them.    It is worth recalling the guiding principles of our foreign  policy. The efforts of our diplomacy focus on activities  serving people and the good of individuals. There is clarity in  the policy and of the concrete actions taken within its  framework. The government has no monopoly on activity abroad,  and neither has the state. (All centers of power--the  president, the government, and parliament--take part in its  creation and implementation. The openness of our state and  society makes politicians, self-government activists, and  ordinary citizens participate every day in this activity.)    The policy, determined in a normal democratic process--that  is, with the participation of the parties--is implemented in a  supraparty manner (we require diplomats to represent the state  and its goals and not give party interests or personal views).  Foreign policy, as any other, has to be coherent (it means,  among other things, the need for close coordination of actions  by various state bodies and institutions). Our policy strictly  observes modern international standards, in particular the  respect for identity, aspirations, and views of other states.  We are conducting a friendly policy, well-disposed to everybody  who does the same.    The most important task of our foreign policy is to ensure  lasting security for Poland. We are doing so by developing good  relations with all of our neighbors and by rapprochement with  Euro- Atlantic security structures.    Every day we are hosting in Poland, legally and illegally,  hundreds of thousands of Russian, Ukrainian, and other seasonal  workers, tradesmen, and tourists. They argue with Poles about  wages, prices, and the quality of goods. Despite such great  movements of people, we have not noted any incidents aimed at  Russia. Miracle? Yes, it is a miracle of normality. I am  convinced that, at the basis of this peaceful atmosphere in  human relations, there is a feeling among Poles that now they  are hosts in their own country, and, as such, they are able to  welcome all guests, including those who only recently symbolized  imperial violence and dictatorship. (...)    By increasing contacts and proposals of joint practical  actions, we are telling all of our neighbors: We are ready to  become friends, we are aiming at being related by a net of  agreements and projects that will ensure the free movement of  people, information, goods, services, and capital. (...)    Poland and Germany are good neighbors. We are looking with  confidence at democratic and European Germany. This  good-neighborliness should transform into a friendship. A firm  friendship is still the aim. If we are to have any mission,  this should be it because friendship between Poles and Germans  will mean that an important source of potential conflict in  Europe will be eliminated. This is a course worth pursuing.    We see the path to friendship in uniting Poles and Germans  in  the same commonwealth of nations, in the European Union [EU],  and in making us partners in joint projects, similar to  French-German reconciliation. This aim dominates our political  dialogue. A particular form of this is the Paris-Bonn-Warsaw  cooperation, the so-called Weimar triangle. We are placing a  great deal of importance in developing this cooperation by  intensification of a dialogue, as well as by its broadening and  move from diplomacy to parliament and into sector problems and,  finally, to local and civil projects. Regional and transborder  cooperation, as well as German investors' interest in all  Poland's regions, are very important.    We attach great importance to military cooperation, and we  will strive to expand it. Taking care of Polish citizens and  citizens of Polish origin living in Germany and the German  minority living in Poland is the topic of our constant attention.    The neighborly, friendly relations with the Czechs, the  Slovaks, and the Hungarians are developing very well. The  agreement on free trade--CEFTA [Central European Free Trade  Association]--is the greatest joint achievement. We believe the  weakening of the Visegrad Group to be unfavorable. It  stimulates a search for different ties in Central Europe. We  are not happy about it because we cannot find a better solution  than the Visegrad Group. It includes the states that have been  the leaders among the postcommunist countries of political and  economic reforms and that unequivocally support integration with  the EU and NATO.    Relations with eastern neighbors have been less developed.  They are too weak, and our important task is to raise them to  the level achieved with other neighbors. (...)    In this context, relations with Russia are of the utmost  importance. We have different views on ways of achieving  European security. This difference, however, should not exclude  lively bilateral and regional cooperation.    Within the program of joint Polish-Russian undertakings  this year, we are going to conclude a trade protocol for 1994  and, possibly, for the following years. We will start work on  an agreement on economic cooperation that, among other things,  will define the principles and directions for developing  cooperation links. We will expand transborder cooperation. We  will review and specify the possibilities for financial and  banking cooperation. We will undertake work on the setting up  of a supragovernmental foundation for supporting democracy and  market reforms in Central and East Europe, activities that will  compensate for shortcomings in the sphere of information and  expand the Polish-Russian dialogue to various political issues.  We will try to set up an association for preventing and  combating organized crime, including representatives of police,  prosecutors, the judiciary of the states of the region, and  Interpol.    In relations with Ukraine, we are striving to fill the  formula of the "close" partnership with material content. In  relations with Lithuania and Belarus and also with other eastern  neighbors and countries further afield, such as Moldova and  Kazakhstan, we concentrate our efforts on creating conditions  conducive to economic cooperation. We are continuing our active  participation in regional institutions, in particular in the  Baltic initiative and the Central European initiative. We will  contribute with our experience to work on the pact on stability  with regard to the legal regulation of relations with neighbors  and with national minorities.    We see two threats to the process of building  good-neighborly  relations, friendship, and regional cooperation. At the basis  of this is intolerance and indisposition toward differences.  Poland is treating all of its neighbors as fully independent  and sovereign states.    The development of friendly bonds in our region can also be  hampered by the intolerance of one of the nations.  Unfortunately, we have noticed the symptoms of this in Russia.  We are afraid of it. We have been alarmed by statements about  Russia's "particular interests" and "special role" in  neighboring countries. These are not conducive to the stability  of the region and of Europe. We do not accept this.    The second threat, also having its source in intolerance, is  nationalism. We can see what it has led to in the former  Yugoslavia. (...)    Poland persistently supports the process of linking the East  and the West into one whole. We want a practical implementation  of the principle of indivisibility and security of the whole of  Europe and, more widely, of the whole European area. We are of  the opinion that the most direct road toward a Europe without  divisions is an expansion of proven structures--the North  Atlantic Treaty and the EU. This expansion does not mean the  creation of new divisions but the breaking down of old ones.  That is why we are striving resolutely for our membership in  these organizations. That is why we support similar attempts by  other states of the Visegrad Group and treat the membership of  the group in the Atlantic structures as an important step, but  also only aa the first step. That is why we support the  establishment of close ties between NATO and Russia. The  security of Poland and Europe would not be full and permanent if  the ultimate system were not to include Russia and our eastern  neighbors.    Our most important goal in 1994 is to create conditions for  a  speedy development of cooperation and the compatibility of the  Polish defense system with the system of NATO. Our  participation in the Partnership for Peace and a number of  agreements on bilateral military cooperation serve this purpose.  We have to maintain the momentum of joining the Partnership.  The combination of our arguments about the advantages--for  Poland and for Europe--of expanding NATO and of the realistic  nature of our offer within the Partnership are yielding good  results. Further results will depend on our diplomatic efforts  and even more so on the military dimension of our relations with  NATO. I want to stress here the full involvement of MON  [Ministry of National Defense] and the exemplary cooperation of  both our departments in the actions to date.    We will continue our efforts for NATO and WEU [Western  European Union] membership. We are moving closer toward both  these goals. In the case of NATO, we cannot count on any  spectacular results for the moment, unless some dramatic--and  potentially dangerous for us--events were to take place in  Russia. Consequently, our task for today is to maintain the  debate about what is happening. (...)    We attach special importance to the discussion with and in  the United States. A very important occasion for continuing  this discussion will be President Clinton's visit to Warsaw this  July.    We welcome with satisfaction our associate WEU partnership.  It constitutes the beginning of the road toward membership and  the basis for involvement in the work and activities of the  Union.    We are continuing our activity in the CSCE, where we are a  significant member. We are particular about the full  implementation by Poland and all partners of the agreements on  reducing arms and military activities in Europe and about the  clarity of these agreements. At the United Nations, we are  concentrating on activities that serve the resolution of  conflicts, the protection of human rights, and arms reductions  and disarmament.    Our activities for security are encountering obstacles. On  the one hand, there is the conservatism of Western institutions,  a fear of opening up, and an unwillingness to take up the  challenge connected with the election of new members and their  integration. On the other, there is the conservatism of  significant political circles in Russia that treat these  institutions as a threat to Russian national interests.  Regretfully, today such statements as Minister Kozyrev's last  year, that Russia "sees the NATO countries as natural friends  and in the future as allies," are rare.    The second fundamental foreign policy task is to ensure the  best possible conditions for permanent development of our  country in its entire economic and civilizational spectrum.  Since 1989, we have consistently been seeking these conditions  in integration with the European Communities. (...)    Just like then, we also can find no better possibilities  today for ensuring development conditions for Poland than  participation in the EU. (...)    Our future membership is accepted by the Union. An  expression  of this is the association treaty and the declaration of the  Copenhagen summit.    Poland must proceed toward the EU consistently and quickly.  Remaining outside it would mean being a politically marginalized  country that is economically discriminated against and forced to  submit to decisions made by others. This choice has no  alternative: Such are the realities of today's and the future  Europe. The most important task in 1994 is to determine as  specifically as possible the road toward Poland's EU membership.  We are making efforts for an undertaking from the Union on  Poland's acceptance that would be more binding than the  Copenhagen declaration. An important opportunity to obtain this  undertaking will be during the German presidency of the Union,  which is very well disposed toward our demands.    We are striving to initiate joint work on a scenario for  integrating Polish and European agriculture. (...)    We are also striving for further improvement in the access  of  goods and services to the Common Market, and we are  counteracting signs of protectionism. We are looking for ways  of joining in cooperation in areas covered by a joint EU  policy--trade, transportation, energy, agriculture,  environmental protection, finance, and so on. Finally, we are  striving for increased aid for Poland within PHARE [Economic  Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary], as well as from  other community funds, and for earmarking a greater part of them  than hitherto for investment purposes. (...)    The issue of European integration dominates our relations  with the West European states. We are increasing the  initiatives and diplomatic consultations involving them. The  visit by French Prime Minister Balladur this July will be an  important event. We will be convincing him that Poland's  participation in the EU will be to its advantage and not a  burden to it. We are intensifying dialogue with Great Britain,  the third state in the European big three, on ways of political  integration, of which that country is a convinced advocate.    The visit by the president and the prime minister to Italy  confirm the good relations with that country. We are looking  for new possibilities of cooperation with the medium and smaller  states of the EU--toward Greece, Spain, Ireland, and Portugal.  We are intensifying our action explaining our integration  plans. With the Nordic countries, we are looking for ways to  strengthen and utilize the promising prospects of dynamic  development of the Baltic region, linked inter alia to its  inclusion in the EU. In view of the approaching EU membership  of the four EFTA [European Free Trade Association] states,  reaching agreement with this group will be of great significance  for our participation in European integration. We will strive  for our trade relations with these states not to deteriorate.  (...)    Already today we must translate what are still for many  people abstract slogans about Poland's membership in the EU into  specific information and undertakings. This task is urgent,  given that the prospect of enlarging the Union is not at all  distant. (...)    The greatest threat to the policy of integration is  protectionism. This problem is still particularly important in  agriculture. In the association treaty, there is a lack of  strategic vision of integration in this sector, a lack of will  to create a common market in this area. Integration must take  many years here, however, and cannot take place without  conflicts. Until protectionist resistance is overcome and a  scenario for including Polish agriculture in the Community is  created, the prospects of membership will be uncertain. I do  not have to add that, from our side too, protectionist  tendencies constitute a real and the most serious threat, apart  from possible delays in the adaptation processes, to integration  into the EU.    The United States, together with the EU, plays an important  part in our efforts to ensure the best conditions for the  development of our country. Traditionally, the Poles see the  Americans, many of whom are of Polish origin, as friends who are  sympathetic and ready to cooperate and help. This results in  our deep belief in the need for a U.S. presence in Europe, for  our frequent contacts and very intensive political  dialogue--more lively than that with the European states--as  well as for the rapidly growing U.S. investments in Poland. Our  objective is to maintain this situation, our position as the  main U.S. partner in Central and East Europe, as well as to  obtain U.S. consent for our integration into NATO. We are  making promising progress. In the economic field, we attach  much importance to the program "of emerging large economic  markets". We like its philosophy, which characterizes sensible  investors: support for countries that manifest dynamic  development and that have conditions for becoming regional  driving forces and, consequently, important economic partners  for the United States.    We are particular about the perfection of our  multidimensional relations with the Holy See. An additional  reason for this today is the fact that the Holy Father is the  best disposed toward us foreign head of state. We must not  forget this when debating the ratification of the concordat,  because our relations will enter a difficult phase without it.    We are trying to broaden our circle of important economic  partners. We are looking for them among East Asian and Middle  East countries. (...)    This year's visits, President Walesa's to Japan and Prime  Minister Pawlak's to China, will provide opportunities to  present our plans and win over partners for them. We will  extend our Partnership for Development initiative toward them,  as well as toward other states that cooperate with us. Neither  do we forget the developing states. They include many people  who are very sympathetic to us. We maintain with them regular  contacts that are commensurate with our interests and abilities.    We are participating in the work on UN reform. We maintain  intense cooperation with the IMF, the World Bank, and the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. We have  applied for OECD membership, and we are trying to normalize the  conditions of our GATT membership. We have joined the World  Trade Organization created under the Uruguay Round. We have  started work to ensure our participation in the organization  that is to replace COCOM [Coordinating Committee on Export  Controls].    We are intensifying international cooperation on  environmental protection. This year we will sign appropriate  agreements with Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Belarus,  and Lithuania, and we will strengthen our presence in the Baltic  region. Together with the Sejm commissions, we want to  determine with greater precision the aims and means for the  promotion of Polish culture so that it can facilitate the  development of our country. We are seeking ways of linking  international scientific exchange to the economy, without which  its development would be constantly hindered by insufficient  state resources.    Perhaps the greatest progress we have made is in the field  of  creating conditions for the free development of personal  contacts. Today we can travel abroad without excessive formal  impediments. However, this does not mean that travel is easy and  that we are welcomed everywhere with open arms. Nor does it  mean that our relatives, fellow countrymen who permanently live  abroad, are well treated there and can visit us freely. We have  to expand and civilize our border crossing points. (...)    The provision for our fellow countrymen of their rightful,  proper, and safe conditions for cultivating their Polish  provenance is more difficult. We attach much importance to this  task. We consistently enforce the rights provided for under  international norms and guaranteed under agreements. We will  strive to protect Poles in Kazakhstan. We are continuing our  activities that serve to cultivate the Polish language,  traditions, and culture.    The most difficult task, however, is changing the Poles' and  foreigners' stereotyped images, both positive and negative.  Foreigners who are well disposed toward us see us as patriots  ready for heroic deeds, as fervent Catholics, and as romantics.  There is nothing in this image about enterprise, education, and  present-day know-how. It is dominated by grave faces, with  blood and horsemen in the background. Those who think ill of us  see Poles as lazy workers, cantankerous politicians, corrupt  bureaucrats, and fraudulent businessmen, and Poland as a country  of dirt and mess. In fact, both images are grim. They do not  encourage contacts. We have to change them, lighten them, show  that Poland is a country of great opportunities and talented  people. We have to promote Poles and Poland.    These are our three tasks--durable security, favorable  conditions for development, and freedom of personal  contacts--and the four greatest threats to them are intolerance,  conservatism, protectionism, and stereotypes. These are the  fundamental parameters of our foreign activity.    There is also a domestic dimension. Today it is perhaps the  most important one. Rarely in its history has Poland had such a  favorable situation and such good opportunities for development  as now. It is very much up to us whether we are going to make  use of these.    We are modernizing our foreign service. We want to eliminate  the lack of separation between the fields of "politics" and  "administration," which is no longer found in modern  democracies. We will achieve this by separating out in the  ministry the minister's political servicing apparatus. (...)    The official apparatus at the ministry will be headed by a  general secretary assisted by his deputies. The officials'  duties and powers, the criteria for their selection,  subordination, and promotion, will be defined by an act. I have  already sent the bill for interdepartmental consultation. (...)    Second, we would like to introduce a number of solutions  strengthening the coordination of foreign policy.</p>

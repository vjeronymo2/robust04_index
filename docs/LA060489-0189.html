			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRENCH OPEN TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> RAINDROPS DAMPEN DROP SHOTS IN PARIS  </P> <P> Maybe Lawson Duncan can find out who stole the sun in one of those detective  stories he loves to read.  </P> <P> Once again, rain was a winner at the French Open, where the day was not only  damp, but colorful. Green tarps were rolled over red clay under a gray sky.  </P> <P> Play was interrupted Saturday at Roland Garros for the second consecutive day,  but neither wind nor rain nor courts of clay could keep Duncan from his  appointed round, which is the round of 16.  </P> <P> A rare American clay-court specialist who has never made it past the second  round here, Duncan got his match in early and defeated Jerome Potier of France,  6-4, 6-0, 6-4. Duncan, from Asheville, N. C., is ranked 67th in the world and  he is 11-4 on clay since May.  </P> <P> Andre Agassi's timing was not quite as good as Duncan's. His match with Jim  Courier was halted because of darkness after each had won a set and Courier was  ahead, 4-2, in the third.  </P> <P> The rest of the top seeded players spent a trouble-free day, except for trying  to keep warm and dry. Ivan Lendl and Sweden's Stefan Edberg and Mats Wilander  won their third-round matches with ease.  </P> <P> On the women's side, the moment of the day was provided by Yugoslavia's  15-year-old Monica Seles, who upset fourth-seeded Zina Garrison of Houston,  6-3, 6-2.  </P> <P> Actually, Seles upset Garrison twice. The first time was when they walked on  the court and Seles began passing out some flowers she was carrying. Seles  tried to give a flower to Garrison, who backed off in disgust.  </P> <P> Although the crowd booed Garrison with vigor, she said later that she  considered a flower an inappropriate gift.  </P> <P> "That's just a bunch of big hype," she said. "That's something someone told her  to do. You're not out there to give flowers."  </P> <P> Seles nearly broke into tears when she explained that the flowers were her own  idea. Some of the ball boys had given them to her when she arrived at Roland  Garros, she said.  </P> <P> "I didn't want to cause anything with those flowers," Seles said.  </P> <P> "In Europe, if you want to show someone respect, you give flowers," she said.  "I just wanted it to be fun. I was surprised she didn't take it. I never  intended to hurt her."  </P> <P> Nearly any U.S. victory on clay is an upset here. Duncan, 24, grew up with  clay-court stars Bjorn Borg and Guillermo Vilas as his heroes, so when he gets  his feet on clay he loves it.  </P> <P> "On hard courts, when the ball travels at Mach 5, it's Kamikaze tennis," Duncan  said. "Serve, return, volley . . . serve, return, volley, pass.  </P> <P> "There's no exposure for U.S. players on clay, and that's really a shame," he  said.  </P> <P> Just before the rain came, Gabriela Sabatini's supposedly superior clay-court  game came close to being exposed as something less than the formidable  reputation it enjoys.  </P> <P> Sabatini, seeded No. 2 behind Steffi Graf of West Germany, was three points  away from losing in straight sets but pulled herself together to defeat Nicole  Provis of Australia, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.  </P> <P> Provis, a semifinalist here last year, chose the wrong time to slump. She won  only two points in five games, from the time Sabatini was serving to stay in  the match at 4-5 in the second set until the Argentine woman led, 2-0, in the  third.  </P> <P> Next for Sabatini is Mary Joe Fernandez of Miami, who started slowly but  finished fast to win her third-round match against Niege Dias of Brazil, 6-7  (7-3), 6-1, 6-1.  </P> <P> Fernandez has defeated Sabatini the last three times they have met -- but none  of the matches was on clay.  </P> <P> Duncan's next opponent is defending champion Wilander, seeded No. 4, who  stormed past Omar Camporese of Italy, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2).  </P> <P> "Feeling as good as I did today, it's hard to understand how I could have been  playing so bad the last couple of months," Wilander said. "I was hoping that by  the French Open I would be 100% both physically and mentally. It's a risky  attitude, but I'm much better now."  </P> <P> Sixth-seeded Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland was down and nearly out but came back  to defeat Leonardo Lavelle of Mexico, 4-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.  </P> <P> Hlasek's path to the quarterfinals is blocked by Alberto Mancini of Argentina,  who defeated qualifier Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands, 6-4, 6-4, 6-3, in 1  hour 25 minutes. Mancini is 0-2 against Hlasek, but both defeats were in  exhibitions and occurred before the hot streak Mancini is enjoying.  </P> <P> "He is a good player, but I think he plays much better on hard court, so I  think I have a good chance to beat him," Mancini said. "Now, when I lose, I am  surprised."  </P> <P> Seventeen-year-old Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia took only 1 hour 30 minutes  to defeat Australian Mark Woodforde, 6-3, 6-4, 6-0.  </P> <P> Ivanisevic will play Edberg, a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4, winner over Jimmy Arias.  </P> <P> Michael Chang will face the top-seeded Lendl, who defeated Darren Cahill of  Australia in the growing darkness, 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, 6-3. Chang won his  third-round match over Spanish qualifier Francisco Roig, 6-0, 7-5, 6-3.  </P> <P> Tennis Notes  </P> <P> Michael Chang (17 years 3 months) is the youngest player remaining in the  field. His advance into the fourth round here equals his best Grand Slam  result, which was in the U.S. Open last year. . . . Sergio Bruguera of Spain,  who ended 1988 at No. 333 on the ATP computer and is now up to No. 44, will  play Ronald Agenor of Haiti in the fourth round. Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet  Union will play the winner of Courier-Agassi. The other fourth-round matches  pit Jay Berger against Theirry Tulasne of France and Guillermo Perez-Roldan of  Argentina against Boris Becker of West Germany.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA  </P> <P> A jury found a jail inmate guilty Wednesday of second-degree murder in the  beating death of another prisoner in the South Bay jail in Chula Vista.  </P> <P> After deliberating one day, the San Diego Superior Court jury convicted Steve  Edward Morrison, 39, of San Diego, in the May 7, 1989, death of Luis Jose Mena,  45.  </P> <P> Mena was attacked on April 14, 1989, and suffered brain damage and a skull  fracture, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Evan Miller. Mena died three and a  half weeks later in a hospital.  </P> <P> Miller said the motive for the attack was Morrison's hatred of child molesters.  Mena had been convicted of molestation in 1985 and was back in jail on a parole  violation when he was killed.  </P> <P> Morrison was in jail at the time on a burglary charge and suspicion of  violating parole, as he too has other felony convictions.  </P> <P> Miller said Morrison faces a maximum sentence of 20 years to life in state  prison, if he gets extra time for having prior felony offenses.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGHSTYLE: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> THE PLIA CHAIR  </P> <P> IT FOLDS AND STACKS -- rarely does one chair do both. The affordable Plia chair  (named after the Italian word for fold), designed in 1968 by Bologna,  Italy-based Giancarlo Piretti and made by Castelli (now owned by Krueger  International) is probably the best-selling "art" chair of all time: more than  6 million Plias have been sold in its two-decade existence. About 70,000 Plias  still sell annually. Interviewed during West Week at the Pacific Design Center  last February, Piretti recalled the design process that gave birth to the Plia:  "If you look at a conventional folding chair in profile, you'll see that it has  three joints. I found a way of shrinking the triangular mechanism to a single  joint, which looked so elegant and beautiful I wanted to make it fully visible.  That, in turn, led to the transparent seat."  </P> <P> Castelli had trouble ironing out one bug in the chair, however: After years of  steady use, the early-vintage Plia chairs I owned one by one cracked,  invariably at a dinner party, under a guest who was just then lifting a glass  of red wine. In fairness, Piretti points out that the Plia was intended as an  occasional chair, not to be used as an everyday dining chair.  </P> <P> Notwithstanding the chair's engineering ingenuity, what accounts for the Plia's  astonishing appeal is its transparency, which automatically makes it the  perfect choice for a cramped apartment, or the chair to place over a beloved  Persian rug when you can't bear to cover up the pattern. But that transparency  worried people at first, Piretti said, mimicking a timid expression and  gingerly settling his weight into the seat. "Other customers never could adjust  to the transparent seat, so for them we came out with a smoke-colored version."  </P> <P> The Plia chair is available at Bullock's and through Krueger International,  Pacific Design Center, Los Angeles; telephone (213) 659-2133. Available in a  chrome or paint frame with seat and back of red, green, white or black plastic  ($118 to $143 retail), clear or smoke transparent plastic ($128) or cane  ($274).  </P></p>

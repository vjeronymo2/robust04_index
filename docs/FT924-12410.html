			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Swedish property group in the red NCC, one of Sweden's leading property and construction groups, made a loss of SKr109m (Dollars 19m) for the first eight months of the year, compared with a profit of SKr242m in the same period last year. These figures include the group's share of profits from associated companies. Its consolidated sales fell slightly to SKr14.3bn from SKr14.6bn. Profits (after net financial items), which exclude the associated companies, were down to SKr165m from SKr321m. The company said it did not expect to make a profit for the whole of the year. Mr Torsten Eriksson, NCC's president, said preliminary estimates suggested a write-down requirement on its property portfolio of between SKr700m and SKr1bn for the full year. He added that the company would have negative, but improving, cash-flow through next year, with a positive one by 1994. The company's real estate sector suffered a SKr187m loss, compared with one of SKr70m for the same period of 1991, while it also made a SKr144 deficit in its exchange-listed subsidiaries and associated companies. The contraction in Sweden's construction sector continues to hit the group's building activities, but NCC still made a SKr502m profit in that part of its business compared with SKr506m for the same period of 1991. The company also pointed out its on-going rationalisation programme as well as an internal reorganisation had brought SKr500m in savings over the year and it expected to reduce its balance sheet by SKr4bn this year compared with 1991.</p>

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Business group attacks plan to deregulate London's buses LONDON FIRST, the business-led organisation set up last year with strong government backing to map a strategy for development of the British capital, has added its voice to criticism of government proposals to deregulate the city's buses. In a policy paper London First warns that deregulation could 'undermine the effectiveness of London's transport system' if current plans are not modified. It warns that the current powers of London's Traffic Commissioner 'would not be sufficient to avoid the chaos that could ensue on London's roads'. Outside London, it says, deregulation has generally been accompanied by falling bus usage. 'In most areas deregulation has led to significant dislocation in services and confusion for passengers, particularly in the first 2-3 years after introduction.' London First - set up last October to provide strategic thinking to maintain and enhance London's reputation as a world-class city - has no formal political affiliation. It has support from more than 40 companies, the Confederation of British Industry, London Tourist Board, Business in the Community, and London Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry. It says in the policy paper that it is 'critical' for the government to avoid a 'rapid and wholesale' move to deregulation and urges ministers to incorporate three main elements into proposals under development. The government should: Upgrade bus travel infrastructure such as information systems and ticketing. Establish a 'sound' base of competitors. Provide an effective operating environment. Without these elements deregulation has the potential to 'jeopardise the significant improvements already achieved' in London's bus operating efficiency and service quality. The government's plans to bring London into line with bus services outside the capital, which were deregulated in the mid-1980s, have been criticised by local authorities and London Transport on the grounds they will lead to road congestion and fare rises. The Commons transport committee said last month the government should think again if its plans would mean abandoning the travelcard season ticket. Ministers are expected to bring forward legislation for deregulation in the next session of parliament beginning in November. Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, conceded earlier this year that fine-tuning of the government's plans might be needed. But Mr Steven Norris, a junior transport minister, told the transport committee in May that deregulation would proceed since this was the only way 'to offer the services people want'. Measures urged by London First include: Implementing bus priority measures within four years on at least half of the designated 600 miles of key routes. Ensuring the Countdown real time passenger information system is 'fully tested and rolled out' before deregulation. Pressing ahead with an agreed system of electronic ticketing to help ensure network and concessionary fare schemes are protected. Imposing operating controls on access to key routes and bus stops.</p>

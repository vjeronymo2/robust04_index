			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Socialists returned to power in Greek election GREECE'S veteran socialist leader, Mr Andreas Papandreou, made a remarkable political comeback last night when his party triumphed in the country's general election after four years in opposition. Looking frail, the 74-year-old socialist pledged a foreign policy that would restore Greece's authority and an economic policy that would ensure 'stability, growth and social protection'. Mr Papandreou lost power in 1989 dogged by ill health and controversy. His health allowed him to make few appearances in the latest election campaign and his victory statement on television was made from behind his desk at his home in Athens. With just over half the votes counted, his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) led with 46.4 per cent, compared with just 40.6 per cent for the conservative New Democracy party of Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis. Computer projections indicated that Pasok would finish with almost 47 per cent of the vote and New Democracy with about 40 per cent. That would give the socialists a clear majority with 169 seats in the 300-member parliament under an electoral law that awards extra seats to the front-running party. Political Spring, a conservative splinter group founded three months ago by Mr Antonis Samaras, a former foreign minister, was in third place with 4.8 per cent of the votes. The only other party to be represented in parliament will be the hardline Communist party, which was set to win 4.3 per cent of the vote. New Democracy appeared to have lost most support to Political Spring, which forced the election six months early by persuading two conservative deputies to defect. Mr Mitsotakis, conceding defeat, said he was resigning the New Democracy leadership. 'New Democracy followed the correct path,' he said. 'It took painful but necessary decisions and it paid the political cost.' The conservatives' popularity was hit by efforts to restructure the economy, including a public sector wage freeze, closures of loss-making state enterprises and a failed attempt to privatise utilities. Voters appeared to have cast aside doubts that Mr Papandreou may not be strong enough to run the country. He has proved an unexpected political survivor, despite leading a secluded life since undergoing heart surgery while prime minister in 1988. He has shrugged off controversy surrounding his marriage. His recovery dates from his acquittal last year on financial corruption charges.</p>

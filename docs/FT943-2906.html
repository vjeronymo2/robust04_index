			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: BP emerges from retrenchment era - Output predicted to show steady increase into the next century British Petroleum yesterday disclosed details of its future exploration and production strategy, in a move which reinforced its recent message that it has now emerged from a protracted period of retrenchment. In an upbeat and wide-ranging briefing to industry analysts in London, Mr John Browne, managing director of BP Exploration, said the company was set to expand annual oil and gas production by two and six per cent respectively into the next century. The steady rise in output would result from improved recovery rates from fields in Alaska and the North Sea - the current focus of BP operations - and the development of new projects, many of them in the developing world. Mr Browne used the occasion to announce the discovery of two big natural gas fields off south Vietnam, the latest in a series of gas finds which will reduce the company's dependence on oil. Recoverable gas reserves from the offshore Nam Con Son basin were 2 trn cubic feet. That is large enough for the discovery to 'play a key role in supplying Vietnam's emerging gas market,' said Mr Browne. Mr Browne said gas would form a growing part of BP's business. In addition to Vietnam, it has recently found a large gas field in Colombia, where demand has been rising by 10 per cent a year. The company is also negotiating with Sonatrach, the Algerian state energy company, on a project to develop a gas field which would be linked by pipeline to southern Europe. BP also had 'significant' undeveloped gas reserves in Papua New Guinea which might justify a costly liquified natural gas project. Mr Browne said BP would have to develop local or regional gas markets to exploit its growing gas reserves. That would require it to enter new businesses, such as power generation. But Mr Browne said it would only do so with experienced partners. The projected growth in oil production was likely to be accompanied by further cuts in costs. Over the past five years finding costs have fallen from about Dollars 5 a barrel to Dollars 2, and development costs from Dollars 10 a barrel to between Dollars 4 and Dollars 5. Mr Browne expressed satisfaction with the portfolio of assets and potential projects outlined yesterday, and said it was the culmination of five years of effort. Since 1989 annual exploration budgets have fallen by a third to Dollars 600m. But spending has been focused on new areas, which could account for 300,000-400,000 barrels a day of new production within five years. Although many of the new areas are in countries with higher political risk profiles, Mr Browne said developed OECD countries would still account for 75 per cent of the company's output in 2004. He stressed that BP, which was forced into retrenchment two years ago because of an over-ambitions expansion and investment programme, had adopted a new strategy to avoid making similar mistakes in future. It will now split upstream development projects into phases to reduce risk and to avoid the bunching of large-scale capital commitments. 'Not all these projects will work out,' he said. 'And we won't make choices until we have to, when we will take into account a number of factors, including the economics of the time and moves by the competition.'</p>

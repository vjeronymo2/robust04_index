			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR MURDOCH, A LIFE 'ADDICTED TO WRITING'  </P> <P> Those who have intuited (Dame Iris Murdoch's favorite verb) that the Oxford  author is not totally of this world will not be surprised to hear that her face  has the familiarity of a legendary creature -- the sort you might glimpse  tangled in ivy leaves on an ancient oak tree, or reflected in a silty black  pond of unplumbed depths.  </P> <P> She wore a perfectly ordinary blue jumper with a striped cotton shirt and  gallery-going black lace-up shoes with sturdy soles as she walked across the  lobby of New York's Regency Hotel. Still, she has a fey air about her,  suggesting she might wear a cap with tassels and shoes with peaks and bells to  dance on the green on Midsummer's Night.  </P> <P> The British writer would likely reject, huffily, the suggestion that she is in  any way related to the Wee People -- she makes a big thing about having left  her Dublin birthplace for London when she was 9.  </P> <P> Still, at 70, the resemblance is there -- in the short, generous stature,  heart-shaped face with deeply dimpled chin and hair swirling around her face  like blond Spanish moss. Certainly those dark blue eyes peer out warily, like  those of some wild creature of the forest, full of knowledge of burrows and  barrows and arcane methods of eluding capture.  </P> <P> Hers are not at all like the fox eyes she describes in "The Philosopher's  Pupil": "cold pale eyes, which were somber and ruthless and sad, awful eyes  which knew not of the human world."  </P> <P> Or like those of the Philosopher himself, whose "stare was startled and  disconcerting as if, when he looked at someone, he simultaneously recalled  something awful which had nothing to do with the person looked at."  </P> <P> The oft-honored novelist was in New York recently: to see the pictures at the  museums and collections; to receive the National Arts Club's Medal of Honor for  Literature at a gala in its historic house on Gramercy Park; and to talk about  her new book, her 24th, "The Message to the Planet" (Viking).  </P> <P> To the black-tie dinner, she went willingly enough. Her speech she wrote in her  customary precise longhand, crossed out and inserted.  </P> <P> She spoke pleasantly to those who claimed to have read all 24 books and wanted  her to autograph even their paperback copies. She listened without grimacing to  master of ceremonies Timothy S. Healy, now president of the New York Public  Library. And upon receipt of the medal itself, she admired it enthusiastically.  </P> <P> As for being interviewed, well, she's very polite, using the disarming  technique of questioning the questioner as a way of providing answers of her  own.  </P> <P> Anyone who's read Murdoch would approach her diffidently, worrying about acting  like one of the pupils or disciples who harass her guru, her holy man, her  philosopher.  </P> <P> In novel after novel, the seekers hunt him (her divine courier is never a  woman, nor are her narrators) down. In the new book, the philosopher is Marcus;  he is "taken for a god," and comes to "symbolize perfect goodness." But Marcus  is more troubled than enthralled by the exercise of his powers.  </P> <P> "He had discovered that he had magical powers, paranormal powers," she writes.  "There's a lot of paranormal about," Dame Murdoch said, defending a willed  death, faith healing and other remarkable events in her new book.  </P> <P> "One of the problems of life is to distinguish between demons, magic and God,"  she said.  </P> <P> And then, in her customary defense of turning the questions on the questioner,  she demanded: "Have you ever met a saint?"  </P> <P> The stunned interviewer racked her memory for a saint but couldn't find one.  Neither, apparently, could Murdoch. "I have never met a saint. I have met very  good people, very unselfish -- but the word saint suggests something elevated,  superhuman. I have met many demons, some beneficent, but still demonic. And I  have known many very great people in my life, even geniuses -- but never felt  it a religious matter."  </P> <P> Murdoch believes, she said, in "puzzling things."  </P> <P> But she distinguishes between the "paranormal, poltergeists or furniture flying  around" -- she thinks such things may well have more to do with powers or  forces that may be "scientific" -- than the powers obtainable from a spiritual  life.  </P> <P> "You don't have to live in Tibet, you can live in South Kensington and still  undertake religious disciplines to acquire unusual powers. To die by your own  will, I don't know -- these things always seem to happen more in Tibet than in  California -- but you never know what goes on in California.  </P> <P> "I have known people who practice Buddhist technique or devotion. I was taught  Buddhist meditation -- I even once thought of becoming a Buddhist. But  Christian meditation can lead to unusual forms of life. Being selfless or  detached from the world is unusual enough -- unusual perhaps because ordinary  life is so usual."  </P> <P> She still meditates regularly, using a Christian form of a mantra, "but not as  much as I once did or should. But from the fact that I did it ardently for a  very long time, something remains. I wish the technique were taught to  children. It does what prayer used to do. It helps remove oneself to another  kind of being. You relax; it's not a matter of thought, but you find the things  that are worrying you, vanities, desires, and you are liberated. It's a kind of  escape. It does sound pompous, but you soon return to normal."  </P> <P> Murdoch, for all her glimpses of the unknowable (Hier ist Kein Warum -- she  quotes the saying, "Here is no why"), her aphorisms, her epigrams, her Minoan  maze plots.  </P> <P> But as high-flown as her prose is, she paces it with the prosaic. She uses  food, for instance, as she said, "to give a pattern to the day. One of the  problems of the novel is to make the ordinary life of the character proceed.  </P> <P> "I like reading in books about people eating," she said.  </P> <P> And a reader is always told what people are eating.  </P> <P> "The Message to the Planet" begins with a group of male friends eating "fish  cakes and boiled potatoes followed by bread and cheese, followed by chocolate  biscuits."  </P> <P> And they drink so much whiskey and talk about Marcus Vallar so long that they  have to have brown bread and Cheddar cheese as well.  </P> <P> "The Sea, the Sea," is full of almost-recipes for food -- provided by Murdoch's  husband, Oxford professor, writer, critic and chef John Bayley. Dame Iris does  not cook.  </P> <P> "I cooked for a short while after I was married. But I didn't like to cook.  When my husband saw what an awful cook I was, he took over. He's a creative  cook -- he could write an interesting cookbook."  </P> <P> She uses other devices to bring her characters to earth. The writer points out  that Tolstoy, in "Anna Karenina," curses her lover with a toothache while he's  walking up and down in the cold on the train platform. "It makes you think:  human life, how awful. The world has collapsed around you -- and you have a  toothache." She herself has asthma and occasionally plagues her characters with  it.  </P> <P> Murdoch carefully describes rooms, houses (notably the one in "The Sea, the  Sea" where eerie faces peered through windows of interior rooms. Her character  decides, "It was not exactly a sinister or menacing effect, but as if the house  were a sensitized plate which intermittently registered things which had  happened in the past -- or, as it now occurred to me for the first time, were  going to happen in the future").  </P> <P> She writes every day "all day," when she's not in New York, or California,  France or Belgium, or running the house or doing the shopping -- "there are  intrusions, though I'm fortunate enough not to have many."  </P> <P> As you might expect from one who has written 24 books and three plays in less  than 40 years, she's quite settled -- some might say "sot in her ways" about  writing.  </P> <P> Amazingly enough, her manuscripts -- pages and pages of her small, neat  handwriting -- go to her agent or publisher in fat, heavy blue laundry bags.  </P> <P> She always uses the same sort of paper and instruments -- which may sound a bit  superstitious to non-practitioners of the trade but is common enough among  writers. She uses the same sort of notebooks to write all her novels, using one  side of the page so as to leave room on the other for second thoughts. And she  always "writes with a real fountain pen. It seems to me to be the way to think.  I can't imagine thinking with a machine between me and the screen. Of course, a  pen is a machine. But I've never touched a typewriter.  </P> <P> "I had always used blue-black ink, as my father did. I was very much attached  to my father, a bookish man, a civil servant who was very precise about  writing. Not long ago, I changed to blue. I'm not sure what it signifies."  </P> <P> Her change of ink is obviously no rejection of her childhood. "I had marvelous  parents. It's rather an advantage to being an only child. Only in later life  did I learn that children don't always get along with parents."  </P> <P> To those who speak of the ease of a computer, she says frostily, "I rather do  my own writing, not let my computer do it. I like to keep my sentences more  closely on a rein." And indeed, every Murdoch word reads as though  premeditated. "I have it all in my mind before I begin," she has said.  </P> <P> Perhaps this prewriting is the reason she doesn't report the feeling many  writers (as well as artists, actors and athletes) sometimes have of "going with  the flow" -- automatic writing or plugging in to the universal muse.  </P> <P> "There are moments," she concedes, "when you feel your heart beats faster. You  feel something. There is an energy -- days when you can do nothing and days  when you can do everything -- days when it goes and days when it doesn't."  </P> <P> Her work is her pleasure. "I'm firmly addicted to writing. I do read a good  deal, the great novels in English, Russian -- and of course French for Proust.  I know these novels by heart. The element of surprise is no longer there."  </P></p>

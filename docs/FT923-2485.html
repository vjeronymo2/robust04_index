			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Two strikes add to French unease THE French government yesterday attempted to defuse embarrassing industrial disputes with prison officers and airline pilots to calm the political climate before Sunday's referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The justice ministry suspended more than 100 striking prison officers following the breakdown of talks with the prison unions on Tuesday. Four warders at Saint-Quentin-Fallavier jail in Isere started a hunger strike outside the prison gate to protest against their suspension. Conditions in many jails have deteriorated since the dispute started last weekend after inmates murdered an officer at Clairvaux jail. The ministry claimed the situation was improving, with 107 of France's 182 jails affected by the dispute yesterday compared with 140 on Tuesday. However, there were violent incidents at many prisons including a clash between riot police and picketing officers outside Rodez jail. Since the strike began the government has been haunted by television images of rioting prisoners and warders complaining about inadequate security. The government yesterday faced the additional blow of a 24-hour strike by airline pilots protesting against proposed changes in working arrangements which, they claim, will result in longer flight times and shorter restbreaks. Air France was forced to cancel a quarter of its European flights, but managed to operate its long haul service. Air Inter, the domestic airline, axed a third of its flights as did TAT, the European airline.</p>

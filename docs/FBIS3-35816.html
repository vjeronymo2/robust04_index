According to him, the lifting of tough state control over  the  press does not mean the press is now free, because mafia-like  structures are all too eager to snatch control over information  outlets.    "Unless the press becomes economically independent, one  monopolist will only be replaced by another," Poltoranin said.    For this reason, demonopolisation of the press is seen by  him  as the key issue in the work of the Russian State Duma's  Information Policy Committee he heads.    Poltoranin, who said in an interview published by  ROSSIISKAYA  GAZETA today that the committee he is now heading has many ideas  concerning the demonopolisation of the press, stressed that his  ultimate goal was to "to deprive all power structures of their  own pocket information outlets".    "All publications must be independent", Poltoranin said,  "and  the government should subsidise new publications only during the  first year of publishing. If authorities want their decrees and  resolutions to be published, they must sign contracts,"  Poltoranin concluded.</p>

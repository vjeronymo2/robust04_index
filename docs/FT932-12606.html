			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Bosnia Conflict: UN concern at flare-up in Bosnia SERB forces yesterday defied the international community by launching an attack in Moslem-held north-western Bosnia just as tough new United Nations sanctions went into force against Belgrade. Fighting also erupted in other parts of former Yugoslavia, one day after Bosnian Serbs refused to accept an international peace plan signed by rival Moslems and Croats. About 100 Serb troops backed by 10 tanks and artillery advanced several miles into the area around the north-western town of Bihac early yesterday, a spokesman for the UN forces said. UN military observers stationed in the Bihac region reported fighting in four locations in the area, where 300,000 people are being supplied with aid by the UN. The new fighting was sure to anger the international community, which started applying sanctions against the Serbian-led rump Yugoslavia yesterday and is considering limited military intervention to halt the year-old civil war. In Belgrade, a map showing the locations of bomb shelters in the city was published by 'popular demand' in Vecernje Novosti, the mass circulation daily. Nato chiefs, meeting in Brussels yesterday, focused on a narrowing set of options ranging from air strikes to the setting up of protected zones. The top-level committee meeting was attended by General Colin Powell, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff. The allies were awaiting an announcement on a possible visit this week by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of State, to European capitals. These were expected to include London, Paris, Bonn, Rome and Moscow. Mr Christopher, testifying to a senate panel in Washington yesterday, set rigorous criteria for the use of force by the US. He said the use of force had to meet four tests: the goal would have to be stated clearly to the American people; there must be a strong likelihood the use of force could be successful; there must be an exit strategy; and a programme that could sustain the support of the American people. There was a consensus in Brussels that any bombing of military positions or supply lines would involve some degree of alliance involvement, and it was made clear that Washington would not obtain backing from allies without specific authority from the UN. Nato contingency planning has so far concentrated on formation of a peacekeeping force which would back up the Vance-Owen peace plan if a ceasefire were established. But officials said these plans - calling mainly on US, British, French and Russian troops - had now been 'put on ice'. Officials said there had been 'reasonably detailed' consideration of different kinds of safe areas for Bosnian Moslems. The lowest level would just involve 'relief zones'. Alternatively safe areas might be set up inside perimeters controlled by UN troops, but without the forces necessary to withstand heavy attacks. Another option would be more heavily defended safe havens modelled on the precedent of northern Iraq. In Stockholm, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said the options did not exclude lifting the UN embargo on arms shipments to Bosnian Moslem forces. However, he said that such a move would require careful consideration before it could be accepted as 'a wise decision'. Speaking at a press conference after a two-day visit to Sweden, Mr Hurd said he did not believe it was possible in practice to lift the arms embargo for one party only. A decision to end the embargo, which would require a UN Security Council resolution, would therefore involve a shift in policy from one of trying to stop the fighting in Bosnia to allowing the combatants to fight it out to the finish.</p>

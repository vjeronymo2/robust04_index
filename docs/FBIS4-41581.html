			<p>BFN     [Text] Vladimir Kazimirov, the plenipotentiary  representative of the Russian President, and Jan Eliasson,  chairman of CSCE Minsk Group, sent a letter to Azerbaijani  President Geydar Aliyev.    The cable says: Esteemed Mr. President, during the  consultations held in Moscow on 22 and 23 June concerning the  resolution of the Karabakh conflict, we noted with satisfaction  that the cease-fire called for on 12 May through the Russian  mediation and CSCE's support is generally being observed. The  cease-fire agreement that has been ratified with the signatures  of the defense ministers and army commanders is an essential  factor for ending the dispute. However, we express our  uneasiness at the human loss and material damage recently caused  by several clashes on the Armenian-Azerbaijan border. We regard  any attempt to violate the cease-fire as dangerous.    Within the framework of our joint efforts, we call on all  the  sides to adhere to the following in order to end the conflict:    1. The sides should demonstrate in words and deeds their  loyalty to the obligations they have undertaken in signing the  cease-fire agreement.    2. The sides should avoid any hostile activity that may  undermine the atmosphere of confidence, which is being created.    3. The sides should take adequate [preceding word in  English] measures to peacefully resolve and remove the existing  disputes.    4. With a view of signing a political agreement to end the  armed conflict and in order to further activate the peace  process, the sides should resolutely take advantage of the  existing peaceful situation. They should make a strenuous  effort to put into effect the clear demand for an end to the  bloody conflict between the people and the solution of all the  contentious issues at the negotiating table.</p>

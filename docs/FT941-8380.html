			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Fashion: The Global Wardrobe - Going Shopping / In the third part of our series on dress codes around the world, FT writers look at how the people of five major cities dress to go shopping If you want to know what New Yorkers wear when they shop, follow a simple rule: look where they are shopping. At Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue, New York's wealthier women - Tom Wolfe's famed 'social X-rays' - wear clothes from the store's collections. At Barneys, either uptown or downtown, the male shoppers dress the way they always have - like members of some kind of European cultural mafia. The women wear black and look grumpy. A lot depends upon the season. In summer, anything will suffice so long as it is cool and comfortable. And with most of New York's movers and shakers out of the city between July and September, it doesn't really matter what you wear. Winter, however, is different. This is the season for a show, and the show is rarely better than at Christmas. Picture the scene: a very crowded Fifth Avenue on Christmas Eve. Amid the crush, a tall, elegantly dressed man, arms full of presents, hails a cab. He is wearing a Della Rovere cashmere sweater, woollen Dries Van Noten pants, and a flowing, warm green Ronaldus Shamask coat, topped off with a dashing trilby from Van Dyck Hatters of Greenwich Avenue. As he departs, there is a glimpse of sensible dark socks from Brooks Brothers encased in sturdy John Lobb shoes, and the final sounds of the crunch of snow as he steps off the sidewalk into the cab heading east on 58th Street.</p>

Any such consideration is beyond the scope of this regulatory amendment, and would require an amendment to the FMP. The commenter should make this proposal to the Council for its consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 9: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter noted that the current regulations require that the size endorsement for a permit endorsed for trawl gear that is transferred to a smaller vessel be downgraded to the length overall of the smaller vessel. The commenter suggested that this regulation would prevent a larger trawl vessel from leasing his permit to a smaller vessel, thus restricting the number of people who might lease a trawl permit. He noted that leasing a 90-foot (27.4 m) trawl permit to a 60-foot (18.3 m) vessel would result in a temporary reduction in harvest capacity, which would be consistent with the objectives of the limited entry program. He recommended revising the limited entry regulations to allow leasing of trawl permits to smaller vessels without having the permit permanently downsized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NMFS agrees that leasing a trawl permit with a large size endorsement to a smaller trawl vessel would be consistent with the goals and objectives of the limited entry program. Amendment 6, however, specifically requires that, if a permit endorsed for trawl gear is registered to a trawl vessel more than 5 ft shorter than the size endorsed on the permit, the permit will be re-endorsed with the length overall of the smaller vessel. In a trip-limit fishery, for example, there may be greater profit from fishing with a smaller vessel. Taking advantage of this would require downsizing the permit. This is one of the means by which Amendment 6 intended to reduce harvest capacity in the groundfish fishery. This provision cannot be changed, except by further amending the FMP. The commenter should take his request to the Council for its consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 10: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters who supported NMFS Initial Alternative I argued that, if the NMFS preferred approach were adopted, the schedule for vessels above 200 ft (61.0 m) in length should be modified slightly to increase the number of permits required for vessels between 200 and 250 ft (61.0 and 76.2 m) in length. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Production data that NMFS examined for the top 25 percent of the factory trawler fleet showed a modest increase in production as vessel length increased. NMFS believes that the modest increase in the number of permits required by the NMFS preferred approach for vessels between 200 and 400 ft (61.0 and 121.9 m) in length fairly represents harvest capacity as suggested by the production data available from the fishery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 11: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters noted that NMFS accepted either the documented length on the U.S. Coast Guard Documentation (CG&hyph;1270) or a marine survey as documentation of ``length overall'' to determine the appropriate size endorsement when initially issuing limited entry permits. They argued that NMFS should continue to accept either form of documentation when determining the ``length overall'' and the necessary size endorsement for a permit for a vessel that results from the combination of two or more smaller permits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The limited entry plan and the regulations require the use of ``length overall'' for permit size endorsements. This was done so there would be a standard length measure that would be comparable across all vessels and vessel sizes. Length overall was adopted because it is routinely used and is explained in Coast Guard regulations. When the NMFS Northwest Region Fisheries Permit Office began receiving permit applications for initial issuance of limited entry permits, applicants were not required to submit a marine survey showing ``length overall.'' The first permits issued were endorsed with the length shown on the CG&hyph;1270. In most cases, the length shown on the CG&hyph;1270, if not the ``length overall,'' was a shorter length derived from the U.S. Coast Guard ``Standard'' system of measurement. In these cases, the use of the length on the CG&hyph;1270 as ``length overall'' was to the detriment of the permit recipient because permits could have been endorsed for the larger ``length overall'' measurement. Initial permit recipients were notified of this discrepancy and offered the opportunity to submit a marine survey or builder's certificate showing ``length overall'' of the qualifying vessel. Upon receipt of these documents, NMFS issued new permits with the size endorsement showing true ``length overall.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For transfers and permit combination (upgrades), use of the improper length measurement for the new vessel operates to the benefit of the individual applicant, but to the disadvantage of the limited entry program, by allowing increases in the overall fishing capacity through granting permits based on length measurements that are not comparable to the measure required by the regulations. NMFS will continue to require either a marine survey or builder's certificate to document actual ``length overall'' of any vessel receiving a new permit through permit combination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 12: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three commenters favored the NMFS preferred approach. Two commenters noted that adoption of the NMFS preferred option would be less disruptive to the fishery for factory trawlers, since some had purchased permits using this option as a guideline, and because there would be little time between the issuance of this rule and the start of the whiting season, April 15, within which to obtain additional permits if NMFS issued a more restrictive schedule. One commenter favoring the NMFS preferred approach was concerned that, under a more restrictive alternative, more vessels would sell their permits and enter another fishery such as the shrimp fishery, resulting in over-capitalization of that fishery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments are noted. The NMFS preferred approach is being promulgated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 13: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Fourteen commenters believed that implementation of the NMFS preferred approach would result in more factory trawlers purchasing permits and entering the whiting fishery than if the Council's recommendation, Initial Alternative II, were implemented. These commenters believed that more factory trawlers entering the whiting fishery would deprive coastal catcher boats of potential whiting markets with at-sea processors. As a result, many coastal catcher vessels would be forced to fish for traditional (non-whiting) groundfish species, adding additional capacity into an already overcapitalized fishery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

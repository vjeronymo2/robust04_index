			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 14 June  publish editorials, reports, and articles on former U.S.  President Jimmy Carter's upcoming visit to North Korea.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,200-word  editorial entitled "North Korea's Withdrawal from IAEA and  Carter's Visit to North Korea." The editorial notes that Carter,  who is expected to meet North and South Korea's presidents at a  time when the North Korean nuclear issue has become the top  world issue, can be regarded as the most important nuclear  envoy. However, the editorial states that North Korea, while  waiting for Carter, chose a hardline position, namely the  withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA,  instead of making an appeasement gesture, and put a wet blanket  on the expectations for Carter's visit, thus causing people to  worry about the possibility of Kim Il-song taking advantage of  Carter's visit. Recalling Kim Il-song's past tactics to  selectively invite Americans and give them the warm treatment,  the editorial stresses that Kim Il-song's propagandistic remarks  have more falsehood than truth as shown in the case of North  Korea's promise to allow the IAEA's nuclear inspections. The  editorial points out that "even if the United States begins to  support North Korea's light-water reactor, North Korea will  undoubtedly continue extracting plutonium from the so-called  'military facilities' while pretending that it froze the  extraction of plutonium only in a certain reactor."    The editorial then calls on Jimmy Carter to keenly be aware  of this situation during his visit to North Korea, and not be  dragged into Kim Il-song's deceitful tactics. The paper  concludes that "at a time when the people think that there is no  other means but sanctions, Carter's visit may be the last  opportunity for North Korea. North Korea should not attempt to  use Carter just as it has used other people who visited North  Korea in the past."    CHOSON ILBO also publishes on page 4 a 1,500-word article by  reporter Kim Tu-sik, under the headline "Carter's Visit to North  Korea--What He Should Do and What He Should Not Do in  Pyongyang." The article notes that the people are hoping that  during his visit to North Korea, Carter will clearly convey to  the Kim Il-song regime the resolute will of the international  community for a solution to the North Korean nuclear problem.  The paper expresses the hope that "Carter will emphasize that  only when North Korea immediately allows the 'special  inspection' of two undeclared nuclear facilities in Yongbyon as  demanded by the ROK and the United States, can North Korea get  rid of the sanctions crisis." The paper then stresses that  "Carter should urge North Korea to make public the record on the  extraction of plutonium in the past and detailed additional  information on the operational plan of the reactor in Yongbyon."  The article adds that Carter should raise the issue of reform  and openness of the North Korean society, as well as its human  rights issue.    As the points that Carter should refrain from doing, the  article emphasizes that Carter should not give a wrong message  that may encourage North Korea's hopes; should refrain from  causing North Korea to misunderstand that he is a special envoy  of the U.S. Government, and should not exaggerate the result of  his visit to North Korea. The paper concludes by saying that our  government will inform Jimmy Carter of our aforementioned hope  before he crosses Panmunjom on 15 June.    The moderate daily TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a  1,200-word editorial entitled "We Call On Carter To Grasp North  Korea's True Intention." Attaching importance to Carter's  meeting with Kim Il- song during which mutual messages may be  exchanged, the editorial expresses the belief that he is the  last nuclear special envoy of the U.S. Government, although he  stated that his visit is strictly personal, in view of his past  role in U.S.-Syrian relations and in negotiations for the  Ethiopian war. Pointing to a possibility for North Korea to take  advantage of his visit for a peace offensive to evade sanctions  and for gaining time, the paper asks Carter to precisely inform  North Korea of the international community's demand and to grasp  North Korea's true intentions, whether they are aimed at  establishing diplomatic relations with the United States and  receiving support for a light-water reactor, or at ultimately  pursuing nuclear development.    The paper also calls on Carter to raise North Korea's human  rights issue while in Pyongyang since he was known as the  president for human rights, and to demonstrate his ability in  blocking North Korea's nuclear development since he blocked the  ROK's nuclear development plan while he was in office.    The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,600-word  article by reporter Ko Tae-song, entitled "The Government To  Cope With the North Korean Nuclear Issue Based on Sense of  Reality." Pointing to recent delicate and cautious changes in  the government steps to deal with the North Korean nuclear  problem, the article states that the government appears to be  turning from a hardline position by favoring sanctions to the  attitude of accepting the reality that requires active  participation of China and Russia, and this government attitude  is reflected in viewing Carter's visit to North Korea. The  article notes that the government was at first worried about a  possibility of Carter being dragged in by North Korea's delaying  and propaganda tactics but is now trying to take the best  advantage of his visits to both North and South of Korea for  directly conveying the worries and warnings of the international  community and of our government to North Korea on its nuclear  problem.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 2 a  1,200-word article by reporter Yi Song-chol, entitled "Carter's  Role--Half Affirmative, Half Negative." The paper notes that the  government's view on Carter's visit to North Korea is more on  the negative side at the moment because his visit may give  unfavorably impact our security strategy when sanctions are  being discussed at the UN Security Council. On the contrary,  some people are hoping for his positive role because he  maintains special relations with the Clinton administration and  because North Korea expressed the will to invite Carter since  1991. The article refers to remarks made by Professor Kim Yu-nam  from Danguk University on the possibility of Carter taking a  certain U.S. message accepting the North Korean demands.  However, the article says: "Most experts point out that the  success of Carter's visit depends more on what kind of message  North Korea will give him rather than on whether he will bring a  message with him or not and than on his role as a mediator."</p>

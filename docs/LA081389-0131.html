			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEER AND CONCERTS  </P> <P> The argument that corporate sponsorship helps to keep concert-ticket costs down  is specious.  </P> <P> Without corporate sponsorship, ticket prices could stay the same or even go  down -- if the venues, promoters, musicians, et al., accepted smaller profits.  </P> <P> I do not say they should be obligated to do so. They can charge whatever they  like. It is up to the consumer to decide if the goods are worth the price; just  as it is up to the consumer (a.k.a. the people) to decide if the politics of a  musical act, or a corporation, are worthy of support.  </P> <P> MARK CHAET  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> WARREN NOMINATED TO STATE LANDS PANEL  </P> <P> Charles Warren, a member of the state Coastal Commission and a former  assemblyman, is expected to be named top executive of the State Lands  Commission. After serving in the Legislature for 14 years, Warren was appointed  in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter to be chairman of the President's Council on  Environmental Quality. He was named to the Coastal Commission by Assembly  Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). As a Democratic assemblyman  representing Los Angeles, he was the principal author of the Coastal Protection  Act. In his new post, he would continue to serve on the Coastal Commission.  Warren's background has made him popular among environmental groups. And his  appointment appears to be another signal that the Lands Commission intends to  continue to play an activist role on environmental issues.  </P></p>

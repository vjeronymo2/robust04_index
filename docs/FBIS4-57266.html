			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 16 May (NA) -- [Passage omitted]  [U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike] Espy held a news conference  with Felipe Sola, his Argentine colleague, at the Economy  Ministry after meeting with Economy Vice Minister Carlos Sanchez.    The U.S. official arrived on 13 May (his visit is part of a  trip that will take him to Brazil on 17 May and finally to  Mexico). He also met with President Carlos Menem, Vice Foreign  Minister Fernando Petrella, and with the Senate and Chamber of  Deputies Agriculture Committees.    Espy and Sola termed their talks as "excellent and  fruitful."  The Argentine official insisted on the global need to eradicate  dumping [preceding word in English] and subsidies.    "I told Espy that maintaining our share of the Brazilian  market is our main concern," said Sola, adding: "We asked for  political priority in sanitary and phyto-sanitary [sanitarios y  fitosanitarios] fields."    Sola indicated that on 6 June a "high level" U.S. delegation  will visit the country to study the phyto-sanitary situation and  the conclusions of this delegation will be decisive in the  purchase of Argentine beef by the United States. [sentence as  received] [passage omitted]    Espy's remarks have a political interpretation because  Argentina currently maintains a strong tug-of-war with the  United States over the Pharmaceutical Patents Law. On several  occasions, U.S. Ambassador James Cheek has supported a solomonic  decision: Patents for subsidies. [passage omitted]</p>

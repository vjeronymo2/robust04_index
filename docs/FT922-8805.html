			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (7): Lop-sided trade links - Relations with South Africa FROM beer to prefabricated housing, from spare parts to office equipment, South African products are reaching Angola in increasing quantities. There has long been a South African connection through the diamond industry. Now the continent's industrial super-power is rapidly moving into what its businessmen describe as one of the most important markets in Africa, challenging traditional European suppliers. The bitter years of enmity and hostilities between Pretoria and the Angolan government have been consigned to history. Pretoria's representative office in Luanda will soon be upgraded. The South African embassy and residence, vacated shortly before independence in 1975, will be returned to their pre-independence owners as soon as alternative accommodation can be found for the present occupants - the Polish diplomatic mission. Most South African businessmen express enthusiastic belief in Angola's potential, modified by concern about political stability and dismay at the bureaucracy, housing shortages and poor communications they encounter in Luanda. The market potential of a country which exports more than 500,000 barrels of oil a day (b/d) is not conveyed by the latest available trade figures, which precede the diplomatic rapprochement. In 1990, South African imports from Angola were negligible (R59,000) but exports reached R50m. The lop-sided trade relationship could change. Apart from providing an outlet for Angola's oil (there is speculation that a substantial barter deal is in the offing), South Africa could be an important market for Angolan fish-meal. South African construction companies are preparing to take part in the rebuilding and development of Angola's infrastructure - bridges, roads, ports. Much of this could be World Bank-funded, says Mr Andrew Maggs of the South African Foreign Trade Organisation (Safto), which has organised trade missions to Angola. The country's oil sector is also a large market for South African companies, businessmen believe. As well as being a potential service and equipment base, South Africa is a logical place from which to source all the consumer needs of a 10,000-strong oil workforce which requires regular delivery of fresh food and consumer goods - hardly any of which is supplied locally. The Standard Bank has had a representative in Luanda since the start of the year, and the group may be opening a branch later this year. Meanwhile, one of the South African companies with the highest profile is Murray &amp; Roberts Construction. At the end of February the company signed a protocol with Cabinda province and the Angola government covering training in the construction and engineering industries, supply of prefabricated houses, schools and hotels, and a range of other services including work on roads and in the agriculture and mining sectors. But one businessman with wide experience of black Africa urges caution: 'No big decisions are being taken until the elections are over and there is greater certainty. Any long-term agreements may have to wait until then.'</p>

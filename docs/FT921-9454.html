			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Pathfinders in reverse takeover AN ELECTRICAL wiring business built up by the former joint head of Thomson T-Line is coming to the main market via a Pounds 15.2m deal with Pathfinders Group, a small media recruitment company. Mr Hugo Biermann, who will become chairman of the new group, and his partner Mr Nicholas Toms, are bringing in their two companies, Cables &amp; Flexibles in the UK, and Seacoast in the US. They and another director will end up with 26 per cent of the enlarged group by taking the payment in shares. Considerations total Pounds 9m and another Pounds 6m-plus is being raised to repay debts. The transactions include a share placing and 1-for-1 rights issue, both at 8p, to raise Pounds 7.42m. Pathfinders' shares were suspended on the USM two months ago at 10p. Cables &amp; Flexibles, a distributor, was acquired in 1987 by Thomson T-Line. Mr Biermann's aim was to build up an industrial distribution group. Along the way Vernons, the football pools business, was bought as a cash generator. This brought Thomson to the notice of Ladbroke Group, which acquired it for Pounds 186m in February 1989. Mr Biermann carried on with a previous Thomson plan to acquire Seacoast, and then in March last year bought back Cables &amp; Flexibles from Ladbroke. He said the new group, which will be called Maddox Group, aimed to distribute, install and service wiring systems. This would initially involve small bolt-on acquisitions, with a larger one planned later this year. Pathfinders is being used as a shell. Its biggest shareholder, Mr Stephen Hargrave, bought nearly 24 per cent of the equity 18 months ago, at 3 1/4 p per share, from Mr Stephen Worth and his wife Ms Andrea Rose. For the six months to September 30 it incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 83,000 on turnover of Pounds 183,000. In the five months to that date Cables &amp; Flexibles made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 277,000. Seacoast made Dollars 2.2m (Pounds 1.21m) trading profit and Dollars 893,000 pre-tax in nine months. For 1992, Williams de Broe, the company broker which is underwriting the rights issue, is forecasting that the group will make Pounds 2.6m pre-tax on turnover of about Pounds 40m, with earnings per share of nearly 8p. On net assets of Pounds 5.5m, initial group gearing is expected to be 25 per cent. At 8p, the market value will be Pounds 18m.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Kleeneze sells store chain Kleeneze Holdings, the home shopping group, yesterday announced its withdrawal from high street retailing with the sale of The Leading Edge, its store chain. The group's five lossmaking outlets - selling innovative products ranging from an electronic thesaurus to designer clocks - are being sold to Revelation (Piccadilly), the privately-owned luggage retailer, for about Pounds 850,000. Mr Robin Klein, Kleeneze chairman, said the deal marked the culmination of a two-year restructuring which has seen it sell three subsidiaries: Molly Housewares, Kleeneze Hygiene and Dalton Young - its toiletries division. The move follows the collapse of a joint venture with PowerStore, the showroom buy-out from London Electricity, to develop The Leading Edge into a profitable chain of at least 40 outlets. Although Mr Klein said store sales had been encouraging, high overhead costs and onerous lease agreements led to losses of Pounds 1.03m in the year to August 31 last year and a Pounds 324,000 deficit in the six months to February 28. 'This completes our transformation into a focused home shopping group. It removes the final lossmaking activity and it will free management time and working capital which can now be concentrated on our growing business - Kleeneze Homecare and Innovations.' The shares were unchanged at 203p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister </F> Haris Silajdzic in unspecified location by Radio Sarajevo studio  announcer in Sarajevo on 22 April -- live]    [Text] [Studio announcer] Esteemed listeneres, we have  just been informed that we have Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime  Minister Haris Silajdzic on the line. Good evening.    [Silajdzic] Good evening.    [Studio announcer] Mr. Silajdzic, at the beginning of the  newscast we announced that we had received news that the NATO  (?ambassadors) had reached a decision on a new ultimatum to the  Serbian aggressor. We also said that we could not confirm this  information. Can you confirm it?    [Silajdzic] Yes. The ultimatum to the Serbian forces calls  for their withdrawal by midnight tomorrow [23 April] to a  distance of three kilometers from the center of Gorazde. If  they fail to comply, every target within a 20 km radius will be  bombed. That is the ultimatum.    [Studio announcer] Could you comment on what will happen?  Will the aggressor comply with the ultimatum?    [Silajdzic] That remains to be seen. If they do not comply,  (?punishment) will follow.    [Studio announcer] Has this decision come too late?    [Silajdzic] Whether it is too late or not -- these are  academic questions. It is too late for the dead, but it is not  too late for the living. It is not too late for those who are  defending themselves. Therefore, we hail this decision, and we  hope it will be implemented. Thank you.    [Studio announcer] Thank you.</p>

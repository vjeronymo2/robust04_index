			<p>`Intimidate'   Judiciary   <F P=102> 94WD0300A Bombay THE SUNDAY TIMES OF INDIA in English 20 Feb  94 p 9 </F>  <F P=103> 94WD0300A </F> <F P=104>  Bombay THE SUNDAY TIMES OF INDIA </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO     [Text] Madras, Feb. 19--The recent arrest of a judge's  son-in-law on the charge [of] smuggling ganja has focused public  attention on the credibility of the Tamil Nadu police and the  admission of a writ petition by the Madras high court has  brought the issue under judicial scrutiny.    The petition, filed by the editor of a Tamil weekly,  THARASU,  Mr. S. Shunmugam, lists four other cases pertaining to the  alleged police abuse of the narcotics drugs and psychotropic  substances act in the last one-year.    No more than 20 per cent of the cases registered under the  act have resulted in conviction. The petitioner's point is that  the poor conviction rate has much to do with the arbitrary  exercise of powers by the police at the instance of the ruling  party bigwigs.    The petition seeks a court directive to the Centre and the  Tamil Nadu government for appointment of a judicial commission  to inquire into the alleged misuse of the narcotic drugs and  psychotropic substances act and abuse of its provisions for  extraneous reasons.    Admitting the petition Mr. Justice Kanakaraj, ordered  notices  to the Union home secretary and also the state home secretary  returnable in three weeks.    In his affidavit the THARASU editor said that the  investigation conducted by his weekly indicated that the arrest  of Mr. Alagappan, son-in-law of justice A.R. Lakshmanan, on  January 28, was done in consultation with the ruling party  leadership.    The suspect on his arrest was not told anything other than  that he was being arrested on instructions from a senior  official of the state law department.    Mr. Alagappan alias Kumar was released on conditional bail  after three days in judicial custody.    Meanwhile, Mr. Kumar today moved the high court, saying that  his arrest on the ganja smuggling charge was motivated and  obtained a two-week stay on the proceedings of the case against  him, pending in the sessions court. [sentence as published]    The THARASU editor, in his affidavit, submitted that the  narcotics drugs act was being used against a family member of a  high court judge as a calculated move to intimidate the  judiciary. Mr. Shanmugam submitted that his writ petition  related to, not an isolated case against the judge's son-in-law,  but several instances of misuse of the narcotics drugs act for  political purposes by the ruling AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida  Munnetra Kazhagam].</p>

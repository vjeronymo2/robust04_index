			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Fund formed to invest in insurance JP Morgan and Marsh &amp; McLennan have raised Dollars 650m for investment in underperforming insurance companies and new insurance ventures around the world, including Lloyd's of London. The scheme, in which each of the principals will invest around Dollars 40m of its own money, closely resembles the Corsair fund, a limited partnership put together by JP Morgan to invest in underperforming banks. The first investment by that fund was in Banesto. Mr Robert Clemens, chairman of Marsh &amp; McLennan Risk Capital, a subsidiary of the US-based insurance broker, indicated that the Trident limited partnership was intended to take advantage of structural changes under way in the worldwide insurance industry. 'It is evident that the property/casualty business is beginning to undergo a significant transformation, similar to what went on in commercial banking over the last 20 years,' he said. The insurance industry is 'plagued by inefficiency, and has the highest costs of any financial services business'. Also, some insurers are weighed down by environmental and other risks for which they do not have adequate reserves, making them uncompetitive with newer companies which do not carry these burdens from the past, he said. The fund will invest either in new insurance ventures, in companies that need to be recapitalised, or in buy-outs of existing companies. It will take an active part in the management of the companies it invests in. Mr Clemens singled out Europe as a source of potential investments, given that some national markets had been dominated by cartels until the passage of single-market legislation recently. He added, though, that the US, which accounts for around half of all property/casualty premiums, would inevitably dominate.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DAVID LEE ROTH DRAWS TROUBLE  </P> <P> Rocker David Lee Roth has caught the wary eye of city officials with a  20-foot-high portrait of a scantily clad woman on the outside wall of a  recording studio.  </P> <P> The portrait, with Roth's name emblazoned across the woman's chest, is on the  rear wall of Little Mountain Sound studio, where fans waiting for a peek of  favorite rockers who record there have sprayed a montage of graffiti.  </P> <P> Roth, former lead singer of Van Halen, commissioned the airbrushed artwork that  went up last month as a "poetic and symbolic tribute to the city of Vancouver,"  said his road manager, Eddie Anderson.  </P> <P> "What better (tribute) than a beautiful woman sitting amidst the city?"  Anderson said.  </P> <P> City officials don't see it that way. They're getting complaints and have told  the studio's owners they must apply for a wall mural permit. Even with a  permit, the city may decide to order the portrait's removal, said Jack Perry,  deputy chief license inspector for the city.  </P> <P> Among other rockers who use the studio are Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, Motley Crue and  Whitesnake.  </P></p>

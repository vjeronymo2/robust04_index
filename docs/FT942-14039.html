			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Human rights court reform The committee of ministers of the Council of Europe, the 32-nation forum for human rights and democracy, voted in Strasbourg yesterday to create a new permanent Court of Human Rights. The present two-tier system of a European Commission of Human Rights and a 17-judge Court has been heavily criticised as cumbersome and inefficient. Individuals have first to satisfy the Commission they have an arguable case before being allowed access to the Court. In future all individuals will have direct access to the new court which will normally sit in chambers of seven judges. Only in exceptional cases will the court sit as a grand chamber of 17 judges. Clearly unfounded cases will be dealt with by committees of three judges. The committee of ministers will retain its role of ensuring that governments comply with the Court's judgments. The change should speed up the handling of cases; under the present system few are resolved in less than five years.</p>

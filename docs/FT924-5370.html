			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Gaidar stand threatens accord with opposition RUSSIA'S acting prime minister, Mr Yegor Gaidar, yesterday ruled out compromise on four key planks of his pro-market reforms, threatening a delicate compromise worked out between the government and the powerful opposition Civic Union (CU). The breach in what had been assumed to be a firm deal offering Civic Union's support for the government in return for a moderation of the economic reforms, could return the Russian political world to serious confrontation. The agreement had received quiet encouragement from international financial institutions. Mr Gaidar told parliament he was willing to compromise with the Civic Union. But he insisted there would be no going back to a state distribution system; no large increase in the money supply; no freeze on wages and prices; and no fixed exchange rate lower than that set by the market. Civic Union's leaders will probably delay a decisive response until it has met tomorrow. Moreover, both sides still have several days left to manoeuvre back into agreement before the opening of the Congress of People's Deputies next Tuesday. However, the Itar Tass news agency reported that Mr Arkady Volsky, a Civic Union leader and president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, had charged the government with reneging on the agreement reached over the weekend. An immediate crisis was averted yesterday when Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, deflected calls for the government's resignation from hardline deputies representing the now-banned National Salvation Front. Mr Nikolai Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party, one of CU's three founding parties and the most consistently hostile to the government, told parliament that while the Gaidar government had done a service in destroying the old system, it must still be sacked. President Boris Yeltsin, meanwhile, offered a conciliatory gesture by abolishing the post held by Mr Gennady Burbulis, state secretary and a figure hated by the CU for his caustic dismissal of their policies. But Mr Burbulis was immediately named head of the president's advisory council, essentially the same function he now fulfils, and the move was generally seen as a transparent manoeuvre. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister and another CU target, flatly denied rumours that he had also been fired. He said Mr Yeltsin had told him there would be no further changes in the cabinet, at least for the present. In his speech to parliament, Mr Gaidar did make some significant concessions to Civic Union's stance, calling for an industrial strategy absent in Russia until now. It would involve selective aid, export credits, the assistance of Russian companies to win large contracts and more assistance to lower income groups. He wanted, he said, to 'replace a general crisis with a structural crisis' - that is, to allow decline only in those industries for whose goods there was little or no demand rather than in all industries irrespective of demand. At the same time, Mr Gaidar said that a de facto Russian currency would be introduced from January 1 - with exchange rates set between the rouble and the coupons introduced by other former Soviet states, customs regulations with all these states, and a transition to world prices for all exports to those states. Reuter adds: Russia's foreign trade minister, Mr Pyotr Aven, said yesterday the Paris Club of creditor states had made outstanding concessions on deferring the debts of the former Soviet Union, paving the way for an early deal. 'We are satisfied,' he said after a two-day meeting with official creditors in Paris.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / World Trade News: GEC Alsthom shares in Dollars 770m Iran power order AN international consortium including Howden Group Canada, part of the Scottish engineering company, and GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French power engineering group, has won a Dollars 770m (Pounds 425.4m) turnkey contract to build a 1,100MW power station in western Iran. The contract is the first important project for GEC Alsthom in Iran since the end of the Iran/Iraq war, and one of the biggest announced in the Middle East since the end of the Gulf War. Over the past year, Iran has been reactivating several projects in thermal and hydroelectric power generation. GEC Alsthom said it had won 'the major part' of the contract, while Howden said its share was Dollars 121m. Other members of the so-called Ontario Group consortium include Babcock &amp; Wilcox of Canada and Italy's Nuova Cimimontubi. The project, at Arak, is for Tavanir, the Iranian electric utility. Construction will begin later this year and the new station is due to be fully operational by 1996. GEC Alsthom and Howden will be responsible for design and supply of the turbine island, which includes two 550MW steam turbines and generators, air-cooled condensers and a high voltage sub-station. The steam turbines are specially designed to meet the requirements of the large air-cooled condensers, which are necessary because of scarce water supplies. Delivery of the Howden components will start in the second half of 1993 and take two years to complete. The GEC Alsthom equipment will be made at factories in Rugby and Stafford, and in Belfort, France. Financing and insurance for the project is to come from the export credit agencies of the consortium's member-countries.</p>

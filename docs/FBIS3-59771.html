The Mach-5 engine is being developed as a joint effort by  aerospace engine makers from Japan, the U.S., Britain and  France. The design calls for an engine which combines a  turbojet, like those used on conventional subsonic aircraft,  with a ramjet, like those used on missiles. The turbojet would  accelerate the aircraft up to Mach-3, after which the ramjet  would kick in.    A one-third scale model of the turbojet part of the engine  has been constructed which is capable of withstanding  temperatures of 1,600 C--a temperature at which conventional  engines melt. To achieve this high heat resistance, the engine  blades were made from a special nickel alloy and a more  effective air-cooling system was designed.    This model was then loaded with fuel and fired up for the  first time to verify the engine's power characteristics and its  ability to withstand shaking. The tests were carried out on 15  November at a plant operated by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy  Industries Co.    The small-scale model engine did not reach an internal  temperature of 1,600 C during the tests, but the international  research group does not plan to test the heat-resistant  characteristics of the engine until fiscal 1995. The goal is to  develop a practical Mach-5 engine by the year 2020.</p>

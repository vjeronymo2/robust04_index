			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said at a news conference in  Warsaw yesterday that he intends to visit Prague on Sunday. In  this connection, our correspondent David Stahlavsky spoke to  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus:    [Begin recording] [Stahlavsky] I have asked you about your  views before. At the time, you expressed the belief that it  would not occur to the Russian radical nationalist to visit the  Czech Republic. It appears that it has occurred to him, but,  above all, it occurred to the crowds close to the Association  for the Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia. How will  the leadership of our state react to this visit? What will our  democracy have to hear before it behaves like other Western  democracies--for example, in Germany and other places, where Mr.  Zhirinovskiy was declared persona non grata?    [Klaus] Well, Mr. Zhirinovskiy is no doubt persona non grata  in our country at the moment, but I am using the expression non  grata in the general civic meaning. I am not using it as a  technical term of international law. We do not want him here.  It is in this sense that he is not desirable in our country,  and the few Mr. Sladeks [head of the Republican Party] who want  him here, well, I think they are again indicating clearly where  he belongs and what we all are to think about him.    I am not fully convinced that we should proceed from  undesirability, in the general sense of the word, to the term  persona non grata, in the legal sense of the word, and formally  bloc the arrival of Mr. Zhirinovskiy in our country. The  government has not made any decision in principle about it,  either. I do not rule out that it will become a topic of at  least brief talks at the government session tomorrow morning. I  really would not like to predetermine this matter.    I think it is a pity, a waste of time, and stupid. On the  other hand, I am fully convinced that our democracy is strong  enough to survive this visit in peace without being threatened  in any way. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading SHARPLY improved trading volume in stock index futures restored the December contract to a good premium and provided the driving force behind the stock market yesterday, writes Terry Byland. London took its cue from the recovery in the German stock market, although UK equities were slow to move until the futures market opened. The strength of the December Footsie contract, which stood at a 36-point premium, brought arbitraging between futures and equities, chiefly by one large UK securities house and a leading Japanese firm. They were able to sell the future at its peak and buy the underlying stocks, taking advantage of a US house which found itself short of the future and was obliged to buy. December closed at 3,066, a 34-point premium against cash and 12 to fair value. Volume increased to 10,864 contracts, compared with under 8,000 in the previous session. However, the future traded 15,000 contracts at the beginning of last week. With dealers concentrating on the Footsie future contract, traded options had a calmer session, with 23,835 contracts transacted against 36,996 on Friday. Even the FT-SE 100 option was significantly less active than on Friday, recording 9,375 lots compared with 14,891. British Steel topped the active stocks list for options with a figure of 3,812, followed by J. Sainsbury at 1,397.</p>

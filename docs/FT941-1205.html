			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Elf and Treuhand agree refinery deal Eastern Germany's largest investment project was yesterday saved from collapse when the Treuhand privatisation agency and Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company, forged a compromise on the construction of the region's most modern refinery. The compromise paves the way for a potentially viable chemical sector in eastern Germany. Had the Leuna oil refinery project collapsed, Buna, the nearby chemical and olefin complex and a big buyer of refinery products, would have been denied local supplies. In 1992, Elf agreed with the Treuhand that it would rebuild the Leuna refinery in a joint project with Thyssen Handelsunion, a subsidiary of the German steel group. It agreed to take a 67 per cent stake in the DM4.5bn (Pounds 1.75bn) project known as Leuna 2000. In January this year, Elf said it wanted to cut its stake to 35 per cent as part of a general cost-cutting strategy. However, under the terms of yesterday's compromise, Elf will reduce its stake by a third. The company's board is expected to endorse the deal when it meets in Paris on Monday. Rosneft, the state-owned Russian oil company, will join the Leuna consortium by taking up Elf's surrendered 24 per cent share. The stake will be paid for with crude oil deliveries. As part of the price for cutting its stake, Elf will give up a third of its 500 petrol stations in eastern Germany. Access to the region's petrol stations was the driving force behind Elf's decision to invest in eastern Germany in the first place. French President Francois Mitterrand had interceded on Elf's behalf, while the Treuhand linked the company's entree into eastern Germany with investment in the Leuna oil refinery, which is in the state of Saxony Anhalt. The Treuhand said yesterday that it would 'definitely not' be selling off the lucrative petrol stations, in spite of enormous interest by Shell, and Aral, the petrol distribution arm of Veba, Germany's large electricity conglomerate. Instead, the agency will allocate the stations to Buna, still under the Treuhand, in a move designed to make the chemical complex an attractive privatisation project. Thyssen Handelsunion and RAO Gazprom, the state-owned Russian gas company, earlier this week signed a letter of intent to negotiate a stake exceeding 25 per cent but less than 50 per cent in Buna. Buna's privatisation prospects will be further boosted if Thyssen decides to shed its 33 per cent stake in Leuna after construction. The stake, which would have passed to Elf, will be passed on to Buna.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Thousands of Somalis today signed a petition for  the withdrawal of foreign forces from Somalia so that the Somali  people can achieve total peace and understanding. The petition  is addressed to the UN Security Council and will go via the  British Government.    The petition begins as follows: The NEW DAWN [WAAGA CUSUB]  newspaper has been asked to campaign for this petition, which is  the wish of Somali National Alliance [SNA] supporters in  particular and the Somali people in general. It asks the UN  Security Council for UN Forces to leave their country and  release the officials and supporters who were illegally arrested  and taken from their homes, and who are still in UN Operation in  Somalia jails. The objective is to let the UN Security Council  and the international community know the true feelings of the  Somali people. [passage omitted]    [Paris AFP in English at 1146 GMT on 30 December in a  Mogadishu-datelined item adds: "The petition signed by Aidid's  supporters in Mogadishu accuses the United Nations of human  rights abuses, including the detention of Osman Hassan Ali,  known as `Ato', Aidid's chief financier who was arrested on  September 21. Two other senior Aidid aides, Omar Salad Elmi and  Mohamed Hassan Awale, have been held since October 3. The  petition reiterates Aidid's assertion that the United Nations  wants trying to colonize Somalia and accuses the world body of  "creating a hostile atmosphere" by attacks against Aidid's  faction, causing "the death and injury of an estimated 11,000  Somali civilians." An Aidid supporter, Abdi Abshir Kahiye, said  the SNA hoped to hand the petition to UN special envoy to  Somalia, Jonathan Howe, with more than 50,000 signatures by the  end of January."]</p>

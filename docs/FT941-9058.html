			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei tumbles 2.5% on further strengthening of yen A further strengthening of the yen pushed the Nikkei 225 average below the 19,000 level for the first time since January 28, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 plunged 484.65, or 2.5 per cent to 18,974.60, while the Topix index of all first section stocks fell 26.64 to 1,555.34, and the Nikkei 300 by 4.71, or 1.6 per cent, to 287.70. Reports that the US could impose sanctions on Japanese exports, because of Japan's tariffs on mobile telephones, triggered further fears of a higher yen. Comments in New York on Monday by Ms Laura Tyson, chairman of the US council of economic advisers, indicating a tolerant stance towards the dollar's decline, also gave a further incentive for traders to sell the US currency against the yen. Concerns that the yen's rise would hurt the profitability of the country's exporters, wiping out the effects of the last economic stimulus package, also undermined investor confidence. The 225 index, which opened at the day's high of 19,406.44, fell to a low of 18,768.98 in the morning session on mounting expectations that the yen could rise above the Y100 level against the dollar. The Japanese currency closed at Y102.02 in Tokyo, closing down Y3.67 from Monday. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed up 2.23 at 1,290.54. Foreigners placed small lot buy orders, but domestic individuals and arbitrageurs continued to liquidate holdings, triggering a further unwinding of arbitrage positions. Volume was 380m shares against Monday's 290m. Declines overwhelmed advances by 1,028 to 84 with 61 issues unchanged. Export-related shares fell steeply. Sony lost Y180 to Y5,870 and Matsushita Electric Industrial declined Y50 to Y1,650. Multimedia-related shares, which had firmed recently, lost ground on profit-taking. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shed Y31,000 to Y895,000, falling below Y900,000 for the first time since January 28. Fujitsu lost Y22 to Y978 and NEC retreated Y35 to Y985. Car manufacturers were also lower, with Toyota Motor falling Y20 to Y1,890 and Honda Motor declining Y90 to Y1,540. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 465.16 to 21,025.81 in volume of 55m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y150 to Y6,400. Roundup Volume remained low in many of the region's markets yesterday, with some foreign buyers noticeably absent. HONG KONG made good intra-day losses to close above the 11,000 level, having fallen nearly 200 points in the afternoon session. The Hang Seng index closed up 23.52 at 11,012.33 in turnover down to HKDollars 5.7bn from Monday's HKDollars 6.7bn. Traders described the rise as technically driven since activity remained low with many investors still on holiday. HSBC Holdings was the most active issue, closing unchanged at HKDollars 117 after earlier dropping to HKDollars 114. Cheung Kong, the property group, added 50 cents to HKDollars 45.50, HK Telecom put on 10 cents to HKDollars 15 and Jardine Matheson HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 75.50. SINGAPORE remained subdued and the Straits Times Industrials index lost 12.45 to 2,329.53. Brokers said that the budget announcement, due next week, would have to offer better-than-expected incentives to boost market sentiment. KUALA LUMPUR was slightly weaker but recovered from session lows on late bargain hunting. The composite index lost 6.09 to 1,087.21. Public Bank rose 14 cents to MDollars 5.10 on higher 1993 earnings. TAIWAN remained weak in the financial sector but was supported by strength in plastics and electronics. The weighted index fell 30.25 to 5,985.01 in turnover down to TDollars 50.5bn from TDollars 58.9bn. Formosa Plastics, up 50 cents at TDollars 53.50, was supported by news that it planned to develop land near Taipei into a high-technology industrial zone. MANILA was lifted by foreign interest in Philippine National Bank, whose shares leapt 45 pesos or 7 per cent to 675 pesos. The composite index rose 3.81 to 3,012.55 as turnover fell to 1.3bn pesos from Monday's 1.5bn. AUSTRALIA found support late in the session and the All Ordinaries index ended off 4.6 at 2,234.0, recovering from a 14 point fall in early trade. ANZ, which gained 16 cents on Monday, retreated 5 cents to ADollars 5.63 in volume of 4.2m shares. Resource stocks remained weak with Western Mining down 8 cents at ADollars 7.42. KARACHI was driven higher by foreign interest on the first day of the new account. The KSE-100 index put on 44.15 to 2,422.99. BANGKOK's SET index recovered half its early losses to finish down 8.23 at 1,413.97, but turnover was slim at Bt7.2bn after Monday's Bt7bn. The index had dropped to 1,406.66 in afternoon trading. Bangkok Bank attracted attention, climbing Bt4 to Bt195, while the newly-listed Eastern Star Real Estate closed at Bt38.00, up from its public offer price of Bt27.

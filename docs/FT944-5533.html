			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Magistrate to question Alcatel Alsthom chief A magistrate investigating alleged overbilling of state-owned France Telecom plans to summon Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of French industrial giant Alcatel Alsthom, for questioning, an official said yesterday. The news followed the release earlier in the day of Mr Pierre Guichet, chairman of Alcatel's telecommunications unit CIT, after two weeks in a Paris jail. Mr Guichet, 62, had received the full support of Alcatel CIT which expressed outrage at his incarceration without charge. He remains under investigation. Mr Guichet was ordered jailed by investigating magistrate Jean-Marie d'Huy who is looking into the allegations that Alcatel CIT overcharged France Telecom, its biggest customer, by an estimated FFr2bn (Pounds 230m). Alcatel CIT has consistently rejected the allegations, saying there had been a misunderstanding of its billing practices. The official said that Mr Suard, head of parent Alcatel Alsthom, would be called in for questioning during December. In July, Mr d'Huy placed Mr Suard under investigation on suspicion of underpaying for security measures at his current and previous residences. He was briefly arrested and questioned for 12 hours in July by the police fraud squad.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HONDA FOUNDER IS FIRST JAPANESE IN AUTO HALL OF FAME  </P> <P> A man who helped devastate Detroit has come to be honored and enshrined by it  tonight.  </P> <P> At a dinner in downtown Detroit, Soichiro Honda, the original Mr. Honda of the  Honda Motor Co., will become the first Japanese auto executive to be inducted  into America's Automotive Hall of Fame.  </P> <P> He will thus be immortalized alongside the legends of the U.S. auto industry,  whose names still ring down through the ages: Henry Ford. Walter P. Chrysler.  Ransom Olds. Alfred P. Sloan. And now, Soichiro Honda, the last living founder  of any of the world's major auto companies.  </P> <P> He will be only the first of what Hall of Fame officials say will be many  Japanese industry pioneers to be inducted.  </P> <P> Honda's election to the hall is, of course, fraught with painful irony.  </P> <P> After all, Honda's company and his cars have brought nothing but headaches to  Detroit. For nearly two decades, Honda Motor has been in the vanguard of the  Japanese invasion of the American car market, taking millions of sales and tens  of thousands of jobs away from the domestic auto makers. Indeed, Honda is now  vying with Toyota for import sales leadership in the United States and may soon  sell more cars in this country than Chrysler.  </P> <P> Yet the car business is an increasingly global industry in which the lines  between import and domestic are rapidly blurring. General Motors has linked up  with Toyota, Ford with Mazda and Nissan, Chrysler with Mitsubishi -- and Honda  now builds hundreds of thousands of its cars in Ohio.  </P> <P> So Detroit seems willing to forgive and forget.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Significant Individual'  </P> <P> "The industry has become so global that we will be looking for more Japanese to  include in the future," said Donald Richetti, the president of the Hall of  Fame, which is based in Midland, Mich. "We want to be an international  organization.  </P> <P> "And it was appropriate that Mr. Honda be the first Japanese," Richetti added.  "He's a marvelously significant individual who has increased the customer's  expectations of quality."  </P> <P> Thus, the 82-year-old Honda, who founded his company in 1948 amid the rubble of  postwar Japan, was given a royal welcome when he arrived in the Detroit area  Monday.  </P> <P> In this moment of vindication and triumph for a man who never expected to  challenge the giants of Detroit when he first started making small motorcycles,  Honda remained effusively gracious -- and very diplomatic -- as he talked to  reporters Monday.  </P> <P> "My greatest achievement," he said, when asked to look back over his career,  "was in imitating American cars."  </P> <P> And, when asked how he would compare the quality of American and Japanese cars  today, he was slightly cryptic.  </P> <P> "Japanese and American cars are like humans," Honda said. "Some are good in  some aspects and some are bad in some aspects."  </P> <P> Honda, who stepped down from active management in 1973, also admitted that he  still is somewhat awe-struck by the enormous success and global stature that  his company has enjoyed since he retired. Asked whether he foresees a merger  between Honda and one of the major auto companies of Detroit, he said, "I know  in my generation, it would never have happened."  </P></p>

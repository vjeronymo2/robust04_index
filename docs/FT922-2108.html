			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Funds to charities remain stable TYPICAL support for charity averaged Pounds 2 a person a month in 1990-91, according to research published by the Charities Aid Foundation yesterday, Alan Pike writes. That was an improvement on the previous year - when typical monthly giving fell to Pounds 1.28 - but the figures disguise the fact that the most philanthropic section of the population donated 'substantially less' while small givers supplied a little more. As a result, total public support for charity was unchanged last year at between Pounds 3.5bn and Pounds 4.3bn. The research, conducted for the foundation by Manchester University, shows that 24 per cent of the population donate nothing, while most of the 76 per cent of donors confine their support to relatively modest levels. The government wants the voluntary sector to take over an increased range of services from public agencies, but the survey shows strong support for continued state provision. A total of 90 per cent of respondents agreed that the government had a basic responsibility to take care of people, with 86 per cent saying that the government should help more and not rely on charities.

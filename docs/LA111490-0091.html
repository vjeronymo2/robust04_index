			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-THATCHER ALLY TO BID FOR PARTY LEADERSHIP;  </P> <P> BRITAIN: FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY IS EXPECTED TO POSE THE MOST SERIOUS  CHALLENGE SINCE SHE TOOK REINS IN 1975.  </P> <P> Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine will run against British Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party, in  what is expected to be the most serious challenge to Thatcher since she took  over the party in 1975, close colleagues reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> Heseltine, a member of Parliament and a firm Europeanist, is expected to  announce his candidacy today, according to widespread reports in London  political circles.  </P> <P> Thatcher's popularity has been at a near-low recently because of aspects of her  domestic and European policies as well as her authoritarian rule in a nation  used to a more collegial government.  </P> <P> Heseltine's candidacy is expected to be bitterly opposed by the prime minister  and leading members of her Cabinet, because of the dangers such a hard-fought  contest will pose to the party in the next national election.  </P> <P> But his position was thought to have been bolstered Tuesday by Geoffrey Howe,  former deputy prime minister, who before a packed House of Commons explained  his reasons for his surprise resignation 11 days ago.  </P> <P> In what observers called a scathing and devastating indictment, the normally  placid Howe said the prime minister was "risking the future" of the country by  her negative attitude toward the European Community.  </P> <P> Howe, the last minister left from Thatcher's original Cabinet, explained that  his position in calling for Britain to play a leading role in the community was  constantly undermined by the prime minister's anti-European remarks.  </P> <P> He contrasted the positive, pro-European approach of former Tory Prime  Ministers Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan against what he called the  negative "background noise" and "nightmare image" coming from Thatcher.  </P> <P> Howe said her view of Europe was that it was "positively teeming with  ill-intended people scheming to extinguish democracy."  </P> <P> "What kind of vision is that?" he asked.  </P> <P> Howe's remarks were the more effective for the understated, almost diffident  way he stated his case, referring to her as "my right honorable friend."  </P> <P> Some embittered pro-Thatcher Tories called Howe's unexpectedly damning speech  an "incitement to mutiny" and an "act of treachery."  </P> <P> On Monday night, Thatcher had appeared highly confident of any possible party  contest and used phrases from cricket that vowed to knock any challenger out of  the ballpark.  </P> <P> Referring to that analogy, Howe on Tuesday declared that the Conservatives were  like a team that found their "bats broken by the team captain before the game."  </P> <P> Under Tory party rules, Conservative members of the Commons will vote probably  within a week on a leader in a secret ballot.  </P> <P> If Heseltine wins a majority -- 159 votes -- he would become party leader, and  Thatcher would be forced to step down as prime minister, though there is no set  time limit to remain in the post.  </P> <P> The crisis in the Conservative Party began at the Rome summit of the European  Community late last month when Thatcher was outvoted 11 to 1 on setting a  timetable for the second phase of European monetary union in agreeing to  establish a central bank by 1994.  </P> <P> She described the Rome proceedings as "cloud-cuckooland," and when she spoke in  the House of Commons the following Tuesday, the prime minister was equally  blunt in her assessment of her EC colleagues.  </P> <P> That was too much for Howe, who as foreign secretary had worked strenuously to  make Britain a cooperating member of the EC -- before Thatcher summarily fired  him from the job last year.  </P> <P> He turned in his surprise resignation on Nov. 2, which generated speculation  about a challenge to the Thatcher leadership. That turned the focus to  Heseltine, 57, who had stalked out of the Cabinet in January, 1986, in a  complex dispute over the sale of a British helicopter company.  </P> <P> Heseltine's lieutenants in the House of Commons say they have at least 100 sure  votes for him, which would not win the leadership -- but would not be a  humiliating defeat.  </P></p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Scotgen in rival bid for Porton Int'l Scotgen Pharmaceuticals, the Anglo-US drug company, yesterday emerged as a rival bidder for Porton International, the UK biotechnology group which earlier this week announced a Pounds 65.5m (Dollars 103.5m) agreed takeover. The California-based company said it would trump the recommended offer from Beaufour Ipsen, a French pharmaceutical business, by almost 50 per cent with a bid valuing the UK group at Pounds 96.3m. Scotgen claimed its overtures had been ignored by Kleinwort Benson, Porton's financial advisers. It has offered Pounds 42m in cash and Pounds 54.3m in shares. On advice from the merchant bank, shareholders with 66.2 per cent of Porton have given irrevocable undertakings to accept the French bid, worth Pounds 13.40 in cash or notes. Of those investors, the largest stake is held by Mr Wensley Haydon-Baillie, Porton's founder and ex-chairman, who stands to receive more than Pounds 20m for his 33 per cent stake. Kleinwort Benson was unavailable for comment. Mr Tony Gover, Porton vice-chairman, said he was 'unaware of a counter bid'.</p>

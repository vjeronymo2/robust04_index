			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Thyssen faces doubts over recovery Thyssen, the German steel and engineering group, has reported weak domestic orders in the first quarter of its 1993-94 fiscal year, raising doubts about the group's recovery this year. Total orders in the three months to December 31 1993 fell 5 per cent with the figure for European Union down 13 per cent. Orders for Thyssen Industrie, the capital goods division, dropped by 16 per cent, reflecting mainly poor market conditions in the car industry. The sharpest drop was in machinery which fell by 38 per cent. The group did not disclose first quarter financial results, but said turnover had improved 1.2 per cent over the same period the previous year, mostly due to foreign subsidiaries. Turnover in Thyssen Stahl, the steel division, was down 7 per cent and in Thyssen Industrie by 10 per cent. Steel losses forced Thyssen into the red for the year ended September 30 1993. It returned a DM864m (Dollars 493.7m) loss, after DM348m pre-tax profits the year before. Without the steel division, the group would have recorded an operating profit of DM774m, Mr Heinz Kriwet, chief executive, said. Thyssen will omit a dividend.</p>

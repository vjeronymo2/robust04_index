			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAIRPLEX;  </P> <P> YES I'M BLUE WINS AGAIN IN AN UPSET  </P> <P> Scoring his second stakes upset of the summer, Yes I'm Blue came from last to  defeat Southern California speedster Valiant Pete in the $52,550 Aprisa  Handicap Tuesday afternoon at Fairplex Park. In June, Yes I'm Blue humbled  Northern California sprint star Valley Land in a stakes race at Pleasanton.  </P> <P> Dropping back to last in the field of six sprinters, Yes I'm Blue moved to the  outside approaching the far turn and blew past 4-5 favorite Valiant Pete in the  final sixteenth, posting a 1 1/2-length victory. Movinglikeawinner was another  three-quarters back in the six-furlong feature.  </P> <P> Yes I'm Blue surged down the stretch, running the six furlongs in 1:09 2/5, a  fifth of a second off Drouilly's Boy's track record. Sent off at 5-1, Yes I'm  Blue paid $12.60 and increased his lifetime earnings to $217,010.  </P> <P> Fairplex Notes  </P> <P> For the second straight day, nobody tabbed six winners in the Pick Six. Today's  carry-over is $41,887. . . . Beyond Perfection, regarded as one of the  country's top 2-year-old thoroughbred fillies, is the heavy favorite in today's  $150,000 Barretts Debutante at 6 1/2 furlongs. In her last race, Beyond  Perfection won the Grade II Del Mar Debutante Stakes by nine lengths, covering  a mile in 1:34 4/5.  </P> <P> Ray Sibille was the riding star Tuesday, recording a triple aboard longshots  Lou's Good Morning ($17.20), Viznaga ($94.40) and Vice Dancer ($25.40). David  Flores and Julio Garcia each had a victory and remained deadlocked for the  jockey lead with nine apiece. . . . Story Book Ending, a 3-year-old maiden  filly, collapsed and died of a ruptured heart shortly after finishing sixth in  the seventh race.  </P></p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Tehran's overtures to central Asia fall on deaf ears: Michael Field debunks the view that Iran will export Islamic revolution to its northern neighbours AN IRANIAN deputy minister recently led a delegation to the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan. At the close of the talks, the two sides decided it would be brotherly to draft the minutes in Persian - in theory, their common language. It took a day for the Tajiks to find a Persian typewriter. Then nobody knew how to use it, except the deputy minister. He typed the minutes. At about the same time, a Turkish-speaking mullah from Iranian Azerbaijan went to former Soviet Azerbaijan to give a lecture on Islam. After his talk, his hosts served sandwiches and vodka. The mullah was horrified. He explained that alcohol was prohibited by Islam. And then he was hurt to discover that not only were the Azerbaijanis unaware of this, but that, on being enlightened, lost interest in the meeting and drifted away. Episodes such as these have taught the Iranians three things: Central Asia and Transcaucasia have become culturally very distant from Iran during 70 years of communism. The population there is not ripe for Islamic revolution. The whole area is very poor. In the west and some conservative Arab countries there is a belief that the Iranians have been provided with a golden opportunity by the break-up of the Soviet Union and that they will try to export revolution and strengthen their position to undermine pro-western regimes in the Middle East. In Tehran, the situation looks very different. Even though it was invaded from the north twice this century, by Russia in 1915 and the Soviet Union in 1941, Iran has had an easy relationship with its superpower neighbour for the past 40 years. After Mr Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is now Iran's president, visited Moscow in 1988, the Soviet Union became an important trading partner and a supplier of sophisticated arms, including MiG 29 fighters. The Iranians now suppose that their relationship with Russia, with which they have no border, will be more distant, and, meanwhile, have been presented with a series of challenges that they fear will underline their weakness. Moreover, there is no chance of exporting their revolution because it is almost a thing of the past in Iran itself, except in official rhetoric and a few hardline pockets in the government and religious establishments. The former Soviet republics know about the chaos that Iran inflicted on itself by its revolution, and can see that Iran needs nearly as much reconstruction as they. The Iranian mullahs would like, at least, that they, and not Saudi Arabia, should exert the main influence in bringing the new republics back to Islam. But they are hampered by the fact that most Iranians are unorthodox Shia while their northern neighbours, except some Azerbaijanis, are Sunnis. Also, Saudi Arabia has more money for building mosques. Secular members of the government hope that Iran will be a more important economic and social influence on central Asia and Turkey. But it will not be. Iran is physically closer to central Asia, and it will be a route for the republics' trade with the west, but in every other way the Turks have the advantage. Turkey is a secular state whose more religious inhabitants practise Sunni Islam, which is more or less how the central Asian republics would like to be. All the central Asians, bar the Tajiks, speak Turkish, though, at a recent meeting of regional states in Tehran, the Turkish ambassador said he could follow what the Azerbaijanis were saying, but that what the others spoke was so impregnated with Russian it was 'only a form of Turkish'. The Turks have a strong, nity, big contracting companies and good political, financial and trading links with Europe and America. They seem much better placed than Iran to provide the goods and economic expertise the central Asian republics want. It is often said outside government circles in Tehran that Iran and central Asia lack 'complementarity.' The central Asians need capital, strong private sectors and contact with international business, which is exactly what Iran needs itself. Turkey's advantages worry the Iranians: they see the Americans in the Gulf, regard the Turks as American proxies, and fear that they are about to be surrounded by US influence. They are resentful that the outside world seems to have ignored their efforts to mediate in the fighting between Azerbaijanis and Armenians in Nagorno Karabakh. The worst prospect of all is that the emergence of independent Asian republics could lead to Iran's own minorities starting secessionist movements. Like many Middle Eastern countries, roughly half of Iran's population is composed of minorities: Turkomans, Azerbaijanis, Baluchis, Arabs, Armenians, Kurds. Many of these are Sunni Moslems. There are no Sunni ministers and no senior officials from any of the minority groups except the Azerbaijanis, whose potential for secession used to worry the Shah. This led to many Azerbaijanis, who were more sophisticated than the other minorities, being promoted, particularly in the Foreign Ministry. Traditionally, the dominant Persian community has not tried to crush the cultures of the minorities, as Turkey and Iraq have tried to do with the Kurds. There has been a general acceptance that Iran is composed of a group of races - an empire, as it was known in the Shah's day. In only one of the minorities, the Kurds, is there any secessionist movement at present. Among the others, the idea remains theoretical: there was no sign of the Arabs in the south-west wanting to join Iraq when their territory was invaded in 1980. Still, if the present changes in the region were ever to lead to a rearrangement of frontiers, it is quite possible to imagine the Azerbaijanis demanding union with former Soviet Azerbaijan and/or with Turkey, and the Turkomans wanting to join Turkmenistan. A major disincentive to secessionist movements is the poverty of the central Asian states. Nevertheless, the mere thought of secession in Iran increases the sense of isolation of a nation which already feels very much on the defensive.</p>

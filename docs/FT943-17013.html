			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Managers say strong manufacturing rise hitting supplies The manufacturing sector is growing strongly, but at the cost of creating some supply bottlenecks and price pressures, according to figures published by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply yesterday. The purchasing managers' index rose to 61.4 per cent in June, the highest level since the figures were first published in 1991. The institute constructs the index from components including new orders and employment. A figure above 50 per cent indicates that activity has grown since the previous month, one below 50 per cent indicates a fall. The index was last below 50 per cent in December 1993, since when it has risen steadily. New orders and employment both reached record levels on the month. Order books improved across all industries and regions, and for domestic and export markets. Employment was particularly strong in the electrical and electronic industries, but was described by companies as 'temporary' or 'seasonal'. Output was particularly strong in Wales, the south-east and the Midlands. Mr Mark Reckless, UK economist at Warburg Securities, warned that the index's short history meant that record levels might not be greatly significant. The institute also said that raw materials shortages, particularly in pulp and paper, had raised prices. Its prices index rose from 57.8 per cent in May to 59.1 per cent in June. Furthermore, bottlenecks are appearing in the system, indicating further potential price pressure. Delivery times have been lengthened by suppliers' inability to meet demand requirements. The institute said that unanticipated strong demand led to a fall in stock levels in June. Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said the prices data 'will worry some people because it resonates with the recent CBI survey' which showed a jump in the number of companies planning to raise prices. However, Mr Smith said: 'What we see in the institute survey is the consequence of higher world commodity prices. It doesn't necessarily mean it will feed through to retail prices.' The institute compiles its data by interviewing a panel of managers from 300 manufacturing companies. The UK economy will grow at 3 per cent this year and at 2.6 per cent in 1995, says National Westminster Bank. It predicts underlying inflation will rise to 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1995, near the top of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range and well above the Treasury's forecast of 2.75 per cent.</p>

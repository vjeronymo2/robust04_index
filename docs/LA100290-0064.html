			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: THIS GUY'S RAIDER-BEAR STORY TURNS OUT TO BE A REAL RIOT  </P> <P> Hey, dude, like, you got a problem with Steve Schoenfeld? Maybe he did get a  little fanciful with the lead of his Raider-Chicago Bear game story in Monday's  Arizona Republic. So what, dude?  </P> <P> Schoenfeld wrote: "A mugging took place before kickoff. The fan was carried  off. No bother. This is Los Angeles Raider football. It just added to the  pregame festivities."  </P> <P> Wait a minute. What mugging before kickoff?  </P> <P> Trivia time: Name the pitcher with a losing record who will appear on next  year's Hall of Fame ballot for the first time.  </P> <P> Road kill: The bumper stickers seen while cruising around Mississippi might  have been more humorous before Alabama defeated Vanderbilt Saturday -- but not  much more.  </P> <P> The top line reads: "Honk if you've coached football at Alabama."  </P> <P> Below are the names "(Ray) Perkins, (Bill) Curry and (Gene) Stallings" with  lines drawn through them, followed by "??????"  </P> <P> Sure lock: An employee in the odds-setting department at Caliente race track in  Tijuana is paying special attention to the American League East race. And if  the Boston Red Sox win the division title, he'll be a nervous wreck.  </P> <P> During spring training, when the track inaugurated future book wagering on the  pennant races and the World Series, the unnamed employee mistakenly set the  computer at 300-1 on the Red Sox to win the American League championship,  instead of the correct odds, 6-1.  </P> <P> Said Jorge Hank, Caliente's owner and general manager: "Seven fans immediately  saw the tremendous overlay and got down for a total of about $1,000 before the  mistake was caught and corrected."  </P> <P> Add Caliente: Hank said that one player bet $700 on Boston and added that "even  though we do have a rule that allows us not to honor tickets issued due to  obvious human or computer error -- just as all the sports books in Nevada have  the same clause -- we will nevertheless keep faith with our customers and honor  their tickets, should the Red Sox win the pennant."  </P> <P> Last add Caliente: And if the Red Sox do make the playoffs against Oakland,  what about the employee who goofed?  </P> <P> Said Hank: "You can trust me when I tell you that (the Athletics') most  fanatical fan, at least during the championship series, is right here in  Tijuana."  </P> <P> These two again?: On this day in 1920, the Cincinnati Reds and the Pittsburgh  Pirates played the 20th Century's only major league tripleheader. The Reds won  the first two games, and the Pirates won the third, which was called after six  innings because of darkness.  </P> <P> That's better: Robert G. Brown, 49, finished the 10-kilometer Great Race in  Pittsburgh Sunday in 1 hour 5 minutes.  </P> <P> Said Brown: "I definitely wanted to run this year."  </P> <P> Midway through last year's Great Race, Brown went into cardiac arrest. In  January, he had quadruple bypass surgery to open clogged arteries. After two  months of rehabilitation, he resumed running and gradually increased his  distance.  </P> <P> Said Brown: "I wanted to show people with heart trouble you can do all of the  things you did before."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Rollie Fingers, with a record of 114-118 and a major  league-record 341 saves.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Nebraska defensive coordinator Charlie McBride, on the eighth-ranked  Cornhuskers' 7-3 halftime deficit against 51 1/2-point underdog Oregon State:  "We started out like we were playing bridge."

			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KARCHER STOCK IS SCORCHED BY DIP IN EARNINGS  </P> <P> Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc.'s stock dropped sharply Friday after the operator  of Carl's Jr. restaurants reported a third-quarter earnings decline of 49% from  the year-earlier period.  </P> <P> The Anaheim-based company, citing weak consumer spending and the resulting  sluggishness in the fast-food business, posted earnings of $2.1 million for the  quarter ended Nov. 5, down from $4.1 million a year earlier.  </P> <P> That news evidently hurt Karcher stock, which dropped 15.8% to close in  over-the-counter trading at $6 per share, off $1.125.  </P> <P> Besides the weakening economy, Karcher officials said another factor  contributing to the earnings decline was the franchising of 40 Arizona  restaurants previously owned by the company. Sales from those restaurants  boosted third-quarter earnings in 1989 but did not contribute to the latest  quarter results.  </P> <P> Revenue fell slightly, to $120.9 million for the latest quarter, from $121.6  million last year.  </P> <P> Loren Pannier, Karcher's chief financial officer, said the company expects a  stronger fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "Even with the disappointing third quarter, I believe the year will end up as  the second or third best in the company's history," he said. "Out of a 49-year  history, that's a pretty strong statement. I had expected the third quarter to  be a weaker quarter."  </P> <P> The company's operating earnings declined just 15% in the third quarter, to  $6.8 million from $8 million a year earlier. The company attributed the decline  to higher revenue a year ago from real estate transactions and a decline in  investment and other income in the lastest quarter.  </P> <P> "The numbers on the surface are a little disappointing," said Thomas F.  Caraisco, an analyst for Emmett A. Larkin, a San Francisco brokerage. "The  fast-food market has been very difficult and slow. However, they (Karcher  officials) have indicated to me they have seen some pick-up towards the end of  the third quarter."  </P> <P> Some fast-food competitors of Carl's Jr. have tried to make up for sluggish  sales by introducing "value pricing" -- the practice of marking down prices on  a few key items to lure customers. Fast-food purveyors are betting, for  instance, that customers will wash down marginally profitable, inexpensive  hamburgers with more profitable soft drinks.  </P> <P> Irvine-based Taco Bell Corp. has credited much of its success to the concept;  now McDonald's and Wendy's are testing the idea.  </P> <P> But Karcher, which operates 561 Carl's Jr. outlets, has resisted so far, except  with its breakfast menu. Patty Parks, a company spokeswoman, said the fast-food  chain has introduced a "value menu" of 99-cent items on its breakfast menu but  does not plan to make similar changes for other meals.  </P> <P> One effect of the weaker economy, analysts and company officials said, is that  some consumers are eating less frequently at sit-down restaurants and turning  instead to fast food.  </P> <P> Sarah Stack, an analyst for Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles, said  some customers are eating fast food more frequently "but (some) people have  resisted . . . quick-service restaurants because prices have gone up  considerably."  </P> <P> </P> <P> KARCHER'S PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> In the third quarter ended Nov. 5, Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. reported net  income of $2.1 million, down from $4.1 million in the comparable period a year  ago. The company attributed the loss to a drop in consumer spending that is  adversely impacting the fast-food business.  </P> <P> Figures are in thousands except per-share data.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.10IN:2.22IN:2.11IN:2.22IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 3rd Qtr  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 3rd Qtr  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 9 Months  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 9 Months  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Revenue  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $120,897  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $121,558  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $403,018  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $393,298  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net income (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,073  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4,054  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12,419  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 14,460  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Per share (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $0.11  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $0.22  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $0.68  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $0.77  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Carl Karcher Enterprises  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 5 GERMAN FANS GIVEN 2 YEARS IN SOCCER BRAWL  </P> <P> Five German fans were sentenced to two years in prison today for their  participation in the violence preceding Sunday's West Germany-Yugoslavia World  Cup match.  </P> <P> They were released on bail but ordered to stay away from the 12 Italian cities  playing host to World Cup matches.  </P> <P> The charges -- including resisting arrest, causing bodily injury and vandalism  -- resulted from clashes that began when the Germans throwing rocks,  firecrackers and bottles attacked a group of Yugoslavs waving their flag on the  steps of the Duomo, Milan's spire-topped cathedral.  </P> <P> It took police using batons and tear gas more than two hours to restore order.  </P> <P> Authorities estimated that 1,000 Germans were involved in the clashes and in a  window-smashing and looting rampage through the center of the city. Italian  newspapers said the 30 injured included police, fans and passers-by.  </P> <P> Forty German and four German-speaking Swiss soccer fans were expelled from the  country, 14 others were arrested, and four more were issued citations and  ordered to leave Italy.  </P> <P> Authorities blamed alcohol use for much of the rampage. Milan had banned the  sale and serving of alcohol for the day of the game, but many fans had beer  bottles in their cars, apparently purchased outside Milan or brought into Italy  from their home country.  </P></p>

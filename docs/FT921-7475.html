			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Belgium may end coalition deadlock BELGIUM seems poised to emerge from 13 weeks of political deadlock over forming a coalition government. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the senior Flemish politician exploring the coalition possibilities, has suggested that Christian Democrats and socialists from both sides of the French-Flemish language divide should form a 'limited government', with half the usual number of ministers. Since November's inconclusive election, Belgium has been governed by a caretaker administration under Mr Wilfried Martens, the long-serving prime minister. Successive politicians have failed to form a new coalition. Mr Dehaene's plan has a better chance of success because the Flemish Christian Democrats have finally agreed to drop their demand for a coalition with the liberal parties. 'It's the beginning of the end of the crisis,' said a spokeswoman for Mr Dehaene last night. If the Belgian king agrees with Mr Dehaene's plan, he will decide who should form and lead a new government. The government is expected to try to cut the country's large budget deficit and push through constitutional changes.</p>

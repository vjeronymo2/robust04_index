			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Benazir Bhutto leads boycott of parliament PAKISTAN'S former prime minister Benazir Bhutto led an opposition boycott of the parliament's lower house yesterday after clashing with the government over an alleged attempt to kill her last month, Reuter reports from Islamabad. Ms Bhutto and other deputies of her People's Democratic Alliance (PDA) marched out of the house after Gohar Ayub Khan, the National Assembly speaker, gave short shrift to their accusations. Shujaat Hussain, the Interior minister, denied the PDA charge that ruling party members attacked Ms Bhutto's caravan with gunfire, stones and sticks when she visited Multan in Punjab province last month to meet victims of devastating floods. Ms Bhutto blamed members of the Pakistan Moslem League (PML) party of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for the September 23 attack, which she branded a conspiracy. 'This is a black day in the history of this parliament,' Ms Bhutto said later. The alliance would decide its next move today, she added. On Saturday, a court acquitted Ms Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari of masterminding the murder of 29 people. Prison officials said Mr Zardari, who was arrested in October 1990, was still being held to face other charges, although this acquittal was his fifth so far.</p>

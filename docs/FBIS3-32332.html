The document establishes  that 750 million new pesos will be assigned to the development  of social projects in that state.    During the ceremony, the social development secretary said  that the public projects and investments that have been carried  out are not enough because the situation in the state is the  product of centuries of backwardness. This is why it is  necessary to respect the decisions of the community and to  listen to and heed their proposals and their truth, he said.    Javier Lopez Moreno said that efforts to integrate a  political coalition government will continue because this is  what the current situation demands.    At the end of the ceremony, the officials went to Comitan,  Chiapas, where they inaugurated one of the 16 health centers  that will function in the state for peasants and Indians.</p>

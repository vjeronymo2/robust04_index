			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / World Trade News: 'Quad' talks on market access fail BRINKMANSHIP by leading industrial nations over a big trade liberalisation package is to be pushed to the very eve of next month's Group of Seven summit at which it is due to be presented. This follows the failure of trade ministers, meeting in Tokyo yesterday, to settle long-standing differences on opening their markets. 'It is unfortunate that we could not come to a full agreement,' said one Japanese participant, adding however that as a result of two days of sometimes acrimonious debate, negotiators had 'become rather more realistic'. The so-called 'quad' trade ministers - from Canada, Japan, the US and the European Community - instructed officials to hold one further round of negotiations in Toronto next week. They themselves are to hold a special meeting on July 6, the eve of the Tokyo G7 summit, when they hope to agree a 'balanced and broad' package of tariff cuts in manufactures, and market opening in services. Hopes have been raised that this big market access package could be used as a springboard for winning broad international backing for global trade reform under the long-delayed Uruguay Round. This in turn would provide a fillip to the recession-hit world economy. Putting a brave face on events, Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said that yesterday's failure was 'not surprising, given the magnitude of our ambitions'. His US counterpart, Mr Mickey Kantor, pointed out that he had 'never been in a negotiation that ended before it had to. . . It is neither surprising, nor disturbing that we did not reach a conclusion today'. Strongly held differences emerged at the outset of the meeting, when EC negotiators effectively withdrew earlier market-opening commitments, arguing that they had been made on the assumption of big cuts in US textile tariffs, which range from 20 to 40 per cent. In the event, the textile proposal fell far short of expected levels, averaging cuts of about a third, and including many exceptions. Other critical stumbling blocks included the EC's unwillingness to make deep cuts in its tariffs on non-ferrous metals and aluminium, and Japan's refusal to drop tariffs on spirits and wood products. Sir Leon said he would make no prediction about progress between now and July 6. He insisted, however, that the package had to include 'something that is balanced and broad' - balanced, 'otherwise other industrial and developing countries will not go along with it', and broad and deep, 'or it won't address the needs that the world economy presents'.</p>

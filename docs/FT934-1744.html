			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Bank 'should seek to achieve price stability' The influential cross-party Commons Treasury and civil service committee yesterday said the Bank of England should have greater autonomy over monetary policy but be made more accountable to parliament. The committee agreed by a 9-1 majority, with Ms Diane Abbott, the Labour MP for Hackney North dissenting, that the Bank of England Act should be amended so that the primary objective of the Bank would be to 'achieve and maintain' price stability. Publication of the committee's keenly awaited report gave an immediate boost to supporters of more autonomy for the Bank. The Commons will debate the commit-tee's proposals early next year. Mr Nicholas Budgen, the Conservative MP for Wolverhampton South-West and a committee member, is preparing a private member's bill, based on the committee's recommendations, that will be given its second reading on January 28. The committee's report recommended that the Bank should be operationally responsible for achieving stable prices, a move that would transfer power to change interest rates from the Treasury to the Bank. The committee said that the government and Bank should agree publicly stated targets for price stability which would be open to debate in parliament. The targets, it said, should be set in the light of monetary and other indicators 'including the extent of spare capacity in the economy and the overall stance of fiscal policy'. It said the Bank should be made far more accountable to parliament through an annual report, which would be debated in the Commons, and through appearances of the governor before the Treasury committee. The committee said its proposals would require changes in the Bank, including the creation of 'a strong and independent monetary policy committee' comprising the governor, the deputy governor and other executive directors. It said, however, that the government should have power to override the Bank's objective of price stability temporarily and in exceptional circumstances. The committee gave lukewarm support for the Bank retaining its role as supervisor of the UK banking industry. It said this position would need to be reviewed if there were to be a complete reorganisation of banking and financial services regulation. The committee plans to investigate supervision under the Financial Services Act in the new year. It will also look into recent revelations on the inappropriate selling of private pension schemes. The committee emphasised the importance of greater transparency in monetary policy. It recommended publication, after a lag, of the minutes of existing monthly meetings between the chancellor and Bank governor and said the minutes of the proposed monetary policy committee should also be published after an interval. The Bank welcomed the report, and a spokesman pointed out that Mr Eddie George, its governor, believed institutional changes such as those proposed would help it to achieve price stability. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said he had an open mind. 'I will give it careful consideration,' he said in a Commons reply. 'We need further discussion and debate. I have a feeling that at the moment it has become something of a fashionable cause.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Michel De Muelenaere report: "The Twelve Want To Believe </F> in Diplomatic Action"]    [Text] "This is a diplomatic challenge, but at this point  we have no other proposal." The European foreign ministers  meeting in Luxembourg yesterday felt helpless. A meager  consolation, however, is that all the parties involved in the  Bosnian crisis without exception have been slapped in the face  in Goradze. "Neither the UN nor the NATO actions have been able  to help Goradze in a decisive way," German Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel said. However, the Twelve have not resigned  themselves to giving up nor agreed to put up with a further  deterioration of the situation. "We do not accept fait  accomplis," Alain Juppe said.    "The diplomatic initiative must resume." In line with the  request put forward by Paris, the Twelve are urging the UN  Security Council to adopt a resolution which includes the four  proposals of Yasuhsi Akashi, UN special envoy to former  Yugoslavia: immediate cease-fire in Goradze, withdrawal of  Serbian troops to the positions they occupied before the  attacks, guaranteed exclusion zone around the town, and  deployment of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR).    No additional pressure will be exerted, however, including  the threat of air strikes. But turning those elements into a  Security Council resolution will give them additional force,  according to the Twelve. "Goradze has become a symbol,"  according to Klaus Kinkel. "A withdrawal of the UN troops will  not benefit anyone, not even to the Serbs themselves."    "They are acting out of despair because they feel isolated,"  Willy Claes believes. "But by attacking the blue helmets, they  are playing with dynamite."    A lifting of the sanctions against Belgrade is out of the  question. "We cannot accept this blackmail," a minister  stressed. "First, the West must make clear demands and the Serbs  must send a positive sign, then we will see...." As far as  leaving former Yugoslavia is concerned, "no one envisages such  an option," Mr. Claes added.    The real new element is the willingness of all sides to  achieve better cooperation between the UN, European, Russian,  and U.S. negotiators. "One day the Serbs talk to Churkin, the  next day they see Redman, and then Akashi," Alain Juppe  complained. "On the day they entered Goradze, the Serbs  explained to Messrs. Akashi and Churkin that they were ready to  negotiate."    To put an end to the game being played by the Serbs, the  Europeans suggest that the four main powers should create a  joint negotiating team that would make it possible to put  pressure on the warring sides. "The three parties have agreed  to return to the negotiating table," according to the French.  "But it has not materialized because they have not found any  unified front. Moreover, the Goradze case has been badly  managed." According to the French, U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher "has not said `no.'" Russian negotiator Vitaly  Churkin has supposedly approved the principle of a joint forum.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Russian defence ministry turns on Kozyrev A BITTER struggle erupted yesterday within the Russian government, as the ministries of defence and security turned on Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister - accusing him of doing the job of US intelligence in seeking the reform of the security and defence systems. Their spokesmen rejected claims by Mr Kozyrev last week, that a 'party of war' was operating in military circles and that security and defence officials were nurturing a coup. They said that local disturbances based on economic grievances were possible, however. They said Mr Kozyrev's call for 'radical reform' of the KGB and defence departments would destroy the professional competence of these agencies  - the aim of the US Central Intelligence Agency. Last week Mr Kozyrev also accused the Russian military of supplying the bulk of the arms being used in the conflict in Moldova and its breakaway region of TransDnestr, and asked - 'Why are the military deciding major political questions? When tanks turn into an independent political force, this spells catastrophe.' General Alexander Lebed, recently appointed head of the 14th Russian Army in the TransDnestr, which has a majority Russian/Ukrainian population, responded by saying that Moldova's government was a 'fascist' one and that the TransDnestr, which is claiming independent status, would be defended. The defence ministry yesterday refused to condemn General Lebed's remarks. On the contrary, General Alexei Gulko, one of its representatives, said that 'Alexander Lebed is a Russian patriot, and his statement met with understanding from the officers of the 14th Army.' The defence and security ministries initiative yesterday casts doubt on the worth of the agreement reached at the meeting of the heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States on Monday to send a peace-keeping force to Moldova to separate the warring forces. A ceasefire called in the region for Tuesday night was reported to have been violated several times yesterday, and the government of Belarus, one of the states which was to have sent a peace-keeping contingent, said it will not do so. However, Marshall Yevgenny Shaposhnikov, head of the CIS armed forces - which largely now consists of strategic nuclear weapons - said yesterday that General Boris Pyankov, his deputy, would be in charge of settling armed conflicts within the CIS countries - and that foreign and defence ministers are scheduled to meet in Minsk next Thursday to define how and where a peace-keeping force would be used.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Burndene shares show 50% rise SHARES IN Burndene Investments yesterday rose by almost 50 per cent to 175p, the highest level for almost three years, following the announcement of annual pre-tax profits ahead by 14 per cent, writes Nigel Clark. The increase was the result of a second half recovery at Willerby Caravans and a continued improvement at Pretty Legs, the hosiery manufacturer. Mr David Caldow, chairman, said that the weather had played an important part in the results. Following two warm summers the more typical weather in the first part of 1991 helped the hosiery side while the sunnier climate from the third week of July onwards came in time to boost the caravan business. He added that Willerby had a 'most creditable performance' in difficult market con-ditions and succeeded in increasing its share of a reduced market. In the first quarter of the current year sales of caravan holiday homes were slightly higher while the hosiery division had maintained sales. However, on prospects Mr Caldow said that they were governed by the rate of recovery in the UK economy and the weather. Pre-tax profits for the year to September 28 were Pounds 4.33m (Pounds 3.81m) and followed interim results of Pounds 1.47m (Pounds 2.19m). Divisional breakdown showed that caravan manufacturing and park operating contributed Pounds 2.98m (Pounds 3.31m) with Pounds 686,000 (Pounds 219,000) from hosiery. Turnover was lower at Pounds 47.3m (Pounds 49.3m) and the pre-tax figure was struck after lower net interest costs of Pounds 576,000 (Pounds 730,000). From earnings per share of 29.31p (24.88p) directors are proposing an increased final dividend of 6.5p for an unchanged total of 8.5p.</p>

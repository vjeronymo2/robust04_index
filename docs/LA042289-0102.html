			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT&amp;T WANTS JUDGE'S OK TO OWN DATA SERVICES  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. on Friday asked a federal judge to lift  provisions in a consent decree that prohibit AT&amp;T from owning the computer  data, financial data and other information services it transmits on its wires.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T, in a brief filed with U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, noted that  the agreement under which the old Bell System was broken up allowed the  restrictions on "electronic publishing" to be lifted after seven years unless  it were shown it should be continued. The prohibition on electronic publishing  was worked out on Aug. 24, 1982.  </P> <P> Greene, who oversaw the Bell breakup, stated at that time that the burden after  seven years would be on any opponents of removal "to show that competitive  conditions clearly require the maintenance of the ban," AT&amp;T's filing said.  </P> <P> The company said the leading firms in the electronic publishing industry "are  large, financially strong corporations."  </P> <P> AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said those include Knight-Ridder (on-line  database services), Citicorp, Dow Jones and Reuters (securities quotations and  financial information), Dun &amp; Bradstreet and TRW (credit data) and General  Electric, IBM and Sears (videotex services).  </P> <P> Linnen said AT&amp;T had no plans to enter the electronic yellow pages and  television businesses -- two areas that are of special concern to the seven  regional Bell telephone companies that were spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984 and  to the broadcast and cable-TV industries.  </P> <P> The company, quoting from the consent decree guiding AT&amp;T's breakup, said:  "There are now 'means other than AT&amp;T's network for the transmission of the  messages of electronic publishers,' and those firms providing electronic  publishing services unquestionably have 'sufficient strength to permit them to  compete.' "  </P> <P> It cited MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint as being among those  transmission competitors and said "it is beyond serious dispute that these  carriers offer ample alternatives to all of the AT&amp;T interexchange  transmission services used by electronic publishers."  </P> <P> MCI officials did not immediately return calls for comment.  </P> <P> Bill McCloskey, a spokesman for one of the seven regional Bell companies,  BellSouth, said company officials had not seen the filing and could not  comment.  </P> <P> Robert L. Smith Jr., executive director of the Videotex Industry Assn., said  AT&amp;T could be a "potentially very important participant" in electronic  publishing, "and I think probably the one area to watch out is if they use this  as an opportunity to get into electronic yellow pages."  </P> <P> Noting that the regional Bell companies are banned from this area, he said a  "vacuum" existed there.  </P> <P> In 1987, Greene gave the regional Bell companies permission to transmit but not  originate information services, which, besides electronic publishing, also  includes data processing and related computer services.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its Recommendation 87&hyph;7: A New Role for the Social Security Appeals Council (adopted December 18, 1987), the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) concluded that the high volume of work of the Council (up to 500 cases per member per month) precluded it from detecting emerging problems, identifying new issues to be resolved, and identifying and developing needed policies. ACUS recommended that the Secretary and SSA restructure the Appeals Council in ``a fashion that redirects the institution's goals and operations from an exclusive focus on processing the stream of individual cases and toward an emphasis on improved organizational effectiveness'' (1 CFR 305.87&hyph;7). To this end, ACUS recommended that ``the Appeals Council should be provided the authority to reduce significantly its caseload and also be given, as its principal mandate, the responsibility to recommend and, where appropriate, develop and implement adjudicatory principles and decisional standards for the disability determination process.'' ACUS also recommended that the agency enhance the status of the Appeals Council and provide law clerks to its members.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To address the workload problems ACUS discussed in its recommendation, SSA decided, in 1988, to add Appeals Officers to the Council to enable the members to focus their attention on the more complex and significant cases, including those cases presenting important policy or procedural issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appeals Officers presently assist AAJs in considering recommendations made by the Council's support staff in OHA's Office of Appellate Operations. Appeals Officers, who are attorneys, also act as the AAJs' staff attorneys, researching and providing legal memoranda on issues arising from cases that come to the attention of the Appeals Council. However, because the Appeals Officers do not have authority under our existing regulations to carry out any of the decision making responsibilities of the AAJs, one or more AAJs must make these decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Research we have supported since we established the Appeals Officer position has persuaded us that if the Appeals Officers are authorized to assume some of the responsibilities of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAJs, the AAJs will be able to focus more of their attention on cases that present broad policy or procedural issues. In a report commissioned by ACUS in 1989 (Report and Recommendations on the Social Security Administration's Administrative Appeals Process), Professor Frank S. Block discussed the Appeals Council's workload and stated that the Council could not be expected to assume a meaningful review function for all claims that might be presented to it. One of the recommendations in the report was that the Appeals Council be authorized ``to use staff or lower level Council members to deny a request for review, and limit the review of cases by the Appeals Council to those raising significant policy issues.'' See Recommendation No. 12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To complete the changes we contemplated when we established the Appeals Officer position, we propose to amend &sect;422.205 to authorize Appeals Officers to deny a request for review of an ALJ hearing decision. Because an ALJ's dismissal of a request for a hearing is not subject to judicial review, AAJs will continue to decide whether to grant or deny a request for review of a hearing dismissal. Appeals Officers will continue to receive guidance, direction and supervision from AAJs, including instructions as to specific issues or kinds of cases requiring the attention of the AAJ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. HEALTH CARE  </P> <P> It is time to think more about our greatest national weakness, namely health  care. We have just had a bitter taste of being taxed on tax to support  so-called catastrophic health care. The United States has 37 million people who  are uninsured and 10 million to 12 million of that number are our children.  </P> <P> Politicians tell us we have the best medical facilities in the world, but go on  to say that only 30% can afford those facilities. The other 70% must go without  care or go bankrupt.  </P> <P> The time has come when our businesses and factories can no longer afford health  insurance for their employees and are ready to make a change. We must realize  that health is everyone's problem. They say that the United States has the  highest health care bill of any nation in the world, yet we have a high  mortality rate for babies up to 1 year of age.  </P> <P> So what is the solution to this dilemma?  </P> <P> Other nations have pioneered this problem and none have given up national  health care once in place. We know that doctors and insurance companies will  tell us it won't work, but we have listened to them long enough. Let this  nation be all it can be.  </P> <P> ALFRED E. BRIGGS  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

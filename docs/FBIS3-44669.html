			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Fei Weiwei (6316 0251 0251) and </F> XINHUA reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)]    [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- Luo Zhiling, vice  chairman of the State Planning Commission, today briefed the  capital's press circles on price situation in the market,  pointing out that the government would take effective measures  to stabilize prices in the course of deepening reform.    Grain and edible oil prices have risen sharply since  November  because of anticipation of higher prices, rumors, untimely  shipping, speculation by a handful of units, and other irregular  factors. The price rise has also spread to pork and other major  nonstaple food items. The rise in grain and edible oil prices  has triggered panic buying in some localities, exacerbating  people's fear of inflation. Following the situation with great  interest, leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee and  State Council have personally conducted investigations and  solicited views from the masses. A number of measures to  stabilize grain and edible oil prices have been announced one  after another since mid-December. In particular, following the  25 December work conference convened by the State Council for  keeping down grain and edible oil prices, governments at all  levels took the matter seriously. They promptly took action by  convening special meetings to make specific arrangements  requiring retailers to mark the prices of grain and edible oil.  The State Planning Commission, Internal Trade Ministry,  Railways Ministry, State Administration for Industry and  Commerce, and other departments have either convened meetings or  issued circulars to outline specific arrangements for fully  utilizing major channels of circulation; for organizing the  procurement, allocation, shipping, and marketing of grains; and  for stepping up the monitoring and supervision over market  prices.    At present, state-owned grain shops in large and  medium-sized  cities across the country -- including some prefectures, cities,  county towns, and market towns -- sell grain at uniform marked  prices with unlimited supply. The prevailing marked prices in  the localities are as follows: standard flour, 0.55 to 0.65 yuan  a jin; Class-2 standard polished long-grained rice, 0.65 yuan a  jin; and rapeseed oil, 3.2 to 3.5 yuan a jin. The state has  sold 5 billion jin of reserve grains and 32,000 metric tons of  reserve commodity edible oil. Shaanxi, Shandong, Anhui,  Beijing, and many other provinces and cities have also sold  local reserves to stabilize grain and edible oil prices in their  localities. To ensure implementation of the policy and measures  of the CPC Central Committee and State Council, local price,  grain, industry and commerce departments have dispatched  personnel in force to monitor and supervise prices in the  market. In Beijing alone, over 600 monitors make daily rounds  of the grain stores. Thanks to the aforementioned measures,  grain and edible oil prices have dropped in some localities.    The state will implement a series of major reforms involving  taxes, exchange rates, finance, banking, and investment in the  New Year. Luo Zhiling pointed out: Implementation of these  reforms will help build the basic framework of a socialist  market economy. The steps and scope of reform will be big,  covering all sectors and all trades. In formulating the  program, we have taken the interest of all quarters -- the  immediate interest of the broad masses of the people in  particular -- into consideration. Generally speaking, reform  will not trigger widespread price hikes. In case it has some  impact on certain sectors or commodities, the state will pay  adequate attention to them and spare no efforts in devising  reform plans and supporting measures to soften the impact on  society. The total supply and demands will remain basically  balanced in 1994. In the current year, we have plentiful grain  resources; the grain output was 30 billion jin higher than in  the previous year and we are well-stocked in grain. The state  will take a variety of measures to increase the supply of edible  vegetable oil. Supply and demand of home appliances, clothing  items, and other articles for daily use are basically balanced  and, in some cases, supply outstrips demand. We are entirely  capable of ensuring adequate supply and keeping the prices  relatively stable. The broad masses of the people can set their  minds at rest.    As for additional measures the government will take to keep  the prices stable, Luo Zhiling said: We have made initial  progress in stabilizing grain and edible oil prices. However,  governments at all levels will continue to keep a close watch on  the market. They will step up administration and monitoring of  the market around the holidays to uncover problems and solve  them in a timely fashion. The state will continue to organize  well procurement, allocation, shipping, and marketing of grain,  edible oil prices, and other essential materials and sell  reserve grains to further bring down prices. To step up control  and supervision of the prices, we will, in the near future, ask  the State Council to publish "Provisions Concerning Marking the  Prices of Commodities and Services" and "Procedures for  Supervision Over the Prices of Daily Necessities and Services in  Urban Areas." Price departments at all levels should organize  and step up supervision and inspections in accordance with the  two sets of regulations. They should earnestly investigate and  prosecute illegal activities involving exorbitant profits by  driving up prices and disrupting the market, conscientiously  protect the interests of the consumers, and see to it that  reform and opening up go forward smoothly. As we stabilize  market prices, localities and departments must not raise prices  or service fees under one excuse or another. State-run  enterprises and establishments must take the lead in  implementing, in an exemplary manner, the state laws and  policies on prices and give full play to their role as the main  channels for regulating goods and stabilizing prices. They must  not take advantage of reform to drive up prices for the benefit  of small groups. Violators, once caught, will be punished  severely. We also hope that the broad masses of people will, as  masters of the state, step up public supervision of the market  prices.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty], April 22 (XINHUA) -- Kazakhstan  President Nursultan Abishevich Nazarbayev said here today that  the Chinese premier's upcoming visit will enhance the  traditionally friendly relations between China and Kazakhstan.    He told XINHUA that the good neighborly relations between  the  Chinese and Kazakhstan people are centuries long, and many  common elements bring the two peoples together.    He added that the joint statement on Sino-Kazakh friendly  relations signed in Beijing last fall was an historic document  of great significance, paving the way for long-term and steady  development of bilateral relations.    On economic cooperation, Nazarbayev said that the two  countries have established 150 joint ventures in Kazakhstan. He  hoped these joint ventures will develop rapidly.    On the domestic economic situation, he said Kazakhstan is  rich in natural resources and has tremendous potential economic  power. But the disintegration of the Soviet Union has destroyed  the economic connection between the former Soviet Republics.  The economic situation and the people's lives have been  seriously affected.    He said Kazakhstan is carrying out industrial structural  reform aimed at transforming a raw material economy into a  high-tech oriented market economy.    He added that Kazakhstan is creating investment laws to  better attract more foreign investment, introducing more foreign  technology and improving management.</p>

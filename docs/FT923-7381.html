			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Justice for the Moslems MR JOHN Major returned to London last night, having interrupted his holiday for talks with senior cabinet colleagues on the Bosnian crisis. In so doing, he inevitably raises expectations that Britain, as president of the EC, is about to take a more decisive lead in dealing with that crisis. If those expectations were to be disappointed, the prime minister would have been much better advised to stay in Spain. So far, Britain's main contribution has been to call a new, larger peace conference in London next week, whose main purpose seems to be to dilute the responsibility for failure, allowing the EC to lean on the UN. There is certainly plenty of failure to share responsibility for. The republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, to which the EC solemnly accorded recognition in April, has all but ceased to exist: its government retains control only of a tiny area of territory around the capital, and a few other isolated pockets. Well over a quarter of its inhabitants have been driven from their homes. Effectively the republic has been partitioned, with the lion's share of the territory going to the Serbs, who make up only a third of the population but are much more heavily armed, thanks to the support of the rump of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) stationed in Bosnia. Aiming to be sole masters of the territory in which they live, they have not scrupled to expel its other inhabitants, most of them Moslems, by the most brutal methods, endowing the vocabulary of war with a new and horrible euphemism: 'ethnic cleansing'. The international community needs now to face up to the magnitude of its failure, rather than hair-splitting over the logistics of humanitarian relief. It must consider how far the consequences are reversible, and how far they form an inescapable if unpalatable reality on which any future arrangements must be built. Unitary state The most unpalatable but also most inescapable consequence is that the demographic status quo ante cannot be restored. Even if all the atrocities had been committed by one side, it would be unrealistic to expect the victims and the perpetrators to live peacefully intermingled in towns and villages as they did before. For a long time to come most Bosnians will feel safe only among members of their own community, whether Moslem, Serb, or Croat. Everyone should have the right to return to his or her home, but many in practice will not do so. That being so, the Moslems will do themselves no good by continuing to insist on a unitary state. However much they may regret agreeing to the EC's 'March 18 principles', under which Bosnia-Hercegovina was to become an independent state with three 'constituent units', they must know that is the only imaginable solution. What is clearly unacceptable is for the Serbs to retain anything like the proportion of territory they control, and for the Moslems to be confined to the miserable remnant the government has held on to, or to be exiled permanently from the republic. The offer by the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, to reduce the territory he holds from the claimed 70 per cent to 64 per cent, is outrageous and insulting. Significant quantities While the international community cannot put Bosnia-Hercegovina together again as it was before the war, it can insist that the Moslems be allowed a 'constituent unit' roughly proportionate to the size of their community - 43 per cent of the population. Mr Karadzic has been able to seize the territory he holds in the teeth of international condemnation and in spite of sanctions applied to Serbia, from or through which his supply lines run. Those sanctions should not be relaxed until the Serbs agree to relinquish significant quantities of the territory they control. So Britain must take the lead in advocating extreme firmness towards Serbia, while giving every possible support to the Moslems in their hour of agony. It may be necessary to send troops to protect them in the enclaves where they are now confined, with the supply lines essential to their survival - and later to help them defend their expanded territorial unit. But above all the Serbs must be kept under maximum international pressure until they agree to negotiate a reasonable territorial and constitutional settlement.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: The nightmare facing French policy makers - Pursuing rational economics means political humiliation THE problem with the struggle over the future of the European exchange rate mechanism is that the economics and the politics are out of kilter. From a purely economic point of view, France is obviously neglecting its real economic interests by clinging with such fierce determination to the virtually fixed exchange rate against the D-Mark. But from a political point of view, the ERM at its existing exchange rates has acquired all the symbolism of the commitment to closer European integration encapsulated in the Treaty of Maastricht. This may not be rational, but it is a fact. If France were not compelled to follow the perverse constraints of the Bundesbank's tight monetary policy, it would be free to respond to low inflation and rising unemployment by sharply lowering its interest rates. But the medium-term political trade-offs would look much more dubious. First, the reputation of the franc as a hard currency would once again be on the line; and the abandonment of the franc fort policy would require a wrenching domestic political reappraisal, since it has been followed with rare unanimity by both left and right in France for ten years. More generally, abandonment of existing exchange rate policy would mean that the credibility of the exchange rate mechanism itself would start to be in question. Most serious of all, the prospects for economic and monetary union, already seriously battered by successive waves of speculative attack, would be further discredited. When President Francois Mitterrand opted in 1983 for what came to be called the franc fort policy, he was effectively discarding most of his election commitments to old-fashioned socialism in France. Instead, he was putting a higher priority on three other values: France's ability to compete in international markets in the outside world, France's reputation as a fiscally responsible country, and France's commitments to the European Community. To begin with, the government's new objectives were quite modest: to put an end to soaring trade and budget deficits, to bring down rising inflation, and stop the repeated devaluations. But as the new policy started to work, it became the centrepiece of France's progressive conversion to market economics, both in the official establishment and among the electorate. In addition it also became the starting point for all subsequent official thinking in France about the future development of the European Community. Without the franc fort conversion in 1983, it is unlikely that France could have accepted the 1985 programme for a Single European Market; and without the accumulated success of the franc fort policy, it is inconceivable that France could have gone along with, let alone proposed, the plan for economic and monetary union eventually incorporated in the Maastricht treaty. But the political corollary of the success of the franc fort policy was even more profound, because it vastly increased the confidence of French politicians, including President Francois Mitterrand, in their attitudes to the relationship with Germany. Previous French leaders, starting with President Charles de Gaulle, had always known that France was economically much weaker than Germany; but they attempted to dominate Germany politically, by virtue of the wartime inheritance, France's possession of nuclear weapons and a seat on the Security Council, and Germany's division and diminished sovereignty. But after the franc fort policy began to produce consistent benefits in the late 1980s, with steadily falling inflation, the French started to think that they might even be able to compete with Germany on terms of economic equality as well. This new economic self-confidence goes a long way to explain the extraordinary partnership between President Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. First, it meant that both of them could believe that their own countries would benefit from ever-more ambitious plans for the integration of a federal Europe. Moreover, when the Germans were reunited and recovered their political sovereignty, it meant that President Mitterrand was able to overcome his initial reflex of revulsion, and instead press for a further acceleration of the Community's integration plans. And in the end, he claimed that monetary union in Europe would make the Community the world's number one monetary power. But the converse is that the franc exchange rate has become a virility symbol of French economic strength. If it were to be blown out of the ERM, that would be a major humiliation on political grounds of self-respect. The problem today is that this logical construction, built up from the foundations of the franc fort, is now turning into a nightmare for French policy makers. In a logical world, it might make sense to argue for a temporary suspension of the ERM, until Germany has digested the costs of unification; it might make sense to re-think the timing and the criteria of the programme for economic and monetary union. The difficulty is that the recent perverse effects of the franc fort policy, notably the aggravation of the recession and the increase in unemployment, have seriously undermined French popular support for Maastricht, leading last March to a catastrophic defeat for the Socialist government. It might be constructive to re-negotiate a more plausible programme for Emu; but by now there may no longer be enough popular support in France for such an objective, to enable it to be ratified.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UPS AND DOWNS OF THE EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 13th Mar 1979                 Start of EMS 4th Oct 1981                  FFr devalued 8.5% against DM 14th June 1982                FFr devalued 10% against DM 21st Mar 1983                 FFr devalued 8% against DM 7th Apr 1986                  FFr devalued 6% against DM 19th June 1989                Peseta joins ERM 8th Jan 1990                  Lira moves to narrow band 8th Oct 1990                  Sterling joins ERM 14th Sept 1992                Lira devalued 7% 16th Sept 1992                Lira and Sterling leave ERM 23th Nov 1992                 Peseta and Escudo devalued 6% 1st Feb 1993                  Irish punt devalued 10% 14th May 1993                 Pta devalued 8% and Esc devalued 6.5%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Datastream  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

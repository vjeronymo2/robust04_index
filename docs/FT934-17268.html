			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Price reductions help Benetton gain 6.3% BENETTON, Italy's biggest producer of casual clothing, saw a 6.3 per cent rise in net first-half profits to L98.6bn (Dollars 62.4m), in spite of the slowdown in many leading clothing markets. Sales climbed by 10.4 per cent to L1,362bn. Benetton's turnover was lifted partly by the lower value of the lira, which inflated non-Italian sales. But the company has also benefited from cutting its prices in many markets. Sales growth was particularly strong outside Europe, with a 35 per cent leap in turnover. Sales in North and South America and Japan rose by 20 per cent, compared with an 8 per cent rise in Europe. The company has appointed Mr Carl Hahn, the former managing director of Volkswagen, to the board. Benetton said the choice 'expressed the company's desire to find ever greater synergies with leading representatives of the culture of international industry'. Benetton attributed its profits rise to its policy of price cuts and improved quality control. The group said the effects of the pricing policy, started earlier this year, would show through fully in 1994. The impact on its 012 line of children's clothing had been particularly marked, with a 20 per cent improvement in the volume of orders for the spring-summer 1994 collection, due in the shops early next year. Gross operating profits rose by 20.2 per cent to L553.2bn from L460.3bn, helped by lower operating costs. The decision to buy control of some local suppliers contained operating costs but helped to push up net indebtedness to L536bn from L326bn last December. Debt charges rose by L6.5bn to L23.3bn, compared with L16.7bn in June 1992.</p>

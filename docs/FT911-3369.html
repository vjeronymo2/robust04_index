			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): TV schedules publishing wars The fiercest marketing battle for 30 years has broken out in the once sedate world of publishing television programme schedules. This has been generated by the British government's decision to end the duopoly of programme listings held by TV Times and the BBC's Radio Times. The market, at least in theory, is now open to any publisher willing to pay for the information under licence. As a result, the established titles and the new entrants are jockeying for position and market share; as much as Pounds 20m has been spent on advertising and promotion. There has even been the first casualty - one of the new entrants, TV Plus, collapsed after only three issues. Some potential players didn't even make it to the starting line; the Daily Telegraph closed its television magazine 7 Days before deregulation and Rupert Murdoch's candidate, the British version of the US TV Guide veered off to concentrate on satellite TV programmes. 'This market is not for the faint-hearted,' says John Matthews, managing director of Independent Television Publications - with more than a touch of understatement. ITP is the publisher of TV Times and a cheaper entrant to the market, What's On TV. Until March 1 viewers who wanted advanced listings had to pay 50p each for TV Times and the Radio Times. Just over 3m households regularly bought a programme journal; about 88 per cent of them bought both. This amounted to only 15 per cent of households with a television compared with 80 per cent in the Netherlands, 30 per cent in France and 28 per cent in Italy. In the UK now there are four paid-for magazines giving all the programmes including those on satellite; at least two more are under consideration. Britain's two leading popular newspapers, The Sun and the Daily Mirror, now include special listings supplements in Saturday's editions which cover the whole week's programmes. But this has potentially tricky consequences; circulation on Saturdays has increased but sales for the rest of the week have gone down. Robert Maxwell, the publisher of Mirror Group Newspapers, says that he will review the situation in two months. Time Out magazine has seen a significant increase in circulation since it has been carrying full TV listings. The full week's listings are also available in the popular celebrity magazine, Hello. But the publication to have made the most significant entry to the scene comes from the German publisher, H Bauer. Having scored two successes in the UK women's weekly market with Bella and Take A Break, and planned its move for nearly two years, Bauer then sat out the first four weeks of the liberalised market before launching TV Quick with all guns blazing. 'We really wanted to be sure that the product was absolutely right before we launched,' says Alan Urry, managing director of Bauer in the UK, who explains that the company had wanted to allow a little of the dust to settle. Some of that dust settled on TV Plus which, after an estimated initial sale of 500,000, sank to 220,000 and closed; Hamfield Publications, the company behind it, went into receivership before TV Quick even appeared. Bauer aimed TV Quick unashamedly at the mass market with a cut-throat cover price of 10p for its first four weeks and backed it with a saturation television advertising campaign. The strategy behind the pricing policy was to get as many people as possible to sample the magazine; it seems to have achieved its objective. Between 1.85m and 1.9m were sold of the first two issues, giving TV Quick an early lead over both TV Times and Radio Times. According to Urry, between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m was spent on the launch. For its first four weeks, Bauer gave the 10p straight to the newsagents, paid the wholesalers a distribution fee and shouldered the entire production costs without revenue. The true test of its circulation will come when TV Quick charges an economic price that Urry says will be between 35p and 45p. Over at ITP, Matthews has also placed considerable emphasis on price-cutting as a device to draw attention to the fact that TV Times now has news of all TV programmes. For the first three weeks of the new competitive era TV Times halved its cover price to 25p. Radio Times was forced to respond - but John Thomas, managing director of BBC Publications did not cut the magazine's cover price - although the effect for the consumer was similar. The BBC seized on the fact that the second week after deregulation coincided with Comic Relief, when comedians and the public raise money for charity. The Corporation announced that during the last two weeks of the special offer at TV Times the BBC would donate half its 50p cover price to Comic Relief. 'We were absolutely appalled that TV Times cut its price - thus devaluing a very well established brand in the marketplace,' Thomas argues. But TV Times's Matthews says the price reduction was both planned and necessary and was a strategy that worked. The second string to ITP's bow grew out of research which showed that while many consumers wanted detailed programme information, others wanted their listings in a more concentrated form. To meet this latter market and to try to extend the company's market share, What's On TV, complete with a free TV planner board with the first issue, was launched. What's on TV began at a discount price of 25p and had a single week at 35p before having to match TV Quick's 10p cover price. After a total ITP promotional spend of Pounds 10m by week six What's on TV had a circulation of around 600,000 and TV Times claims its circulation was 1.7m, down from 3.1m before deregulation. Falls in circulation of both TV Times and Radio Times were expected as double buying of the titles fell away; the BBC says Radio Times sales fell from 2.16m to 1.72m. The Corporation's promotional costs were about Pounds 5m including more than Pounds 1m spent on commercial television. It also had considerable support on BBC television channels. Thomas believes deregulation is leading to a polarisation of the market. The BBC claims that more than 50 per cent of Radio Times readers are ABCIs, the professional and managerial classes, compared with a TV Times figure in the mid-30s. 'We think the UK public is realising what this is all about; there is now an opportunity to increase the market not through pyrotechnics but through careful promotion to distinct segments,' says Thomas. He has researched a new listings title which could be launched later this year, but refuses to say at which sector of the market it would be aimed. ITP, too, has plans for a third title - a glossy upmarket magazine - but no decision has yet been taken on whether to bring them to fruition. Thomas says he would be amazed if another mainstream British publisher were to enter the market now 'with the blood still drying on the wall', although further interest from non-UK publishers could not be ruled out. In two or three years' time when the market has settled down, Matthews forecasts there will be five paid-for listings magazines in the UK with total sales of more than 6m, 1m more than at present - a far cry from the last time all Britain's broadcasting listings were available in a single magazine: the Radio Times of the 1950s sold more than 10m copies a week.</p>

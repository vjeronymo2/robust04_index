			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / World Trade News: Venezuela and Chile in accord CHILE and Venezuela are due to sign today a free trade agreement which is expected to help Chile close a trade deficit with its third largest partner in Latin America. Mr Jorge Marshall, Chilean trade and industry minister, said the agreement, due to take effect on July 1, would let Chile double exports to Venezuela within the next two years. Exports in 1992 totalled Dollars 75m, against imports of about Dollars 120m from Venezuela. A similar agreement with Mexico in 1991 triggered an 80 per cent increase of Chilean trade with that country last year, to about Dollars 80m. Chile's strategy has been to pursue bilateral trade pacts with like-minded countries. Colombia and Bolivia are next on the list. Under the accord with Venezuela, import tariffs will be eliminated on 90 per cent of goods by January 1997. Venezuelan-made vehicles, however, will enjoy a zero import tariff from the start of the agreement. A small group of 'sensitive goods' - including petrochemicals, tobacco, wood, sugar and dairy products - has been excluded from the free trade agreement.</p>

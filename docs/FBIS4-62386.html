			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Lunch Hour Break" program] </F>   [Text] As you know a catastrophe occurred at Novonezhino on  14 May, exactly two years after the explosions at the Vtoraya  Rechka fleet arsenal in Vladivostok. According to witnesses the  power of the explosion the day before yesterday was equivalent  to the explosion of a nuclear bomb and it was a terrible scene.  The area looks like a war zone. This was confirmed by Yevgeniy  Nazdratenko, the kray governor, who went on the air over our  television and radio company yesterday. He noted the  coordination and operational efficiency of the militia, fleet,  and administration throughout the kray, the medical services and  everyone who was called up during the emergency.    Disasters unite people and in such a critical situation  people show their best qualities. According to reports, the  fire in Novonezhino was localized on Sunday [15 May] and people  have returned to their homes. But how much effort and money  will now be needed to restore normal life and eliminate the  consequences of the disaster? The cause of the catastrophe is  not yet known but an investigation is underway and the  commission will report on its findings.</p>

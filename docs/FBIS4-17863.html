			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By CRIME-PRESS correspondent Andrey Kulikov for TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 26 Apr -- Today at a news conference at the  Center for Public Relations of the Russian Ministry of Internal  Affairs, those who returned from Zagreb on 25 April spoke about  the work of the Russian police mission in Yugoslavia.    The news conference noted that the first group of Russian  police observers, numbering 14 people, was sent to Yugoslavia in  April 1992 at the request of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali.  Russian militiamen were working as part of the UN police  forces, who perform peacekeeping functions. The tasks of these  forces include monitoring the observance of human rights by the  local police and the distribution of humanitarian aid. The  staff of the police forces also undertook the organization of  exchanges of POWs.    The second group of militiamen went to Yugoslavia a year  ago.  Anatoliy Tsoglo, the commander of the Russian police contingent,  informed a CRIME-PRESS correspondent that our militiamen were  serving in all sectors of the UN police mission, including those  in areas with an extremely exacerbated military situation, such  as Sarajevo and Tuzla. According to Colonel (militia) Boris  Rakitin, deputy commander of the contingent, the group of  observers working in the area of Sarajevo airport, where there  was practically no local police, had the hardest time. The  Russian contingent was involved in the evacuation of sick and  wounded from the area of Sarajevo.    According to Anatoliy Tsoglo, Russian militiamen enjoy high  prestige both among the local population and among their  colleagues from other countries. Twenty-six people from the  staff of the mission (altogether it has 41 people) are occupying  leading posts in the structure of the UN police forces.    The next group of Russian police observers is now getting  ready to be dispatched to Yugoslavia.</p>

Section 408 authorizes the Agency to establish tolerance levels and exemptions from the requirements for tolerances for raw agricultural commodities. Section 408(o) requires that the Agency collect fees as will, in the aggregate, be sufficient to cover the costs of processing petitions for pesticide products, i.e., that the tolerance process be as self-supporting as possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current fee schedule for tolerance petitions (40 CFR 180.33) was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 24, 1993 (58 FR 16094) and became effective on April 23, 1993. At that time the fees were increased 3.7 percent in accordance with a provision in the regulation that provides for automatic annual adjustments to the fees based on annual percentage changes in Federal salaries. The specific language in the regulation is contained in paragraph (o) of 180.33 and reads in part as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 06 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (o) This fee schedule will be changed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annually by the same percentage as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent change in the Federal General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Schedule (GS) pay scale***. When automatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments are made based on the GS pay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scale, the new fee schedule will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule to become effective thirty days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or more after publication, as specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 06 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 06 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA) initiated locality-based comparability pay, known as ``locality pay.'' The intent of the legislation is to make Federal pay more responsive to local labor market conditions by adjusting General Schedule salaries on the basis of a comparison with non-Federal rates on a geographic, locality basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The processing and review of tolerance petitions is conducted by EPA employees working in the Washington, DC/Baltimore, MD pay area. The pay raise in 1994 for Federal General Schedule employees working in the Washington, DC/Baltimore, MD metropolitan pay area is 4.23 percent; therefore, the tolerance petition fees are being increased 4.23 percent. The entire fee schedule, 180.33, is presented for the reader's convenience. (All fees have been rounded to the nearest $25.00.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedures, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 23, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 06 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Daniel M.

Such fee is not required when, in connection with the change sought under this paragraph, a petition or request is filed for the establishment of new tolerances to take the place of those sought to be repealed and a fee is paid as required by paragraph (a) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) If a petition or a request is not accepted for processing because it is technically incomplete, the fee, less $1,450 for handling and initial review, shall be returned. If a petition is withdrawn by the petitioner after initial processing, but before significant Agency scientific review has begun, the fee, less $1,450 for handling and initial review, shall be returned. If an unacceptable or withdrawn petition is resubmitted, it shall be accompanied by the fee that would be required if it were being submitted for the first time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Each petition or request for a crop group tolerance, regardless of the number of raw agricultural commodities involved, shall be accompanied by a fee equal to the fee required by the analogous category for a single tolerance that is not a crop group tolerance, i.e., paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, without a charge for each commodity where that would otherwise apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Objections under section 408(d)(5) of the Act shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $2,925.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j)(1) In the event of a referral of a petition or proposal under this section to an advisory committee, the costs shall be borne by the person who requests the referral of the data to the advisory committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Costs of the advisory committee shall include compensation for experts as provided in  180.11(c) and the expenses of the secretariat, including the costs of duplicating petitions and other related material referred to the committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An advance deposit shall be made in the amount of $29,225 to cover the costs of the advisory committee.

A request for waiver or refund of a fee shall be submitted in writing to the Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Pesticide Programs, Registration Division (7505C), Washington, DC 20460. A fee of $1,450 shall accompany every request for a waiver or refund, except that the fee under this sentence shall not be imposed on any person who has no financial interest in any action requested by such person under paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section.

Box 360277M, Pittsburgh, PA 15251. The payments should be specifically labeled ``Tolerance Petition Fees'' and should be accompanied only by a copy of the letter or petition requesting the tolerance. The actual letter or petition, along with supporting data, shall be forwarded within 30 days of payment to the Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Pesticide Programs, Registration Division, (7504C) Washington, DC 20460. A petition will not be accepted for processing until the required fees have been submitted. A petition for which a waiver of fees has been requested will not be accepted for processing until the fee has been waived or, if the waiver has been denied, the proper fee is submitted after notice of denial. A request for waiver or refund will not be accepted after scientific review has begun on a petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (o) This fee schedule will be changed annually by the same percentage as the percent change in the Federal General Schedule (GS) pay scale. In addition, processing costs and fees will periodically be reviewed and changes will be made to the schedule as necessary. When automatic adjustments are made based on the GS pay scale, the new fee schedule will be published in the Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as a Final Rule to become effective 30 days or more after publication, as specified in the rule. When changes are made based on periodic reviews, the changes will be subject to public comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;13431 Filed 6&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

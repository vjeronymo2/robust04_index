			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The situation remains exceedingly tense on Karabakh  fronts. The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] Defense Army press  service reported that after a brief lull in fighting at night,  the Azerbaijani troops resumed their attacks today in the  direction of Gadrut, Agdam, and Askeran under the cover of  fierce artillery shelling of Karabakh's defensive positions.  Having massed large forces on the front, the enemy is trying at  all costs to breach Karabakh's positions in these sectors.    NKR Defense Army subunits are succeeding in halting the  numerically superior Azerbaijani troops. Nevertheless, the  Azerbaijanis moved forward in the southern sector on the evening  of 5 January.    The battles are also continuing with alternating success in  the north, near Matagis in Mardakertskiy Rayon, where in recent  days the Karabakh forces have managed to push back the enemy to  its initial positions.    The battles were still continuing on all the aforementioned  sectors at 1100 today. Both sides are suffering losses.    Information gathered from radio interception indicate that  during the attacks the Azerbaijanis used assault detachments of  foreign mercenaries, most of them from the CIS countries.</p>

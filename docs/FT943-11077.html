			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Spanish banker fined Spain has imposed a Pta15m (Pounds 76,000) fine on a former Bank of Spain director for insider trading. The economy ministry said in a statement yesterday that it had ratified a recommendation by the National Securities Market Commission, fining Mr Tomas Ramon Fernandez Rodriguez for insider trading in Banco Espanol de Credito-Banesto shares. Mr Fernandez ordered the sale of 2,388 Banesto shares on December 23 1993, the same day the Bank of Spain's executive committee met in his presence to analyse emergency measures to be taken at Banesto, whose board the central bank ousted on December 28. The shares were actually sold on December 27, which the ministry said saved him Pta3.06m. The next day Banesto's shares were suspended when they were quoting at 1,995. They resumed trade at the end of January at 855.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Observer: Euro-muddle David Williamson, secretary general of the European Commission, is not accustomed to being shown the door. But that was exactly what happened when he tried to claim his bed at the Luxembourg Pullman last Monday. Amid scenes of chaos rare in the somnolent Grand Duchy, managers hastily dispatched EC dignitaries, assembling for this week's meetings of foreign and finance ministers, far and wide. Protestations that a computer breakdown had erased reservations did nothing to soothe the ire of the likes of Dutch foreign minister Piet Dankert, who only belatedly secured a room. A trio of senior Foreign Office diplomats travelling with Douglas Hurd were deported by taxi shortly after midnight to the Hotel Senator, plum in the middle of Luxembourg's red-light district. Outside the hotel, Williamson was to be heard muttering darkly that the Commission intended to withdraw all future bookings from the Pullman group. No mean threat, given the size of the Commission's travel budget.</p>

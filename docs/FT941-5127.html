			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Guinness Peat holds near 10% stake in Premier Investments Sir Ron Brierley's Guinness Peat Group has emerged as the holder of a near-10 per cent stake in Premier Investments, a small quoted Australian investment and wholesaling company previously headed by Mr Solomon Lew. Mr Lew, who announced yesterday that he was stepping down as a director of Premier, is better known as the chairman of Coles Myers, one of Australia's largest retailers. Last year, Premier was the focus of much controversy - and an Australian Securities Commission inquiry - over a deal in 1989 which involved Premier in buying a block of 9.22m Coles Myers' shares. Originally, a private Lew family company called Etiket had undertaken to buy these shares for ADollars 8.12 (Pounds 4) each. But Premier offered to purchase the same block for ADollars 9 each, allowing Etiket to pocket the balance of 88 cents a share in return for cancelling the ear lier purchase agreement. The ADollars 9 paid by Premier matched the price it paid for a block of institutionally-held shares in Coles Myers at the same time. However, the market price for Coles Myers' shares when the deal closed was ADollars 8.62. Certain disclosure requirements were also breached. Yesterday, Premier said that it had offered UK-based Guinness Peat a seat on the board, and that its new shareholder had nominated Mr Gary Weiss as its representative.</p>

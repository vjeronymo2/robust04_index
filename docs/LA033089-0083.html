			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIL OFFICIAL SAYS GLENDALE STILL IN RUNNING FOR COMMUTER LINE  </P> <P> Despite a low priority rating, Glendale officials this week were told that they  still are in competition for funding for a commuter rail system.  </P> <P> Glendale leaders have long complained that the city was unfairly slighted in  1983 when the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission assigned a high  priority to construction of a commuter rail line to Pasadena, rather than  Glendale.  </P> <P> But Richard Stanger, the commission's director of rail development, told  Glendale City Council members during a city transportation study session  Tuesday that the low rating is no longer significant. "High priority, low  priority is less and less clear," said Stanger, who urged the city to continue  to work for early development of a rail system.  </P> <P> Pasadena was one of three destinations targeted for initial construction of a  proposed 150-mile rail system in the Los Angeles Basin. Early priority also was  given to proposed routes in the San Fernando Valley and along the new Century  Freeway to Los Angeles International Airport and Marina del Rey.  </P> <P> The Transportation Commission is expected within a year to select which of the  routes will receive funding from the Proposition A half-cent gas sales tax  authorized by voters in 1980. It is estimated that about $800 million will be  available for construction projects through the year 2000 -- not enough to fund  all three proposals.  </P> <P> Stanger encouraged Glendale officials to join forces with Pasadena and Highland  Park in lobbying for construction of the northeast route out of Los Angeles. He  said the key to construction of a route to any of the northeast communities  depends upon getting funding for a transit line from the Metro Rail station at  7th and Flower streets downtown to Chinatown.  </P> <P> "It is important for Glendale, Pasadena and Highland Park that that segment be  built," Stanger said. Once the link to downtown is decided, he said the  communities could then fight it out to determine which one will receive the  first commuter rail service.  </P> <P> Commission officials in 1983 said Glendale had little chance of getting a  light-rail system in less than 20 years because of the city's low priority  rating. Glendale officials have attributed the rating to the city's laxity in  lobbying for commission support.  </P> <P> Pasadena, on the other hand, has been vociferous in its support of a light-rail  system. Glendale City Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg this week described  Pasadena's campaign as "extra lobbying behind the scenes." She said Glendale  was "out in left field" when priorities were assigned by the commission.  </P> <P> Pasadena is participating in a joint study with the Transportation Commission  on potential light-rail routes within Pasadena connecting to the proposed  commuter line to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Following Pasadena's example, Glendale last year voted to split the $200,000  cost with the commission for a similar study in Glendale, even though no route  is being considered to link the city with a proposed rail line. City officials  said the study, expected to be completed within nine months, would allow the  city to act quickly should funds become available for a transit corridor to  Glendale.  </P> <P> It was during a study session with the city's light-rail transit consultants  Tuesday that the county commission official offered the city hope. "What we are  doing in Pasadena is very much to your advantage," Stanger said. "Stay up on  what we are doing and work with Pasadena. Together you represent substantial  interest."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Li Renzhu </F> (2621 0088 0031) and XINHUA reporter Yu Changhong (0060 7022  3163)]    [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- To usher in  International Labor Day that falls on 1 May, the Propaganda  Department held a get-together meeting in Beijing today. About  200 experts and scholars from social sciences, literature and  art, as well as press and publication circles were invited to  attend to strengthen contacts and enhance friendship in a happy  atmosphere.    Zheng Bijian, executive deputy head of the Propaganda  Department, spoke at the meeting. On behalf of Comrade Ding  Guangen, he extended cordial holiday greetings to comrades in  the social sciences, literature and art, and press and  publication fields across the country. He also expressed his  sincere thanks for their important contributions to and hard  work in promoting socialist spiritual civilization and socialist  modernization. Zheng Bijian said: It is very important to  energetically strengthen the ties with social sciences,  literature and art, and press and publication circles because we  all shoulder a common historical responsibility, that is, to  carry out the following four tasks forwarded by Comrade Jiang  Zemin: "to arm the people with scientific theory, to guide the  people with correct public opinion, to mold the people with  noble spirit, and to encourage the people with fine works." We  should stress the importance of spiritual civilization  construction. In the light of the new historical stage our  country has entered in our drive of reform, opening up, and  socialist modernization and in consideration of the  unprecedentedly severe competition of the overall national  strength in the world including spiritual and cultural strength,  such contacts, communication, and friendship become even more  important. "The most important thing for cultivating friendship  lies in understanding other's feeling." The Propaganda  Department will try to "make friends with more people by winning  their hearts." It will try its best to help them solve  difficulties and problems existing in their work and daily life.    Liu Zhongde, deputy head of the Propaganda Department and  minister of culture, also spoke at the meeting. He said: We  are living a great historical period. Propaganda and cultural  workers should perform their duties commensurate with the great  epoch. We should spare no efforts to achieve this goal.    Zhai Taifeng, deputy head of the Propaganda Department,  presided over the meeting during which representatives from  social sciences, literature and art, and press and publication  circles expressed their opinions. Also attending were  responsible comrades from the Organization Department, the  United Front Work Department, the Personnel Ministry, the  People's Liberation Army General Political Department, and other  units.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 07, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister  Mart Laar in an interview with BNS expressed his disappointment  with the decisions adopted by last week's congress meeting of  the country's farm sector representatives.    He said it had seemed that many of the activists there had  gathered only to gain political capital for themselves rather  than discuss the topical problems facing the farm sector.    The prime minister in his address had reassured the farmers  of the government's commitment to speeding up the reform in  agriculture. But he said the government's efforts had met with  little understanding and that many questions posed by him at the  meeting had been left without answer.    Laar said a wish to limit the congress to complaining and  letting one's emotions show had been greatly in evidence among  speakers. "Many speakers found that farmers need no World Bank  credits, and doubted in the necessity of a free trade treaty  with the European Union. But both of these are badly necessary  to the farmers," he said.    "If during the discussion on the property reform one speaks  of the need to introduce direct election of the president and,  with respect to protecting the domestic market, the prime  minister is scolded for traveling around in the country, the  future of the rural sector apparently seems dark," Laar said.    "Looking at the luxury cars that had gathered around the  Vanemuine theatre (where the congress took place) in Tartu, one  could at least state that the representatives of the rural  people are not having a bad life," he added.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  articles and an editorial published in Seoul vernacular dailies  on 3 May on the recent North Korean attempt to replace the 1953  Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty and its declaration to  withdraw from the Military Armistice Commission, MAC, and that  it will expel the Polish delegate to the Neutral Nations  Supervisory Commission.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 1 a 1,000-word  article by Kim Chang-ki entitled: "North Korea Unilaterally  Withdraws from the MAC -- Strategy Aimed at U.S.-North Korean  Peace Agreement." The article writes: "North Korea's attitude  is analyzed to be a scheme to turn the MAC, stipulated in the  Armistice Agreement, into a mere scrap of paper and virtually  destroy it, as noted by the government officials concerned."  The article continues: "The North Korean side, however, said  that it will abide by the existing Armistice Agreement until the  replacement agreement is signed and that it will continue to  maintain the hotline between military authorities, such as joint  duty officers, of the two sides presently in operation in  Panmunjom." The article cites remarks by a relevant government  official: "The North Korean attempt to incapacitate the MAC  must be its strategic move to reinforce its demand for replacing  the Armistice Agreement with a U.S.-North Korean peace agreement  and to discuss this issue in a full-fledged manner at the third  round of North Korean-U.S. talks."    The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,700-word  article by Pak Tu-sik entitled: "The Scheme Behind North  Korea's Declaration on Withdrawal From MAC." The article notes:  "The North Korean strategy is to force the U.S. Forces out of  the ROK through a peace agreement with the United States,"  adding: "In order to maximize its force of negotiation, North  Korea is attempting to virtually scrap the MAC, the implementing  organization of the Armistice Agreement, while conducting 'small  provocations' near the Military Demarcation Line, MDL, annoying  the ROK and the United States. This is interpreted to be the  North Korean strategic move to create a situation in which the  North Korean-U.S. peace agreement has to be discussed at the  third round of U.S.-North Korean talks."    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 5 a  1,200-word article by Pak Chae-pom entitled: "The Background of  North Korea's Notification of Its Unilateral Withdrawal from the  MAC -- Scheming To Deal Directly With the United States by  Scrapping the Armistice Agreement." The article notes recent  reports on North Korean moves, including provocative military  actions near the MDL, and cites a Defense Ministry official's  remark: "If the Armistice Agreement is suspended according to  the North Korean demand, the situation on the Korean peninsula  will be ambiguous -- neither peace nor armistice. North Korea  has called for the replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a  peace agreement, and is sure to call upon the United States for  direct negotiations. The North Korean moves are a calculated  action aimed at eliminating the ROK from the discussion of  issues on the Korean peninsula."    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled: "Why Is North Korea Shaking Up the  Armistice System?" The editorial begins: "North Korea, being  cornered by the nuclear issue, is making a dangerous gamble to  get out of a crisis," and notes: "North Korea is making these  provocative moves to heighten the feeling of danger of military  conflict and psychological anxiety on the Korean peninsula to  disperse the international concern on the nuclear inspection  issue and to maximize the utility of the nuclear card." The  editorial continues: "Announcing its unilateral withdrawal from  the MAC, North Korea stated that it will abide by the present  Armistice Agreement until a new peace system, which it demands,  is established and that the military hotline will continue. In  view of the North Korean attempt to scrap the armistice system,  we cannot believe this statement. North Korea's unilateral  decision itself is a grave violation of the Armistice Agreement,  and this is the first of its attempts to destroy the armistice  system. If this attempt by North Korea is tolerated, it will  commit other acts that violate the Armistice Agreement, creating  a crisis." The editorial concludes: "North Korea is an  unpredictable opponent, therefore, if the MAC, which maintains  the armistice system and manages crises, is incapacitated, it  could bring about the danger of an armed conflict. The  government should not simply concentrate on assuring the people  of the lack of signs of North Korean provocation, but see the  seriousness of the problem and establish a posture of  preparedness to cope with the ensuing developments."</p>

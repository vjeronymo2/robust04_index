			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Russia and Ukraine to ratify arms pacts RUSSIA and Ukraine have said they will both ratify the Start nuclear weapons reduction treaty and the treaty on reducing conventional forces in Europe as part of their agreement to divide the Black Sea Fleet between them. These treaties were not ratified by the Union Supreme Soviet before its demise last year. The agreement to ratify them by both the Russian and Ukrainian legislatures is an indication that Ukraine has established a form of joint control over the nuclear weapons on its territories, and can act as a guarantor of international treaties concerning them. However, actual ratification and full agreement between the two states on defence issues may be some way off - the agreement reached in Kiev at the weekend refers ultimate agreement to further talks and work by experts. An aide to Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, said 'it would be wrong to say that there has been any conclusive resolution to this issue'. Mr Andrei Kozhyrev, the Russian foreign minister, has hailed the agreement to divide the fleet and ratify the agreements as a 'step towards the formation of good neighbourly relations between the two countries and peoples'. Tensions between the Ukraine and Russia remain high, however, especially over economic reform. Ukraine's decision to switch a large part of workers' pay packets to coupons will mean an avalanche of unwanted roubles flooding into Russia, further pushing up prices which are already up to 30 times higher. A meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in Minsk on January 24 is advertised as focusing on both defence and economic issues. However, all three previous meetings - two in Minsk, one in Alma Ata - have seen the members grow further apart, rather than closer, on most fundamental questions. Most are now laying the foundations for separate armies, most are considering the introduction of a separate currency, and most - including Russia - now have trade barriers against each others' produce. Officials from the commonwealth will meet western bankers in Frankfurt today to discuss deferring interest payments on its foreign debt, sources close to the talks told Reuter in Frankfurt. The former Soviet republics are also likely to ask for an extension of an existing deferral of principal payments until the end of 1992, in line with an agreement reached in Paris with government creditors. The two-pronged request would dent banks' trust in the CIS but the banks would have no choice other than to accept. Commerzbank's spokesman, Mr Peter Pietsch, said: 'There's very little we could do against such a request.' The Russian central bank said on Friday it would seek to postpone interest payments on both government and bank debt because other commonwealth members had not produced their share of the cash. Mr Hilmar Kopper, head of Deutsche Bank, said a more comprehensive debt deferral arrangement than the one agreed in Paris might be needed in the second half of this year. He told the Handelsblatt newspaper he doubted whether the commonwealth states would be able to accumulate the currency needed for current interest payments and the deferred principal payments. Germany's economics minister, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, has invited counterparts from the Group of Seven nations and the CIS to a two-day meeting in Munster opening on May 8, Reuter reports from Bonn. An economics ministry spokesman said the meeting would focus on future western aid for the commonwealth and the rest of eastern Europe.</p>

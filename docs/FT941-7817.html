			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Arts: 'Wozzeck' in Chicago - Opera As the English National Opera did a few seasons ago, but over the span of a decade, the Lyric Opera of Chicago is offering a conspectus of 20th-century opera. There were grand plans for Wozzeck: a cast led by Franz Grundheber; Daniel Barenboim to conduct; and a production by Patrice Chereau, his first for any American opera company. But the production, which was seen in Paris last year, turned out to be too expensive for Chicago in its lighting demands, and so the Lyric Opera set about mounting its own instant version. Luckily Franz Grundheber survived from the original plans. His Wozzeck here is, as usual, grave and grey, sung out of a sort of somnolence, an embattled numbness of spirit, but always capable of sudden rises or falls into something sweetly melodious for a momentary phrase. Another survivor from the original project is Graham Clark, who as the Captain gives a brilliantly precise and vigorous performance, vocally creating the image of a man who appropriates command as a thin, bright shield for himself. But in other respects the casting is not so happy. Kathryn Harries as Marie is hampered by a vibrato that slackly pulls down the flying kite of her intensity, and Norman Bailey as the Doctor lacks focus. The staging, too, is a mixed success. Put on the spot, Chicago called upon a director with plentiful experience of this opera, going back to an Edinburgh Festival production in the late 1970s: David Alden. This version has his signatures (the bare light bulb, the blood-smeared surgical gown for the Doctor), some of his abiding faults (the lack of a feeling of outdoors, the diversion of musical developments - such as the crisis of the Wozzeck-Doctor scene  - to support groundless stage business), and some triumphant inventions, new and old. Many of the most effective innovations come from the use of a ramp on the stage up towards the audience, so that characters at the front seem enlarged  -often grotesquely enlarged  - against the perspective provided by furniture and people at the back of the set (designed by Charles Edwards). The strong use of shadow also works to create powerful dissonances of scale. However, some of the imagery is adventitious (an instance would be the slantwise view of modern Chicago occasionally exhibited in a corner) and the expressionist rhetoric is untrusting of the music. Unfortunately, the orchestral score is not defending itself under Richard Buckley's baton: much of the more discontinuous music is a tangle of inert blobs and streaks, and the performance all through is short-breathed. Perhaps, under the circumstances, this was the best that could be done. But the Lyric Opera needs more than decent retrievals to support its fair claim to being artistically as well as financially the healthiest of the big American companies.</p>

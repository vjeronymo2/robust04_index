			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Bundesbank hawk defends tough line ONE of the Bundesbank's leading anti-inflation hawks yesterday accused the government of failing to do enough to protect the D-Mark. He also confirmed that Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, had tried to head off last month's controversial increase in the German discount rate. 'Unfortunately, the Bundesbank currently bears an over-heavy responsibility for the stability of the D-Mark, since pay and finance policies deny it the necessary support,' Mr Lothar Muller, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making central council, said in a letter. The discount rate rise from 8 per cent to 8.75 per cent, imposed to bring money supply growth under control, was 'necessary, suitable and moderate', he added. Mr Muller, who is also president of the central bank of Bavaria, was replying to a sharp attack from Mr Erwin Huber, general secretary of the Christian Social Union. The CSU is a senior partner in the Bonn coalition. Led by Mr Theo Waigel, it sponsored Mr Muller's appointment to the Bundesbank council. Mr Huber claimed in a newspaper interview yesterday that Mr Muller had defied the finance minister over interest rates and abused his office with a recent call for a referendum on the Maastricht treaties on European Union. Mr Muller wrote to Mr Huber personally, saying he regretted going against Mr Waigel's wishes, but making plain that the Bundesbank council was politically independent and committed to maintaining the D-Mark's status and stability. The attack, which signalled a determined effort to make Mr Muller toe the party line, if not remove him, came at the end of a week of unusually harsh complaints about the Bundesbank's latest move. A study from the respected DIW economics institute in Berlin accused the central bank of pursuing a 'misguided' monetary policy. The latest rate rise, intended to rein in money supply, would in fact increase it, and aggravate recessionary tendencies in west Germany. The VDMA engineering industry association, reporting a 22 per cent fall in domestic orders for June, said the prolonged period of high interest rates was making matters worse. Bundesbank policy had reduced industry's room for manoeuvre, it added. Although Mr Waigel has not objected publicly to the Bundesbank's strictures, he and the rest of the cabinet are under heavy pressure from European Community partners concerned that high German rates are reducing their chances of early economic recovery.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: BULLPEN IS BAFFLED BY THROWIN' VOICE  </P> <P> Baseball players apparently never run out of ways to have fun at the expense of  their teammates. Yankee relief pitcher Dave Righetti told the New York Times:  </P> <P> "Our bullpen is right under the bleachers, and we hear a lot of stuff from  fans. In the last two years, Charlie Hudson would come out there and hide  behind a pillar, disguise his voice and act like a fan. He'd ride us, give us  the Bronx cheer, the whole works.  </P> <P> "Scott Nielsen went for a month thinking it was the real thing. I don't think  Neil Allen ever found out."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Who pitched the first no-hitter in Dodger Stadium?  </P> <P> Sweet dreams: Andre Rison, Indianapolis Colts receiver from Michigan State, on  his $890,000 signing bonus, half of which is deferred: "My money is sleeping. I  hope when it wakes up, there's more of it."  </P> <P> Slim-and-none Dept.: Indicating that Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor never  had a chance of signing Danny Ferry, Ailene Voisin of the Atlanta Journal  wrote:  </P> <P> "Former Clipper Coach Gene Shue, who was fired last Jan. 18, is Danny Ferry's  godfather and a close friend of the family. During his 20 months with the  organization, Shue tangled frequently with Baylor regarding personnel and  coaching matters."  </P> <P> Accursed one: Headline in the Seattle Times after Bert Blyleven of the Angels  had pitched a shutout against the Seattle Mariners in the Kingdome:  "Blankety-blank Blyleven."  </P> <P> Fickle fates: Writes Russ White of the Orlando Sentinel, indicating all has not  gone well for the 1969 Miracle Mets:  </P> <P> "Donn Clendenon, who gained a law degree after his playing career, pleaded  guilty to a charge of cocaine possession last year in Sioux Falls, S.D. Catcher  Jerry Grote served time in jail for cattle sale fraud. Left fielder Cleon Jones  received a suspended sentence for forging checks. Reliever Jack DiLauro joined  a California commune in 1970 and hasn't been heard from since."  </P> <P> White said 14 of the 25 players have been divorced, two of them twice.  </P> <P> Straight arrow: How straight is Mike Reid off the tee? Writes Gordon S. White  Jr. of the New York Times: "Usually, you do not ask Reid how many fairways he  missed. You ask him how many water sprinkler lines he missed."  </P> <P> 'Fessing up: As he goes into his fifth year as a CBS football analyst, Terry  Bradshaw told the Houston Chronicle, "I should've been canned right off the  bat, but I was given a chance. I've cut out all the silliness; there's only one  John Madden."  </P> <P> Heat treatment: Boston's Mike Boddicker, asked his secret after he had reeled  off five straight victories with a 0.78 earned-run average, said: "More  fastballs. You'd be surprised how many fastballs right down the middle hitters  miss."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Bo Belinsky of the Los Angeles Angels. On May 5, 1962, he did it  to Baltimore, 2-0.  </P> <P> Quotebook: George Brett of Kansas City, on the 17-5 loss to Cleveland while Bo  Jackson was sidelined: "I knew we were in trouble because our only player who  could score touchdowns was on the bench, and we didn't have time to kick four  field goals."  </P></p>

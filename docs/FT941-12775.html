			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Waste management should also mean producing less rubbish Sir, Two articles on waste management on one day ('Recycling has neighbours crying foul' and 'When waste is not wanted', January 25), but not the smallest mention of the crux of the problem: the need to produce less rubbish. The impact on other countries' waste disposal markets of Germany's efficiency at collection should at last induce Europe's legislators to force manufacturers to use less packaging - or at least more of the reusable kind. In Germany, most people cart crates of glass bottles full of mineral water, fruit juice, beer, etc, back and forth to the supermarket as a matter of course, but dairy products, for example, are rarely obtainable in anything but plastic - though milk is available in bottles here for the more conscientious. The mere thought of the millions of sordid plastic yoghurt pots alone discarded every day enrages me. Georgina Watkins-Spies, Schrotteringksweg 5, 22085 Hamburg, Germany</p>

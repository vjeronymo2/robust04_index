			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEW;  </P> <P> CONCERT DELIVERS DIVERSE SCORECARD OF LLOYD WEBBER  </P> <P> Andrew Lloyd Webber's music gives some people goose bumps and other people the  creeps. I liked his work through "Cats" and started to hate it with "Starlight  Express." A chance to hear his theater scores as a continuum couldn't be passed  up.  </P> <P> Another reason for attending "The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber in Concert"  Wednesday night at the Orange County Performing Arts Center was to see Sarah  Brightman. She is married to Lloyd Webber and played Christine in the original  "Phantom of the Opera."  </P> <P> Brightman's vocal range may be wider than her emotional range, but within her  limits she's a charming musical actress.  </P> <P> Brightman is not ready to play Evita. "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" was sung  with the proper drama, but we didn't get the creepy feeling that Evita had by  now become a figment of her own imagination.  </P> <P> But "Cats" was right up Brightman's alley.  </P> <P> "The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber in Concert" won't make converts to Lloyd  Webber's cause, but it will please the multitude.  </P> <P> A full review of "The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber in Concert" will appear in  Friday's Calendar section.  </P></p>

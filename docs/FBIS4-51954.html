			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Ridiculous and Imprudent Act" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  authorities decided to hold a meeting of the "Unification and  Security Policy Coordinating Council" on May 6 in order to  confirm their position that the replacement of the Armistice  Agreement with a peace agreement which the North proposed to the  United States must be discussed through direct North-South  dialogue after the complete settlement of the nuclear issue of  the North and notify the United States and the United Nations of  this position.    Papers here today brand this as a ridiculous and imprudent  act.    An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says:    The replacement of the Korean Armistice Agreement with a  peace agreement and establishment of a new peace arrangement are  questions that can be solved only between the DPRK and the  United States, the parties concerned for the Armistice  Agreement. The authorities of South Korea, not a signatory to  the Armistice Agreement, are not qualified or justified for  poking their nose in it.    It is the United States that holds all powers in South Korea  including the military prerogative. Therefore, the question of  the replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace  agreement cannot be solved through dialogue with the South  Korean authorities who are deprived of the military prerogative.    The South Korean puppets' opposition to DPRK-USA negotiation  for peace on the pretext of the "settlement of the nuclear issue  of the North" and their call for "direct North-South dialogue"  clearly show that they want neither the settlement of the  nuclear issue nor the establishment of new peace arrangement.    Their ulterior intention is to block the DPRK-USA  negotiation  for peace arrangement at any cost.    If the South Korean authorities want peace, they must not  obstruct the DPRK-USA negotiation for the establishment of a new  peace arrangement.    An analyst of MINJU CHOSON warns that if the South Korean  puppets continue to resort to despicable acts to prevent the  realisation of the just proposal of the North, they will  encounter bitterer criticism and rejection from the people at  home and abroad.</p>

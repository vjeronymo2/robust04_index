			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Jordanian-Palestinian Talks Are </F> Successful"]    [Text] The multilateral Jordanian-Palestinian talks  witnessed in Amman during the past three days have revived  coordination between the two sides. This is due to the fact  that these talks dealt with practical issues and outlined the  features of future relations between Jordan and the Palestinian  self-rule during the interim period.    It seems that the high level Jordanian-Palestinian talks  went  beyond headlines and into details. This is a wide practical  step toward reinforcing coordination between the two fraternal  peoples.    These talks and their results acquire their importance from  the fact that they coincided with the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations and came after the signing of the  Palestinian-Israeli security agreement.    We hope that these talks tackled vital political, economic,  trade, and security issues in a manner that forms the basis for  frank and clear future relations between Jordan and the  Palestinian self-rule.    Based on statements by Jordanian and Palestinian officials  taking part in the talks, it is clear that these talks were  crowned with success. This affirms that the two sides enjoy a  spirit of responsibility and believe in a joint future of  brotherly relations between the two fraternal people.    It is noteworthy that the emphasis placed on the need to  implement programs to enhance the Arab Islamic character of holy  Jerusalem is an important practical step and an accomplishment  that deserves to be appreciated    Moreover, agreement to continue serious coordination and  cooperation on the level of the peace process shows how aware  the two sides are of the need to reinforce the Palestinian  negotiating position.    In any case, the brotherly talks between Jordan and the  Palestinian delegation within the higher committee were  successful. If coordination and cooperation between the two  parties continues throughout the course of the peace process,  this will be useful to both parties and to national and pan-Arab  issues as well.</p>

			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Civil rights leaders in Atlanta commemorated the day their movement became law  by praying at the crypt of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and challenging President  Bush to live up to his stated commitment to their cause. "Mr. Bush has got to  get up and make the White House the right house," said the Rev. Joseph Lowery,  president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. "It's not enough to  talk that talk. We need him to walk that walk." The SCLC was marking the 25th  anniversary of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned  segregation in public facilities and has been used in court actions against  discrimination in the workplace. Lowery said recent Supreme Court decisions  against affirmative action programs have left black leaders doubting that the  President would work to protect progress made under the law.  </P></p>

			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Mind over matter as arrows fly - To a degree, top archers are split personalities I HAVE always pictured archery as a thrilling sport. If it was not men in Lincoln green shooting down stags in forest glades, it was bands of yeomen good and true splitting each other's arrows in merry village competition. But it is not that way, at least not in the Olympics. I had a very good seat in the stands last Friday at the men's individual 90 metres and 70m elimination event. Directly in front of me, their backs to the stands and their arrows pointing down-field at 25 brightly coloured targets, spread a long line of 75 archers. The competition began merrily enough with drumming from Spanish supporters in medieval robes. But when the arrows began to fly, it became very confusing indeed. To the naked eye the yellow inner ring of an archery target 90m (more than 295ft) distant is about the size of a pinhead. Even with my binoculars, I had difficulty seeing arrows strike anywhere. Viewed end-on, an arrow is a tiny thing - archers themselves use scopes to verify their shots. With groups of three competing archers firing simultaneously at a single target, it was impossible to tell whose arrow belonged to whom. My lasting impression is not visual at all, but aural: a great twanging of bowstrings as hundreds of arrows flew invisibly to their destinations. Archery is not a popular spectator sport. There is no fast and furious action, no build-up of tension, no climactic moments of victory or loss. Yet for those who practise it, it is the most competitive and demanding of sports. Deep down in every archer, under the cool nerves and air of contemplation, a tremendous battle of conflicting wills is taking place. The battle is one that assumes cerebral, near-spiritual proportions. All accomplished archers are, to some extent, split personalities. On one hand, after years of daily training, they possess an instinctive, automatic and sub-conscious mastery of their art. On the other hand, on the day of competition they are like lesser mortals: their conscious minds are worrying about the strength of the opposition, calculating the chances of success, or fretting over the heat, the humidity or the effects of last night's seafood paella. In other words they are nervous, and nerves are the archer's greatest enemy. The art of archery, then, is to still the conscious mind, block it out no matter how desperately it wants to help, and let the sub-conscious master inside take over. It is a subtle skill, and to achieve it many archers use a meditational technique - constant repetition of a word or phrase, meaningless in itself, that stops conscious thought processes interfering with the inner mind's control of the body. Britain's Steve Hallard, who has competed in world championships or Olympic Games every year since 1983 and qualified on Friday for further elimination rounds, repeats the three words 'smooth constant draw' incessantly to himself throughout his matches. 'Mentally you have got to be right,' he says. 'I shoot with my unconscious. Those who are consistent winners are the ones who get on a high mental plane.' Such techniques are far from gimmicks. These days it is being recognised that the psychological component in sport is all-important. Archery's mental techniques, however, originated long ago in the Far East, where technical development of the laminated bow dramatically changed the nature of warfare. The bow's power gave it almost magical status in battle, and a symbolic, ritual role in peace-time. For educated mandarins in China, archery became a form of meditation in itself: adepts would induce a ritual trance before practising their art, and found it so satisfying spiritually that they developed a school of Zen poetry extolling archery's virtues. In Japan, more than 50 separate schools of archery evolved. Some were quasi-religious in nature, others more exhibition-oriented: in 1870 president Ulysses S Grant witnessed the last public performance of inouimono, an event where mounted archers took turns shooting specially constructed whistling arrows at packs of released dogs. There were no dog-shooting events in Barcelona on Friday, but the predominant role of archery's mental discipline was evident. One indication was the physical make-up of the archers. They come in all sizes, from tall and thin to short and solid. Physical strength has little importance in archery. One might imagine that brawny arms make a good archer. In fact a straight arm, unencumbered by muscles, allows the bowstring to pass unhindered from the face to the bow; the arms are used as levers so that the pressure of drawing the bowstring is transferred to the shoulders and the back. If an archer develops muscles, he is doing something wrong. If the necessary mental balance is achieved, so is perfect physical balance, and that, in mechanical terms, is what archery is all about. The archer's skill lies in maintaining absolute equilibrium while at the same time accommodating two opposing forces - the push necessary to hold the bow away from him with one hand and the pull required to draw the bowstring towards him with the other. The slightest tremor or imbalance means an arrow out of true: a deviation of just  1/16 -of-an-inch will cause the archer to miss the target entirely. So consistent are good archers in their aim that just one or two arrows gone astray out of a round of 72 can mean the difference between winning and not placing. In Friday's competition, the winner, the Unfied Team's Vladimir Echeev, did not have an arrow in his first 66 shots out of the 4 1/2  inch-diameter bull's eye. But then Echeev has archery's age-old mental and physical discipline in his blood. He is a Tajik from the steppes of central Asia. His cheekbones are high and angular, his complexion oriental, his eyes long and narrow. With those looks he might be descended from Ghengis Khan himself.</p>

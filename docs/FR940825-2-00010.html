			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sandvik also asserts that, contrary to the Department's contention that the company failed to ``demonstrate that it incurred different indirect selling expenses on sales to different levels of trade in the German market,'' the company demonstrated, in significant detail, that discounts were granted exclusively to German distributors to compensate these distributors for their cost of holding a stock of Sandvik products. Sandvik claims that the fact that these distributor discounts were granted is undisputed in the case record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, contrary to the Department's traditional reliance on cost differences as the basis for the adjustment, Sandvik contends that other methods of valuing the adjustment may also be used since the Department's regulations do not expressly limit the grant of the adjustment to those instances in which cost differences are present. Rather, Sandvik argues that the regulation simply ``requires a level of trade adjustment whenever prices are not comparable.'' According to Sandvik, the distributor discount in this case is exactly the amount by which the sale price at the distributor level of trade varies from the price of an identical sale at the end-user level of trade. Sandvik concludes that the distributor discount is the best basis, if not the only basis, for valuing the level of trade adjustment. Accordingly, since the company has shown that ``the discount is uniformly provided in all German distributor sales'', the Department must make the level of trade adjustment whenever sales at different levels of trade are compared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Department's Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine whether a level of trade adjustment is warranted when sales to distributors are matched with sales to end-users, we compared the reported unit sale prices to distributors with reported unit prices to end-users for the same product, month of sale, and quantity bracket. Based upon our examination of these prices in both reviews, we found wide price fluctuations without any discernible pattern. Moreover, in some instances, we found that prices to distributors exceeded prices to end-users. Based upon these facts, Sandvik has not demonstrated that there are differences affecting price comparability relating solely to the fact that sales are made at different levels of trade. Thus, the Department maintains that there is insufficient justification to make a level of trade adjustment in those situations where distributor and end-user sales are compared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 2: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Sandvik contends that two separate and distinct exporters are under review in the first administrative review, and therefore, the Department should calculate separate rates for these companies. According to Sandvik, it sold to an unrelated Canadian distributor a small volume of hollow bar, most, if not all, of which has never been sold into the United States. Sandvik contends that the Department incorrectly assumes these sales have entered the United States since the dumping calculation is based on Sandvik's sales to the Canadian company, not on the Canadian company's subsequent sales into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, Sandvik maintains that the Department has an established practice of calculating a separate margin for each manufacturer/exporter investigated in an antidumping duty action provided the firms operate as separate and distinct entities. In discussing its position, Sandvik addresses  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Certain Granite Products from Italy <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (53 FR 27187, July 19, 1988), where the Department collapsed firms with common ownership and boards of directors and similar production facilities such that the firms would not have to retool in order to produce jointly;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Certain Granite Products from Spain <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (53 FR 24337, June 28, 1988), where the firms shared sales opportunities, manufacturing decisions, and were billed jointly; and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Certain Granite Products from Italy <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (53 FR 27189, June 28, 1988) where the firms acted in concert in the marketplace. Sandvik claims, in contrast to these cases, that it and the Canadian company are independently owned, possess no corporate or other close relationship, and never operated closely or in concert for the production or sales of hollow bar.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, citing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Plate and Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Sheet from Brazil <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (49 FR 3104, January 25, 1984), Sandvik contends that the only other situation in which the Department may consider calculating a single margin for two companies involves entities with cooperative sales operations or firms that do not separately negotiate prices with U.S. customers. Once again, Sandvik maintains that the facts in this case do not warrant such treatment. Sandvik argues that it maintained separate sales operations at all times. Moreover, Sandvik asserts that in those instances in which the Canadian company made sales to the United States, it directly competed with Sandvik. Sandvik further maintains that each firm separately negotiated prices with potential U.S. customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a final point, Sandvik contends that the Department has consistently published separate rates for sales made through unrelated third-country trading companies or resellers. According to Sandvik, that practice should apply in this case as the Canadian company is an unrelated third-country reseller.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Department's Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We normally treat sales by a respondent to an unrelated purchaser as sales to the United States where the seller knows that the merchandise is being sold for export to the United States. This is true of sales to trading companies in the country of origin or those in third country locations. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sandvik AB v.

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pause in Maastricht debate MPs are to have at least a week off from debating the Maastricht bill - but the government denied that it was having to be slowed deliberately to fit in with Denmark's plans for its second referendum. As the Commons last night began the 11th committee day on the bill, ministers confirmed privately that the final vote by MPs before it goes to the House of Lords will not take place before the Danish poll, now fixed for May 18. Yet they insisted that the bill was proceeding through the Commons as planned and its timing had not been affected by the Danish announcement. 'We think that we are making reasonable progress on the Maastricht bill, in line with the sort of progress that we expected to make,' said one cabinet minister. In the Commons Mr Tony Newton, leader of the house, announced a programme of business for next week that excludes debate on the Maastricht bill. No decisions have been taken about when the committee stage will resume. Government managers argued that a backlog of business had built up which required debate and that it was always the intention to vary the pace of the bill's progress.</p>

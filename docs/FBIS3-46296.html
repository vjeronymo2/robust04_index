			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 25 (XINHUA) -- Zhou Guangzhao,  president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said today  that the CAS will change its systems of operation, personnel and  choice of subjects.    Speaking at the 1994 work conference of the Chinese Academy  of Sciences, he called on Chinese scientists to "take hold of  the opportunity to speed up development."    According to Zhou, the academy will not only develop into  one  of the most advanced research centers in China but also become  an important base for China's high-tech industry and for  training qualified scientists and technicians.    Zhou said the CAS will spare no efforts to promote the  application of research achievements in industrial production  this year.    In 1994, the CAS will focus its efforts on the research and  development in such energy development as the burning,  crystallization and conversion of coal and in the amelioration  of red soil in hilly areas in southern China, comprehensive  development and utilization of rare-earth resources and research  and application of information technology.    The CAS will put into service its Shanghai Life Sciences  Center and Beijing modern geoscience center this year and build  some other science centres in the near future.    Without fixed staff, these science centers will operate  under  the guidance of the most prominent scientists with high  attainments and with researchers, mostly with doctorate or  post-doctorate degrees, to be appointed for a fixed period.    The CAS will train more post-graduates and post-doctorates,  Zhou said.    It will also convert all its high-tech enterprises into  joint  stock companies.    Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent a letter of  congratulation  to the work conference, urging the CAS to make breakthroughs in  the frontier projects that will promote a new industrial  revolution by making most of its advantages.</p>

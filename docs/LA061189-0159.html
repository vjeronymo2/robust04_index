			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'FRIENDSHIP FLIGHT' ESCORT PLANE MAKES FORCED LANDING  </P> <P> A twin-engine airplane that was ferrying luggage and members of an entourage  for boy aviator Tony Aliengena was forced to make an emergency landing after  clouds of smoke spewed from the instrument panel.  </P> <P> The plane -- following 11-year-old Aliengena in his bid to become the youngest  pilot to fly around the world -- landed safely back at National Airport shortly  after takeoff. There were no injuries, although a few passengers were treated  for dizziness and minor smoke inhalation.  </P> <P> Aliengena, who experienced mechanical trouble in his own plane Saturday, was  unaware of the difficulties with the "chase" plane until he landed at Lawrence  Airport outside Boston on the sixth leg of his seven-week "Friendship Flight."  </P> <P> Smoke began spewing from the chase plane, one of two following Aliengena, when  it was about 1,000 feet above the Potomac River. Pilot Lance Allyn maneuvered  his King Air through restricted airspace above the capital's monuments and  government buildings.  </P> <P> The exact problem had not been diagnosed late Saturday, although mechanics  suspected a failed clutch gear.  </P> <P> Repairs on both the chase plane and on Aliengena's plane in Lawrence are  expected to be completed by Monday, enabling the boy and his entourage to  continue on their way to Canada after a delay of no more than a day in the  flight schedule.  </P></p>

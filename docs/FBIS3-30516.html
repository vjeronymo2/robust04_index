			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Slovak newspapers on 3 February publish  TA SR and correspondents' reports, ranging from 300 to 500  words, on statements made by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar at a  rally of Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] supporters in  Bratislava's Park of Culture and Repose on 2 February.    Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 3 February on page 13  carries a 500-word Bohumil Olach report entitled "Will There Be  a Referendum Against Knazko's Followers?" The report includes  the following passage: "In the first round of replies to  questions from the audience, the prime minister said that he  will not hold talks on collective rights for the Hungarian  minority because, in Cyprus, too, it once started with  collective rights and ultimately led to a war between Turkey and  Greece. He who feels bad here is absolutely free to leave, he  said, for which he earned great applause. He also touched on  the differences of views between the government and the  president on some issues. He said, for example, that it is not  good when the president and the government both push for their  own version of the law on names and surnames. The opposition  operates with the cliche that everything will be better without  Meciar, he continued. The president has called for the  formation of a multicolor government, but the Party of the  Democratic Left [SDL] is ready to talk [about joining the  government coalition] only when there will be early elections.  The Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] and the Alliance of  Democrats [AD] only want an agreement without Meciar. "And the  president said that they must be accommodated," the prime  minister added.    "The president was awarded with `Phooey!' and the chanting  of  `Shame!' from a group of enraged women in the left corner of the  audience in front of the stage. No one made an attempt to  silence them."    Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 3 February on page 3 carries  a  500-word Martin Krno report entitled "Our Mr. Meciar." The  PRAVDA correspondent observes that, in addition to the  "traditional" criticism of "the Hungarians, the Czechs, the  correspondents, the head of state, and the opposition," the  participants in the rally "heard also something new from the  prime minister's mouth. According to the prime minister, the  ruling movement is increasingly consolidated. If parliament  does not approve a law under which all `disobedient' deputies  must surrender their seats, a referendum will decide on this  issue. Three large electoral blocs are taking shape, the prime  minister said: 1. The SDL, Social Democrats, and farmers; 2. The  KDH, Conservative Democratic Party, and Knazko's followers; and  3. The HZDS, together with the anti-Cernak part of the Slovak  National Party, Klepac's Christian Social Union (frenetic  applause), and, possibly, the Greens. It goes without saying  that this last bloc will be victorious again."    Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 3 February on page 2  carries a 300-word TA SR report entitled "Vladimir Meciar:  Devaluation Is Not Being Prepared." According to the report,  Meciar told the meeting of 2,000 Bratislava residents that "no  devaluation is being prepared, fares will not go up, and the  government will do everything within its power to accelerate the  sale of [community-owned] apartments into citizens' private  ownership." He reportedly also "rejected speculations that the  government might tender its resignation and denied reports that  he is divorcing his wife."</p>

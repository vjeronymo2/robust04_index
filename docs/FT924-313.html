			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Roadworks rules REGULATIONS coming into force on January 1 will make roadworks less of a disruption, the government says. The rules provide for better control over the timing and co-ordination of street works to help ensure that utilities such as gas and water do not rip up the same piece of road in succession, and set standards for the reinstatement of surfaces.</p>

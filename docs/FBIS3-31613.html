			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network in Polish] </F>   [Text] [Announcer Monika Boniecka] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  the leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, has, after  all, decided to come to Poland on 12 March.    [Correspondent Witold Laskowski, in Moscow] An accused  former  activist in the radical Self-Defense Movement was meeting the  leader of Russian nationalists in freshly refurbished offices in  a prestigious building in the center of Moscow, which he  described as his Moscow bureau. In a small conference room  plates with halves of eggs with black caviar, sandwiches with a  less prestigious red caviar, fish, cold meats in aspic, and  fruit were already on the table.    This meeting today -- does it have any special aim? Are you  (?discussing] any concrete issues, or is it just a friendly,  social meeting?    [Janusz Bryczkowski, Front Narodowy-Samoobrona, identified  by  caption] A friendly meeting and we want to discuss, as it were,  the agenda of Mr. Zhirinovskiy's visit to Poland.    [Laskowski] Is there already a date?    [Bryczkowski] Oh, yes, there is: The congress of our party  is  on 12 March.    [Laskowski] And then Mr. Zhirinovskiy would be coming to  Poland?    [Bryczkowski] Yes, he announced that he would come with all  the entourage of the, as it were, Polish set of his deputies:  Mr. (?Zhebrovskiy), Mr. Vengerovskiy.    [Laskowski] Zhirinovskiy failed to come to Poland in January  because, as he claims, he had problems with means of transport  from Belgrade. Now, Janusz Bryczkowski promises him that he  will be meeting businessmen and representatives of otherwise  unspecified social organizations.    Zhirinovskiy considers his greatest successes since the  parliamentary elections to be the fact that several radical  reformers led by Gaydar have left the government. He is  temporarily tolerating Prime Minister Chernomyrdin treating him  as a lesser evil. He claims that his organization is growing  every day. He intends to win the 1996 presidential elections  when he is leader of the party with a membership of half a  million. Several days ago we almost witnessed a split in  Zhirinovskiy's parliamentary faction: One of his closest aides  could not agree to irresponsible statements issued by his boss  while on foreign trips. Everything is pointing to the fact that  Zhirinovskiy will weigh his words while in Poland: Otherwise  this visit could just be one of his last foreign trips.    Witold Laskowski speaking for the Wiadomosci [bulletin] from  Moscow.

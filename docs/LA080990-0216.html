			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TRIPLE PLAY IS RELIEF FOR MCDONALD  </P> <P> Ben McDonald is proving to be a good pitcher and a good-luck charm to boot for  the Baltimore Orioles.  </P> <P> Although he needed the help of three relief pitchers and a triple play,  McDonald was the winner in a 4-1 victory over the Athletics Wednesday at  Oakland.  </P> <P> The rookie became the first Baltimore pitcher to win his first four decisions.  </P> <P> McDonald, who pitched an inning Sunday at Kansas City before the game was  rained out, had a one-hit shutout and a 4-0 lead before giving up three  consecutive singles with one out in the sixth.  </P> <P> Manager Frank Robinson decided McDonald had enough. Mark Williamson bailed him  out of the jam, and when Williamson walked the first two batters in the  seventh, Jeff Ballard took over.  </P> <P> The first batter he faced, Willie Randolph, hit a hit-and-run line drive that  Ballard snared and turned into an easy triple play. Exactly 13 years ago, the  Athletics also hit into a triple play.  </P> <P> Ballard was also on the mound last June 15 when the Orioles made a triple play  that started with a line drive by New York's Steve Balboni.  </P> <P> "In that situation," Ballard said, "you're looking for a double-play ball. I  just put my glove up. Luck. It was luck. Go ahead and say it. But it took the  wind out of their sails."  </P> <P> Gregg Olson, who has never given up a run in August, went the final 1 2/3  innings for his 26th save. The second-year bullpen ace has pitched 14 2/3  innings in August.  </P> <P> "McDonald is not just a rookie, he's an exceptional rookie," Robinson said. "He  doesn't let all the hoopla, publicity get to him. He just goes out there and  gets people out. He doesn't try to necessarily strike out people, he just gets  them out."  </P> <P> Because of injuries to Randy Milligan and other regulars, the Orioles had a  makeshift lineup. They managed to get to Scott Sanderson (11-7) for all their  runs and seven hits in 4 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Bob Melvin broke out of a two-for-21 slump and drove in two runs with singles  in the fourth and fifth innings.  </P> <P> The Athletics remained three games ahead in the American League West.  </P> <P> Kansas City 5, Chicago 1 -- Carlton Fisk hit his 327th home run as a catcher to  tie Johnny Bench for the all-time high, but it was the only damage done to Tom  Gordon (7-8) at Kansas City.  </P> <P> Fisk hit a 1-and-2 pitch over the left-field fence in the seventh. Gordon, who  struck out eight, gave up only three other hits and no one but Fisk advanced as  far as second.  </P> <P> "I'm not your classic home run hitter," Fisk said. "I'm more of a line drive  hitter. I'm no Canseco."  </P> <P> Fisk was met at the plate by his son Casey, 18.  </P> <P> "I had goose bumps when he hugged his boy at home plate," Chicago Manager Jeff  Torborg said. "That was beautiful. That's a big emotional thing right there. It  meant so much to those two and that family."  </P> <P> Kevin Seitzer had three doubles to lead the assault on Greg Hibbard (9-6).  Seitzer scored two runs and drove in two.  </P> <P> The White Sox had won six of seven.  </P> <P> Toronto 8, Detroit 3 -- Pat Borders keyed the offense at Toronto as the Blue  Jays continued to exert pressure on the Red Sox in the East.  </P> <P> Borders had a home run and two singles, scored three runs and drove in three.  </P> <P> Fred McGriff hit his 25th home run and the Blue Jays built a big lead for David  Wells (8-3).  </P> <P> The hard-throwing Wells managed to make it through five innings despite giving  up eight hits and walking two.  </P> <P> Cleveland 5, Texas 3 -- Chris James had his fifth two-hit game in a row at  Cleveland, including a single in the fourth inning that started a string of  five singles after two were out.  </P> <P> Rookie Jeff Shaw (2-2) got his second major league victory. His first was also  against Texas. Shaw went 5 2/3 innings, giving up two runs and five hits. Doug  Jones worked the ninth, getting his 29th save and giving up Harold Baines' 12th  home run.  </P> <P> Minnesota 4, Milwaukee 2 -- Rookie Scott Erickson gave up five hits in seven  innings at Minneapolis and Randy Bush had another home run.  </P> <P> The Twins had lost four in a row and seven of their last eight.  </P> <P> Bush is 17 for 44 since coming off a two-month stint on the disabled list July  19. Since returning from a hamstring injury, he has four homers and nine runs  batted in. He has raised his average from .206 to .277.  </P> <P> Rick Aguilera pitched the last two innings for his 24th save.  </P> <P> New York 6, Seattle 4 -- The Yankees are going so well, they don't hesitate to  pinch-hit for a home run hitter.  </P> <P> Jesse Barfield, batting for Mel Hall, who earlier hit a home run, hit a two-run  shot in the seventh inning to lead the Yankees to their fourth victory in a  row.  </P> <P> The Yankees trailed, 4-3, but tied the score on Oscar Azocar's two-out,  run-scoring double. Then Barfield unloaded off Keith Comstock on an 0-and-2  pitch. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

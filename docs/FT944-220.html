			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / UK Company News: 80% rise in value of M&amp;As The value of mergers and acquisitions in Britain has risen almost 80 per cent in the past 12 months, according to an industry survey published yesterday. Figures compiled by Acquisitions Monthly, the financial magazine, showed that the total value of public and private takeover bids, along with management buy-outs, rose from Pounds 10.5bn last year to Pounds 18.6bn in 1994. Bids for public companies increased sharply from Pounds 3bn to Pounds 5.09bn, while the value of private deals almost doubled from Pounds 5.72bn to Pounds 11.4bn. Fees earned by merchant banks and accountants advising on these transaction also rose - up from Pounds 100m to Pounds 120m, although still far behind 1989's record Pounds 800m earnings. Among the banks, SG Warburg emerged as the leading financial adviser for the second successive year, playing a role in deals worth more than Pounds 4bn. Schroders was ranked second after advising on 28 deals worth Pounds 3.82bn, and Baring Brothers rose from eighth place last year to third in 1994.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DEALS 1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Adviser                 Public deals    Private deals       Totals                        No.  Pounds m   No. Pounds m      No.  Pounds m  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1 SG Warburg (1)    10      3,346   26       733      36      4,080  2 Schroders (4)        8      2,683   20     1,132      28      3,815  3 Baring Brothers (8)  6        616   17     2,242      23      2,858  4 Goldman Sachs (-)    3      1,831   10     1,382      13      3,214  5 Samuel Montagu (11)  9        903   15     1,896      24      2,799  6 Morgan Grenfell (2)  9      1,292   17     1,385      26      2,677  7 Kleinwort Benson (3) 6        819   12     1,753      18      2,572  8 Robert Fleming (19)  5      2,072   16       243      21      2,315  9 Lazards (7)          4      1,398   20       511      24      1,909 10 KPMG Corp Fin (9)    1          7  137     1,785     138      1,792  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993 rankings in brackets.

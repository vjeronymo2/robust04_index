			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY AGAIN APPLIES FOR STATE FUNDS FOR BUILDING BIKE PATH  </P> <P> For the second time, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is seeking  $800,000 in state funds to begin construction of a bike path that would  eventually extend 14 miles from the San Gabriel River to Temple Avenue in  Pomona.  </P> <P> Last year, the California Department of Parks and Recreation denied the county  the money needed for the first phase of the San Jose Creek Bikeway, which if  completed would serve Bassett, Hacienda Heights, Industry, La Puente, Rowland  Heights, Pomona, Walnut and West Covina.  </P> <P> The bikeway would connect to the existing San Gabriel River Regional Bikeway.  </P> <P> The county is also asking for $50,000 to improve access gates and asphalt ramps  at locations along the San Gabriel River, Los Angeles River and Rio Hondo  trails, which lead to Long Beach.  </P> <P> After voters approved Proposition 70 in June, 1988, the department set aside a  total of $776 million for recreational projects.  </P> <P> Shirley Willd-Wagner, grants administrator for the department, said she had  received the county's application for money from the California Wildlife,  Coastal and Park Land Conservation Bond Act funds. But only $2.5 million is  available for trails construction throughout the state, she said.  </P> <P> "To get $800,000 is unrealistic," Willd-Wagner said. "That's one-third of the  entire amount."  </P></p>

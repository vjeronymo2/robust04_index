			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Koretskiy report: "Returning to the Motherland </F> Is Not as Easy as Crossing the Inguri River"]    [Text] Georgian head Eduard Shevardnadze yesterday  expressed the hope for an early and massive return of refugees  to Abkhazia -- but this is hardly destined to materialize.  Abkhazia's position remains unchanged: Each returning refugee  will be screened and vetted as to whether he has not been  implicated in military or other criminal activity on the  autonomy's territory during hostilities. Thus, returning to  Abkhazia will be no easier than crossing the border. Therefore  any talk about the massive scale or speediness of this process  is senseless.    Eduard Shevardnadze believes that the return of "large  masses  of refugees" to Abkhazia is possible within the next few days.  The process will begin as soon as the bridge across the Inguri  river has been restored, groups of refugees formed, and a  schedule for their movement drawn up. Shevardnadze entrusted  this mission to Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsiya and  Defense Minister Varden Nadibaidze, who were to leave Tbilisi  yesterday for a place in immediate proximity to the  disengagement line in the city of Zugdidi.    Indeed, the bridge across the Inguri can be restored in the  next few days (after a corresponding order has been issued,  engineers will cope with this task within just a few hours).  Schedules for the refugees to cross the demarcation line can be  drawn up and coordinated with the Abkhazia side in two to three  days. But making up individual lists of refugees is not a  matter of just one week. Yesterday Igor Akhba, head of the  Abkhazia mission in Moscow, told KOMMERSANT-DAILY's  correspondent that the Abkhaz side considers screening of each  refugee a matter of principle. Sukhumi does not intend to  abandon this principle: It will not allow a spontaneous return.  Neither is there a mechanism for the return: The quadripartite  commission's consultations continue.    Considering that in early July another round of  Georgian-Abkhaz talks on a political settlement -- which has  been delayed on several occasions following the introduction of  peacekeeping forces -- is to begin, it is not ruled out that the  refugee problem will become an Achilles heel for the Georgian  delegation. Sukhumi, by manipulating this issue, will be able  to obtain further concessions from Tbilisi. The latter will be  appealing to Moscow, insisting that toughness be shown toward  the Abkhaz. In any event Eduard Shevardnadze will be caught in  a cross fire. He will not be able to avoid a compromise with  Vladislav Ardzinba, who wants to talk with Tbilisi as equals. At  the same time the Georgian leader will have to put this  political authority on the line by submitting the accords  reached to parliament's judgment.</p>

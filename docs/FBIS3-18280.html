			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Christian Brondum report: "Nyrup Rasmussen Rejects New </F> Treaty for the Community"]    [Text] Not until the spring of 1995 will the Danish  Government begin to analyze what changes Denmark will propose  when the EU [European Union] countries meet for an  intergovernmental conference on the EU's future in 1996. And in  advance Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is rejecting the  possibility that the result in 1996 could be a new treaty.    So said the prime minister yesterday at a conference  arranged  by the European Commission.    "I seen one major problem that I would like to mention  immediately. The time is not right to build new European  castles in the air when it comes to relinquishing sovereignty.  We must remember that the Maastricht treaty came into force on  1 November last year. We have scarcely become acquainted with  the tools it contains as yet. There can be no point in our  making changes six months later in our eagerness to achieve  perfection. And, after all, the signal from the people of  Europe is not great love of European institutions. People have  to be able to come along with us," Nyrup Rasmussen said.    He stressed that European cooperation will continue to be  cooperation among nation-states and that the many words spoken  must be seen in actions that the peoples of Europe can see in  everyday life.    In his speech to a number of invited politicians, business  leaders, and civil servants, the prime minister outlined his  vision of developments in the next 10-20 years. The United  States will be alone in the role of superpower. Neither Russia,  Japan, China, or Europe will be able to develop into great  powers in this period. Europe probably can develop into an  economic superpower, but not a military superpower.    Nyrup predicted major problems in maintaining viable  cooperation among the EU countries once they have become 20 or  more after the end of the century.    "The task is impossible. But it will be done," he said.    In his address EU Commissioner Henning Christophersen  predicted that it will now be almost impossible to set up the  third phase of economic and monetary union -- the common  currency -- in 1996 as planned. A number of countries are  striving to achieve this goal, but in particular the large  public sector deficits in many countries will prevent a  sufficient number of countries being able to meet the criteria  for creating monetary union.    It is therefore more realistic that EMU -- economic and  monetary union -- will not come until 1999.</p>

Lomonosov; UDC  547.963.32.057:542.95]    [Abstract] The development of synthesis of  oligodesoxyribonucleotides containing  5-fluoro-2'-desoxyribocytidine (fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd) which are a  promising source for understandding mechanism of cytosine  DNA-methylases is described in detail. The resistance of  5'-O,N-protected fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd under the conditions of  standard postsynthesis oligonucleotide treatment is examined,  and it is shown that exposure of such protected  fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd to concentrated ammonia at 55C for 18 h  with subsequent exposure to an 80% aqueous solution of  acetic  acid at 20C for 40 min removes the protective groups  without altering the fluoridated nucleoside structure. It is  speculated that the absence of benzoyl amino group protection  makes the nucleoside more stable to subsequent acid treatment.  The findings show that oligonucleotides containing  fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd in the middle of the chain can be produced  rather simply and effectively by a combination of chemical and  enzymatic synthesis; this method can be used for producing  oligonucleotides not only with a single fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd  radical inclusion but also with several fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd  radicals spaced from each other by six-to-seven nucleotide links  by ligating several oligonucleotides with 5'-terminal  fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd. The authors are grateful to V.N. Sergeyev,  V.N. Tashlitskiy, and G.Ya. Sheflyan for help with isolating and  analyzing oligonucleotides. Figures 1; references 11: 2 Russian,  9 Western.</p>

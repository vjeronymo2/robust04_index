			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NEWHALL SCHOOLS HIRE NEW BUS FIRM  </P> <P> Trustees of the Newhall School District voted unanimously Monday night to hire  a new school bus company to replace troubled and much-criticized Laidlaw  Transit Inc.  </P> <P> Parents, children and district administrators have complained since October  that Laidlaw drivers were poorly trained, unfamiliar with their routes and  rarely completed their rounds on time.  </P> <P> The complaints dogged Laidlaw for months, and school administrators have been  threatening since November to sever the company's contract unless service  improved.  </P> <P> Laidlaw is the nation's largest school bus company, with about 180 contracts in  California alone.  </P> <P> In its place, the trustees awarded a $396,000 annual contract to Santa Barbara  Transportation, a much different firm. Santa Barbara is a small family-run  company that has only 10 contracts with school districts in Santa Barbara  County, said Ken Stokes, company president.  </P> <P> Supt. J. Michael McGrath said he was impressed by Santa Barbara's management  practices. A consultant hired to review Laidlaw cited poor management as a  major cause of the company's problems.  </P> <P> The trustees of the William S. Hart Union High School District are expected to  approve a $1.5-million contract with Santa Barbara tonight.  </P> <P> Four bus companies, including Laidlaw, bid on the contracts. Santa Barbara was  the lowest bidder on the Hart contract.  </P> <P> Laidlaw, however, was the lowest bidder on the Newhall contract, submitting a  bid $63,000 under Santa Barbara's proposal.  </P> <P> But McGrath said the trustees were not obligated to renew Laidlaw's contract,  despite the low bid.  </P> <P> Laidlaw officials also had to fend off allegations by former employees at a  state Senate hearing last year that supervisors doctored training records to  make rookie drivers appear more experienced.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol investigated but found no proof that records had  been altered.  </P></p>

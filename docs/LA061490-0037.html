			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FIRMS, AGENCIES JOIN IN DRIVE TO FIND CHILD CARE  </P> <P> More than a dozen Ventura County companies and public agencies have formally  joined forces in a drive to provide better day-care services for their  employees, although most are stopping short of actually opening children's  centers in the workplace.  </P> <P> One major focus of the consortium, whose first formal meeting was held  Wednesday night at the Ventura Holiday Inn, is to locate and upgrade private  day-care providers countywide.  </P> <P> The companies, which will pool information on available day-care services, also  will try to zero in on facilities that care for children who are ill -- a  service that working parents find particularly difficult to find.  </P> <P> Ellen Coleman, project coordinator for the Ventura Child Care Consortium, said  most of the companies are too small to establish day-care programs on their  premises, but have joined forces to improve day-care options outside the  business place.  </P> <P> A leading member of the coalition is Patagonia, a Ventura outdoor clothing  business with a national reputation as a leader in providing day-care  facilities for its workers.  </P> <P> As the consortium launched its countywide effort, another member company  announced Wednesday that it plans to follow Patagonia's lead by building its  own on-site children's center when it moves later this year from midtown  Ventura to the city's west side.  </P> <P> The company, Western Instrument Corp., which has 130 employees, said it hopes  to join forces with Patagonia in the actual operation of the new center.  </P> <P> Formal contracts have not been signed, but Jean Halsell, Western Instrument's  administration manager, said she is hopeful that the child-care partnership  will be formed and that Anita Garaway, director of Patagonia's Great Pacific  Child Development Center, will head both schools.  </P> <P> Halsell said discussions have been held about placing the younger children of  employees of both companies at Patagonia and older children at the proposed  Western Instrument facility. The companies and the children's parents would  share the cost of operating the centers, she said.  </P> <P> Halsell said Western Instrument, an ocean engineering firm, plans to move in  late summer or early fall to the site of the former Mill Elementary School on  Ventura Avenue. The company's new children's facility will open six to nine  months later, she said.  </P> <P> Paul Tebbel, a Patagonia spokesman, said it is too soon to consider the deal  completed.  </P> <P> Henning Ottsen, Western Instrument's vice president, said, "We'd like very much  to get the benefit of Patagonia's expertise, but we're definitely going to open  an on-site center whether or not we reach an agreement with them."  </P> <P> According to Coleman, a child-care partnership between the two companies would  be an ideal example of what is needed in the county.  </P> <P> "This is a slow-growth area, but we're still making children," Coleman said.  She suggested that because the county's employers are relatively small, their  assistance to working parents must be innovative rather than costly.  </P> <P> Thirteen employers -- holdovers from the 65 that were represented at a  symposium in April -- signed up as founding members of the consortium. Coleman  said another 40 employers are interested in working with the group.  </P> <P> The founding members include American Commercial Bank, Bank of A. Levy, First  Interstate Bank, GTE California, J.C. Penney, Patagonia, Pemko Manufacturing,  Pyramid Employment Agency, Turning Point Foundation, Ventura County National  Bank and Western Instrument. Ventura County and Oxnard College are also  members.  </P> <P> "One of our first responsibilities as we move into our second year is to draw  those other 40 in," said James W. Word, manager of the J.C. Penney store in  Ventura's Buenaventura Plaza. He was a member of the Blue Ribbon Committee that  guided the child-care campaign through its first year.  </P></p>

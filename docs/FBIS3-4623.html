International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Sri  Rafidah Aziz said Malaysia had not imposed any trade barrier or  sanction as had been misconstrued by the British press. She  told reporters after attending her ministry's annual dialogue  with trade and industry bodies in Kuala Lumpur that Malaysia's  action mainly centered on not entertaining tenders from British  companies for government tenders and this is its right. The  action does not directly affect the normal run of business  between private sectors of Britain and Malaysia.    As for transactions between the British and Malaysia's  private sectors, this is proceeding well in the open market.  She said Malaysia's action only pertained to British companies  which intended to do business with the Malaysian Government.</p>

Fuzhou is separated from Taiwan by the Taiwan Strait and is  the closest mainland city to Taiwan Island. Because of human,  geological, and blood relations, trade, economic cooperation and  various kinds of exchanges between the two places have been  increasing in recent years and remarkable results have been  achieved. Xi Jinping believes that Fuzhou City has a lot of  favorable conditions for attracting capital from Taiwan and, at  present, the investment environment improves with each passing  day. As far as the "hard" environment is concerned: Various  counties (cities) under the city have gone all out to build  high-grade major highways from north to south and east to west  and the 7,500-tonne passenger wharf open to the outside world  has been completed and put into operation; after expansion,  Fuzhou's Yixu Airport opened more than 80 air routes to various  major cities in China and preparatory work for the construction  of the Changle International Airport is almost complete and  construction work will start soon; and the Fuzhou Huaneng Power  Plant will be expanded. As far as the "soft" environment is  concerned, Fuzhou City has set up a Taiwan Compatriot Investment  Service Center to help Taiwan businessmen solve problems in  making investment in a timely manner.    Xi Jinping told these reporters that capital introduced from  Taiwan this year would be used mainly in infrastructure, such as  transportation and power facilities, agricultural production  which could earn foreign exchange, and industries using new and  high technology. Preferential treatment would be given to  investment in major construction projects and infrastructure  projects such as airports, wharves, roads, and power plants.  Taiwan businessmen would be encouraged to set up bonded  warehouses and carry out entrepot trade in the bonded zone and  they would also be encouraged to transform, lease, contract, and  purchase various enterprises by setting up joint ventures. He  said that in the Fuzhou Bonded Zone, tariffs and permits were  exempted, international trade organizations were allowed to be  established to carry out international entrepot trade, and the  establishment of a capital goods market would also be allowed.    He said that in attracting capital from Taiwan this year,  Fuzhou City would further improve the system for keeping in  contact with Taiwan enterprises involved in investment of over  $10 million, do a good job in providing services for Taiwan  enterprises, organize the functional departments concerned to  carry out investigation and study on Taiwan enterprises and to  help solve various difficult problems, and strive to make new  breakthroughs in attracting investment from major financial  groups. At the same time, Fuzhou would further strengthen the  construction of the "soft" investment environment, establish and  improve the joint examination and approval system, simplify  procedures for examination and approval, properly organize  activities on reception days for Taiwan and foreign businessmen,  carry out official work on the spot in the economy and  technology development zone, and the Taiwan Businessmen's  Investment Zone, and strengthen the building of Fuzhou's Taiwan  Compatriots Investment and Trade Service Center and Foreign  Businessmen's Investment Service Center to improve efficiency  and service functions.    Talking about how to urge Taiwan businessmen to abide by  laws  and how to earnestly protect the legitimate rights and interests  of workers and staff members of enterprises following the  increased number of Taiwan-invested enterprises in Fuzhou year  after year, Xi Jinping said that it was necessary to safeguard  the legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan compatriots who  make investments in Fuzhou and to assist Taiwan businessmen to  make investment and operate enterprises in Fuzhou City in the  long-term. On the other hand, it is necessary to earnestly  safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of workers and  staff members; to urge Taiwan-invested enterprises to implement  the state laws, decrees, and regulations concerned and inspect  how they implement them; and to ensure proper labor insurance,  labor protection, welfare, and wages for workers and staff  members so that state laws, decrees, and regulations can be  implemented smoothly in Taiwan-invested enterprises and those  enterprises can develop in a healthy direction.</p>

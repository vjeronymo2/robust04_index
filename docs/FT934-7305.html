			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Possibility of a sea-change in IRA leadership THE GOVERNMENT is taking seriously the possibility that Sinn Fein's recent peace initiative with Mr John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour party may represent a sea-change in the thinking of the IRA leadership, Philip Stephens writes. Intelligence reports seen by Mr John Major have supported the view expressed by Mr Hume that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, may be ready to call a halt to the violence. That in turn has raised cautious hopes that the IRA's traditional Christmas ceasefire might offer an opportunity for a more durable cessation of violence. In spite of high-level denials of any official contacts with Sinn Fein, it is acknowledged in Whitehall that the British security services maintain close contacts with members of the party. Their reports suggest that, in spite of the military and political strength of the nationalists, the present generation of IRA leaders is seeking an alternative to the terrorist campaign. Mr Adams' peace overtures are said to have had the support of the movement's military leaders. Explanations for the apparent change of heart vary, but the most common is that Mr Adams and his colleagues simply do not want the next generation of Sinn Fein activists to have no future beyond violence. They have been dismayed by the lack of support from Washington for the republican movement and hit by a succession of arms cache discoveries in the republic. The reports, supported by the contacts of experienced local politicians in the province, offer a partial explanation of Mr Major's public offers this week of a place at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein if it renounced violence. But officials stressed that doubts remain over whether Mr Adams could prevent a breakaway movement of hard-line IRA terrorists.</p>

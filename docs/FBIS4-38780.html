			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev is 99 percent ready to introduce direct  presidential rule in Crimea. This is the opinion of the head of  staff of the Crimean president and government Viktor Minin.    In a Wednesday interview with INTERFAX Minin said that the  situation in the peninsula is being used for a top-level power  struggle in Kiev.    Minin, who met the speaker of the Ukrainian parliament  Aleksandr Moroz several days ago, hopes that the parliament will  not support the proposals of several politicians in Kiev to  introduce direct presidential rule. According to him, Moroz is  the only person in Ukraine representing the new legitimate power  and does not want to be held responsible for the sins of the old  leadership.    Several days ago Moroz spoke against presidential rule in  Crimea.    Minin predicted that direct presidential rule would lead to  confrontation between Russia and Ukraine. "Russia would either  have to wash its hands, or react", he remarked. "If Yeltsin does  nothing, Zhirinovskiy and the Russian military are going to  demand either tough measures or a change of government."    In Minin's opinion the only reasonable way out of the crisis  is the signing of a treaty between Ukraine and Crimea as a  republic within Ukraine and the expansion of trade and economic  relations between Crimea and Russia.</p>

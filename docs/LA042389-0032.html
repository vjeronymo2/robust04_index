			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO STRANGER TO CAUSES, SHE NOW FIGHTS FROM CITY HALL  </P> <P> When Barbara Messina sets out on a political mission, there's no stopping her,  even if she is confronted with threats or public disdain.  </P> <P> Take the case of El Cid, an adult bookstore targeted for closing by community  groups shortly after it opened on Main Street in 1975. Unfortunately for the  store owner, Messina headed the picketing campaign, which lasted five years,  ending only after the store burned down in 1980. Fire officials suspected arson  but closed the case due to insufficient evidence.  </P> <P> Seven days a week, rain or shine, Messina dispatched picketers to the store,  where volunteers took one- or two-hour shifts from 9 a.m. to midnight. Messina  was frequently in the picket line herself, carrying placards and marching  quietly.  </P> <P> Some passing motorists honked in support, Messina said, whereas others heckled  them, accusing them of infringing on free speech.  </P> <P> "They took a lot of abuse, especially at night," Messina said of her fellow  picketers, who were members of a group called People Against Obscenity. On at  least one occasion, occupants of a passing car "mooned" them, she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Influential Councilwoman  </P> <P> Nowadays, Messina, 49, is championing her principles from City Hall, where she  has become influential after 2 1/2 years on the City Council. As a  councilwoman, she also sits on the redevelopment agency board, and her vote has  often decided the fate of major Main Street projects crucial to revitalizing  downtown.  </P> <P> She is also a member of a committee that will advise the City Council on the  development of Valley Boulevard, and as such will play a key role in the  development of one of the city's key commercial strips.  </P> <P> A short, energetic woman whose black curls are trimmed in an easy-care,  no-nonsense style, Messina juggles a hectic schedule of family and city  affairs, dashing from City Hall meetings to ribbon-cutting ceremonies to the  family's new pizza restaurant, Artino's, which, it is planned, will be renamed  Messina's Trattoria, or Messina's Little Eatery, to add a family atmosphere.  </P> <P> In the mid-1970s, when she was caring for three young daughters, Messina said  she joined People Against Obscenity after she saw grammar school children being  allowed inside the adult bookstore. She visited more than a dozen Alhambra  church and community groups to sign up scores of picketers. On Mondays, members  of St. Thomas More Catholic Church took the shift. Tuesdays it was Atherton  Baptist Homes, and Wednesdays it was the Knights of Columbus.  </P> <P> "I lived my life on the picket line," Messina said. The campaign took its toll,  nearly breaking up her marriage, she said. Her husband, Michael, who had helped  to schedule the picketing shifts, said the campaign got boring.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Matter of Principle  </P> <P> "It took a lot of time, and it seemed nothing was happening," he said.  </P> <P> But Barbara Messina never considered giving up the fight.  </P> <P> "Maybe I'm just a stubborn Italian," she said. "It just became a matter of  principle with me." Even after an anonymous sender mailed her a tarantula as a  warning to quit, she held her ground.  </P> <P> As a council member, Messina has a reputation for being outspoken and  accessible to people. Critics, however, say she can be obstinate and emotional  in her decision-making. But all agree that she is hard to ignore.  </P> <P> Messina sits on a council that includes two attorneys, an accountant and a  health administrator. She is outspoken and persistent -- some would call her  stubborn. She is credited with doing her homework before meetings but often  consults her husband, a former mayor and councilman whom she succeeded in  office, for advice.  </P> <P> "Of all the council people in Alhambra, Barbara Messina is the most loyal to  the people of Alhambra," said Ralph Gilliam, a former Planning Commission  member who is a regular at council meetings. "She speaks out."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vocal at Meetings  </P> <P> Herman Schwab, a 42-year Alhambra resident, agrees. In 1986, when Schwab and  his neighbors on Violeta Drive were fighting a proposed theater complex near  their homes, Barbara Messina met with the residents and spoke up for them at  council meetings.  </P> <P> More recently, Messina met with and agreed to help Ramona Avenue residents  opposed to a controversial 78-foot sign. Resident Clifford Chen said that  Councilman Michael Blanco, who also opposed the sign, "let his vote speak for  itself," while Messina "talked to us." The city obtained an injunction to halt  the sign's construction.  </P> <P> "I try to put myself in the other person's position," she said. "I'm a bleeding  heart, as they like to put it. It's true."  </P> <P> Gilliam said that after being called for the least little thing, Messina "will  call City Hall and make things happen." As a result, Messina receives 20 or so  calls a week from residents, and she follows up on all of them, she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stubborn Under Stress  </P> <P> Messina admitted to being stubborn when she is under stress, but added, "If you  show me I'm wrong, I'm flexible."  </P> <P> For example, she said, she had originally opposed installation of a dance floor  at a proposed restaurant downtown, but after learning that there would not be  nightly dancing there, she voted to approve it.  </P> <P> When Messina first took office, her relations with other council members were  "a little strained," she said, because they probably believed accounts of her  stubbornness circulated by her opponents. But tension eased after council  members attended a retreat and "put their cards on the table," she said.  </P> <P> Messina's colleagues on the council said she is hard-working but can be  hardheaded.  </P> <P> "I enjoy working with Mrs. Messina," Boyd Condie said. "I think she feels  fervently about things."  </P> <P> Blanco, who backed one of Messina's opponents during her 1986 bid for office,  said: "It's easier to work with Michael (Messina) than it's been working with  Barbara." He said he felt Michael Messina was better at understanding city  issues. But Councilman Talmage Burke said Barbara Messina is good at talking  with residents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Heart of Gold  </P> <P> "If she has all the facts and listens to all the discussions, she comes to a  reasonable conclusion," he said.  </P> <P> Parker Williams, a former council member who at times had clashed with Messina  over redevelopment and other issues, said: "She's got a heart of gold, but she  doesn't understand things."  </P> <P> "I can say the same thing about him," she responded. She said Williams thinks  she doesn't understand the economic consequences of city policies.  </P> <P> "I understand," she said. "I just don't agree with him." She said she tends to  side with the underdog, mainly residents and small business owners.  </P> <P> Messina acknowledged that 20 years ago she was thin-skinned, but said she feels  that now she has learned to take criticism in stride. What made the difference  was the 1973 death of her daughter Kathleen, 10, from a brain tumor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Close to Her Daughters  </P> <P> "Life is too short," Messina said. "I don't harbor any hard feelings for  anybody that's done anything to me. I just don't think it's worth it."  </P> <P> Now her biggest problem is learning how to say no so that she doesn't stretch  herself too thin, she said.  </P> <P> She is close to her daughters, two of whom are married -- but "no grandchildren  yet," she said. Teresa Messina Juarez, 27, and Maryann Messina-Doerning, 25,  are both teachers in Alhambra. Kristen, 18, is a cheerleader at Alhambra High  School.  </P> <P> "We really grew up with a sense of civic responsibility early on," said Juarez,  who is a library board member. Daughter Maryann helps manage the family  restaurant.  </P> <P> Barbara Messina knows that the restaurant's location on Main Street may raise a  conflict-of-interest issue if future city projects are proposed nearby, but she  said she has informed the city attorney that she will disqualify herself from  voting based on his advice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hates to Cook  </P> <P> Messina admittedly hates to cook but agreed to help run the restaurant as a  family investment. She works there four or more hours a day and whips up a  10-gallon batch of spaghetti sauce and meatballs every Monday.  </P> <P> One recent weekday, Messina, dressed in a tailored gray skirt, white blouse,  and black pumps because she had just come from a city-related meeting, stood  behind the restaurant stove and served up a heaping portion of the spaghetti  lunch special. The mild sauce, made from her grandmother's recipe, is jazzed up  with sweet bits of fresh garlic, which she loves.  </P> <P> "I think it's a better spaghetti sauce," said Steve Francis, a 19-year-old who  started working at the restaurant before the Messinas bought it in February. He  also credits the councilwoman for getting him back on the job, which he had  quit after an argument with Michael Messina.  </P> <P> "It was my fault," Francis said. "She helped me own up to it." Michael Messina,  who said his wife is much better than he is at dealing with people, now mainly  concentrates on the business side of the restaurant while she supervises the  employees.  </P> <P> Barbara Messina shuttles to her appointments in a new Cadillac sporting  personalized plates that say "HOT ITLN," for Hot Italian. "It caused such a  stir," she said, wincing in disbelief. The plate elicited uninvited comments  from truck drivers and raised eyebrows from neighbors, she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Come a Long Way  </P> <P> Politically, she has come a long way since 1969, when she headed a citizens  group to defeat proposals for a new courthouse and library that would have  raised taxes for homeowners such as the Messinas, who had just bought a house.  </P> <P> Picketing the bookstore further piqued her interest in politics by introducing  her to Sacramento legislators she described as "so liberal." But she did not  run for the council until 1986, when she won a close race to fill a seat  previously held by her husband.  </P> <P> In 1983, after then-Mayor Mike Rubino left office after a conviction for  accepting a bribe, Messina's husband urged her to run, but she demurred, saying  she didn't feel she was qualified.  </P> <P> "I guess I did have the housewife syndrome at the time," she said. She said she  no longer suffers from that but acknowledges that she frequently consults her  husband on city policy.  </P> <P> "I respect him, and I respect his opinion," Messina said. She said her husband,  who owns Messina Development Co. in Alhambra, is an expert on development  issues and also the person she most admires. He said his company does not take  on projects in Alhambra.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proud of Park  </P> <P> Asked to name the accomplishment she is most proud of, the councilwoman names  the renovation of Almansor Park, a project completed when her husband was on  the council and she was his field representative.  </P> <P> Councilman Blanco said that Messina's penchant for consulting her husband has  made it more difficult for the council to reach decisions on various projects.  </P> <P> "At times she sounds like what he says is what she's going to do," Blanco said.  "But he's not there (at council meetings) to discuss things." He said that as a  result, progress on the city's redevelopment projects has slowed.  </P> <P> Michael Messina said he advises his wife, but they do not always agree and she  often turns out to be right. "We each have certain talents and skills," he  said. "We feed off each other."  </P> <P> He dismisses as "typical political talk' accusations that although his wife is  on the council, he is running the show.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Team Approach  </P> <P> He said he is quieter than his gregarious wife. When he was a councilman, he  said, the talk was that "he may be running, but it's her that's running  everything."  </P> <P> The Messinas' team approach did get them into trouble in 1985. Then Councilman  Michael Messina, saying his job was requiring him to travel more, offered to  resign -- but only if the council named his wife to replace him.  </P> <P> Critics accused Messina of trying to broker the selection of his successor, and  the council rejected the conditional resignation on a 2-2 vote.  </P> <P> "It was just taken the wrong way by people," Barbara Messina said of the  resignation offer. "I just didn't feel it was out of line."  </P> <P> For some politicians, such as former Monterey Park Councilman Matthew G.  Martinez, who went on to be a state assemblyman and now U.S. congressman, a  City Council seat has turned out to be a steppingstone to higher office.  </P> <P> Messina plans to run for reelection next year but insists she has no ambition  beyond City Hall.  </P> <P> "It's hard enough trying to deal with four other people, much less an Assembly  position," she said.  </P></p>

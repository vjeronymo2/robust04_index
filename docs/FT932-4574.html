			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Acal shows 13% rise to Pounds 3.15m ACAL, the USM-quoted electronics and industrial controls distributor, finished the year ended March 31 1993 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.15m, an increase of 13 per cent over the Pounds 2.78m of the previous year. The growth was mainly the result of further improvement in the Netherlands, the turnround in Acal Electronics in the UK, and the success in Belgium with the acquisition of Betea Components, reported Mr John Curry, chairman. That, together with Italy and currency benefits, accounted for an increase in sales of 18 per cent to Pounds 68.9m (Pounds 58.5m). Earnings per share came to 14.6p (14p). The final dividend is 4.2p for a total of 6.3p (5.85p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Denidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau February 9 TASS -- The parliament of the  Moldovan breakaway Dniester Republic called on the United  Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  (CSCE) and heads of the CIS states to send observers for "the  objective assessment of the situation".    The Tiraspol leaders consider this has become necessary due  "to increasing attacks of Chisinau on the Dniester  administration".    Thus the parliament fired back the Wednesday statement of  Moldovan President Mircea Snegur, who accused Tiraspol of  attempts to aggravate the socio-political situation and block  the implementation of the Moscow agreement on the peaceful  settlement of the conflict, signed in August 1992.    "The presence of international observers may prevent  economic  siege and a new military conflict in the region", the parliament  statement said.    The document reiterated that the Dniester province will not  take part in Moldova's parliamentary elections scheduled for  February 27.    The situation is apparently hotting up in the Dniester  province. "A single provocation will be enough to have a  military conflict unleashed", Valeriy Prudnikov, chief of police  in the Dniester town of Bendery told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday.  Prudnikov complained that the Dniester leaders "stur up local  population against the police", which is subordinate to Chisinau  Interior Ministry.    Dniester is not the only pain in the back for Chisinau.  Leaders of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic in the southern  part of Moldova insist that the 14th Russian Army deployed in  the former Soviet republic must be granted the status of  peace-keeping forces.    This will prevent Chisinau's possible attempts to solve by  force the problem of Moldova's two provinces -- Dniester and  Gagauzia, said a statement signed by Gagauz leaders.    The Army itself warned all sides against "the illusions to  solve the conflict by force". The statement of the command of  the 14th Army circulated on Wednesday stressed that "organizers  of armed provocations from both banks (of the Dniester River)  will get severe punishment for any attempt to unleash a new  conflict".    The military appealed to politicians to seek for a political  settlement of "all difficult but still solvable problems" basing  on the Moscow accords.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Internationals helped Stronger than expected fourth-quarter GDP figures from the US undermined fears that interest rates there would rise and helped UK stocks traded in New York. Pharmaceutical group Wellcome rose 9 to 675p in spite of continuing concern over the expected results of a huge Anglo French study into the Aids treatment AZT and high court proceedings against the company and a US government agency over claimed toxic effects of the drug. And BP gained 2 to 367p in spite of a change of sentiment on the oil major from US investors. Leading international conglomerate Hanson improved 5 3/4 to 284p. However, Glaxo fell 2 to 663p. The group faces a patent challenge in German over its ulcer treatment Zantac. And an article in the Lancet medical journal focused on the clear up rate for duodenal ulcers after seven years, which would be better for the patient than for Zantac sales. NatWest Securities was the big buyer of both classes of BT tock, as the broker emphasised their attractions saying they had underperformed the market by 10 per cent over the last quarter. NatWest focused on BT's yield premium which it puts at nearly 30 per cent and emphasised its dividend growth forecasts for 1994 and 1995. The broker said the shares have been restrained by worries about the second instalment on the new shares and would respond to news emerging with the third quarter figures on February 10. The ordinary shares jumped 9 1/2 to 467 1/2 p, on heavy turnover of 14m with the partly-paid moved up a similar amount to 209p.</p>

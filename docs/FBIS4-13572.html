			<p>BFN     [Text] China says India and Pakistan should find a solution  to the Kashmir issue bilaterally. The Chinese ambassador in  India, Mr. Cheng Ruisheng, told a press conference in Calcutta  this afternoon that China does not want to be a mediator on the  issue. On nonproliferation, Mr. Ruisheng said no country should  pressurize India to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    Replying to a question on India's new economic policy, he  said the time has come to integrate developing economies with  the world economy to expedite progress.</p>

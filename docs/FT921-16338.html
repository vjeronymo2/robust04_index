			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities firmer in two-way trading THE UK stock market began to return to more normal trading levels yesterday as tensions over sterling and domestic interest rates relaxed a little and the institutions took a fresh look at their equity portfolios. Share prices moved erratically before closing firmly behind early gains in the new trading session on Wall Street. Traders reported substantial activity in London, with many large deals not reported until the very end of the session. The institutions were present, both as buyers and sellers, apparently re-positioning portfolios rather than buying across the range of equities. International blue chips were firm, encouraged by sterling's steady performance and by the continued improvement on Wall Street. Strong gains were recorded among brewery and publishing stocks, both sectors influenced by hopes for early economic recovery. But there were also some notable weak spots. Electricity stocks recovered from the initial effects of a political attack on the industry's profits record. Food retailers turned down sharply on news that Sainsbury plans substantial price cuts this month, a move seen as threating further pressures in a tightly competitive industry. Equities opened strongly, quickly rising by 22.9 on the FT-SE Index as the March Footsie contract established one of the largest premiums against the cash market ever recorded. However, the Footsie topped out at 2,515.7 as the futures premium faded and by mid-session, the equity market was barely ahead of its overnight level, reflecting some nervousness ahead of Wall Street's opening. In the event, the Dow Average, after a slow start, showed a gain of 15 points in UK hours, and the London market was quick to respond. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,504.1, its highest level since mid-November, with a gain on the day of 11.3. Seaq volume totalled 452m shares, below the 457.1m of the previous session. 'But, on Thursday, it was all basket trades with the futures market. Yesterday, the institutions were very busy, although very stock selective,' said the head trader at a large integrated securities house. Cadbury-Schweppes stood out strongly among the food manufacturers, helped by Wall Street's influence. But there were heavy falls in such institutional core stocks as British Gas and Wellcome. The government bond market, in contrast, had a quiet trading session and although there was a favourable reception for the December Official Reserves statistics, bond prices ended the day a shade easier. Retail or customer volume in equities has remained below last year's average daily levels as the market returns from the Christmas holiday.</p>

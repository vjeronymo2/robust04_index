			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Lajos Fur, nominee for the </F> position of chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Zsolt  Mester; place and date not given: "Unsatisfied Masses Could  Become Toys in the Hands of Demagogues"]    [Text] Defense Minister Lajos Fur is the only serious  candidate for the position of chairman of the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF], and this fact is not kept secret even by  the leading figures in the MDF. In his interview with PESTI  HIRLAP prior to the seventh national conference of the MDF  scheduled for the coming weekend, Lajos Fur spoke about his  ideas, his party's internal situation, and the advance of the  left which, in his view, is the most dangerous political force.    [Mester] You are regarded as the only serious candidate for  the position of MDF chairman. Sandor Lezsak stepped down but he  continues to accept gladly the position of executive chairman, a  position that has been necessary so far because the party  chairman was also the prime minister. Now, Peter Boross is the  MDF's candidate for the position of prime minister. If things  turn out the way you envisage, what kind of division of labor  will you develop with Sandor Lezsak?    [Fur] There is no need for the previous division of labor to  change. It is the task of the executive chairman to deal with  organizational and administration matters, and this can continue  in the future because, even if not a prime minister, I am still  a minister and I have a lot of government tasks to see to. It  is the task of the MDF chairman to represent the party outside.  As part of this effort, I will continue to visit various places  in Hungary if the upcoming national conference assigns this task  to me, just like now, for the benefit of keeping contact with  the members.    [Mester] It seems that, after Istvan Csurka and his  followers, a new internal opposition is emerging in the party.  Based on his declarations, Ivan Szabo and the national liberals  seem to be part of this opposition.    [Fur] I do not think that they are emerging as an internal  opposition. National liberalism has its own justification and  place within the MDF, along with the other two main trends, of  course, on condition that it refrains from trying to become the  exclusive trend, but nothing like this is happening.    [Mester] One of the liberals, Ferenc Kulin, is the first MDF  leader in a top position who used to be member of the Hungarian  Socialist Workers Party [MSZMP].    [Fur] This has no special importance whatsoever.    [Mester] At a meeting of the MDF organization in Zuglo  [Budapest district], you spoke about the leftist danger  threatening Hungary. It seems that you regard the left as the  most dangerous election rival, and you are afraid of possible  restoration of old ways. The left has repeatedly criticized you  for such statements.    [Fur] I continue to declare that the danger can be clearly  shown by scientific means. The extremist dictatorship of the  past four decades has not disappeared without any trace; it has  penetrated the society and it is present as an extremely  organized force that can be mobilized any time. It is also  present in the people's thinking and mentality: Although  everyone knew that the communists were lying when they spoke  about equality, people who are now living under difficult  conditions and struggling with various problems are weeping for  the return of the period of "equality." The danger of  restoration is real: History proves that it is possible to make  a dictatorship out of democracy, by democratic means; take the  example of Germany between 1929 and 1933 or Hungary between 1945  and 1948.    [Mester] The election campaign has clearly started, and the  MDF does not have an appointed campaign manager to this very  day. I know that the general answer to this is that the  executive chairman and his staff are directing the election  campaign. You have not yet finished your election program  either, although almost every party has already come up with  some program. It is true that Sandor Lezsak said earlier that  the MDF was focusing on the work to be done, and not on the  campaign; in other words, the MDF is engaged in the electoral  campaign by working. However, not long ago, the MDF group in  the National Assembly suggested the earliest date for Parliament  to end its activity.... Are you late with the work?    [Fur] Not at all. The division of labor of the executive  body is adequate; its members have specific tasks and they have  been working on them for a long time. The national conference  will formulate and approve the election program; the  preparations have been made and the draft is ready. At the same  time, the campaign of individual candidates has been going on  all over the country for weeks and months. As for the proposal  of the parliamentary group, the date of end of March or the  beginning of April is realistic, especially if we consider the  candidates of the Dunantul region, with 60-80 small villages in  their electoral district. Sandor Lezsak's previous statement is  still valid: Tough work is awaiting us in Parliament until the  beginning of the election campaign. There is a lot of work to be  done.</p>

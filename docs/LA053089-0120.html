			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> S. AFRICAN STOPS AMERICAN IN 6TH  </P> <P> South African heavyweight champion Pierre Coetzer knocked American  cruiserweight Mike Greer down twice, then stopped him in the sixth round of a  scheduled 10-round bout Monday night.  </P> <P> Greer, of Memphis, Tenn., was booed by the crowd from the outset as he went  straight into clinches and held on, hardly throwing a punch. Greer, ranked  fourth by the International Boxing Federation, fifth by the World Boxing  Council and sixth by the World Boxing Assn., was the highest-rated opponent  Coetzer has faced in his bid for a chance at the world heavyweight title.  Coetzer improved his record to 26-2.  </P></p>

			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Japanese Bonds: Hopes of recovery fade as yen rises THE JAPANESE bond market has brushed aside uncertainty over economic policy of the country's new government, which took office last week, and has instead focused on further evidence of a weaker economy, driving long-term interest rates down to five-month lows. The yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark fell to 3.995 per cent - the first time since March 19 that it had fallen below 4 per cent - before closing the week at 4.08 per cent. Hopes of an imminent recovery have faded as the economy faces an increasing number of stumbling blocks. Aside from continuing sluggishness in corporate activities, consumer spending has been hit by bad summer weather, and the yen's rise to record levels threatens to strangle exports. The ratio of job offers to applicants fell to 74:100 in June, down from 81:100. Industrial production declined by 5.1 per cent from the previous year, falling for the 21st consecutive month, while machinery orders fell again for the 15th successive month, a down 13.3 per cent. The unusually long rainy season and cool summer have depressed sales of air conditioners, clothing and beer, which usually rise during the summer. Even if the weather improves, retailers do not expect a rapid recovery to make up for the earlier losses. The yen has appreciated 21.5 per cent from the beginning of the year, closing the week in Tokyo at a record Y102.40 to the dollar. Traders said the trade surplus, which rose 28 per cent in July, was the leading cause, while speculation of political pressure from the US is also driving the yen higher. Such factors, along with the Bank of Japan's unexpected easy stance over its money market operations last week, have heightened hopes of monetary easing. The central bank allowed three-month certificate of deposit yields to fall to 3.1 per cent on Friday, down from 3.23 per cent at the start of the week. The overnight call rate, which is closely controlled by the BoJ's money market operations, fell through a perceived floor of 3.2 per cent to 3.18 per cent. Concerns over extra supply due to redemptions of equity-linked bonds have also been put aside. According to the Bank for International Settlements, equity-linked bond redemptions peaked during the April-June quarter, totalling Dollars 26.5bn. The BIS said many corporate issuers raised funds during the first quarter, leading to a decline in bond placements in the second quarter. Meanwhile, some analysts see the pessimism over recovery as overstated, since the widely-expected cut in the official discount rate will help a gradual recovery. Moreover, although bad weather may postpone a rise in consumption, it does not cancel it. Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, points out that the yen is in 'overshoot territory' since, in yen terms, the trade surplus has peaked and has started to decline. Using the correlation between the yen-based trade surplus and long bond yields, he predicts that the coming two months is the last leg of a three-year decline in interest rates. While the US dollar-based trade surplus has been rising, on a yen basis it has peaked and has been falling month on month since spring. Since a fall in the trade surplus means an increase in the outflow of funds, this eventually leads to a gradual rise in interest rates. Long-term interest rates lag about six months behind the yen-based trade surplus, and the yield on the benchmark may be close to a bottom. Mr Barker predicts that the yield on the No 145 benchmark still has room to fall to the 3.8 per cent level, reached earlier this year, and advises taking profits around that level.</p>

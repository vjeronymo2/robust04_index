			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Opt-out school loses bid to be selective THE FIRST application for an opt-out comprehensive to become a grammar school was rejected yesterday by Mr John Patten, education secretary. Castle Hall School in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, wanted to become selective and change its age range from 9-13 to 11-18. It is understood that Mr Patten rejected Castle Hill's application because it had no record of teaching the planned age range, there was no proper financial scheme and no clear curriculum planning. The decision was greeted with fury at the school where 91 per cent of parents voted in favour of the application. It was reported last night that Mr Patten may face a legal challenge from parents over his decision. Editorial Comment, Page 16</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Rifts re-open in Mideast peace talks THE substantial differences between Arab and Israeli negotiators re-emerged yesterday, after the first round of talks in Washington on Monday, which had been marked by what all sides described as a distinct improvement in atmosphere. The Jordanian and Syrian delegations said they were particularly encouraged by Israel's willingness to discuss UN Resolutions 242 and 338 'in all their aspects'. These two resolutions assert the principle of Israel exchanging Arab land occupied in the 1967 war in return for a comprehensive peace. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, have affirmed Israel's commitment to the resolutions. But Mr Rabin stressed yesterday that Syria had not been given any document or specific proposals pledging a withdrawal from the Golan Heights. His comment appeared to qualify an earlier statement by Mr Peres yesterday that Israel was ready for territorial compromise on the Golan. However, even this was rejected out of hand by Syria yesterday, before negotiators began their second round of talks. Tishrin, the official Damascus daily newspaper, insisted no compromise was possible on Resolution 242 and demanded full withdrawal by Israel. 'Peace cannot be achieved through a deal or a partial settlement. There is no alternative to real peace which gives the Arabs back their occupied land,' the newspaper said. The Syrian team said on Monday that if Israel conceded the principle of a full withdrawal, all matters could be open to discussion. During five previous rounds of negotiations, Israel, under the hardline former government headed by Mr Yitzhak Shamir, would not even discuss territorial compromise. Similar differences over the interpretation of 242 will emerge as the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians move on to substantive issues in the next four weeks. Israel has already warned that a Palestinian self-governing authority in the occupied West Bank and Gaza can have only an administrative function. The Palestinians want a full legislative body. The aim of both sides is to agree the form of an elected Palestinian body to administer the areas from which the Israeli army will withdraw, pending final talks within three years on a lasting solution for the occupied areas.</p>

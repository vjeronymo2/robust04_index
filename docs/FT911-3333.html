			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Increased interest payments reduce CWS to Pounds 19.1m CO-OPERATIVE Wholesale Society, the co-operative trading company which has substantial interests in retailing, farming and manufacturing, raised trading profits from Pounds 30.7m to Pounds 44.1m in the year to January 12. However, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 19.7m to Pounds 19.1m after a higher interest charge of Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 13.8m). And following a Pounds 10.9m loss arising from bad-debt provisions in the banking group there was only Pounds 12.3m transferred to reserves in comparison with Pounds 34.7m last year. Sir Dennis Landau, chief executive, said the society's property development and engineering businesses had also proved vulnerable to the downturn in the economy but that retailing had proved resilient and had increased profits by Pounds 6m. He singled out for praise the performance of the Scottish retailing arm which which operates a wide spread of outlets, ranging from superstores to small shops in the Orkney, Shetland and Western Isles. In total, the group's retailing activities now represent 30 per cent of turnover. Almost half of CWS's business is accounted for by supplies to its retail society shareholders although these operations are run on a cost-recovery rather than a profit basis. Sales topped Pounds 3bn for the first time climbing from Pounds 2.68bn to Pounds 3.03bn as the society benefited from the inclusion of North Eastern Co-op, which joined CWS in June. During the year, CWS spent almost Pounds 150m on capital expenditure. Sir Dennis said this had helped sow the seeds for future development which augured well for the future of CWS and the Co-op as a whole.</p>

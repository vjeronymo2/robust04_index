			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["asa"-signed report: "Coupon Book Should Cost No More Than </F> 1,000 Korunas"]    [Text] Bratislava -- A group of experts appointed by the  state secretary at the Ministry for the Administration and  Privatization of National Property [MSPNM] is working on a  document on the preparation of coupon privatization, which it  will submit to the government, probably on 19 April. The  document will contain the timetable of coupon privatization and  of concomitant steps. This was stated by Privatization Minister  Milan Janicina at a news conference yesterday.    According to the minister, all efforts are aimed at having  the registration for coupon privatization start by the end of  August. G. Porvaznik, head of an MSPNM department, said that  large enterprises, in particular, are to be included in coupon  privatization, with the majority stake in these companies to be  privatized by this method. Altogether, the MSPNM is preparing  some 200 businesses with shares worth about 80 billion Slovak  korunas [Sk] for privatization by the coupon method. Added to  them will be some Sk20 billion worth of shares in companies that  have been founded by the National Property Fund. The problem of  privatizing -- including in coupon privatization -- some  companies, in which the strategic participation by the state is  foreseen, has not yet been resolved. This concerns, in  particular, power and gas generating and distribution companies,  arms factories, and chemical plants. An agreement with the  founder will determine to which extent these companies will be  privatized. Similarly, the inclusion of Slovak spas and of  Benzinol [chain of gas stations] in coupon privatization will  also depend on an agreement with the founding ministries. As  for the price of the coupon book, it should not cost more than  Sk1,000, according to Milan Janicina, and a lower price is even  being considered.    Milan Janicina agrees that although coupon privatization is  the socially most equitable privatization method, it does not  bring any capital. He added, however, that, besides coupon  privatization, the use of standard privatization methods will  continue; these can secure the inflow of capital. The  minister's adviser Igor Uhrik said in this context that the  greatest advantage of coupon privatization is that it eliminates  the blocking of credit resources. Besides, coupon privatization  helps establish the capital market, he added.    Minister Milan Janicina provided information on activities  by  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak  National Party [SNS] deputies to the National Council of the  Slovak Republic and other state administration officials in  lobbying for specific privatization projects. According to his  words, this activity was "reminiscent of methods used under real  socialism when you needed the support of some party  organization, at the local or district level, for some project  to come through." He said that it was interesting that, in all  cases, the deputies were lobbying for the project that turned  out to be the "victorious" one. Asked about the further course  of action in reexamining projects approved by Vladimir Meciar's  government, Minister Janicina said that the situation is  complicated by the fact that people are afraid of speaking or  testifying in individual cases. He said that, in the case of  the privatization of the Piestany spa, he had the opportunity to  see an agreement on the quiet partnership of two government  representatives and one deputy. The minister supposedly avails  himself of indications that, in three privatization cases, the  HZDS election campaign was to be financed from the approved  projects. Evidence for this assertion is lacking, however.</p>

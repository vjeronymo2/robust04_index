			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BE GOOD TO YOUR BACK, AND IT'LL BE GOOD TO YOU  </P> <P> It's too bad that backs don't come with owner's manuals, because most people  abuse them and pay with pain.  </P> <P> Bad body mechanics add up to bad backs. Be kind to your back and follow these  tips from experts at Hoag Hospital's Back on Track program and the YMCA's Y's  Way to a Healthy Back:  </P> <P> * Lifting: It's how you lift, not what you lift. Bend at your knees, not your  waist. Use your legs, not your back. Put the stress on leg muscles, which are  larger and stronger than back muscles. Hold the object close to your body,  because the farther away it is, the heavier it is. If something seems too heavy  to lift, ask for help.  </P> <P> * Twisting and reaching: Twisting your back unnecessarily when reaching for  something puts stress on your spine and the supporting tissues. Use that swivel  chair like you're supposed to and turn it when you reach for something. Keep  your knees pointed in the direction that you are reaching to avoid stress on  the spine.  </P> <P> Don't strain to reach that jar on the top shelf of your kitchen cabinet. Keep a  stepping stool handy or, if it's an item you use frequently, move it more  within range.  </P> <P> * Standing: Shifting your position when standing for long periods helps avoid  back strain. Placing one foot on a small stool also helps. If there's a cabinet  below the sink, when you are washing dishes, open one door and rest one foot on  the floor of the cabinet.  </P> <P> Everything you've heard about the importance of good posture is true. Slouching  and slumping create back stress that can result in considerable pain.  </P> <P> * Sitting: Make sure your chair is at the right height and provides good  support. Consider purchasing a lumbar roll to place in the small of your back  for better support. There are several kinds on the market, including ones that  are inflatable and fold up for travel. There are also special support systems  for use in automobiles. Medical supply companies and the Back Stop in Orange  carry these products.  </P> <P> * Sleeping: A firm mattress is best, but you should shift position frequently.  Never sleep on your stomach. If you sleep on your back, placing a pillow under  your knees helps to put your spine in correct alignment. Bend your knees when  sleeping on your side, and you can use a pillow then too.  </P> <P> Other suggestions from the Y's Way to a Healthy Back include: Exercise  regularly to strengthen and condition muscles, develop strong abdominal muscles  to provide support for the lower back, maintain your ideal weight and eat a  balanced diet.

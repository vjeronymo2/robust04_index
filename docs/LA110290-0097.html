			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DON'T START A WAR, BRZEZINSKI WARNS  </P> <P> Former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski warned U.S. officials  Thursday against starting a war with Iraq, saying it would lead to a protracted  conflict, with victory possible only at great cost.  </P> <P> "If we pursue a policy of liberation of Kuwait and of destroying Iraq, it would  cost much blood," Brzezinski said.  </P> <P> "We can say we can bomb them, and maybe that will crack their morale. . . . If  their morale doesn't crack, fighting could last three to four weeks, maybe four  to five months. Are we prepared to do this?"  </P> <P> The comments by Brzezinski, who served under former President Jimmy Carter,  were a significant departure from the silence that generally has engulfed the  U.S. foreign policy Establishment in the aftermath of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of  Kuwait.  </P></p>

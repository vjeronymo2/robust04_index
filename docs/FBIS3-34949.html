			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The residents of the Birah Makrun complex have  staged a large demonstration in al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate in  front of the offices of the agent and sabotage cliques. The  residents demanded redressing their living conditions and daily  suffering, noting that they have not received food supplies for  months. In addition, electricity and other basic services are  absent.    Another demonstration was staged at the Shawrash complex in  Chamchamal District, during which demonstrators demanded  ensuring food supplies to them. An exchange of fire ensued with  the demonstrators, prompting the sabotage cliques to close the  Chamchamal-al-Sulaymaniyah road.    Agent and sabotage cliques receive food supplies and then  sell them on the black market. They are also stealing electric  wires and transformers and smuggling them across the border,  thus causing a blanket power cutoff in the region.</p>

Sales  totaled $4.4 billion, down 5%. The Pittsburgh firm attributed the results in  part to lower refined product margins at Marathon Oil Co., the disposition of a  number of units in its diversified businesses segment and the reduction of  financial obligations by $1.6 billion since year-end 1988.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the market value of the portfolio has declined, the owner will receive not less than a specified percentage of the principal amount of the security. (For instance, if the market value of the portfolio used to calculate the amount payable at maturity has declined more than 10%, the owners of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will receive 90% of the principal amount of the securities.) The payment at maturity is based on changes in the value of the portfolio, but does not reflect the payment of dividends on the securities that comprise the portfolio. Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS are cash-settled in that they do not give the holder any right to receive a portfolio security or any other ownership right or interest in the portfolio securities, although the return on the investment is based on the aggregate portfolio value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the NYSE, Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will allow investors to combine the protection of a portion of the principal amount of the MITTS with a potential additional payment based upon the performance of a portfolio of securities representing 17 highly capitalized companies that either have restructured or are in the process of restructuring. Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will mature on December 31, 1999. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Restructuring Companies Portfolio consists of securities of 17 companies that have significantly different levels of market capitalization, ranging from a high of approximately $30. 2 billion (IBM) to a low of approximately $328 million (Arkis, Inc.). <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  Sixteen of the securities in the Restructuring Companies Portfolio are traded on the NYSE and one is a National Market security traded through Nasdaq. The average daily trading volume for the components of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio for the period from November 5, 1992, through March 7, 1994, ranged from a high of approximately 3.7 million shares (Eastman Kodak), to a low of approximately 93,008 shares (The Columbia Gas System, Inc.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These values are as of March 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the outset, each of the securities in the Restructuring Companies Portfolio will have equal representation. Specifically, each security included in the portfolio will be assigned a multiplier on the date of issuance so that the security represents an equal percentage of the value of the entire portfolio on the date of issuance. The multiplier indicates the number of shares (or fraction of one share) of a security, given its market price on an exchange or through NASDAQ, to be included in the calculation of the portfolio. Accordingly, each of the 17 companies included in the Restructuring Companies Portfolio will represent approximately 5.88 percent of the total portfolio at the time of issuance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The multiplier for each security in the Restructuring Companies Portfolio will generally remain unchanged except for limited adjustments that may be necessary as a result of stock splits or stock dividends. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  There will be no adjustments to the multipliers to reflect cash dividends paid with respect to a portfolio security. In addition, no adjustments of any multiplier of a portfolio security will be made unless such adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the multiplier then in effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Merrill Lynch will adjust the multiplier of any portfolio security if the security is subject to a stock split or reverse split to equal the product of the number of shares issued with respect to one share of the portfolio security and the prior multiplier. In the case of a stock dividend, the multiplier will be adjusted so that the new multiplier will equal the former multiplier plus the product of the number of shares of such portfolio security issued with respect to one share of the portfolio security and the prior multiplier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the issuer of a security included in the Restructuring Companies Portfolio no longer exists, whether for reason of a merger, acquisition or similar type of corporate control transaction, then Merrill Lynch will assign to that security a value equal to the security's final value for the purposes of calculating portfolio values. For example, if a company included in the portfolio is acquired by another company, Merrill Lynch shall thereafter assign a value to the shares of the acquired company's securities equal to the value per share at which time the acquisition takes place. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the issuer of a portfolio security is in the process of liquidation or subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, insolvency, or other similar adjudication, such security will continue to be included in the Restructuring Companies Portfolio so long as a market price on an exchange or through NASDAQ for such security is available. If such a market price is no longer available for a portfolio security, including, but not limited to, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, or any other similar proceeding, then the value of the portfolio security will be assigned a value of zero in connection with calculating the daily portfolio value and the closing portfolio value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio, for so long as no such market price exists for that security. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Merrill Lynch will not attempt to find a replacement stock or to compensate for the extinction of a security due to bankruptcy or a similar event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio will be calculated by an independent third party and will be disseminated through OPRA at least once each minute throughout the trading day. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  The portfolio value will equal the sum of the products of the most recently available market prices and the applicable multipliers for the portfolio securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Amendment No. 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Like other issues of MITTS listed on the NYSE, Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS may not be redeemed prior to maturity and are not callable by the issuer. Holders of Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will be able to cash-out of their investment by selling the security on the NYSE. The Exchange anticipates that the trading value of the security in this secondary trading market will depend in large part on the value of the securities comprising the Restructuring Companies Portfolio and also on such other factors as the level of interest rates, the volatility of the value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio, the time remaining to maturity, dividend rates, and the creditworthiness of the issuer, Merrill Lynch. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Merrill Lynch will deposit registered securities representing Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS with its depository, the Depository Trust Company (``DTC''), so as to permit book-entry settlement of transactions by participants in DTC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS are linked to a portfolio of equity securities, the NYSE's existing equity floor trading rules will apply to the trading of Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS. First, pursuant to NYSE Rule 405, the Exchange will impose a duty of due diligence on its members and member firms to learn the essential facts relating to every customer prior to trading Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  Second, consistent with NYSE Rule 405, the Exchange will further require that a member or member firm specifically approve a customer's account for trading Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS prior to, or promptly after, the completion of the transaction. Third, Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will be subject to the equity margin rules of the Exchange. Fourth, in accordance with the NYSE's Hybrid Approval Orders, the Exchange will, prior to trading Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS, distribute a circular to the membership providing guidance with regard to member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations) when handling transactions in Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS and highlighting the special risks and characteristics of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NYSE Rule 405 requires that every member, member firm or member corporation use due diligence to learn the essential facts relative to every customer and to every order or account accepted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Hybrid Approval Orders,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Commission Findings and Conclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5). Specifically, the Commission believes that providing for exchange-trading of Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will offer a new and innovative means of participating in the market for securities of companies that have either recently restructured or are in the process of restructuring. In particular, the Commission believes that Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will permit investors to gain equity exposure in such companies, while at the same time, limiting the downside risk of the original investment. For the reasons discussed in the MITTS Approval Orders, the Commission finds that the listing and trading of Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS is consistent with the Act. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Mitts Approval Orders,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 8. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

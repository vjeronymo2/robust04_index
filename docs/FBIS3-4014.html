And the municipal Government will also set up a fund to protect  workers against wage defaults.    Official figures show that in the past two years, there have  been 1,100 labour disputes, strikes and go slows, in the Special  Economic Zone. Ninety per cent of these happened in  foreign-owned enterprises and non-government-subvented factories.    In his report to the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference of Shenzhen delivered yesterday, a senior official of  the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) Huang Jinrong,  told deputies that labour disputes not only would continue to  exist, but would appear in new forms with the development of the  market economy.    Mr Huang said that the ACFTU in Shenzhen has planned to  increase the number of unions in foreign owned enterprises, of  which more than 40 per cent should be unionised this year. The  ACFTU also plans to set up a Shenzhen Wage Insurance Fund to  protect workers from wage defaults. And, a certain proportion  of the enterprises' total wages, about one or two months of  workers' salary, would be collected to form this fund, he said.    According to surveys, Mr Huang said that low salaries, poor  social securities, wage defaults, bad monitoring systems and the  divorce of management and practice are the main reasons behind  these conflicts. In May last year, 1,300 workers in a  foreign-owned factory in She Kou went on strike.    Mr Huang said that it was discovered that workers were paid  five to seven yuan (HK$4.44 to HK$6.22) a day, much lower than  the already demeaning stipulated minimum salary of 11.2 yuan a  day. Besides setting up more unions, Mr Huang said that  education for labour legislation should also be strengthened.  And in a bid to keep a closer control and take prompt action to  crack down on disputes, the ACFTU would help public securities  departments to form internal security organisations in larger  enterprises, he said.</p>

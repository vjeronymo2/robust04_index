			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Velayati, speaking before a  gathering of ambassadors, charges d'affaires, and diplomatic  representatives of foreign countries in Tehran today, said that  the double-standard of some countries regarding the ominous  phenomenon of terrorism is an encouragement to the continuation  of organized crime.    According to a report by our correspondent, the foreign  minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran, referring to the  recent horrific crime by the hypocrites added: This catastrophe  is so profound that no free-minded human being can regard it  with indifference.    Velayati described the crime as similar to the one in Hebron  in the occupied Palestine and said: Such terrorist acts against  the great nation of Iran will never shake the determination of  our people in confronting criminals.    Our country's foreign minister also called on the  international community to confront the ominous phenomenon of  terrorism decisively and without a selective approach.    He regretted some of the foreign states' support for the  hypocrites' terrorist group and letting them put propaganda  means at their disposal. He added: Without such support the  bloody catastrophe in Mashhad would not have happened.    According to the same report, after the statement made by  our  country's foreign minister, the Libyan ambassador in Tehran, as  the doyen of ambassadors, expressed regret over that traumatic  incident and considered that terrorist act as a violation of  human rights.</p>

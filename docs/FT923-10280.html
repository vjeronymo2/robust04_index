			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Indonesia's banks await foreign investors - Prospects for an influx of cash into Jakarta's financial sector Indonesian brokers have been on the starting-blocks anticipating a law permitting foreign ownership of bank shares. However, several months after details were agreed by government ministers, the law remains unratified. The anticipated race for shares may now be off, with many brokers advising clients to adopt a wait-and-see approach. The decree will allow foreigners to buy up to 49 per cent of a bank's listed shares. An influx of foreign capital would, government ministers believe, bring stability to the banking sector and act as a catalyst for the Jakarta stock market which has been handicapped by a dearth of liquidity. Listed banks among Indonesia's top 10 private banks in terms of assets include Bank Danamon, Bank International Indonesia, Bank Umum Nas-ional, Bank Dagang National Indonesia, Bank Niaga, Bank Duta, Bank Bali and Lippo Bank. Their combined assets at the end of last year totalled Rp26,100bn (Dollars 13bn). The unexplained delay in the decree has given investors a chance to look closely at the sector and at a number of reports by leading brokers. A report in May by Jardine Fleming Nusantara, the Indonesian subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based Jardine Fleming merchant bank, described the the Indonesian banking system as 'in a period of turmoil (and) consolidation'. The banking sector experienced explosive growth after the government passed a sweeping deregulation package in 1988. Total bank credits rose from Rp44,001bn in 1988 to Rp97,696bn in 1990. In the second quarter of 1990, credit from private banks recorded a year-on-year growth of 120 per cent. Competition between banks - there are some 170 of which 11 are listed - led many to expand beyond their management capability and lend on the back of poor credit analysis. Bank Indonesia, the central bank, estimates the sector's bad and doubtful debts last year at 5.9 per cent of total loans, up from 3.9 per cent in 1990. Private bankers are more pessimistic and estimate the non-performing loans at about 15 per cent of the sector's total portfolio. Donors say the non-performing loans of the five state commercial banks, which account for about half the sector's assets, range between 15 and 25 per cent of their respective portfolios. A recent report by Crosby Securities says: 'The financial health of the leading banks is adequate.' But it warns that 'the profits reported by the banks are flattered by inadequate charges for bad debts'. Potential foreign investors will also be aware of the past record of some banks when disclosing their balance sheets. In 1990 Bank Duta failed to disclose foreign exchange losses of Dollars 419m a few months before going public. Bank Indonesia has since taken steps to curb the sector's worst excesses. Banks have also been struggling to reach a timetable for higher capital adequacy requirements, from 5 per cent of total assets last March to 8 per cent by December next year. Bankers estimate the state banks alone will require up to Dollars 2bn of new capital by the end of next year. But the sector's current difficulties should be placed against a background of continuing macro-economic growth. Gross domestic product rose 6.75 per cent last year and banks will be key beneficiaries of a rise in per capita income which the World Bank forecasts will almost double to Dollars 1,000 by the turn of the century. Continued economic growth should provide the surest means for banks to improve profitability and reduce bad debt. Although this year has been one of consolidation - credit growth is expected to be just 15 per cent - the better managed banks are benefiting from an average 7 per cent spread between deposit and lending rates. Bankers believe many of the listed banks will soon announce rights issues as a means of meeting the capital adequacy targets and improving liquidity. As Mr Phillip Widjaja, vice-president of Bank Bali, said, the decree 'is good news for banks, especially given the capital adequacy regulation. A lot of banks are still undercapitalised'. This may lead many non-listed banks, perhaps even some state banks, to consider a flotation which would present investors with a confusion of choice. Brokers have given a preliminary 'avoid' recommendation to about half the leading listed banks. In the past two months, however, the share prices of these banks have risen on average 20 per cent, while the shares of Bank International Indonesia, which many brokers have recommended as a 'buy', have remained static. The bull market in bank shares has been caused by domestic investors buying in advance of the decree. Brokers say share prices may actually weaken when the market is opened to foreigners. 'The market is likely to be surprised by the lack of foreign interest,' explained one broker. The sector, however, will be difficult for country fund managers to disregard. Banks account for about 10 per cent of the stock market's capitalisation and a balanced Indonesia portfolio will require a stake.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- INDONESIAN BANKS RESULTS FOR 1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Bank                         Bad debt   Pre-tax   Net    Earnings                             provision    profit  profit  per share                              (Rp bn)    (Rp bn)  (Rp bn)   (Rp)  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Bank Ball                      35.7       74.2    51.7      833 Bank Dagang                    23.6       52.6    34.0      250 Bank Danamon                   18.9       45.8    35.6      317 Bank Duta                      25.8       36.0    36.3      258 Bank Niaga                     24.8       27.7    18.1      345 Bank Umum Nasional             25.2       40.0    24.1      246 Bank Intl.

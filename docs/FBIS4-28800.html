			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher agreed  Tuesday that North Korea's decision to quit the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is a matter of deep concern,  officials said.    Kakizawa and Christopher also agreed over the phone that  Pyongyang's decision to leave the IAEA and reject further  inspections of its nuclear facilities is an internationally  unacceptable act, the Foreign Ministry officials said.    They agreed to maintain close contact on the problem.    Pyongyang's action runs counter to international demands to  abide by the nuclear safeguards arrangements and its refusal of  further inspections may make matters worse, the officials quoted  Kakizawa as saying.    Christopher also voiced serious concern and indicated that  the United States may review its stance in the UN discussions on  the North Korean situation, the officials said.    Kakizawa, who visited South Korea and China over the  weekend,  told Christopher he held frank discussions with South Korean  President Kim Yong-sam and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu on the  North Korean nuclear dispute.    The Foreign Minister said he agreed with the South Korean  leaders to maintain bilateral coordination on the issue and to  seek gradual sanctions against Pyongyang.    China is also seriously concerned about the situation,  Kakizawa said. He told Christopher that he urged China to  continue to try to persuade North Korea to change its stance.  The minister said he also asked China to play a positive role  in the UN Security Council regarding the problem.    Kakizawa quoted Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen as  saying Beijing wants to play a constructive role in solving the  North Korean nuclear dispute, the officials said.    Christopher said he will closely watch China's moves.    Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai quoted  Kakizawa as telling Christopher that Japan intends to cope  calmly with the North Korean nuclear problem.    The top government spokesman also told a press conference  that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will talk to U.S. President  Bill Clinton over the telephone, possibly later Tuesday.    The premier will seek to have a "frank" talk with Clinton,  Kumagai said.    Earlier in the day, Hata expressed regret over North Korea's  reported decision.    Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada issued a  statement  Tuesday morning, calling on North Korea to reconsider its  decision.    In Washington, the White House said Clinton talked with  Russian President Boris Yeltsin over the phone about an  international conference on North Korea.    Yeltsin told South Korean President Kim in Moscow on June 2  that Russia, the U.S., Japan, China, the United Nations and the  IAEA should join North and South Korea in holding a conference  to defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis.    At the UN in New York, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright  told reporters the U.S. will submit a sanctions resolution to  the UN Security Council in the next couple of days.</p>

Lacalle termed his meeting with Clinton -- his first ever --  as "brief, but all in all, most satisfactory."    During a news conference later, the Uruguayan head of state  commented that the "scope" of Clinton's letter convening the  Miami summit next December is unprecedented because  "nongovernmental interest groups are invited to participate and  hold meetings."    He said: "If integration between intermediate sectors of our  society is achieved between now and December, the summit will be  a meeting of nations, to which governments will contribute by  applying the political and legal wrappings to something prepared  from the grassroots."    Lacalle praised Clinton's idea of relating the struggle to  "achieve prosperity with the strengthening of the democratic  system in the entire western hemisphere."    He said he was convinced that "even though the GATT trade  talks unfortunately failed to meet all our expectations, I have  no doubt whatsoever that trade links between countries of the  hemisphere will be strengthened."    "The integration of the Americas will be achieved in due  time  -- perhaps not in the near future, but certainly in the  foreseeable future," he said. To attain this, it is important  to "further the parallel development of integration processes  like the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and NAFTA."    Lacalle praised Clinton's endeavors, as he "campaigned for  NAFTA with intelligence, boldness, and zeal -- which met with  Latin American approval."    The head of state declined to discuss who his country will  vote for at the forthcoming elections for the OAS General  Secretariat.    "Uruguay will not voice its opinion. We have already  decided, but we would rather not make it public until we are  further enlightened through future negotiations," he noted.    The president stated that Uruguay is in favor of settling  the  issue by consensus rather than having an all-out struggle at the  polls. He believes the new secretary general will thus have  greater support.    Regarding the possibility of Cuba joining the OAS, Lacalle  said: "Unless the Cuban Government changes its position," this  is most unlikely.    Lastly, commenting on the elections that will soon be held  in  his country, the head of state said: "There is special interest  in hearing the proposals of the opposition because the proposals  we submitted to Congress concerning state-owned enterprises and  health care were voted down."    Concerning the government's economic policy, Lacalle  asserted  that the important "adjustments" implemented were always  accompanied by "a far-reaching social policy."    Lacalle is on a private visit to Washington, where he will  be  presented with an award by the AIPAC [American Israel Public  Affairs Committee] (a pro-Israel lobby that gives annual awards  to people who champion the cause of Israel and the Jewish  people).</p>

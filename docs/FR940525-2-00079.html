			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The applicant notes that while the Plan held the Mobile Home Loans, the Lorenzos and the Grubers were occasionally delinquent. However, the applicant explains that, in all instances, the borrowers quickly corrected these delinquencies and the loans were current at the time of the sale transaction described herein. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Plan received total investment income of $14,423 in connection with its investment in the Mobile Home Loans. The Plan also paid servicing fees to SAC with respect to the administration of the Mobile Home Loans. Such servicing fees were based on the receipt of a flat 11 percent interest rate. Income received above that rate was retained by SAC. Through December 31, 1988, the Plan recorded servicing fees of $1,571. Following this date, the reporting system was changed and the only entries that appeared were recordings of net interest income received by the Plan. No other fees were paid by the Plan in connection with this investment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A $1,003,958 Investment in a Package of Residential Mortgage Loans (the Residential Mortgage Loans). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 4,L2,tp0,i1,s10,10,10,10 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=3 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Loan <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Amount of investment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Income received <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Servicing fees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=3 --> 20 Loans  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $1,003,958  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $265,837  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $11,090 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

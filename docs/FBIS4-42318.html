			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen by </F> Dirk Koch and Klaus Wirtgen; place and date not given:  "Red-Green Does Not Frighten" -- ellipses as published]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Verheugen, do you think that the  offended reaction of leading Social Democrats, particularly  Rudolf Scharping, to Johannes Rau's defeat in the presidential  elections is a good strategy for recruiting new voters?    [Verheugen] Our reaction was well-considered. We had enough  time to think about it....    [DER SPIEGEL] ...because you knew long before the elections  that Rau would not win....    [Verheugen] ...we did not know it, but we had to assume a  defeat as being realistic. I am sure that the media criticism  of our reaction and what the people are thinking are two  different things. I think it is necessary to tell those who  want to preserve our state's liberal face that the Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] is not available for this, but  the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is indeed.    [DER SPIEGEL] Why do you accuse the FDP of having been  consistently loyal to the coalition?    [Verheugen] The FDP deceived the public. Even in the days  and hours before the Federal Convention met, Messrs. Kinkel and  Solms gave the impression that the FDP was free to decide in  favor of the candidate who was best suited in the view of  liberal party. In reality, the FDP was not free. I assume  Kinkel had promised the chancellor to vote for Herzog long ago.  On the other hand, the allegedly liberal party is failing in  its own claim if it votes for the one candidate out of four who  is the only one who cannot be called liberal.    [DER SPIEGEL] As former FDP secretary general, can you  imagine the price that the Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Social Union [CDU/CSU] had to pay for this voting behavior by  its coalition partner?    [Verheugen] Yes, the at least silent tolerance of a second  vote campaign for the Bundestag elections. And this will come  with absolute certainty, because the FDP is now approaching zero  in the polls.    [DER SPIEGEL] Since last week, the loser Johannes Rau,  looking very thoughtful, can be seen on the poster for the  European elections. Is the appeal "revenge for Rau" supposed to  make undecided voters enthusiastic for the SPD?    [Verheugen] Our strategy is focused on the up to 40 percent  of voters who are undecided, and there are also those who do not  yet know whether they are going to vote at all. They see things  differently than you do. The majority of them wanted Rau. We  are bringing to the fore the discrepancy between the will of the  majority of the people and the existing conditions of power,  which we want to change.    [DER SPIEGEL] And these arguments are supposed to strengthen  the SPD after the meager 33.5 percent in 1990? This looks more  like therapy for the loser than like a recipe for success.    [Verheugen] Don't worry. We will not replace our election  topics with the discussion about the presidential elections.  This topic will disappear within a relatively short period.  However, we should be driven out of the Erich Ollenhauer House  if now, after Rau is again available as a party politician, we  were to hide a man with his reputation and his popularity in the  final stage of the European election campaign.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is the SPD's course of cozying up to those in  power now over?    [Verheugen] We are not cozying up; we want to replace this  government. Things are now getting really exciting. The  conflict will escalate. This is necessary. The voters must  realize why they should vote for another party. After all, the  SPD must make a number of voters vote differently at the next  Bundestag election than at the last election. For this purpose,  the differences must become clear. The party's profile must be  worked out quite clearly.    [DER SPIEGEL] This has not been done so far.    [Verheugen] I think this is wrong. I was unhappy about a  few things in the recent past. I have been most unhappy about  the course of the program discussion. It is conceived as the  substantiation of a large reform project, for modernization and  renewal. The program was not taken because of one or two  conventional issues. It was wrongly defamed as a program of  adjustment and the blurring of Social Democratic positions.    [DER SPIEGEL] Well, perhaps the paper is not worth much?    [Verheugen] The program is a draft that counters the policy  of the current government. It provides the justification why we  are making the claim to a change in power and it justifies this  claim in terms of issues. After all, it is not enough to say in  a democracy that it is good if power changes every few years.    [DER SPIEGEL] SPD Chairman Scharping in particular has done  more to rid the citizens of the fear of a change than to explain  to them the different policy of an SPD-led government.    [Verheugen] This is true to the extent that we have to  fulfill a complicated dual task. We must free the citizens who  have not voted for the SPD so far of the fear that an SPD  Government -- I am deliberately exaggerating -- will open up a  new chapter in the text books of Marxist Socialism. Therefore,  over the past months, we have concentrated very strongly on  social, economic, and internal security. And we must convince  those who call for a fundamental change in policy. I cite  topics such as ecological change, the reform of state and  administration, and the correction of social imbalances. We  must live up to both demands. We have decided to do one thing  after the other.    [DER SPIEGEL] "Safety Instead of Fear" is the slogan; and  the SPD poster show a floating boat with father and son, both of  whom are asleep. Where are they floating to -- perhaps to power  in the Federal Government?    [Verheugen] This is a completely impermissible exaggeration.  The poster transposes a political demand into an image; nothing  else.    [DER SPIEGEL] The slogan sounds as defensive as the picture  looks sleepy.    [Verheugen] I think "Safety Instead of Fear" is an  aggressive formula: The policy of the current government causes  fear. The whitewashing of the government and the media that are  kindly disposed toward it does not change anything about the  dramatic unemployment, the gigantic debts, and the social  injustice.    [DER SPIEGEL] In contrast to your advice, Mr. Verheugen, the  SPD has not managed to rid the people of the fear of higher  taxes.    [Verheugen] We had to comment on the supplementary tax,  which is supposed to replace the government's solidarity  surcharge -- better early than too late before the elections.  By the way, it means less tax for more than 80 percent of the  tax payers, not higher taxes. Our central statement for the  next years is: No higher tax quota with the SPD, but  redistribution.    [DER SPIEGEL] This does not reassure those citizens who are  afraid of a higher payroll tax and more expansive gasoline.    [Verheugen] This is correct. Since 1982 the Kohl government  has put a burden on medium and smaller incomes to ease the  burden on top earners and companies; here corrections are  necessary -- therefore, we want the supplementary tax only for  single people with incomes of 60,000 German marks [DM] and  couples with incomes of DM120,000; therefore we want tax  exemption for the subsistence level; therefore we want a limit  to the advantage of tax splitting, therefore, we want a DM250  children's allowance for everyone.    [DER SPIEGEL] Why was the SPD suddenly frightened when  Scharping spoke of burdens for high-wage earners? That is,  after all, the point.    [Verheugen] The concept of who is a high-wage earner in  Germany differs so much that this term cannot be used  politically. We did not use it, either.    [DER SPIEGEL] This Social Democratic confusion of language  has contributed to attacks on the SPD from all sides. The  economic associations, by whose support your party leaders felt  flattered for a long time, accuse the SPD of a mentality of  redistribution. "I do not know where Mr. Scharping wants to get  to. I do not know why he is actually in politics," Frankfurt  functionary Tom Koenigs, a Green reform politician, said.    [Verheugen] The reaction by some representatives of industry  is not typical for the general mood. Party followers have taken  a stand here. Just let them continue. When they tried it the  last time, in 1972, the SPD got its greatest victory. That Mr.  Koenigs is not interested in saying anything positive about  Scharping is quite obvious. As regards the program: You may  well trust us to streamline the reform projects contained in it  in such a way that they become unmistakable.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is it not already too late? At the moment, it  looks as if Chancellor Kohl has turned the negative trend around.    [Verheugen] Don't make me laugh. For more than half a year  there has been no poll that gives the coalition more than 43  percent of the votes. Shifts to the benefit of the CDU take  place at the cost of the FDP. Just wait for the upcoming  discussions, when unemployment once again raises by 400,000 to  500,000 on annual average, when the people realize that DM1 out  of DM4 in the federal budget must be spent on interest and the  repayment of debts.    [DER SPIEGEL] What would the SPD have to offer in detail for  the first 100 days of its government?    [Verheugen] Purposeful investment promotion for job creation  measures, relieving labor of taxes and contributions, more  flexible work times, and more intensified labor promotion.    [DER SPIEGEL] This means primarily redistribution of  existing work, not stimuli for growth.    [Verheugen] No, the point is growth and consolidation. We  want to profoundly transform our economy and society through  ecological change. Saying simply that we need growth is  nonsense, because we will not be able to ecologically tolerate  purely quantitative growth at the level that would be necessary  to combat unemployment. Therefore, the SPD will not agree to a  return to nuclear energy. I can compare such a social change  only with Willy Brandt's great reform project in 1969.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do these prospects for reform not  automatically result in a preference for a red-green coalition?  Or do you think that you can implement the ecological change  more easily in a grand coalition or in an SPD-FDP-Greens  coalition?    [Verheugen] If a coalition is necessary, I would prefer a  small one, just two parties. The SPD-FDP-Greens coalition is  not a tempting idea at the federal level. We have already said  we do not want a grand coalition. I think we cannot -- which  will be the case -- wage the election struggle claiming it is  time for a change and then include in the government the very  people whose politics we want to change. This would make us  lose our credibility.    [DER SPIEGEL] Does a party that wants to bring about a  change in power with reforms need a trademark, in this case a  coalition statement in favor of red-green?    [Verheugen] In any case, for a reform-oriented policy we  need a majority that is ready for reforms. A clear policy  automatically gets its majority. I am firmly convinced that  this will also happen after this Bundestag election.    [DER SPIEGEL] Does the idea of a red-green coalition still  give rise to fear in the bourgeois camp?    [Verheugen] I assume that red-green no longer frightens  anyone at the federal level, either. This is quite clearly  shown by election results and polls. We have good reasons to  want an election result that offers us options. Which option is  then chosen depends on how we can best implement our policy.    [DER SPIEGEL] Can you think of reforms that would be easier  to implement with the FDP than with the Greens?    [Verheugen] If I look at the current Bundestag group and at  the FDP leadership, I do not see at all where one can still  expect any readiness for reform in this party. However, one  must not forget: The most important thing for the FDP is  participation in government. Being the second or third  strongest opposition party would be an existential risk for it.  This might force the FDP to pay high prices for participating  in an SPD-led government. The ecological changes could  certainly be implemented more easily with the Greens. However,  they too must move from unrealistic positions.    [DER SPIEGEL] Can you imagine that the FDP might get enough  votes for a majority with the SPD but not with the CDU/CSU in  the autumn?    [Verheugen] At the moment I see the FDP somewhere on the  fringe. I do not even see it back in the Bundestag. The second  vote campaign of the FDP, which I assumed will be at the cost of  the CDU/CSU, and raises our prospects for becoming the strongest  party. Purely in terms of numbers, neither of the two people's  parties currently has the opportunity for a coalition with the  FDP. However, this is really bad only for Kohl. He can no  longer assemble a majority.    [DER SPIEGEL] How long do you want to keep your voters  waiting?    [Verheugen] We will begin the hot stage of the Bundestag  election campaign with a Germany meeting on 4 September. There  we will present our 100-day program. The better we streamline  our goals there, the easier it will be to answer the coalition  question -- which will, in the end, practically answer itself.    [DER SPIEGEL] Your chairman, Scharping, is burdened with the  image of being respectable but boring. Is he the candidate for  reforms and visions?    [Verheugen] Does Helmut Kohl have charisma? In any case, he  won elections. Rudolf Scharping has those qualities that an SPD  candidate for the chancellor's office needs in 1994 in order to  win the elections. An election year like this one has its very  own drama. In the end, one must still have enough breath for  the final effort.    [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Verheugen, thank you for this interview.</p>

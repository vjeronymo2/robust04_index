			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Death duties paid in full Sir, 'Funeral wishes ignored' (Q&amp;A: December 3/4) mulled over the funeral directors' dilemma as to whether the deceased's instructions, or those of his executors, should be followed concerning the funeral arrangements and church service. This brings to mind an aggrieved taxpayer's instructions that he should be cremated and his ashes sent to the Collector of Taxes with a note: 'Now you've had the lot.' AD Foreman, partner, Pannell Kerr Forster, New Garden House, 78 Hatton Garden, London EC1N 8JA</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: MCCARTY PUSHES HIS PROJECT IN DENVER  </P> <P> What's Michael McCarty up to now? As he awaits hoped-for approval from Santa  Monica voters this November to get on with his long-delayed luxury beachfront  hotel project, he is simultaneously attempting to buy the entire Tivoli retail  complex in Denver -- site of his Adirondacks restaurant in that city.  </P> <P> There have long been rumors that his Denver outpost was in financial trouble  and was for sale. On the contrary, says McCarty, "The Tivoli is just about to  really happen. There's a big college complex there with about 35,000 students  within walking distance. The city has just built new freeway on- and off-ramps  right there, the 16th Street mall bus is extending its route to come all the  way to the Tivoli, and there's going to be free shuttle service from downtown.  Besides that, the new Denver convention center just opened about two blocks  away -- and the city just got a bond issue approved to build a new baseball  stadium practically across the street."  </P> <P> If McCarty's buyout attempt is successful -- the price tag has been estimated  at between $13 and $18 million -- he plans to eliminate all retail business in  the complex, with the possible exceptions of a music/video store and a  bookshop, and turn the Tivoli into a restaurant and entertainment center  instead. Besides Adirondacks, Tivoli has a diner, a disco, a hot dog and  hamburger place, and a Morton's of Chicago restaurant. "In addition," McCarty  says, "we want to put in a 12-plex theater, a country-and-Western bar, a sports  bar, a Mexican concept, an Italian concept, a bakery. It'll all be big, fun,  easy."  </P> <P> ADIOS: Sabroso in Venice will close Oct. 15th. It's the old story, says  proprietor Jeanine Coyle: "Our lease ran out, and the rent increase was more  than the restaurant could bear." Although she has tried to find another  reasonably priced location in the same area, she adds, her attempts have been  unsuccessful thus far and she has no plans to reopen at this time.  </P> <P> THE SALTY COD: I am in receipt of a do-it-yourself press release from an  organization calling itself Les Chevaliers de Morue -- which translates roughly  as The Knights of Salt Cod. It reads in part: "A fistful of soggy fish sticks  to I Cugini (in Santa Monica) for having taken its salt cod and goat cheese  pizza off the menu! One of the few salt cod dishes appearing on any menu in Los  Angeles, this delicious preparation might have earned new fans for this most  wonderful of fish. Why was it stricken from the menu? Because not many people  ordered it? So what? For heaven's sakes, Cugini people, it's not as if salt cod  spoils!"  </P> <P> DINING CALENDAR: Campanile hosts a "Celebration of the Olive" this Wednesday to  honor Italy's Countess Romana Bicocchi Pichi, producer of the Tuscan olive oil,  Tenuta del Numerouno. The five-course olive-oil-based meal is $48 per person,  food only. For reservations call (213) 938-1447. . . . The Electric Palate Food  &amp; Wine Society hosts a "gourmet dinner" at Tribeca in Beverly Hills on  Monday, Oct. 15, at 7:30 p.m. The five-course menu will be accompanied by wines  from Sterling, and a guest expert will discuss each wine as it is served.

Also on the night of Oct. 16, George's of the Cove in La  Jolla, Scoma's in San Francisco, and Bayside 240 at the Portofino Inn in  Redondo Beach are among 10 California restaurants preparing their versions of  cioppino, at the second annual Cio-Pinot cook-off and tasting at the Olde Port  Inn in Avila Beach.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Reliable sources in Aden have told AL-ITTIHAD that  the Yemeni president yesterday telephoned southern leader 'Ali  Salim al-Bid and asked for an unconditional cease-fire.    Another source in the Socialist Party has also said that  Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, the deputy prime minister in the Sanaa  government, who is currently in Paris, the night before last  telephoned some Socialist Party leaders in Aden asking them to  approve a cease-fire and start immediate negotiations in Paris  between Sanaa and Aden (three people from each party). The  source said Aden does not object to a cease-fire and  negotiations, on the condition that Sanaa withdraws all of its  troops from the south.</p>

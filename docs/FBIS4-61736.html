			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow May 9 TASS -- Several dozen thousand  Muscovites and guests from other cities and republics of the  former Soviet Union gathered on Moscow's Poklonny Hill on Monday  to pay tribute to the memory of Russia's soldiers who lost their  lives defending freedom and peace in the World War Two.    The ceremony, which began with an inauguration of a new  World  War Two museum, was attended by Russian President Boris Yeltsin,  Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov and  other high-ranking Russian officials.    Yeltsin made a speech and laid a wreath at the war memorial.  He also met with war veterans to thank them for their heroism  and wish them good health and prosperity.    In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Yeltsin  said that "all this can be considered as a whole: the present  celebrations, the upcoming 50th anniversary of the victory and  the signing of the memorandum on civic peace and accord. All  this raises people's mood and, as a result, there is less and  less animosity against each other."    "I assess what is going on now very highly," Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told ITAR-TASS. The signing of the  memorandum and the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the  victory over the Nazi aim at forging unity in the country. "We  must work for unity, so that we had a normal country and could  live a normal life," he said.    "Such great anniversary unites people," Yeltsin's chief of  staff Sergey Filatov said. As never before Russia needs  consensus. Today's festivities are in harmony with the  memorandum of civic peace and accord, he continued. "People are  beginning to calm down and to believe that we will be able to  resolve this situation, avoiding civil conflicts," Filatov said.    "I believe that this is not an ordinary holiday, but a sign  of a breakthrough in what is happening in Russia," Russian  Vice-Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays said. He stressed that  there cannot be economic breakthrough without a psychological  and moral breakthroughs.</p>

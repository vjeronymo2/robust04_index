			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT'S $1-MILLION PUMP  </P> <P> The recent article (Jan. 15) regarding the purchase of new pumps and valves to  speed the collection of storm water runoff missed the mark.  </P> <P> To imply that the Orange County Water District bought equipment based on an  error-filled report misleads the public into thinking that a poor public policy  decision was made by the district's staff and board.  </P> <P> Nothing could be further from the truth. The district made a decision to select  this equipment from one manufacturer in keeping with sound public policy based  on saving the public money. Timely installation of the pumps during the rainy  season can potentially save the district hundreds of thousands of dollars by  capturing high-quality storm runoff from the Santa Ana River. The errors in the  decision report were minor, inadvertent and inconsequential. They had no  bearing on the decision to select the pumps. The manufacturer is the industry  leader in constructing a complicated piece of equipment, critical to the  efficient operation of the district.  </P> <P> It is not uncommon for competitors to second-guess and complain about not being  selected for a particular piece of work, and this seems to be what happened  here. Orange County Water District enjoys a national reputation for innovation  based on good public policy to provide ample high-quality water at the lowest  possible price. The decision to select these pumps and valves is consistent  with this policy.  </P> <P> WILLIAM R. MILLS JR.  </P> <P> General Manager, Orange County Water District  </P></p>

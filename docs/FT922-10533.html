			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / MPs see scope for cut in fighter order THE UK could reduce its purchases of the planned European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) from the present target of 250 in order to limit the cost of the programme, the Commons defence committee suggested yesterday. Its report, which also raised the issue of whether the Royal Air Force still needed such a high-performance aircraft, is likely to add to the uncertainty surrounding the project. The four-nation fighter is expected to figure prominently in talks in Bonn today between Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, and Mr Volker Ruhe, his German counterpart. The meeting will take place amid continuing widespread opposition to the fighter in Germany. The next few months will be crucial for its future as the partner nations - Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain - prepare to move from development to the investment needed for production. Total costs for the UK on current plans are put at Pounds 20bn for the whole life of the aircraft. The RAF said yesterday it still had 'firm plans' for 250 aircraft, the level set for the UK when development began in 1988. It wants to use the aircraft not only to replace its Phantoms and Jaguars, as originally planned, but also as an eventual substitute for the long-range air-defence version of the Tornado. However, studies are still going on at the MoD on the size of the purchase. Officials said final numbers would become clearer towards the end of the year. Germany, Italy and Spain are all expected to reduce their purchases. If the UK cut its requirement to 200, the total might fall to fewer than 600 compared with the planned 765. That would, however, be more than the total of 400 to 450 seen by the MoD as a minimum for economic production. The committee said that when the government decided about the project, it should take into account the aircraft's importance for UK high-technology industries. 'It remains open to question how far the RAF still requires an aircraft with the full level of performance offered by EFA,' the MPs said. But they added that there was no alternative to EFA that offered the same level of performance at an acceptable cost with anything approaching comparable technological benefits. While no defence programme costing Pounds 20bn could be described as cheap, EFA should be 'substantially more economic' than its competitors, the MPs commented. German withdrawal would be 'a grave setback', although the project could survive, they added. European Fighter Aircraft. HMSO. Pounds 11.85.</p>

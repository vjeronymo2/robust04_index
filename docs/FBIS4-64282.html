			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks as received] </F>   [Text] "I think that we have reached agreement over the  program," said Forza Italia Leader Silvio Berlusconi following a  four-hour meeting with the National Alliance leaders Gianfranco  Fini and Giuseppe Tatarella, and the Northern League's leaders  Umberto Bossi and Roberto Maroni. The newly appointed prime  minister stressed: "We discussed the program, not ministries.  The government is being formed under favorable auspices."    "There are no plans" to widen the majority. Ministries will  be discussed next week.    Berlusconi added: "I do not think that Bossi is going to set  conditions concerning the choice of ministers."</p>

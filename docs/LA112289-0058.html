			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNION VOTE BY CEMETERY WORKERS UPHELD;  </P> <P> LABOR: PANEL RULES AGAINST THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHDIOCESE, WHICH CLAIMED THAT  THE WORKERS HAD BEEN INTIMIDATED BY ORGANIZERS.  </P> <P> Organized labor won a small but bitter struggle against the normally  sympathetic Roman Catholic Archdiocese in Los Angeles on Tuesday when a  three-member panel upheld the results of an election in which 128 archdiocese  cemetery workers narrowly voted for union representation.  </P> <P> The panel, whose members were selected by the archdiocese and the Amalgamated  Clothing and Textile Workers Union, ruled 2 to 1 in favor of February's vote in  which cemetery workers voted 66 to 62 to join the union.  </P> <P> The dispute has been watched closely because Archbishop Roger M. Mahony -- for  decades a supporter of the labor movement on issues such as unionization of  farm workers and raising the state's minimum wage -- had lobbied hard against  unionization of the largely Latino work force at 10 cemeteries.  </P> <P> Before the vote, Mahony spoke personally to many of the workers, arguing that  unionization was not necessary because improvements in working conditions had  been made. After the vote, the archbishop accused textile union organizers of  using "confrontational methods" and said some cemetery workers had been  threatened and intimidated.  </P> <P> Mahony maintained that, despite his stand, he remains a labor sympathizer. But  relationships between the archdiocese and local labor leaders grew strained.  Last summer Mahony decided that he would not address the annual Labor Day  breakfast of the Catholic Labor Institute, breaking with years of tradition.  </P> <P> At the breakfast labor leaders declined to read a written statement submitted  by Mahony in which he said "no one has benefited from this time of tension" and  hoped for "the restoration of that unique friendship between us."  </P> <P> The union election was conducted under the auspices of the state Mediation and  Conciliation Service with an agreement that if the results were disputed, they  would be resolved by a three-member "agreement committee" headed by Fred  Alvarez, a San Francisco attorney who often represents management in labor  relations matters.  </P> <P> Alvarez and David Sickler, an AFL-CIO regional director, found that while the  organizing campaign included "some widely circulated inappropriate appeals,"  including several attempts at intimidation by pro-union cemetery workers, it  was not "permeated by confusion, fear or threats of violence such that the  atmosphere rendered a fair election impossible."  </P> <P> Ralph Kennedy, an attorney and former National Labor Relations Board regional  director, dissented. "Employees were threatened with physical assaults,  discharge, layoff . . . and complaints to the United States Immigration Service  because they did not support the union," he wrote. "The majority opinion, like  the conduct it condones, is outrageous."  </P> <P> Barbara Mejia, manager of the textile union's California joint board, said she  looks forward "to meeting with Archbishop Mahony as soon as possible to start  negotiations -- and to begin the healing process."  </P> <P> Efforts to reach Mahony or a representative of the archdiocese for comment were  unsuccessful.  </P> <P> Both sides in the dispute agreed that many of the improvements in wages and  medical benefits originally sought by the union have been made by the  archdiocese since the organizing campaign began more than 18 months ago. Mejia  attributed that to union pressure and said her goal now is to adopt a contract  that "locks in what the workers currently have."  </P></p>

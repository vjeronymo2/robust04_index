			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> BETTER SUPERCONDUCTORS  </P> <P> Researchers increased a hundredfold the amount of electricity that could be  carried by crystals of superconducting material, boosting hopes for making the  materials practical, scientists say.  </P> <P> The work indicates a solution is possible for one obstacle to making  high-temperature superconductors carry useful amounts of current, said  researcher Robert B. van Dover of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill,  N.J., where the research was done in conjunction with Swedish scientists.  </P> <P> Superconductors are materials that carry electricity without resistance. All  those discovered so far must be chilled to work.  </P> <P> In recent years, scientists have created high-temperature superconductors, so  named because they require less chilling than previously known materials. They  want to use these new materials in such applications as high-power magnets,  high-speed trains and devices for storing electrical power.  </P> <P> The researchers bombarded a crystal of superconducting material with neutrons,  tiny particles that make up parts of atoms. The crystal could then carry about  100 times the current that untreated crystals could without losing  superconductivity, they found.  </P></p>

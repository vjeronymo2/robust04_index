			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong Province, a  pilot in reforms and opening up, scored a stable economic growth  in the first four months of 1994, the provincial statistics  bureau reported yesterday.    The province manufactured 115.9 billion yuan-worth of goods  during the January-April period, up 19 percent from the same  period in 1993, a bureau official said.    The market continued to be brisk, with retail sales soaring  32.5 percent during that period to reach 51.9 billion yuan, he  said.    Exports shot up 120 percent to 11.47 billion U.S. dollars in  the first four months of this year.    Meanwhile, Guangdong attracted 3.19 billion dollars in  overseas investment during this period, up nearly 37 percent  from the same period in 1993.    The official listed the following figures to illustrate  Guangdong's economic achievements during the January-April  period:    -- The number of construction projects undertaken was 464  fewer than in the same period of 1993 as a result of efforts to  control excessive investment in fixed assets;    -- The amount of cargo transported climbed 28 percent to  nearly 92 million tons; and    -- Electricity production shot up 42 percent to 21.4 billion  kwh.    Furthermore, inflation has been curbed, the official said.    The increase in the price index rose 19.6 percent in April,  five percentage points lower than in both March and February.</p>

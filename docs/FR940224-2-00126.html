			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Business Conduct Committee of the NASD (``NBCC'') is composed of participating members of the first year class of the NASD Board of Governors (``Board'') plus an elected Chair and Vice-Chair from the Board's second year class. The members of the NBCC are sent a weekly package (``weekly mailings'') for review on proposed Acceptance, Waiver, and Consents (``AWCs''), Minor Rule Violations Letters, and Offers of Settlement. The NBCC also reviews, on a weekly basis, all disciplinary decisions of the District Business Conduct Committees and the Market Surveillance Committee. All matters are first reviewed by the Chair and Vice-Chair of the NBCC and then reviewed by the other members of the NBCC along with the recommendations of the Chair and Vice-Chair. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD has determined that the weekly mailings to the NBCC require a substantial commitment of time of NBCC members and that the review by NBCC members of all the foregoing matters is unnecessary and unduly burdensome. In order to reduce the amount of materials which must be read by NBCC members, the NASD proposes to amend Article II, Sections 10(a), 10(b), and 11(e) <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  of the Code of Procedure (``Code'') to allow the NBCC to designate a Subcommittee composed of members of the NBCC to review AWCs, Minor Rule Violations Letters, and Offers of Settlement in all instances other than matters that are outside the NASD Sanction Guidelines <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  or where the designated Subcommittee, in its discretion, otherwise believes full NBCC review is appropriate. The NASD intends that, initially, the Subcommittee designated by the Committee will consist of the Committee Chair and Vice-Chair, but may modify the composition of the Subcommittee in the future., <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NASD Manual, Code of Procedure, Article II, Sections 10(a), 10(b), and 11(e), (CCH) &para;&para; 3030, 3031. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD Sanction Guidelines were published in May 1993 and sent to all NASD members,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  NASD Regulatory &amp; Compliance ALERT, Volume 7, No. 2 (June 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD is, therefore, proposing to amend Article II, Sections 10(a) and 10(b) of the Code, to allow acceptance and rejections of AWCs and Minor Rule Violations Letters to be made by a Subcommittee designated by the NBCC as an alternative to full NBCC review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD is also proposing to amend Article II, section 11(e) of the Code to allow acceptances and rejections of Offers of Settlement to be made by a Subcommittee designated by the NBCC as an alternative to full NBCC review. The NASD is also proposing to delete the phrase ``by a majority vote'' from Article II, section 11(e) of the Code. The NASD considers the phrase ``by a majority vote'' to be confusing since a majority vote is always required by an NASD review body acting pursuant to the Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(8) of the Act in that the proposed rule change provides for fair procedures for the disciplining of members and persons associated with members. The proposal enhances the NASD's disciplinary procedures with respect to AWCs, Minor Rule Violations Letters, and Offers of Settlement by facilitating the review of such matters by the NBCC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments were neither solicited nor received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III.

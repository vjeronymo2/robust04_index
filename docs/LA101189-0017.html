			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSIAL BILLBOARDS TO COME DOWN;  </P> <P> FIRM PLANNING PROJECTS NEAR AGOURA HILLS TO FORCE REMOVAL  </P> <P> A company that wants to build two major projects near Agoura Hills is  terminating the leases of four billboards just outside the city, forcing the  removal of the signs by the end of the year, a representative of the firm said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The removal of billboards along the Ventura Freeway has been a major issue for  the town's City Council. Agoura Hills officials are seeking a "scenic highway"  designation for the freeway.  </P> <P> The company, Potomac Investment Associates, is proposing to build 94 estate  homes and nearly 1 million square feet of commercial space on 474 acres north  of the freeway and just east of the city's boundary at Chesebro Road.  </P> <P> Peter N. Kyros Jr., Potomac's general counsel, said the termination of the  billboard leases was not related to the company's discussions with the city  about having it annex the land from Los Angeles County and approving the  development.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'More Valuable'  </P> <P> "The issue is the billboards are unsightly, and removing the billboards is more  valuable than the income they produce," Kyros said.  </P> <P> "Whether or not we annex to Agoura Hills, we're right next to Agoura Hills and  expect to be good neighbors, and we don't think the billboards on the property  enhance the neighborhood."  </P> <P> City Council members reacted happily to news of the decision.  </P> <P> "I think that's wonderful," Mayor Darlene McBane said. "Four fewer billboards  will certainly improve the scenic quality of the area."  </P> <P> "I'm not going to second-guess his motives," Councilwoman Fran Pavley said,  "but regardless of whether his project gains approval, whether it's through the  city or Los Angeles County, the billboards will be gone, and we do appreciate  that."  </P> <P> Potomac acquired the land in 1988 from Encino realtor Jerry Y. Oren. The  company also has proposed a controversial 2,300-acre project at Jordan Ranch in  Ventura County, just north of Agoura Hills. Ventura County officials have yet  to decide on that proposal.  </P> <P> The four billboards were making several thousand dollars a month in rent, Kyros  said. He would not be more specific. The leases were held by 3M National  Advertising Co., which will have to remove the billboards by Jan. 1, Kyros  said. A 3M official could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

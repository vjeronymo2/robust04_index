			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: UPI finds a new buyer UNITED Press International, the financially troubled news agency, said last night it had found a new buyer to replace Mr Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who cancelled plans to acquire UPI on Wednesday. Mr Steve Geimann, the executive editor of UPI, said the agency would therefore not have to shut down - as threatened - at midnight tonight. . UPI named Mr Leon Charney, an attorney and former President Carter adviser, as the potential buyer. Mr Robertson, who runs the Christian Broadcasting Network, withdrew his Dollars 6m bid for UPI because he claimed he would have had to spend Dollars 31m over the next 18 months to make the news agency viable. Although the prospect of a television preacher acquiring a news agency might have seemed odd, UPI had no other bidders before Mr Robertson. UPI last year filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law.</p>

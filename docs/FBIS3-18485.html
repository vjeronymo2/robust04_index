			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Kevin Done report: "EU and Tokyo Close on Vehicle Import </F> Numbers"]    [Text] Brussels -- The European Commission and the  Japanese Government are close to agreeing a forecast for new  vehicle sales in the European Union [EU], which would leave the  level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU virtually unchanged  from last year.    The Commission is optimistic that last year's prolonged  conflict over the level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU  can be avoided.    The latest round of talks, which ended in Tokyo at the  weekend, had shown for the first time that little divided the  forecasts of the two sides, Mr Martin Bangemann, European  industry commissioner, said yesterday.    The EU expected new vehicle demand in West Europe to remain  virtually unchanged at last year's very depressed level, said Mr  Bangemann, while the Japanese Ministry of International Trade  and Industry, was forecasting modest growth of up to 3 percent.    The EU market for cars and light commercial vehicles fell by  15.9 percent to 11.739 million last year, the steepest decline  of the postwar period.    In its original estimates last year Tokyo had refused to  accept gloomy European forecasts of a steep fall in sales and  was then forced to curtail exports drastically last autumn to  bring shipments in line with the 1991 EU/Japan accord on  Japanese vehicle sales in the Union.    Direct Japanese vehicle exports to the EU fell last year by  18.4 percent to 980,000 units. The Commission expects a second  round of talks with Tokyo to be held in mid-March.    Addressing a European car industry forum organised by the  Commission and the European Parliament, Mr Bangemann gave his  clear backing yesterday for a continuation of the current  controversial "block exemption" for the motor industry, which  allows carmakers to use a selective distribution system with  exclusive dealers in breach of European competition law.    The 10-year block exemption is due to expire in mid-1995,  and  the Commission is still divided over whether to accept the motor  industry's demand for the selective distribution system to  continue.    Mr Bangemann said that the system played an important role  in  the monitoring of Japanese vehicle sales in the EU. "On no  account should this be endangered," he said.    He also dismissed arguments from European consumer  organisations that the system was responsible for high car  prices in the EU.    "I do not believe that getting rid of the selective and  exclusive distribution system would lead to more choice and  lower prices -- but just the reverse," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- A government advisory tax  panel is inclined to present concrete tax rates and other  figures in its report scheduled to be issued in June, a senior  panel member said Tuesday [17 May].    Most panelists stressed the need to put "great effort" into  winning public support through regional hearings by presenting  "various quantitative options," Sakue Matsumoto, acting chairman  of the Tax Commission, told reporters after a panel meeting.    The advisory panel to the prime minister listed major  opinions spelled out in seven previous meetings to map out the  direction for discussion on tax reform, including income tax  cuts and offsetting tax hikes.    Matsumoto, speaking in place of panel chairman Kan Kato,  said  he does not know if panelists want to include concrete figures  in the June report. But he said members agreed to carry out  "quantitative" discussions.    He also said most panelists called for additional proposals  such as administrative and fiscal streamlining and welfare  revision to win support if the tax reform is to cover heavier  burdens on taxpayers.    Matsumoto said panelists are still split on whether to  conduct a full tax reform or take more limited measures under  the weak economy.</p>

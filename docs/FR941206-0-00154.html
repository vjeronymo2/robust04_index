			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nevertheless, RCRA section 1006(b) cannot be used to ignore key elements of RCRA; see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chemical Waste Management  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 976 F.2d at 23. In this case, Congress has indicated that TSDF air emissions need to be controlled on the RCRA timetable, not that of the CAA. Deferring totally to the CAA would vitiate this key RCRA requirement. [See also RCRA section 3004(q) and CAA section 112(n)(7) in which Congress indicated that pendency of CAA air standards for RCRA units does not vitiate RCRA requirements.] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA's approach to developing air standards for TSDF under RCRA is consistent with CAA programs to achieve attainment and to maintain national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The NAAQS specify limits to pollutant concentrations in the ambient air to protect public health and welfare. A NAAQS has been established for ozone. Ambient ozone concentrations in many metropolitan regions of the United States exceed the NAAQS. Organic emissions from TSDF as well as other sources react photochemically with other chemical compounds in the atmosphere to form ozone. The CAA requires that States develop and the EPA approve air emission control plans called ``State implementation plans'' (SIP's). For those regions within a State that are in nonattainment with the NAAQS for ozone, the SIP specifies the standards and other control measures to be implemented by the State to attain the NAAQS. However, the CAA requires the EPA not only to implement programs to attain the NAAQS in nonattainment areas but also to maintain, and prevent significant deterioration of, the air quality in those areas of the Nation currently in attainment with the NAAQS. Consequently, in addition to the CAA control programs to address specific regional NAAQS attainment problems, the EPA also develops under the CAA authority minimum national emission standards applicable to stationary sources independent of whether the source is located in a NAAQS attainment or nonattainment area. The EPA considers the subpart CC standards to be reasonable national standards needed to control emissions of air toxics as well as to attain and maintain NAAQS for ozone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The subpart CC standards are consistent with the EPA's pollution prevention policy. Pollution prevention involves reducing the quantity of pollution produced for a given quantity of product prior to recycling, treatment, or control of emissions. Activities defined as source reduction measures in the Pollution Prevention Act include technology modifications, process and procedure modifications, reformulation or redesign of products, and substitution of raw materials. A decrease in production alone does not qualify as pollution prevention. Under the subpart CC standards, a TSDF owner or operator is not required to manage a hazardous waste in a tank, surface impoundment, or container using the specified air emission controls in cases when the owner or operator determines that the organic content of all hazardous waste placed in the unit meets certain conditions specified in the rule. Thus, the subpart CC standards encourage pollution prevention by providing an incentive to generators to initiate source reduction measures that will reduce the concentration of organics in a hazardous waste. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The development of TSDF air standards under RCRA is not contrary to the EPA's ``cluster'' approach of examining and coordinating regulations addressing the same emission source to minimize duplicative or contradictory requirements. The different EPA Offices responsible for implementing RCRA and CAA requirements are coordinating the development of this rulemaking to ensure that subpart CC standards are compatible with other rules and programs applicable to TSDF owners and operators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The air emission control requirements for tanks under the subpart CC standards incorporate provisions of NSPS that were promulgated under the authority of the CAA and apply to storage tanks constructed or modified after July 23, 1984, that contain volatile organic liquids (40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb). Therefore, air emission controls already in use on a TSDF tank in compliance with 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb will comply with air emission control requirements of the subpart CC standards. Also, the subpart CC standards for closed-vent systems and control devices cross reference the requirements for closed-vent systems and control devices promulgated under subpart AA in 40 CFR parts 264 and 265. The subpart AA requirements are consistent with the requirements for closed-vent systems and control devices under several CAA air standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Khalid al-Zubaydi] </F>   [Text] The first and biggest Palestinian holding company,  with a capital of 200 million dinars [currency as published],  has emerged at the Amman Chamber of Industry with the  participation of Palestinian, Jordanian, and Arab banks,  companies, and investment figures. The company, considered a  distinguished private sector effort, seeks to establish  investment projects in the Palestinian-Arab territories.    Participants in the constituent meeting viewed the launching  of the Palestine Development and Investment Company as a part of  Palestine's modern history and as an important step in the  direction of a market economy, which is embraced by the  Palestinian leadership as a path, according to Ahmad Quray'  (Abu-al-'Ala').    Sources of the [company's] constituent committee have  estimated the volume of investments expected to be contributed  by the Palestine Company at $1 billion. Raja'i al-Misri, the  company spokesman, has asserted that the constituent assembly  has developed initial ideas for a long list of projects. He has  also estimated the company's investments in the first year at  nearly $200 million.    In response to a question by AL-RA'Y, al-Misri pointed out  that the company's Executive Board is inclined to invite  [public] subscription for 49 percent of the capital of the  Palestine Pioneers Establishment as a first practical step on  the company's part.    Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, Jordan's information minister and  minister of state for cabinet affairs, expressed hope that the  company will accomplish its tasks of developing Palestine;  creating work opportunities for those who seek them; and  expanding the spheres of fruitful investment. He also asserted  Jordan's support for development and reconstruction efforts in  the occupied territories.    Dr. al-'Anani also noted that economic relations between  Jordan and the occupied territories have continued to exist by  virtue of fundamental factors, asserting that these relations  must continue so they will remain a firm barrier in the face of  Israel's schemes to maintain the status quo of the Palestinian  economy.    He reminded us of the comprehensive economic agreement  concluded between Jordan and the PLO and said, "Creation of the  Palestine Company embodies the form of relations toward which we  aspire and creates a harmonious reality which Israel cannot  infiltrate."    Al-'Anani noted that Jordan's and Palestine's private  sectors  are capable of being pioneers and foresighted initiative-makers  that play a role in building the Palestinian economy and in  turning it into a bridge for greater Arab unity.  <H5>  More Important Event </H5>   Abu-al-'Ala', who delivered an address on behalf of  Palestinian Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, considered the foundation of  the Palestine Company as the most important event since  conclusion of the Declaration of Principles in Washington.    He said that this private sector initiative will have a  great  impact on economic and social development activities in the  Palestinian homeland. It will also have the greatest impact in  preparing and revitalizing the Palestinian private sector at  home and abroad to play a role in and to contribute to the  development activities. Abu-al-'Ala' asserted that this good  initiative will receive full support and backing from the  Palestinian authority and its institutions and from the  Palestinian people's institutions inside and outside the  occupied homeland.    He added that the size of the challenges facing Palestinians  in the coming phase is only matched by the size of the hopes and  expectations. He said that these challenges are the challenges  to build institutions of civilization on the ground according to  the most modern principles and to create a system that embraces  democracy and plurality as its path and joint economic  development and growth as its course. Moreover, these challenges  are also challenges of the ability to ensure stability and  security.    Abu-'Ala' summed up the goals and priorities of development  in Palestine, saying that they must be designed to befit the  conditions of a people who have experienced and who continue to  experience great hardship as a result of the hateful occupation.  They must also be designed to befit a totally new political  entity that is in the phase of creation. These goals seek to:     -  Correct the distortions, flaws, and bottlenecks  experienced by the Palestinian economy as a result of the  occupation and of its actions.    -  Expand and improve the infrastructure.    -  Create work opportunities to absorb the unemployed.    -  Encourage export and foreign currency generating sectors.    -  Work to meet the Palestinian people's basic needs.    -  Gain and resettle an effective technological capability,  considering that education, teaching, and training are three  meshed priorities.    -  Encourage the private sector and open the door for it to  participate in all branches of construction and development and  to contribute promptly to the construction of 185,000 housing  units in order to meet the shortage in the housing area and to  absorb repatriates.    -  Seek equality and balance between men and women and between  the  various districts and social and economic groups.     Regarding the development strategies for Palestine,  Abu-'Ala'  said that they must achieve balance between agriculture and  industry, exports and imports. They must also make maximum use  of land and water; must strengthen bonds and interaction between  the various sectors; must select the appropriate technology for  all branches of the economy; and must set up the institutions,  centers, and frameworks that support economic activity. The  strategies must, moreover, mobilize the resources and  capabilities of the diaspora Palestinians; must attract  financial, investment, and technological, educational, and  administrative aid; must strengthen self-reliance within the  framework of collective (i.e., Arab) reliance, without  retreating into a shell; and must benefit from Arab and  international aid.    Abu-'Ala' estimated the total investments needed for the  Palestinian development program at $11.6 billion, plus 12  percent to face inflation and 10 percent added to the total as  reserves. All of this raises the total amount needed, at 1994  prices, to $13.4 billion, of which the private sector  contributions will constitute nearly 60 percent.  <H5>  Market Economy Is Our Option </H5>   Before a crowd of more than 200 businessmen and investors,  Abu-'Ala' declared, "We aspire for an economic system that  epitomizes the greatest and most successful experiments;  achieves justice, prosperity, and constant growth; and releases  individual initiative--a system that is founded on frankness,  explicitness, openness, and accountability; that benefits from  our people's competence and capability; and that always works to  develop them.    Abu-al-'Ala' noted that other people's experiences have  proved that the rules and laws of the market economy are the  best motivators of people's economies and capabilities and are  the most successful in economic growth and development processes.    Concluding, Abu-al-'Ala' asserted that the Palestine  Investment Company [Palestine Development and Investment  Company] initiative will have an important role in the  construction and development activities and in motivating the  Palestinian, Arab, and international private sector to invest in  Palestine. Through interaction with the Palestinian national  authority, the company will play an important role that benefits  this authority.  <H5>  Correction of Historical Flaw </H5>   Munib al-Misri, a major shareholder and a constituent  committee member, said that the idea of founding the Palestinie  Investment Company with a capital of 200 million dinars  [currency as published] was developed nearly a year ago with  brothers from Palestine. He asserted that the company will  participate in Arab-Palestinian firms that will be founded in  the Palestinian lands to play an effective role with the private  sector in implementing the economic plan. This plan is capable  of correcting the flaw that has afflicted the economic structure  in recent decades and of reviving the Palestinian economy  through the implementation of a large number of economic  projects, expected to exceed $1 billion in value and to have a  cumulative effect on the society and the economy. The company  will also support the industries that currently exist in  Palestine--especially small industries--financially,  administratively, and technically.    Munib al-Misri added that the company will encourage the  private sector to play its role of supporting and complementing  the public sector so as to contribute to building the  independent state and to fulfilling our Palestinian people's  social and economic development aspirations. The company will  also work to improve the investment climate so as to attract  Palestinian, Arab, and international capital. A number of  factors have been taken into account in designing the company's  structure and the structure of the domestic joint-stock  subsidiaries emanating from it. These include expanding the  participation base to open it to everybody, provided that no one  individual investor is allowed to participate with more than 1  percent of the company capital. Foundation of the Palestine  Company for Development and Investment and of subsidiaries  emanating from it is tantamount to providing practical  encouragement to the extensive expertise, capabilities, and  economic presence of Palestinian investors in the diaspora and  to their Arab brothers, as well as to the brothers inside  Palestine.    Munib al-Misri noted that, with the election of the  executive  board, detailed studies will be completed on a number of  important economic projects. The company has conducted  preliminary studies on the feasibility of these projects from  several aspects. The projects include the construction of  housing complexes outside urban areas, each consisting of 1,000  housing units and containing all the necessary utilities. The  company has also conducted studies to make a determination on  basic industrial projects. To be feasible, these projects have  to be generally beneficial to a large number of citizens and  free of market risks because they are basic projects.    Concluding, al-Misri noted that the citizen is the true  wealth. He praised the Palestinian people's capabilities and  sacrifices, saying that if high capabilities are utilized well  in the construction and production process they will provide  bright opportunities and economic future. He asserted that the  private sector can accomplish this goal, considering that this  sector has proved under the most difficult circumstances that it  is the forerunner in taking the initiative and that it is  creative and innovative.  <H5>  Entrenchment of Jerusalem's Arabism </H5>   Faysal al-Husayni, head of the steering committee of the  Palestinian delegation to the peace negotiations, delivered  Jerusalem's address. He asserted: "We are convinced that it is  possible to get Gaza with or without negotiations. The West Bank  can be gotten with negotiations. As for Jerusalem, it will not  be available with negotiations alone but rather with  negotiations and with a fait accompli."    He added: "To win the Jerusalem battle, we are required to  establish in our conscience and in the consciences of the  Israelis and the world that Jerusalem is Arab and the capital of  the State of Palestine. It will be won with a religious fait  accompli or with a political and economic fait accompli."    Al-Husayni warned of the swift steps being taken by the  Israelis in an attempt to isolate Jerusalem, saying, "Despite  our difficult circumstances and weakness, we were able in 1967  to impose certain important things, such as administration of  al-Aqsa Mosque, religious courts, and religious trusts. All are  managed by an Arab, not Israeli, presence. [passage  unintelligible].    Al-Husayni renewed the call to Palestinian businessmen and  investors to revive the plan for an international investment  conference in Jerusalem so as to bolster the Arab-Palestinian  reality in Jerusalem and to implant in the mind of the world and  of the Israelis that this Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine  and so as not to leave to the Israelis the task of organizing  international meetings and symposiums on Jerusalem's soil.  <H5>  Company Is Tantamount to Accepting Challenge </H5>   In his capacity as a founder, Khaldun Abu-Hassan, chairman  of  the Amman Chamber of Industry, said before businessmen and the  constituent assembly of the Palestine Company for Development  and Investment: "It is our duty in this homeland to take the  initiative and to roll up our sleeves so we will be the vanguard  in rebuilding the wounded Palestine." He added: "You are the  elite, not just with your economic expertise but also with your  noble character, your firm patriotism, and your true zeal to  employ your capabilities in order to set up an Arab organization  that is prepared and eligible to build and to develop on firm  and solid bases."    Abu-Hassan further added, "After considering the goals,  means, and methods carefully, we decided to establish the  Palestine Company for Development and Investment as a holding  company so it will form an effective factor that turns the wheel  of development and accepts the challenge of rebuilding the  Palestinian economy and of mending the wide fissure that has  developed in the Palestinian economic structure as a result of  occupation throughout recent decades. This occupation has  destroyed the production installations, structure, and  utilities, and whatever pertains to them." He also said, "By  coming forth to establish this company, we direct our attention  at the sacred goal of reviving constructive life in the  Palestinian citizen on the Palestinian soil. Through this  company, we seek to create an investment climate in the areas of  industry, tourism, food production, and of other projects that  produce and create work opportunities; that meet the citizen's  needs; and that enhance his standard of living."  <H5>  Uniting Goal and Interest </H5>   Kamal Hassunah, general director of the Palestinian Pioneers  Establishment and a constituent assembly member, presented a  quick review of the Palestinian investment horizons. He said  that the 1990s have experienced fundamental developments that  are still affecting the entire world, including collapse of the  Soviet Union, unification of the two Germanies, the Gulf war,  the Middle East peace plans, and economic developments toward  bloc formation, such as the American NAFTA, the European Common  Market, the Asian Tigers, and others.    Hassunah said that these immense and unprecedented  developments "have imposed enormous challenges also. To confront  this new reality, where do we stand vis-a-vis these developments  and changes? Does the Arab environment promote change and  development?"    He stressed that many things depend on this review, most  significantly the increased chances for success of big companies  and the exposure of small and medium companies to losses or  risks of losses if they fail to unite in the next five or 10  years in order to adapt to the international economic  developments.    Hassunah said that if normal circumstances are made  available  to Palestinians, then "we are capable of succeeding in the  development process through fruitful cooperation between the  interior and the diaspora, by uniting in common goal and  interest after a long absence of more than 40 years in the  diaspora, and by bolstering the confidence and inspired spirit  of the Palestinians at home."    The constituent assembly of the Palestine Company for  Development and Investment elected a 16-member executive board.  This board held its first meeting and elected Dr. Kamal  al-Sha'ir as chairman, Munib al-Misri as deputy chairman, and  Nabil al-Sarraf as secretary. The executive board has been  formed of the following:    A member representing the Arab Bank; a member representing  the Cairo-Amman Bank; a member representing the Housing Bank; a  representative of the Engineering House Company, namely Dr.  Kamal al-Sha'ir; a member representing al-Masirah Investment  Company; a member representing al-Sa'id Company; Husayn  al-Sharqawi; Khaldun Abu-Hassan; Riyadh Sadiq; Ramzi Dalul; Zahi  Khuri; 'Azmi 'Abd-al-Hadi; Munib al-Misri; Nabil al-Sarraf;  Nabil al-Shawwa; and Nidhal Sakhiyan.</p>

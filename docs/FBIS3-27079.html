Now, the Germans are the third party benefiting while  the Americans and Japanese tussle with each other in a trade war.    The initial reaction to the collapse of U.S.-Japanese trade  negotiations earlier this month was the sharp rise of the  Japanese yen.    Just before negotiations broke down on February 11, the  exchange rate between the yen and the German mark was 100 yen to  1.62 marks. But on February 15, the yen's rate against the mark  rose to a high of 100 yen to 1.68 marks, with the yen gaining  four percentage points in trading against the mark in just four  days.    This depreciation of the mark means that German companies  can  earn more from exports to Japan.    If German exports to Japan can be regarded as only a small  proportion of the German economy, the appreciation of the yen  does have a significant effect on the German economy.    It is apparent that Germany's role is similar to that of  Japan in the world's economic affairs. But the sale of  Japanese-manufactured goods represents a large share of the  German market.    Because of lower prices, Japanese goods, including  automobiles and home appliances, enjoy good sales in the German  market.    Now, with the appreciation of the yen, if the Japanese  companies want to retain the same profit level they will have to  raise prices.    Consequently, any increase in the price of Japanese goods  will contribute to the competitiveness of German goods in the  domestic market. This could be a shot of "cardiac stimulant"  for the recession-hit German economy.    Both Japan and Germany are major exporters. The Germans also  benefit from the appreciation of the yen in terms of competition  in the markets of other countries.    Also, as a result of the appreciation of the yen, the mark  has remained firm against the U.S. dollar.    As Germany is only slowly recovering from recession, a  motivating force is needed.    The benefit the Germans gain from the U.S.-Japanese trade  war  will undoubtedly contribute to the recovery.    But the question is, how long will the good times last?    In an effort to stop continued increase in the value of the  yen, Japan is selling the yen in large quantities. At the same  time, the United States has increased certain interest rates in  order to defend the U.S. dollar.    It also remains uncertain what kind of agreement Japan and  the United States will reach to ease their trade conflict.    In its latest monthly economic report issued on Wednesday,  Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said that Germany had  not yet recovered from the worst recession since World War II.    On Thursday, the Bundesbank cut its discount rate, a key  interest rate, by half a percentage point to 5.25 percent, in an  apparent effort to inject vigor into the economy.    Any lowering of the central bank's major interest rates may  be effective in stimulating economic development, but will  likely weaken the mark.    Thus, the central bank, while lowering the discount rate,  left its less important Lombard rate unchanged at 6.75 percent,  and held another key money market interest rate unchanged at  6.00 percent.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Heseltine urges 'green club' for UK companies MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, environment secretary, is asking Britain's 1,000 largest companies to establish a 'green club' committed to achieving tougher business standards for reducing pollution and producing environmentally clean products. He also wants them to set targets for increasing their share of the growing worldwide market for environmental technology and pollution abatement equipment. He was critical of management's performance in this area so far. 'What we need is - in effect - a green renaissance of Britain's economy,' he said in the annual Shell lecture on the environment at the Royal Society of Arts in London last night. Mr Heseltine will today send letters to the chief executives of Britain's 1,000 largest companies seeking their 'active participation in the challenge of the environmental decade ahead'. He envisages them establishing a 'green club' committed to a strategy of environmental review, target-setting and public reporting. This would be on a voluntary basis but with the encouragement of the Department of the Environment. Mr Heseltine wants companies to carry out independent 'green audits' of their environmental performance and make them public. A growing number have such audits but are reluctant to publish them. Separately, Mr Heseltine and Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, announced the appointment of an advisory committee on business and the environment. Mr John Collins, chairman and chief executive of Shell UK, is chairman, and the 23 members include representatives of IBM UK, ICI, Norsk Hydro UK and Bowater. Mr Heseltine said he wanted a market-based approach to the environment. But he warned: 'Where things do go wrong, sanctions and prosecutions must follow  -the environmental equivalent of the short sharp shock'. He feared that for all British success in this field, companies were still winning less than 5 per cent of the available export market. 'I am sure that part of the answer rests, as it does with other problems, in the quality of British management,' he said. Shell chairman to lead green group Page 31</p>

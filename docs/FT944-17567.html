			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Observer: Gunning for voters Brazilians are rightly proud of the smooth way their biggest set of elections in 40 years was staged on Monday. But voters in the poor, north-eastern state of Paraiba may have less to celebrate. With about a third of the votes counted, ex-governor Ronaldo Cunha Lima is almost certain to get a senate seat. This is a little unfortunate. Last year he tried to assassinate his principal political rival. The victim survived and Cunha Lima was charged with attempted murder. But justice grinds slow in Paraiba. By winning a senate seat, Cunha Lima gains immunity from prosecution under Brazil's arcane laws protecting legislators. Paraiba's second choice for the senate - Humberto Lucena - had his candidature cancelled by election authorities, for illegally using senate printing presses to print glossy calendars and then handing them out to voters. He contested the elections, regardless. Surely there's a bylaw somewhere to let him off the hook?</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> SMITHEREENS DELIVER RIGHT-LEFT COMBINATION  </P> <P> Louder, looser and sweatier than their records, the Smithereens blew through an  hour-plus, more-killer-than-filler, end-o'-the-tour show at the Hollywood  Palladium on Thursday before an adoring if not quite capacity crowd.  </P> <P> With his gleaming pate, hawk nose and Vandyke beard, Pat DiNizio looks more  like a demented biker poet than the frontman in a POP! group.  </P> <P> His three cohorts look about as exciting as a box of rocks, too.  </P> <P> Ah . . . but when it all comes down to that right-left combination of  craftsmanship and raunch, these Jersey devils whip every glamourpussed  power-pop group that's packed the pipe in the last 18 years where it counts --  in the wallet.  </P> <P> So the hits after semi-hits after hits after semi-hits just kept right on  comin'. And if not all of them are up to the shimmering, shattering, mindbust  status of the '87 career breakthrough numbers "Behind the Wall of Sleep" and  "Blood and Roses," they've still got the kind of hooks you can't forget.

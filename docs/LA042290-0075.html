			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS CAN WIN  </P> <P> As one of several Democratic candidates for public office in Orange County, I  wish to protest a statement made by your paper on Page 1 of the first section  of your March 10 edition. Printed in a box at the bottom of the page, it cited  a news story on Page 24 of the same section saying that: "The good news for  Democrats is that they are entered in all 14 county races.  </P> <P> The good news for Republicans is that both sides expect the GOP to win all 14."  </P> <P> The wording of this statement, particularly the second sentence thereof, is  both untrue and, because of its front page placement, especially embarrassing  and damaging to all of our party's candidates. Who is going to walk the  precincts, make the phone calls or contribute money to a Democratic candidate  who at the very outset of his campaign has, reportedly, agreed that he expects  his Republican opponent to win?  </P> <P> To the best of my knowledge, neither I nor any other Democrat in question was  interviewed at the time as to his expectations of victory and nothing in the  referenced story substantiates in any way your assertion that we all expect to  lose. I, for one, certainly did not undertake the expense and effort of running  for Congress with the thought that it will all be in vain. That would be utter  nonsense.  </P> <P> In short, we Orange County Democrats have enough on our hands already without  being branded by The Times as a bunch of self-confessed losers. Give us a  break!  </P> <P> JOHN W. BLACK  </P> <P> Democratic Candidate  </P> <P> 39th Congressional District  </P></p>

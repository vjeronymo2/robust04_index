			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber price poised for an upturn RUBBER prices are poised for upturn on the back of increased demand, even though turmoil in the world's top grower Thailand has failed to spark a rally, an International Natural Rubber Organisation (INRO) official said, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. 'I expect a gradual improvement in prices in the second half of this year,' said buffer stock manager Mr Aldo Hofmeister. 'Prices could rise by 10 per cent by the end of the year from current levels due to increase in offtake.' 'But there is very little (market) reaction to developments in Thailand and that is surprising,' he said. The INRO uses a buffer stock mechanism to stabilise prices. Prices in Singapore and other major markets inched up marginally on Monday and Tuesday on fears of reduced Thai supplies. But prices eased in Singapore yesterday.</p>

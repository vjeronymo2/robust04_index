Henceforth, the  agricultural sector is an integral part of the GATT system.  Fixed customs rates will replace the varying duties that have  been imposed at the frontiers to date. These rates will be  reduced by 36 percent over a period of six years. A minimal  opening up of access to all of the markets is planned. Domestic  measures to support prices will be reduced by 20 percent, but  direct aid to producers will be allowed. Subsidized exports, for  their part, will be reduced by 21 percent in volume, while  overall budget support of exports, for its part, will be reduced  by 36 percent in value. The reduction commitments will not apply  to the "less-developed countries."    A first assessment can be made. The Americans emerge from  the  agreement as the principal winners, inasmuch as their system of  subsidies is not altered by the final document. This is because  one of the advantages they still enjoy is that their domestic  prices are close to those quoted internationally. There is a  greater disparity between the prices guaranteed to the producers  in Europe and international prices.    Despite everything, the Europeans have not come out of these  accords too badly. The bulk of the guidelines had already been  established by the Common Agricultural Policy of the Union  (CAP). But a new reform of the CAP is to be expected in the  years to come (additional restrictions on the production of  beef). While subsidized exports will be reduced, those exports  that are not subsidized may increase thanks to the opening up of  certain markets. In France, the producers of basic foodstuffs  such as grains and beef will suffer as a result of the  agricultural accord. On the other hand, it will benefit the  manufacturers of processed or "luxury" products such as wines,  poultry, cheeses, and dairy products. "There has been a  psychological and political overinvestment where this issue is  concerned," Michel Rainelli, a professor at the University of  Sophia-Antipolis, believes. "Economically, this is a  satisfactory agreement for France. But it is difficult to pursue  this discussion with the farmers. Instead of taking agriculture  as a whole into account, the debate has become polarized around  the oleaginous crops and wheat. But the wine producers are aware  of the opportunities provided by the opening up of the markets."    The assessment is clearly less favorable for a certain  number  of other countries. The producers in the Cairns group  (Australia, Argentina, Canada, etc.), who fought for a real  opening up of the agricultural markets, are likely to have to  pay the cost of an understanding between Europe and the United  States. In the short run, it is the developing countries that  will be the main losers as a result of the accords, according to  Abdelaziz L. Alaoui, a Paribas Bank economist. They will no  longer benefit from the exemption allowed them on the subsidized  European wheat they receive. The social consequences to be  expected from a rise in prices are likely to be harsh.</p>

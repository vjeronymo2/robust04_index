			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Secretive body debates next step THE EC monetary committee, which was summoned to a crisis meeting in Brussels last night after sterling's suspension in the Exchange Rate Mechanism, is a highly secretive body. Senior European Commission and national officials in Brussels at first even refused to confirm that the meeting would take place, let alone where. The meeting began at the Borschette conference centre towards midnight, with some officials indicating it could continue well into the morning. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, called the meeting in his capacity as current president of the EC finance ministers' council. The monetary committee groups senior EC treasury and central bank officials, as well as their European Commission counterparts. It is chaired at present by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the French treasury director. Britain is represented by Sir Nigel Wicks, second permanent secretary at the treasury with responsibility for international monetary affairs. The 26-strong committee lies at the heart of EC economic and monetary policy. In effect, it manages the ERM. It was the monetary committee that issued the communique last weekend on the devaluation of the lira and the cut in German interest rates. The committee also has a strong interest in the intricacies of the Maastricht Treaty on European union.</p>

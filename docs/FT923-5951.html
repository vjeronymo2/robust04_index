			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Mallett shares fall 17p on loss SHARES OF Mallett, the London antique dealer, dived 17p to 35p on news that the company had run up losses of Pounds 485,000 pre-tax for the half year to June 30. The interim dividend is omitted - 1.5p was paid previously - and payment of a final will be considered at the year-end. The loss, which compared with profits of Pounds 680,000, was struck from turnover some Pounds 2m lower at Pounds 3m. Directors said conditions had been as 'difficult as at any time since the war, not helped by the present high exchange rate of the pound against many world currencies, particularly the dollar'. Costs had been reduced via a 20 per cent staff reduction since the year-end and from the closure of the Motcomb Street premises and the transfer of the business to the main New Bond Street premises converting office space to retail showrooms.</p>

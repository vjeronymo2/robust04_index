			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SET YOUR VCR  </P> <P> Danton Bleakly beautiful and richly detailed, Andrzej Wajda's 1982 film is an  electrifying depiction of a society hurtling toward chaos. Gerard Depardieu is  superb in the title role as the boisterous and earthy revolutionary. (3 hours)  Edited. (A&amp;E early Sunday at 1 a.m.) Kevin Thomas  </P></p>

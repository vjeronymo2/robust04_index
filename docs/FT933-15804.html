			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Observer: Nice one, Willy John Garrett, the Labour MP for Norwich South, is probably the only management consultant sitting on the Labour benches. But he's better known for banging on about how the only people who are doing well in Britain's civil service are white, male, public school, Oxbridge arts graduates. Indeed, his fixation with the subject is so well known that William Waldegrave, who doubles up as a fellow of All Souls and Citizens' Charter minister, had no difficulty earning a cheap point at yesterday's select committee hearing on the civil service. Cross-examined by Garrett about the percentage of top civil servants from Oxbridge, Waldegrave noted that the ratio of Garrett's fellow committee members who went to Oxbridge was far greater than in the case of permanent secretaries.</p>

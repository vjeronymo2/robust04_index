Japanese Ambassador to  Ukraine Shoji Suezawa handed Hosokawa's written message to  Nikolay Makarevych, Ukraine's first vice foreign minister,  Terada said.    In the letter, Hosokawa gave high marks to a recent  trilateral accord among Ukraine, Russia and the United States in  which Ukraine pledged to give up its nuclear arms. He also  urged Kravchuk to implement the accord as soon as possible,  Terada said.    Hosokawa called on Ukraine to ratify the Strategic Arms  Reduction Treaty (START I) unconditionally and accede to the  nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) as a nonnuclear state, the  spokesman said.    He also said Ukraine's participation in the "Partnership for  Peace," endorsed by the leaders of North Atlantic Treaty  Organization (NATO) in Brussels last month, is meaningful in  enhancing global security. The plan is intended to bring former  Warsaw Pact adversaries into a limited partnership with the  Western Military Alliance.    Hosokawa's letter also expressed Japan's strong expectations  that Ukraine will further promote efforts for economic  development, Terada said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by Guatemalan President Ramiro de </F> Leon Carpio with unidentified reporters at the National Palace  in Guatemala City on 22 February; from the "Telepress"  newscast-- recorded]    [Text] In a statement to reporters at the National Palace  on 22 February, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio commented on the  variations in fuel prices. He initially answered questions from  reporters who asked him about the appointment of a new  government minister after accepting current Minister Arnoldo  Ortiz Moscoso 's resignation this week. De Leon said he has not  yet decided who will be the new government minister.    [Begin recording] [De Leon] I do not know yet.    [Reporter] When will the announcement be made?    [De Leon] When I have the name. I have not decided yet.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [De Leon] Yes, of course he will assume his post at that  time, but I still do not know.    [Reporter] Any candidates?    [De Leon] No, not yet.    [Reporter] What will be the basis for selection?    [De Leon] The president will make the decision based on the  requirements, qualifications, personal qualities, and so forth.    [Reporter] Will he be another civilian?    [De Leon] We still do not know.    [Reporter] What are your comments on the article published  by THE MIAMI HERALD and the current situation of  nongovernability?    [De Leon] I would like to refer to a commentary written by  one of your colleagues, which was published today, in the sense  that sometimes a foreign reporter visits our country for a few  minutes and then believes he is an expert in our national  affairs. Carlos Rafael Soto said this, not me. This is what he  said in his column today.    I believe we can handle our internal affairs better, more  knowledgeably. The article stated I depend on the Army and that  the Army is pressuring me. Maybe we should inform the person  who wrote the article about the changes we made on 18 February,  so he can see differently. I am not concerned about the  article, because I feel it is not consonant with reality.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] at the international level?    [De Leon] None at all.    [Reporter] What would be the impact of an increase in the  price of diesel?    [De Leon] I am pleased to say a few days ago I was  criticized  when I said I would not increase the price of gasoline and that  instead it was possible the price of the two types of gasoline  would drop. Based on the economic theory of free supply and  demand and free market, I then said we had to wait. Today, 10  or 12 days later, what I said is right. I did not lie. I said  the price of gasoline would drop.    It is significant that gas stations that did not increase  the  price of gasoline by 10 cents possibly doubled their sales,  according to statistics. The economic theory did work.  Concerning diesel, what happened was logical; nevertheless, as  I said, this compensates for the lower prices in the two types  of gasoline. Prices have dropped considerably, 30 or 40 cents.  I did not lie; on the contrary, I told the truth. Liberalizing  the price of fuel can benefit consumers at a given time, once  the market reaches its natural levels.    [Reporter] Certain private hospitals have offered their  assistance due to the public hospitals strike. Will you accept  that proposal? Could the military hospital also help?    [De Leon] Any type of assistance is welcome, especially when  the people's human rights are being violated, in this case, the  human right to health, which the Constitution guarantees. Those  who earn a salary to give medical attention--sometimes  deficiently due to lack of funds, medicines, and proper  conditions--are giving an even more deficient service today. We  do not know if this can be called a service when there is an  illegal strike, a totally illegal strike; hence, in addition to  the disciplinary actions, the administrative, and legal actions  we are conducting, naturally any assistance is welcome. If  doctors and paramedics in private hospitals are willing to  reduce the harm being done to the Guatemalan people, I welcome  their assistance. I respect them, because they are honoring  their Hippocratic oath, showing their humanitarian spirit; they  deserve praise and recognition.    Nevertheless, we must act. I met with members of the  Association of Hospital Directors yesterday and will continue to  meet with them in an attempt to find medium- and long-term  solutions. One of those solutions is having family foundations  [patronatos familiares] take care of the direction and  administration of hospitals in the future. There are already  very good examples of how this can work.    We will expedite the procedures for approximately 100 or 120  foundations that have already requested their registration and  recognition of their legal status. In the future, this will  result in the decentralization of administrative functions, and  this type of problem will be solved via social participation and  supervision. For this to happen we must first take care of  certain administrative aspects. In the meantime, we will try to  resolve certain financial problems, but the administrative  aspect and handling of hospitals is a different problem.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [De Leon] I have not thought of that yet, but as I said, any  assistance is welcome. If this is possible, if the military  hospital and the doctors of the military hospital can help, we  would use those services. [end recording]</p>

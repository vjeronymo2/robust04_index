			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CABARET REVIEW;  </P> <P> SERIOUS SINGING FROM REESE  </P> <P> There's never much doubt about what to expect when Della Reese hits the stage.  Powerful singing, whimsical humor and no-nonsense entertaining are her stocks  in trade.  </P> <P> The opening-night set in the Cabaret Room at the Improv was a typical example  of the Reese performance magic. Never one to waste time or mince words, she  steamed into the room with the imposing presence of a musical grande dame.  Moving easily and quickly through several opening numbers, she tossed off a few  jokes and established a solid interaction with her audience before finally  getting down to the serious work of a beautifully crafted, multi-tempoed  reading of "Just One of Those Things."  </P> <P> Reese's voice, always a richly resonant instrument, has moved into the low  tenor range in recent years, but her characteristic warmth and precision were  as good as ever. Virtually every note she sang Wednesday night was right smack  in the middle of the pitch, with lyrics that were as clear, concise and  passionately articulated as a preacher's sermon.  </P> <P> Reese wisely balanced her program with new and old material. She was crisply  rhythmic on "Just the Two of Us" and surprisingly tender on "Until It's Time  for You to Go." A collection of her old hits was on target, and her precise  style sounded just right for John Benson Brooks' rhythm standard, "You Came a  Long Way From St. Louis."  </P> <P> The decision to bring another singer -- William Knight -- on stage for several  closing duets, however, seemed less wise. Knight's soft and mellow romanticism,  pleasant as it was, provided an oddly jarring contrast to Reese's upfront,  declamatory style. She would do well to consider climaxing her set with her own  strong skills.  </P> <P> Reese continues at the Cabaret Room at the Improv through Sept. 15. DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

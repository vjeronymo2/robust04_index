They wanted to indicate in a violent way that the Islamic  Armed Resistance cannot be brought down by repression, which is  particularly harsh at this moment, nor by the "national  reconciliation" advocated by head of state Liamine Zeroual.  [passage omitted]    The [French] Foreign Ministry has condemned "this odious  crime" and has reissued a warning to the remaining 3,000 or so  French citizens in Algeria to return to France (some 5,000 have  already left the country). Government Spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy  stated that "Today, Algeria is one of the prime minister's  primary concerns."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Agatha Ngai at Qiandao Lake, Zhejiang Province] </F>   [Text] Attempts by Beijing to heal the wounds of the  Qiandao Lake tragedy have apparently backfired with relatives of  the Taiwanese victims criticising the authorities for concealing  and intentionally destroying evidence.    The relatives were yesterday shown the charred boat in which  the 24 Taiwanese tourists and their eight mainland tour guides  were burnt to death on March 31.    "The Chinese Government is not sincere in helping us," said  one victim's relative Chen Chin-tzu.    Relatives' representative Wang Tse-lung said he had pictures  of the boat which could prove that the pleasure boat had been  further damaged since their last visit. "Last time (in April),  there were only a few holes found on the boat's plastic shade...  But it (the shade) is totally damaged now," Mr Wang claimed.  "What are they (the mainland authorities) trying to hide from  us?" he asked.    Another relative, Lin Chi-neng, said the top of the bow had  been repainted.    In addition to the pleasure boat, the relatives and a  delegation of experts of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation  (SEF) were also taken to a display room where they were shown  two hunting rifles used by the murderers. They also saw 33  pictures developed from films taken by the Taiwanese victims  before the murder, some cash, and six cameras belonging to the  victims.    Despite this evidence the relatives claimed that the Chinese  authorities had broken an earlier promise of giving them a  forensic report -- more than a month after the autopsies were  completed. "We have been here for four days. And today is the  first time we have been given some practical information about  the case. However, the scene (of the crime) has been damaged.  The video they have shown us in the last two days is also  incomplete. How can I know the truth and be satisfied?" Mr Wang  said.    But Hangzhou's Public Security Bureau Criminal Investigation  Team Commander Li Shuguang denied they had destroyed evidence of  the massacre. "We have to sweep up the ashes to look for  evidence. The point of the explosion was discovered after  cleaning the cabin," Mr Li said.    Hsu Hui-you, secretary-General of the SEF said the visit  yesterday was "helpful." "We hope we can come to a conclusion  when we go back to Hangzhou," Mr Hsu said. "What we are doing  is to manage the aftermath of the incident objectively and  reasonably. We hope crosss-trait relations will return to  normal quickly."</p>

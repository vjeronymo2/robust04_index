			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Shift in manufacturing to Tungsram General Electric of the US is moving the manufacture of lighting products to its Tungsram subsidiary in Hungary from plants in western Europe. Mr Jack Welch, the group's chairman said yesterday: 'In the European manufacturing sense, Hungary will be our principal base. There is no question.' GE is closing down its plant producing incandescent light bulbs in Preston in the UK with the loss of 330 jobs and is in the process of transferring some of the machinery to Hungary. The rationalisation is part of GE's merger of its own European lighting business with Tungsram and the lighting interests bought from Thorn-EMI in 1991. The group is also winding down facilities in Wimbledon in the UK, and in Austria and Germany, and assigning output to its factories in Hungary. While there have been several examples of German and Austrian manufacturers relocating production to eastern Europe to escape high costs, GE's shift is the clearest example involving the UK. GE is, however, maintaining its UK facilities at Enfield and Leicester. The group's main competitors in the European lighting market have also sought out lower overheads in eastern Europe, with Philips, the Dutch electrical group, investing in Poland and Germany's Osram in the Czech Republic. GE said it had centred in Nagykanizsa production of compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy-efficient lighting source which is the fastest growing part of the market. GE announced plans to invest Dollars 30m to Dollars 50m a year in Tungsram. Underlying GE's commitment to manufacturing in Hungary, which remains strong despite initial heavy losses, are sharp improvements in efficiency. GE said total productivity at Tungsram rose by 16 per cent in 1993. 'We are now well positioned with a productive, excited and empowered workforce that is going to be a major factor in the whole of Europe,' said Mr Welch. Continuing productivity improvements, combined with an easing of the Budapest government's exchange rate policy, have allowed GE to hold relative labour costs steady for the first time since it entered eastern Europe. The improvements in productivity are the key to GE Lighting Europe's efforts to match Osram's pre-tax operating margin this year and draw level with Philips in 1995. GE says it sees Hungary as more than a low-cost manufacturing site. The group has made Hungary a centre for lighting research, with nearly as many engineers employed in Budapest as in GE headquarters in Cleveland. 'Pound for pound they are every bit as good,' said Mr Welch.</p>

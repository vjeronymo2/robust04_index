			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Platkovskiy: "Why Does the Great </F> Leader Need a Big Bomb?"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]  <H5>  Anything Can Be Hidden in </H5> Catacombs    In the summer of 1990 Eduard Shevardnadze, who was foreign  minister at the time, conducted exhaustive talks with the North  Koreans, trying to explain to them the necessity of Moscow's  imminent diplomatic recognition of Seoul. His Pyongyang  counterpart, Kim Yong-nam, was under orders from Kim Il-song to  employ every means to block Moscow's move, a move which  undermined the leader's [vozhd] concept of the existence of a  "sole legitimate state" on the Korean peninsula -- the DPRK.  Having exhausted the range of diplomatic devices, Kim Yong-nam  produced what was intended to be the trump card: Pyongyang  "will consider itself free of all commitments not to create  nuclear weapons" if Gorbachev starts cooperating with the "South  Korean puppets."    Shevardnadze countered the blackmail bid in his  characteristic emotional and trenchant manner. He attached no  significance to the threat. Meanwhile Moscow did not believe in  the seriousness of reports that American spy satellites had  detected installations in North Korea for reprocessing nuclear  fuel waste into plutonium.    The Russian intelligence service continues to deny today  that  Pyongyang has installations for manufacturing nuclear weapons.  Our experts think that the North Koreans are banking on  producing highly accurate intermediate- and long-range missiles.  They can be equipped with chemical, bacteriological, or  conventional warheads. These systems are sufficient, in our  experts' opinion, for the purpose of "nuclear deterrence."  There are nine nuclear electric power stations operating in  South Korea, and a missile strike on them would be equivalent in  its effect to a nuclear raid.    Our military specialists are struck by the naivete of the  Americans in trusting the information supplied by their  satellites: The North Koreans would never build a secret  installation in the open. The North Koreans conceal all their  strategic plants either underground or deep inside mountains,  and these facilities are like whole cities on many levels. The  North Koreans have built up a wealth of experience in this  sphere since the war in the fifties.    There is nothing surprising in the fact that our and the  American intelligence services differ in their assessments,  although it may be that this is not a case where the truth will  emerge out of controversy. CIA Director James Woolsey obviously  has strong grounds for stating that there is proof that the DPRK  has at least two nuclear weapons. According to the U.S.  intelligence department chief, Pyongyang will be producing 10 to  12 nuclear weapons per year in the future.  <H5>  Cat-and-Mouse Games </H5>   Pyongyang signed the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of  Nuclear Weapons in 1985. Just seven years later the North  Koreans permitted inspectors of the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] to carry out monitoring procedures.    IAEA representatives arrived in Yongbyon and made the North  Koreans acknowledge that they had produced 98 grams of plutonium  "for research purposes" from reactor waste in 1990, but  investigation then established that this was not produced at the  time indicated by the North Koreans. The inspectors threw up  their hands in despair: How could they believe the statements  that the North Koreans had no interest in plutonium -- it was  deception. What they were doing in Yongbyon all the time there  was no verification taking place could only be guessed at.    Another critical situation arose quite recently. It served  as grounds for the IAEA to ask the UN Security Council to  examine the possibility of introducing sanctions agaianst the  DPRK.    A while ago the IAEA received information that in 1989 the  Yongbyon reactor had been shut down in unscheduled fashion for  100 days. The inspectors suspected something untoward: The  shutdown of the reactor could have been used to remove some of  the fuel rods and extract 10 to 16 kg of plutonium from them.  The CIA immediately calculated that North Korea would be able  to make four or five nuclear bombs with this plutonium.  Patience was exhausted. An indignant Secretary of State  Christopher demanded firm and resolute measures. Kim Il-song  should not escape sanctions.  <H5>  What Is In the Leader's Mind? </H5>   A trade blockade is futile without the agreement of China,  which supplies the DPRK with 70 percent of its oil and 60  percent of its food. Beijing opposes sanctions against its  ally. Logic suggests that in the event of a vote in the  Security Council China would use its veto and block sanctions.  Kim Il-song calculates that this is indeed what would happen  and thus rests assured. Meanwhile he is making threatening  gestures, stating that the DPRK will respond to a trade war by a  real war.    What, then, is to be done about Kim Il-song? The first  option is to introduce sanctions in one way or another and, if  China refuses to go along with this, to do so sidestepping the  Security Council, risking a conflict on the peninsula provoked  by the North Koreans, with consequences which are difficult to  guess. The second option is to resign ourselves to Kim  Il-song's concealing plutonium for military purposes from the  IAEA.    This latter scenario is absolutely unacceptable. Not just  because it allows (even if only theoretically) the emergence of  a new nuclear power -- the very idea of it fills you with dread.  The most dangerous thing -- Washington, Moscow, Seoul, and  Beijing are agreed on this -- will be the undermining of the  international arrangements governing nonproliferation. And that  will be a real nightmare.    But the first option is frightening by virtue of its  unpredictability.    Observers come to the discomforting conclusion that there  will be no sensible solution to the Korean nuclear problem at  all as long as the present regime, which is concerned about its  own survival and the upcoming transfer of power from Kim Il-song  to his son, Kim Chong-il, exists in Pyongyang. Even if  Washington does give diplomatic recognition to Pyongyang -- this  is precisely what Kim Il-song is seeking, offering to freeze  nuclear developments in exchange -- North Korea will find  another way of keeping some other kind of "infernal secret" for  new bargaining or blackmail purposes.</p>

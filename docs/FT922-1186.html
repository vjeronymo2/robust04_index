			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Letter: Too much re-packaging of education initiatives Sir, The Training and Enterprise Council initiative - launched in March 1989  -seemed to many to be essentially the re-packaging of earlier government initiatives in the field of employment training and enterprise encouragement that proliferated in the 1980s. They included the Manpower Services Commission, Training Agencies, Enterprise Agencies, Local Employer Network Service. It was expected, or hoped, that the Tecs might rationalise and streamline many of them. TECs have not enjoyed the most enthusiastic of comments from the various constituencies they set out to serve. But for those of us who participated in some of these earlier initiatives and the discussions leading up to the establishment of Tecs, the news of a further initiative - Investors in People (Iip) - leaves them, as it does the Tecs and as you said your article 'Setting standards for the working classes' (Management, June 17), 'confused about how and to whom Iip should be marketed'. British society has in place a recently much improved and up-dated modernised educational medium, its colleges of further education. They are beginning to make good the deficiency noted as long ago as 1868 by a Royal Commission which commented on Britain's deficiency in technical education. This once 'neglected sector' is today serving an increased population of young people, of those returning to employment and those who have recognised the need for continuing education. I urge that, rather than further re-packaging of old initiatives, colleges of further education be given the necessary support to deliver their offerings even more effectively. As a footnote I would add that while these initiatives continue to proliferate, with the concomitant expenses and learning curves, this college, funded by the London Borough of Brent, has a current budget shortfall of Pounds 1m, the equivalent of 40 full-time staff.

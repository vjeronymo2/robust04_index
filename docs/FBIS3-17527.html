			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 27 Mar -- "Kazakhstan and Russia are tied by  stable links of friendship and fraternity going back centuries,"  President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan said in an  interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent on his way to Moscow.  He said: "The key factors cementing them are a common economy,  historical and cultural traditions, and a common mentality."  Therefore, Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized, "nobody will ever  manage to sow discord between our peoples. Although such  attempts have already been made and are still being made by some  irresponsible politicians."    "Take, for instance, the problem of dual citizenship," the  Kazakhstan president said. "Many countries, including Russia,  do not provide for this. So the question arises: Can this be  introduced in Kazakhstan when it is just beginning to construct  its statehood and when more than half of its citizens are not  native inhabitants? This would put the republic's citizens at a  disadvantage at the outset, dividing them into people of first  and second class. Would it not be better for everyone to create  equal conditions and have everything correspond to the demands  of peaceful, world standards, and to make borders transparent by  concluding the appropriate intergovernmental agreements? Then,  for instance, persons wishing to move to a permanent place of  residence in Russia would be automatically given Russian  citizenship, and if they return to Kazakhstan, Kazakh  citizenship would be given just as freely. If that were to  happen, no one would ever again raise the question of the need  for dual citizenship."    As to the essence of the forthcoming talks with the Russian  Federation president, is concerned, the Kazakh chief of state  said the main purpose of the meeting with Boris Yeltsin is to  remove the problems which have accumulated in relations between  the two countries. Experts have worked throughout the year on  ways of resolving many of them and there is no doubt that mutual  understanding will be found.    Nursultan Nazarbayev went on to say that the first thing at  issue will be military cooperation. He said: "We had a single  army, a single weaponry, a single military school, and these  ties should not be broken, especially since we are friendly  states. In our time we have already reached a relevant  agreement on friendship, cooperation, and military aid, and I  think normal conditions should be created for the Russian Army  to use the military test ranges on Kazakhstan's soil."    "A second problem -- Baykonur -- should also be resolved,  Nursultan Nazarbayev continued. "This is a unique facility, the  only one of its kind. I think that tomorrow the Russian side  and ourselves will find mutually acceptable conditions for its  use in the interests both of Kazakhstan and of the Russian  Federation.    All unresolved problems concerning humanitarian links,  including civilian ones, must be resolved. People's freedom of  movement across the border must be guaranteed. Economic  problems must also be resolved; they concern many aspects of our  cooperation. We expect over 20 specific documents to be signed  here.    Nursultan Nazarbayev stressed, in particular, that he  personally would like matters to be conducted in such a way as  to ensure that there are never any problems at all in the  dialogue between Russia and Kazakhstan. The Kazakhstan  president said the two countries are fated, "in the best sense  of that word, to be always together. After all, the economies of  our republics represent in many ways a single production  mechanism. In particular, the world's biggest coalfields in  Pavlodar Oblast send most of the fuel they mine to the Russian  Federation. Siberia and the Far East provide Kazakhstan with  the lion's share of its industrial timber requirements. It is  not difficult to imagine what our countries would be deprived of  if such reciprocal deliveries were halted. For it would take  Russia not just tens of years, but also vast and presently  nonexistent resources, to develop its coalfields, just as it  would Kazakhstan to grow its forests."    Nursultan Nazarbayev said the exchange of opinions on the  "situation in the Commonwealth and on ways to give it a more  concrete and effective content will occupy an important place in  his conversation with Boris Yeltsin. The fact of the matter is  that all the heads of states are already saying that the  Commonwealth is necessary, that it is a great future. At the  same time, little is being done in practice to strengthen the  processes of integration. One wonders how long some political  leaders, and not just them, will continue to harbor a panicky  fear that the empire will be revived? It has already been  consigned to history. It's time for all to realize that fact  once and for all and to begin restoring the economic ties which  have been ruptured. Otherwise the economy of our countries will  never get out of the crisis."</p>

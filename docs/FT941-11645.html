			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Europe's next flashpoint With the election of Mr Yuri Meshkov as president of Crimea, Ukraine has taken another step towards the fate of Croatia. Crimea stands in relation to Ukraine much as the enclave of Knin did to Croatia in 1990. For Serbs, read Russians. Mr Meshkov, an ethnic Russian like 70 per cent of the Crimean population (a figure ominously close to the 73 per cent of the electorate which voted for him last Sunday), favours reuniting Crimea with Russia, from which it was severed administratively when Khrushchev transferred it to Ukraine in 1954, and politically when the Soviet Union broke up into its constituent republics at the end of 1991. He has toned down his rhetoric on this point, to avoid an immediate confrontation with the Ukrainian authorities, but is still planning to hold a referendum in March on 'an independent Crimea in union with other CIS states', a move which Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk regards as unconstitutional. Ukraine has treated its ethnic minorities, including Russians, much more tactfully than Croatia did its Serb minority. So far Russians elsewhere in Ukraine are not emulating those of Crimea, and even in Crimea there has as yet been mercifully little violence. But the potential for clashes is very great, if Mr Meshkov tries to set up his own militia, or if Ukrainian national guards try to stop him going ahead with his referendum. Russian troops belonging to the Black Sea fleet in Sebastopol might all too easily become involved, as other Russian units have in comparable struggles in Georgia and Moldova. Underestimate The previous Russian parliament laid formal claim to Crimea as Russian territory, and the new one is hardly likely to be less nationalistic. Indeed, few Russians of any political persuasion seem to regard Ukraine's independence as serious or permanent. Most dangerously, many seem to underestimate both the capacity and the willingness of Ukraine's armed forces to fight. Talk of war 'between two nuclear powers' may be excessively alarmist, since Ukraine is not really a nuclear power. The ex-Soviet strategic weapons still based on its territory are pointed at US targets and controlled by Moscow, if anybody. Even so, war between Russia and Ukraine would be a much more serious affair than the wars we have seen so far in Moldova, Transcaucasia or even Yugoslavia. It could involve very large forces, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and many millions of refugees. It would create a feeling of acute insecurity throughout central Europe, and almost inevitably mark the beginning of a new cold war between Russia and the west - a cold war perhaps even more dangerous than the last, with Russia under less stable and more openly nationalistic leadership. Ukraine's frontiers Western governments should be doing everything possible to avert this prospect. An outright guarantee to come to Ukraine's defence against Russia would hardly be credible, but they should make it clear that they would not turn a blind eye to any violation of Ukraine's frontiers. Russia itself has repeatedly recognised those frontiers - most recently in the tripartite agreement between Presidents Clinton, Kravchuk and Yeltsin on January 14, under which the remaining missiles in Ukraine are to be dismantled. Intervention by the Black Sea fleet or any other Russian units in internal Ukrainian fighting would clearly infringe that agreement. If Russia expresses anxiety about the fate of ethnic Russians in Crimea or elsewhere, the west could offer a preventive deployment of UN forces. Such a deployment has helped stabilise the situation in Macedonia. But the west would also have to make it very clear to Ukraine that western support is conditional not only on the Ukrainian parliament ratifying the tripartite agreement, but also on it adopting policies which can unite Ukraine's people, regardless of nationality. There is just a chance of that happening if the elections in March produce a parliament in which western nationalists and eastern economic reformers work together, accepting that Ukraine can be independent and yet retain close economic and cultural ties with Russia. The relationship between Austria and Germany provides a possible model.</p>

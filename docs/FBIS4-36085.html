			<p>BFN     [Text] The British Embassy in Beirut today expressed  London's extreme concern over the recent escalation of violence  in the south, particularly in the wake of the Israeli raid  against a Hizballah center near Ba'labakk. The embassy  emphasized Britain's position, which fully supports the  implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425, and called  for the restoration of the Lebanese Government's effective  authority over all Lebanese territory.</p>

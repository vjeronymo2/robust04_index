			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> SCHOOL CUTS IN ARTS FOUGHT  </P> <P> A standing-room-only crowd of about 450 students, parents and district  employees protested potential cuts in programs and personnel at Tuesday night's  board meeting of the Alhambra City School District.  </P> <P> Most of the comments were about possible elimination of district elementary  music and art programs.  </P> <P> "We feel we should still have the program," said Celeste Flores, 12, who is  learning to play the flute. "Some children don't have the money for special  classes."  </P> <P> Others spoke out against potential staff reductions that could eliminate as  many as 27 jobs and deprive other employees of health benefits.  </P> <P> The cuts were adopted Nov. 6, then rescinded a week later. Since then,  administrators and union negotiators have been discussing alternate cures for a  $600,000 budget deficit.  </P></p>

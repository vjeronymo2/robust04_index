			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: New equity product for US retail investors A NEW type of equity product could soon provide US retail investors with access to an investment strategy commonly used by institutional investors. The first such product is expected to be listed on the American Stock Exchange (Amex) next month, and further offerings, totalling close to Dollars 1bn, are already in the pipeline, as banks rush to gain a foothold in a potentially lucrative new market. Known as equity participation trusts, these products will recreate for individuals the practice of 'covered-call writing' - the common technique among institutional investors of writing call options against a portfolio of shares. More particularly, they will allow retail investors to mimic a 'buy-write' strategy, which involves simultaneously buying shares and selling call options on the shares as a means of enhancing returns. Short-Term Equity Participation Units (Steps), jointly developed by Morgan Stanley, will be the first off the block. The Amex will list 2m units in a three-year trust, called Technology Equity and Income Trust, which will hold a basket of 12 technology stocks, sell call options against them, and invest the proceeds from the call options in US Treasury strips (bonds which have been stripped of their coupons). Similar products, based on other market sectors, include PaineWebber's Trust from Income Participation from Stocks (Tips); and Goldman Sachs is planning a product called Stairs (Short Term Appreciation and Income Return Shares). Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter developed their product in response to growing retail demand for Preference Equity Redemption Cumulative Stock (Percs) - essentially a buy-write strategy sold by a company on its own stocks. 'The first Percs were sold mainly to institutions, but a high percentage of the follow-on demand has been at retail level,' said Mr Richard Sandulli, vice-president, corporate finance at Dean Witter. While Percs allow investors to pursue a buy-write strategy on a single stock, Steps apply the technique to a whole market sector. The technology sector was chosen because technology stocks typically offer little or no yield, but are highly volatile. The product allows investors to earn more yield, though a portion of the upside potential of the stocks is given up. Steps were due to be listed on the Amex at the beginning of the month, but the listing has been delayed by a regulatory problem with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The structure 'will provide retail investors with a relatively inexpensive means of adopting a sophisticated investment strategy,' said Mr John Braddock, a director of the capital markets group at Amex.</p>

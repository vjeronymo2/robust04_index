			<p>BFN     [Text] President Kim Yong-sam yesterday called for active  preparation for the world trend to link environmental protection  with trade.    Kim said, "The structure of industry has to be transformed  into one which consumes less energy."    The Chief Executive made the remarks during a report from  the  Advisory Council for Science and Technology at Chongwadae  [presidential offices].    After the report, the President hosted a lunch for the 10  council members and seven related Cabinet ministers on the  occasion of the first anniversary of the council inauguration.    President Kim also said that products which do not  contaminate the environment much have to constitute the  mainstream of exports, calling for added efforts to foster  people's awareness of environmental protection and energy  conservation.    Pointing out the fierce confrontation between the United  States and France during the Uruguay Round negotiations,  President Kim accented that a comprehensive plan should be  mapped out to sharpen the national competitiveness of the  domestic video industry in preparation for the coming multimedia  era.    "Our video industry, in fact, has been lagging far behind  those of advanced countries chiefly because of a lack of  creative ideas and financial shortcomings. This problem should  not be left unattended," he said.    He emphasized the fact that the video industry is a more  value added one than manufacturing and will become promising in  the coming century.    Kim added that national leap into the ranks of advanced  nations is possible only when science and technology backs,  calling for development of Korean technology.    Prof. Pak U-hui of Seoul National University said that  government officials' understanding of science and technology  development remains low in terms of budget allocation and law.    He also said that officials are not catching up with the  change of times. President Kim said that the officials have to  change their way of thinking in the era of the World Trade  Organization.</p>

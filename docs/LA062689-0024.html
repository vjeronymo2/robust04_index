			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PICASSO, J.S. BACH MAY VOTE IN BAJA ELECTION;  </P> <P> EVIDENCE OF FRAUD RAISES FEARS THAT PRI IS GEARING UP FOR RIGGED VICTORY  </P> <P> The alchemists of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party have been  mixing their potions, it is said, along the deep-rutted streets of the  squatter's community known as Camino Verde.  </P> <P> The product of these latter-day conjurers, critics say, is not gold yielded  from lead, but rather the raw material of which elections are made: votes.  </P> <P> They have been successful to the extent of inflating the voting rolls in Camino  Verde -- a pro ruling-party stronghold -- by more than threefold, opposition  leaders charge. And that's just in one neighborhood.  </P> <P> "We've found that the fraud has been massive and crude," said Cecilia Barone de  Castellanos, campaign coordinator in Tijuana for the opposition National Action  Party, as she brandished pages of allegedly phony voter registration  credentials from Camino Verde.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Casting a Spell  </P> <P> It's election time in Mexico, and the nation's peculiar electoral alquimia --  alchemy, as electoral fraud is not-so-fondly known here -- appears to be  casting as mesmerizing a spell as ever.  </P> <P> With the campaign for Sunday's elections drawing to a close -- up for grabs are  the Baja California governor's seat, four municipal governments and 15 state  legislative slots -- allegations of voting misdeeds have begun to dominate  headlines here. The election has attracted international attention, as Mexico's  ruling party, known by its Spanish acronym as the PRI, faces the possibility of  losing control of a governor's seat for the first time in history.  </P> <P> Throughout Baja California, official figures show that the total number of  registered voters has risen by more than 10% in the past four months -- a  proportionately huge increase that opposition leaders say is evidence of  tampering.  </P> <P> On Friday, the muckraking weekly Zeta published allegations that even the  departed have been called on to vote in Ensenada. The newspaper published a  copy of the death certificate of one registered voter, Jose Sanchez Meza, who  passed away on Jan. 6, 1988.  </P> <P> "Miracles of the Electoral Commission," read the headline. "The dead are  revived and will vote."  </P> <P> Such charges are as much a part of the electoral fabric of Mexico these days as  blaring loudspeakers, mass rallies and giveaways of food and other amenities.  Just last week, the opposition National Action Party said that it found 15,000  ballots already marked in favor of the PRI in the bathroom of a government  printing office in northern Chihuahua state, where hotly contested elections  are also slated for Sunday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fraud Part of Process  </P> <P> While fraud has been part of the Mexican electoral fabric for decades, the  growing strength of Mexico's opposition parties has focused increased attention  on the phenomenon. Also, opposition leaders have had additional resources to  document the problem.  </P> <P> This year's allegations, complete with apparently substantive evidence of clear  irregularities, observers say, tend to undermine claims by Mexico's President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took office Dec. 1, that he is committed to  electoral reform and a true democratic opening. Opponents maintain that Salinas  himself owes his position to a rigged vote last summer.  </P> <P> "Mexico City can bemoan (fraud) and denounce it, but its continued presence  illustrates the continuing problem of control over what the party does at the  state and local levels," said Wayne A. Cornelius, director of the Center for  U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego. "It's going to be very difficult to  police the actions of PRI apparatchiks and government types at local levels to  prevent the usual shenanigans from going on again."  </P> <P> As always, the chief target of such allegations is the all-pervasive ruling  party, the PRI, which has dominated Mexican politics for six decades. Since its  founding in 1929, the PRI has never lost the presidency or a single governor's  seat. Until last July's elections, in which President Salinas of the PRI won a  narrow and much-disputed victory over a popular opposition leader, PRI  presidential candidates routinely commanded 75% of the vote or more -- almost  unheard-of majorities in true multi-party systems.  </P> <P> "The PRI always wins, doesn't it?" is a frequent response in Mexico to  inquiries about prospective election results.  </P> <P> Although PRI officials say their hands are clean, few independent observers  dispute the fact that fraud on a scale unimagined by even the late Chicago  Mayor Richard Daley has been an integral part of the system in Mexican  politics. Traditionally, observers say, PRI leaders have resorted to fakery  even when they didn't have to, eager as they were to amass the largest  majorities possible in their districts, the better to curry favor with party  leaders. It was a way of climbing the PRI success ladder.  </P> <P> In what many analysts consider a hopeful sign, the PRI mayor of the northern  Mexican city of Hermosillo, Mexico, recently resigned from office after being  charged with electoral fraud. Experts gathered at a conference on U.S-Mexico  relations in San Diego last week said they could recall no similar case.  </P> <P> But, among opposition politicians, hope for a true political opening is dimming  with every new allegation of fraud by PRI loyalists.  </P> <P> "We are constantly frustrated by fraud and other electoral chicanery," charged  Diego Fernandez Cevallos, a member of the national committee of the National  Action Party (PAN) during the San Diego conference last week. PAN officials  have alleged that their candidates have been robbed in rigged elections in  recent years throughout the nation, notably in the northern border states of  Chihuahua and Sonora. They fear the same in Baja.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Charge of Sour Grapes  </P> <P> In the view of PRI leaders, such allegations amount to sour grapes on the part  of opposition leaders unable to mount successful campaigns. While PAN activists  charge the ruling party with creating a "culture of fraud," PRI officials  respond that the allegation is simply something to fall back on with every new  defeat at the polls.  </P> <P> "National Action tries to cultivate this image of electoral fraud being  everywhere," said Bernardo Sanchez Rios, a federal senator from Tijuana who is  the president of the city's PRI committee. "They want to cover up for their  losses. That's what this is about."  </P> <P> But charges of fraud emanate from most every opposition party, not just the  PAN. Leaders of the reformist Party of the Democratic Revolution, which is also  contesting the elections in Baja California, joined in denouncing the alleged  deception in Baja California.  </P> <P> "I don't see where the PRI is respecting the integrity of this election,"  Martha Maldonado, the party's gubernatorial election, said in an interview  Friday.  </P> <P> In the case of Camino Verde, a Tijuana neighborhood long regarded as a  veritable PRI fiefdom often independent of municipal control, opposition  parties have reported that voter registration rolls mushroomed from 8,769 to  29,741 -- more than tripling -- during April, the cutoff month for  registration. (Residents must be 18 to vote in Mexico; before registering, they  must present authorities with evidence of their identity and residence. Some  weeks later, they receive their official voting credentials; their fingerprints  are kept on file.)  </P> <P> Presumably, the newly registered voters of Camino Verde would cast their  ballots for PRI candidates. The names of relatives of a number of community  party leaders were listed multiple times, according to examinations of official  records by opponents and the press.  </P> <P> There were also some more singular names. Among those registered to vote: Pablo  Picasso and Juan Sebastian Bach.  </P> <P> When National Action officials attempted to verify matters in the streets of  Camino Verde earlier this month, they maintain that they were obstructed by  thugs who broke vehicle windows and punctured tires. They left.  </P> <P> Officials such as the PRI's Sanchez describe such vote-registration  irregularities as "human" mistakes that are being rectified, and will not  affect the voting tally. They point out that the the State Election Commission,  which oversees the voting process, is an independent body. Commission  officials, whose independence has been questioned by the opposition, have  denied there is any evidence of wrongdoing in Baja.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Questioned Sharp Rise  </P> <P> Opposition leaders have questioned the recent sharp rise in the voting rolls in  Baja California -- the numbers grew by some 82,000 in the past four months,  with the total now topping 900,000 eligible voters. Between 1986 and 1988, the  latter a presidential election year, the number of eligible voters rose by  fewer than 575.  </P> <P> Ernesto Ruffo Appel, Baja gubernatorial candidate of the opposition PAN,  attributed the increase in an interview principally to a rise in fraudulent  registrations by the ruling PRI.  </P> <P> But Arturo Guerra Flores, general secretary of government for Baja California,  traced the big hike to a series of less sinister factors, including voter  registration campaigns by various parties and heightened interest in the  elections. "There has been absolutely no fraud," Guerra declared during an  interview Saturday at his office in Mexicali. Guerra, who twice served as state  president of the ruling PRI, presides over the state administration of the  voting.  </P> <P> The opposition has filed a criminal complaint in connection with the Camino  Verde case, and is calling for a complete sanitizing of the voting rolls --  although it is unclear how that could be accomplished before election day. PAN  officials have even raised the possibility of withdrawing their candidates from  the elections. But that would be a drastic step -- and potentially  counterproductive.  </P> <P> Apart from inflating vote totals, the electoral fraud could have another  impact: Higher abstention. Political apathy has led growing numbers of Mexican  voters to abandon the polls on election day; some fear that renewed reports of  "alchemy" could accelerate the trend, even in heated contests such as those in  Baja California.  </P> <P> "Some people will say, 'Why vote? It's not worth it,' " noted J. Jesus  Blancornelas, editor of the weekly Zeta.  </P> <P> But, at a voting registration office in the Colonia Libertad last week,  business was brisk. Among those picking up credentials was Jose Luis Ortega,  20, who said he was going to cast his first ballot ever.  </P> <P> "I'm voting for the PRI," Ortega told a reporter afterward. "They always win,  don't they?"  </P> <P> Times staff writer Marjorie Miller contributed to this story.  </P></p>

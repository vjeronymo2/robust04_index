			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NO. 2 HOPES TO CATCH NO. 1 IN BEACH VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> It's a deceiving game of tag. In pursuit is most of women's pro beach  volleyball. Being pursued is the top-ranked and seemingly unstoppable team of  Brazil's Jackie Silva and San Juan Capistrano's Janice Opalinski.  </P> <P> But one pair is drawing closer than the rest.  </P> <P> In the first two stops of the Flamingo Hilton Women's Pro Beach Volleyball  Tour, Silva and Opalinski went undefeated in the double-elimination format for  back-to-back championships. Losing twice in each stop -- all four times to  Silva and Opalinski -- were second-ranked Patty Dodd of Colombia and Karolyn  Kirby of San Diego, who have finished second each time.  </P> <P> The hunt continues today at the San Diego Open, the third stop on the tour.  After Saturday's opening rounds at Pacific Beach, only four teams remain in the  championship bracket. Dodd-Kirby and Silva-Opalinski are among them.  </P> <P> Beginning with the semifinals at 9:30 a.m., Dodd and Kirby will attempt to  break what has become routine: make it to the final of the winner's bracket,  lose to Silva-Opalinski, win the consolation final and lose to Silva-Opalinski  again in the championship final. Last week in Santa Barbara, Silva-Opalinski  won, 15-13. It was the most points anyone has scored against them.  </P> <P> "Patty and I have the ability to beat them," said Kirby, 28, one of the newest  and most successful members of the beach tour. "In time, we can be the best  team on the beach."  </P> <P> How much time is anyone's guess. Kathy Gregory, a tour veteran and ESPN  commentator, said they have all the physical talent -- it's the mental  preparation they need to improve.  </P> <P> "They have all the tools," Gregory said, "but it's hard to go against Jackie  and Janice. Their mental game is so much better than anyone else. You have to  be hungry, and I don't know if they're as hungry as Janice and Jackie are."  </P> <P> Said Kirby: "A lot of what we've done is on athletic ability only. The mental  game is such a big part of it. Jackie and Janice go out to win. A lot of teams  go out trying not to lose. They are so intense. We're trying to get to that  point."  </P> <P> It is the first season together for both Silva-Opalinski and Dodd-Kirby, but  after Silva's total dominance of the tour last year -- she won 11 of 14 stops  with two different partners -- and with Kirby still learning the finer points  of the beach game, Dodd and Kirby have more catching up to do.  </P> <P> "I think Karolyn's a great athlete," said Dodd, a five-year veteran. "She's  complete in all her skills, but she's not at the peak of her game."  </P> <P> Before Dodd-Kirby get another shot at Silva-Opalinski, they must first get past  a pair of former Olympians, the No. 6 team of Linda Carrillo (Van Nuys) and  Angela Rock (San Diego). They sent the only all-San Diego team, third-ranked  Lori Kotas and Gail Castro, to the loser's bracket with a 15-5 victory.  </P></p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Arts: Measure for Measure - Theatre The fortunes of Shakespeare's lesser-known plays cast a fascinating light on social attitudes. The modern age tunes in clearly to the wavelength of Troilus and Cressida, for example, with its bleak cynicism towards romantic love and bilious vision of ruling classes bickering over war as they would at croquet. Now comes a Measure for Measure which underlines our current obsession with the private weaknesses of public figures, homing in on the outward puritan who burns with inner lust. Angelo's hypocrisy is less important than his abuse of power as ducal deputy to gratify his lust. Unlike today's British popular press, the Elizabethans distinguished between the domestic habits and the professional abilities of their rulers. They would not automatically agree that a bureaucrat is unfitted to negotiate defence contracts, say, because he wears panty-hose at home, when indeed the reverse might well be true. Cheek by Jowl has toured its new version through such exotic localities as Tokyo, Rio, St Petersburg and Darlington. At the Lyric, Hammersmith, for a month, Declan Donnellan's updated production begins ominously. With Peter Lilley's hairline and John Gummer's devoutness, the sleekly-suited career politician Angelo portends heavy-handed satire. Will the well-meaning but out of touch Duke be played as Prince Charles? When he yells 'Supply me with the habit]' is he demanding a monkish gown or a quick fix? The production is not that crass. Over the years Cheek by Jowl has evolved a style that might be defined as the unthinking man's Jonathan Miller. This can result in freshness and vitality or the overegged pudding of a Twelfth Night when almost every line was re-interpreted, even working in an implied affair between a weepy Feste and a hunky Texan Aguecheek. The suspicion lingers that the company's main aim is to show A-level students that the classics can be cool. The new Measure for Measure avoids such excesses. It skips through the low-life scenes with restraint (Mistress Overdone is modelled on a Dora Bryan chirpy tart, c1950). It inspires some excellent acting. It oddly makes little of the central dilemma - should Isabella sleep with the man who can spare her brother's life? - and leaves a moral puzzle at the play's heart. For Stephen Boxer's Duke, incognito among his subjects and foiling his deputy's tyranny in the nick of time, is seen as a melodramatically excitable and really rather silly protagonist of a silent-screen cliff-hanger. He is cut down to size as a meddler who toys with people's lives. The final scene of retribution, reconciliation and mercy finds the assembled company grim-faced with resentment. The Duke has played God and we live in a secular age. This is 20th-century editorialising; if you accept the Duke, not Angelo, as the (unwitting) villain of the piece, it paints a desolate picture of a society with no point of moral reference. It also turns Lucio into a romantic hero. The 'fantastic', a louche man-about-town, parasite and name-dropper, is brilliantly seen as a gossip-columnist figure. One of life's free lunchers, he blossoms in scabrous anecdotage about his alleged familiarity with the great. In Mark Bazeley's performance, a near-schizoid awareness gives glimpses of self-loathing. In this climate of rottenness even the most blameless character is reduced to status of bawd: the jilted Mariana is a cackling drunk, though when allowed to Marianne Jean-Baptiste shows a moving dignity. Yet even in this corrupt Vienna, there are two performances that would fit magnificently into a traditional production. Anastasia Hille's Isabella, long-eyed and with the wide mouth of a Greek tragic mask, begins as fluttery, uncertainly bossy as she pleads for her brother, meeting Angelo's pedantry with her own. Her eventual focus on rage, shock and grief is almost painful to watch. Adam Kotz lends Angelo tragic stature: the dry, bloodless inhumanity that can blaze helplessly into passion. Even in sexual blackmail, his bureaucratic logic remains: he rightly makes 'Who will believe thee, Isabel?' the most chilling line in the play.</p>

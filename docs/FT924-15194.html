			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Letter: Germans dislike V2 celebration Sir, As both a citizen and a member of a reputable German company, I would like you to know that the majority of Germans were left speechless by the intention of the German aerospace industry federation to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first V2 rocket launching from Peenemunde. In my own way, I have sought to remind senior executives and appropriate authorities how totally wrong, even abominable, such a commemoration must be both to Germans and British citizens, who after all have set out to once and for all create a genuine spirit of a united Europe. Yet, you are probably aware that many Germans are under the impression that many British citizens have become suspicious and have deve-loped rather reserved opinions about the Germans following the reunification of this country. It was by no means wise for Britain to erect a monument to Sir Arthur Harris, who was responsible for the bombing of Dresden in February 1945. F A Wolf, Lortzingstrasse 8, 7012 Fellbach-Oeffingen, Germany</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROBBER FIRES HANDGUN IN HUNTINGTON BEACH BANK  </P> <P> A man who escaped with money from several tellers after firing a shot in an  unoccupied area of a bank remained at large on Saturday, police said.  </P> <P> The robber entered a branch of Security Pacific Bank, 16811 Algonquin St., at  5:10 p.m. Friday and fired one shot from a handgun at a window in the building,  said Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Louis Ochoa.  </P> <P> No one was standing near the window and none of the 20 employees and customers  inside the bank was injured, Ochoa said.  </P> <P> "I guess it was a way of getting (the people's) attention," Ochoa said. "He  told everybody in the bank that it was a robbery."  </P> <P> The suspect then went to each of five teller windows, put an undisclosed amount  of cash into a bag, and fled out the front door, Ochoa said.  </P> <P> The suspect is described as a man of medium build in his late 30s, 5-foot-9  with black curly hair and a beard. He was wearing sunglasses, a brown cap and  dark pants.  </P> <P> Investigators believe the weapon used was a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol.  </P></p>

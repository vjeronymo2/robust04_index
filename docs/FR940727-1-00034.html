			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> EPA plans to propose mercury emission limits for new and existing municipal waste combustors in 1994 (U.S. EPA, 1991a). The mercury emission limits will be based on the use of activated carbon injection for mercury control as demonstrated by EPA at tests at the Stanislaus municipal waste combustor (California) and Camden municipal waste combustor (New Jersey). These tests demonstrated activated carbon injection technology as available for post-combustion mercury control at municipal waste combustors and achieved mercury reduction levels of 80 to 90 percent. During the tests, activated carbon was injected into the flue gases upstream of the acid gas control system and collected (with the mercury) in the particulate matter control system. The ash from the particulate matter control system was then landfilled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is unclear to what degree the mercury being released from municipal waste combustors would contribute to increased mercury levels in surface waters because the transport and cycling of atmospheric mercury emissions are complex and poorly understood. It is uncertain how long mercury will stay in the atmosphere after being released. The oxidation state of mercury dictates how long it remains in the air. Elemental mercury could stay in the atmosphere for months to years, whereas an oxidized species of mercury would stay for only days to weeks. Although controversy remains over the form of mercury as it leaves the MWC stack, it is likely that mercury from a municipal waste combustor would be more oxidized and therefore would not remain in the atmosphere for a long period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, since MWC facilities comprise one anthropogenic source of atmospheric mercury, there are probably regional-scale or global-scale impacts from such sources (Glass et al., 1986/Johnson, 1987). The elimination of mercury-containing lamps from municipal waste combustors would reduce annual atmospheric mercury emissions from these significant sources by around 3 metric tons, or about 3 percent of the total mercury-bearing waste that is incinerated. The Agency is considering proposing air emission controls for mercury later this year which would, when implemented, reduce these emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> (2) Mercury in Landfill Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> EPA evaluated emissions of mercury in landfill gas emission in its ``Preliminary Risk Assessment'' which is available in the public docket (EPA, 1993). EPA reviewed studies on the amount of mercury that may be released to the air from municipal solid waste landfills. Specifically, this section presents in detail the results of two studies that attempt to measure mercury air releases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Swiss study (Baccini et al., 1987) measured the amount of landfill gas from four municipal landfills. This study is comparable to municipal solid waste landfills in the U.S. because the study indicated that these Swiss MSW landfills contained approximately 2 parts per million (ppm) of mercury, which, given the standard error range, is comparable to the approximately 3.6 ppm of mercury in U.S. municipal solid waste (U.S. EPA, 1990). The Swiss study indicated that mercury concentrations in landfill gases had a mean value of about 0.4 &mu;g/cubic meter. The annual total mercury release also was low (0.0065 mg/Mg waste, average). Using this gas release value, and the amount of municipal solid waste annually disposed in U.S. landfills (118 million Mg), the amount of mercury annually released in landfill gas can be estimated as 0.8 kg, about 0.0001 percent of the total mercury load entering MSW landfills (643 Mg). Adjusting the proportion of total mercury contributed by mercury-containing lamps to the MSW stream (3.8 percent), provides an estimate of annual landfill gas emissions from lamps of about 0.03 kg, less than 0.00001 percent of the total municipal solid waste mercury input (EPA, 1993). The amount of mercury from lamps emitted into the atmosphere by landfill gas is very small (.00003 Mg) when compared to the 3 Mg of mercury from lamps that is estimated to be emitted into the atmosphere through municipal waste combustors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also received a study (National Environmental Protection Board et al, 1989) in a comment to the Universal Waste Proposal that provided data on mercury gas from four municipal landfills in Sweden. The Swedish study measured the ambient air quality above four municipal landfills. The study did not indicate the level of mercury in the municipal landfills. Mercury was measured using differential optical adsorption spectroscopy (DOAS), located two meters above the landfill, compared with background mercury concentrations measured at each of the four landfills. The mean ranged from 10.2 ng/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to 23.6 ng/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  with background mercury levels at 4 ng/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to 8ng/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The report stated that because all measurements were close to the detection limit for the DOAS technique, the reliability of the results was questioned. After a review, it was determined that although the quantification was uncertain because of a low signal-to-noise ratio, the concentration above the landfills was significantly above background mercury levels, indicating that mercury was being released to the atmosphere. However, since it is unknown how much mercury is found in Swedish municipal solid waste landfills, the results of this study cannot be readily compared to the situation in the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

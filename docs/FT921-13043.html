			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Tecs to confront Howard over planned training cuts CHIEF executives from more than half of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) took the unprecedented step yesterday of asking their chairmen to take concerns over proposed cuts in training funds directly to the government. G10, the group of 10 chairmen that presents the views of Tecs to Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, meets on Monday to discuss the present round of negotiations over this year's Tec budgets. It is understood that most of the 82 chief executives in England and Wales broadly support the concerns of the 42 who met yesterday in Derby. The Department of Employment plans a 'substantial reduction' in the weekly contributions for Youth Training, its main scheme for people aged 16 to 18, and for Employment Training, the scheme for long-unemployed adults. The department, under pressure from the Treasury, wants increased volumes of training in 1992-93 for roughly the same amount of money as in 1991-92. The chief executives said yesterday that although it was up to Tecs to negotiate individually with the government there was also room for a common approach. They feared that if cuts were made they would not be able to guarantee training places to all young people who wanted them. They also worry that quality of training may deteriorate. One chief executive said: 'We are concerned that we might not be able to deliver high-quality qualifications.' The chief executives said they thought the Treasury saw Tecs as deliverers of the two main training programmes and had little understanding of their wider role, such as prompting employers to improve their own training. Apex Trust, the charity that provides training and job help for ex-offenders, was placed in administration by the High Court today. The court-appointed administrators have about four weeks to try to bring off a rescue operation for the financially troubled trust.</p>

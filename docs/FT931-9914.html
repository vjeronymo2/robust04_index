			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Acas workload jumps to record ACAS, the conciliation service, dealt with a record 72,166 unfair dismissal and discrimination claims last year - almost 20 per cent more than in 1991. The rising workload of the service, which has a statutory duty to conciliate between employees and employers before a case goes to an industrial tribunal, indicates the increased reliance of individuals and unions on the law to resolve disputes. It also reflects the continued rise in unemployment as individuals made redundant claim that employers have failed to meet statutory or collectively negotiated provisions governing redundancy procedures. Sex discrimination claims rose 66 per cent to 5,778. Almost 40 per cent more people brought claims that employers had failed to pay wages or benefits laid down by wages councils under the Wages Act. The number of people claiming racial discrimination rose almost 20 per cent to 1,748. Acas said 35 per cent of all claims were settled, 31 per cent were withdrawn and 34 per cent were heard by an industrial tribunal. Acas said the figures were consistent with the service's expectation. It also said the increasing demand for conciliation meant diverting resources from its advisory service.</p>

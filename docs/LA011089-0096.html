			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> HOME CARE STUDY AIMS AT SENIORS  </P> <P> Several hundred elderly Santa Monica residents will receive physical exams and  other health care at home under a pilot program conducted by the Santa Monica  Senior Health and Peer Counseling Center and UCLA's Multicampus Division of  Geriatric Medicine.  </P> <P> Under a $657,143 grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation of Battle Creek,  Mich., to study the effects of in-home preventive health care on the elderly,  researchers are contacting 2,700 Santa Monica residents who are age 75 or older  to find at least 600 people willing to participate in the project, according to  project director Harriet Aronow. Of those, 300 will be visited by nurses,  interviewed and given physical examinations, and their progress will be  monitored for at least two years, she said.  </P> <P> The other participants will be a comparison group for whom no services are  provided. Dr. Laurence Rubenstein, one of the coordinators of the project, said  similar studies in Europe have shown that in-home assessment and intervention  lower the mortality rate, reduce the need for hospitalization and cut medical  costs for senior citizens.  </P></p>

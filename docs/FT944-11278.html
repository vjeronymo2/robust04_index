			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ambroveneto claims bid by BCI is doomed to fail Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, the Italian bank, claimed at the weekend that the takeover planned by Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) and announced only last week was already doomed to fail. Mr Giovanni Bazoli, Ambroveneto's chairman, confirmed on Saturday that the bank's largest shareholders had agreed to renew and reinforce their defensive pact, which controls a majority of the bank's shares. BCI wants to buy a 50.1 per cent stake in Ambroveneto for about L1,750bn (Dollars 1.1bn), as the rationalisation of the highly fragmented Italian banking sector gathers pace. Another big Italian bank, Credito Italiano (Credit), is preparing to bid more than L2,000bn for a majority stake in the Bologna-based Credito Romagnolo (Rolo). Neither bank has yet tabled a formal offer. Mr Bazoli said at the weekend that Ambroveneto would strengthen its links with its two largest shareholders, Credit Agricole of France, and Crediop, part of San Paolo di Torino, Italy's largest banking group, each of which owns just over 15 per cent of the bank. Under the terms of the shareholder pact, they will buy most of the 13.52 per cent stake offered to them by a group of small banks from the Veneto region. Another shareholder - Gruppo Banca San Paolo di Brescia  - has agreed to maintain its 12.7 per cent stake as part of the pact. BCI has so far declined to comment on the latest developments, let alone admitted defeat. Ambroveneto's shareholders have also remained silent, but Mr Bazoli believes the bank is now impregnable. 'Integration (with BCI) would have destroyed half the value built up over 12 years of rebuilding Ambroveneto,' he said on Saturday. Alleanza, the Italian insurer which owns 12 per cent of Ambroveneto, has still not decided whether to renew its commitment to the shareholder pact. Alleanza is part of Generali, Italy's biggest insurer. It is seen as an ally of BCI because all three companies are linked to Mediobanca, the influential Milan-based merchant bank. Meanwhile, Credit has taken on JP Morgan, the US investment bank, and Vitale Borghese, an Italian merchant bank, to advise on its bid for Rolo. The Bologna bank, which is being advised by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs of the US, has resisted the Credit approach and is planning a defensive merger with its local rival, Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna.</p>

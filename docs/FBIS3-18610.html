Three federal councillors attended the opening. For 10 days  more than 1,400 exhibitors will display their services and  products in seven distinct sectors. The special presentations  this year are dedicated to AIDS, civil protection, radioactive  waste, and rational energy use.    Federal Councillors Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, Arnold Koller,  and  Swiss President Otto Stich attended the first day of Muba 1994.  Among the people invited were Lonnart Meri, president of the  Republic of Estonia; Mario Frick, head of the Liechtenstein  Government; Gret Haller, president of the Swiss National  Council; and Riccardo Jagmetti, president of the Swiss State  Council.    [Public Economic Councillor] Jean-Pascal Delamuraz delivered  a speech in which he said: "There is hope of a modest recovery,  but we should also be aware that the economic recovery will not  have an immediate affect on the labor market." He reminded his  audience that the parliament will have to decide this autumn on  whether to accept the new GATT agreements. These agreements, he  said, are "good and even indispensable for Switzerland, but they  will not perform miracles." They are aimed at entrepreneurs and  "bold" workers, and are not "for the faint-hearted."  <H5>  Fifteen Trading Partners </H5>   This year, Muba is acting as host to 15 trading partners.  Estonia, Kenya, the DPRK, and the region of Offenburg/Mid-Baden  (Germany) are represented for the first time. The other guest  countries are India, Mongolia, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, the  Slovak Republic, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the Czech republic,  Hungary, and the French region of Vosges.

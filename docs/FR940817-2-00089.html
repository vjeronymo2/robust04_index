			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 211 of the Clean Air Act, certain fuels and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additives must be registered with EPA as a precondition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduction into commerce. Section 211(a) of the Act authorizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA to designate any fuel or fuel additive for registration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon designation, fuels or additives may not be introduced into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commerce unless they have been registered by EPA in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with section 211(b). In 1975, EPA issued regulations (40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 79) implementing basic registration requirements, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stipulated by section 211(b)(1), that required applicants to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit certain information, such as commercial identifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, range of concentration, purpose-in-use, and chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> composition, in order to register a fuel or fuel additive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1970 Clean Air Act also gave EPA discretionary authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to establish additional registration requirements under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 211(b)(2). This section authorized EPA to require fuel and fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive manufacturers ``to conduct tests to determine potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health effects of such fuel(s) or additive(s) (including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but not limited to, carcinogenic, teratogenic, or mutagenic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects),'' and to further furnish other ``reasonable and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary'' information to identify fuel and fuel additive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions and determine their effects on vehicular emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control performance and on public health and welfare.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA did not exercise its discretionary authority to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing of fuels and fuel additives under section 211(b)(2) when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general registration regulations were first adopted in 1975.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95&hyph; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 95, August 7, 1977), Congress added section 211(e), which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required EPA to take certain actions to implement section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 211(b)(2). A final rule was signed by the Administrator of EPA on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May 27, 1994 and was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on June  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27, 1994 (59 FR 33042). The final rule, ``Fuels and Fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additives Registration Regulations'', implemented additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration requirements under sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Clean Air Act. The rule requires manufacturers to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA with information to assist EPA in identifying and evaluating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential adverse health effects of motor vehicle fuel and fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive emissions, and to support and guide related regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The recently promulgated health effects testing requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporate a three-tiered health effects evaluation structure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Tier 1, fuel and fuel additive manufacturers are required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to perform a literature search on the health and welfare effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of fuel and fuel additive emissions, characterize the emissions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and provide exposure information. Tier 2 includes short-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biological testing to screen for specific health effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endpoints, involving the exposure of laboratory animals to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whole emissions of fuels or fuel/additive mixtures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where appropriate, EPA has retained authority to modify or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> augment the standard Tier 2 test requirements. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``alternative Tier 2'' procedures set forth in &sect;79.58(c), EPA may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute alternative tests for standard Tier 2 tests or impose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional testing requirements. Alternative Tier 2 procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be utilized to modify standard Tier 2 requirements, but may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be utilized to entirely delete testing for any of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard endpoints. The alternative Tier 2 provision affords the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency flexibility when available information indicates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another testing regimen is preferable to the standard set of Tier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 tests. Instances where Alternative Tier 2 requirements may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate include scenarios where previously available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information may cause EPA to be concerned about potential health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects related to an endpoint not specifically addressed in Tier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2, or when otherwise available information identifies a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially significant public health risk related to a Tier 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endpoint such that more definitive testing will be required for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this endpoint than is ordinarily required. In both of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenarios, alternative Tier 2 testing can facilitate earlier and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially more efficient acquisition of the required data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After receipt and review of a manufacturer's Tier 1 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier 2 submittals, EPA determines, on a case-by-case basis, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional testing is needed under Tier 3 to evaluate the risk of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a particular fuel or fuel additive (or group of fuels or fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additives) on human health or welfare. Tier 3 testing could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include any emission analysis, health effects, welfare effects,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or exposure testing or analysis deemed necessary by EPA for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has considerable discretion to formulate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impose appropriate testing requirements under either alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier 2 or Tier 3 procedures. In practice, EPA will be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely to utilize alternative Tier 2 procedures in instances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where additional data needs are apparent even prior to completion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and submission of the standard Tier 2 tests, and prompt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulation of appropriate alternative testing requirements will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in a more efficient use of industry and governmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources. Tier 3 procedures will be preferred in those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances where standard Tier 2 tests are necessary to assist EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in identification of potential hazards and/or in design or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selection of appropriate follow-up studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For fuels and fuel additives registered as of the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgation of the final rule, registrants must submit Tier 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Tier 2 test data within six years of that date. On the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand, manufacturers seeking to register new fuel and fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive products after the date of promulgation must satisfy all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing requirements before registration will be granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this regard, the new rule clarifies what constitutes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``new'' fuel or fuel additive, distinguishing between two types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unregistered products which a manufacturer might seek to register  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the promulgation of the final rule: (1) fuel and fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive products similar in composition and usage to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already allowed wide commercial distribution (e.g., registered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for general use by other manufacturers), and (2) fuel and fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive products which differ significantly in composition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or usage from such current products. To effectuate this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinction, EPA's final rule, promulgated under sections 211(b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (e), makes use of grouping system concepts and definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, a fuel additive product not registered by its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer <FOOTCITE>73</FOOTCITE>  for a specific type of fuel as of the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgation of this rule is designated as ``registrable'' if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel/additive mixture resulting from use of the additive in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific fuel is in the same fuel/additive group as one or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently registered fuels or bulk additives. <FOOTCITE>74</FOOTCITE>  The grouping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system establishes various fuel/additive groups within each fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family. <FOOTCITE>75</FOOTCITE>  Conversely, a fuel additive product not registered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by its manufacturer for a specific type of fuel as of the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgation is designated as ``new'' if the fuel/additive mixture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from use of the additive in the specific fuel cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grouped with one or more currently registered fuels or bulk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additives. In these definitions, the term ``currently registered''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refers to the date on which the prospective applicant seeks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration for the fuel or fuel additive in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 73 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of these definitions, registration is product-specific. Thus, if a particular fuel or fuel additive product has not been registered by its manufacturer, then that manufacturer does not have the right to introduce, market, and/or sell this product, even if a compositionally similar or identical product has been registered by another manufacturer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 74 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A ``bulk additive,'' sometimes called a ``general use'' additive was defined as a product added to fuel at the refinery as part of the original blending stream or after the fuel is transported from the refinery, but before the fuel is purchased for introduction into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle. In contrast, an ``aftermarket additive,'' sometimes called a consumer additive, is an additive product marketed for introduction directly into the fuel system of a motor vehicle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 75 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Fuel Family'' refers to the primary categorization of fuels and fuel additives within the proposed grouping system. A fuel family was defined as a set of F/FAs which share basic chemical and physical formulation characteristics and can be used in the same engine or vehicle. Six such fuel families were proposed (unleaded gasoline, leaded gasoline, diesel, methanol, ethanol, methane, and propane). EPA did not include a leaded gasoline family in the final rule because Clean Air Act section 211(n) prohibits on-road use of leaded fuel after December 31, 1995. In the definition of ``registrable,'' the restriction ``in the same fuel family'' means that the similarity of an applicant F/FA to a bulk additive currently registered for use in another fuel family would not suffice to make the applicant F/FA registrable. This restriction is consistent with the general principles of the grouping system, which permits grouping of F/FAs only within defined fuel families. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to these definitions, an unregistered fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive which meets the criteria for grouping only with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently registered aftermarket additive (and not also with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently registered fuel and/or bulk additive) is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registrable. This does not preclude an unregistered aftermarket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive from being registrable (since aftermarket additives can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group with fuels and bulk additives), nor does it affect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration status of currently registered aftermarket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, an unregistered detergent additive (either bulk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or aftermarket) intended for use in unleaded gasoline and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conforming to the ``substantially similar'' criteria for unleaded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline (56 FR 5352) would be registrable, since it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to group with currently registered baseline unleaded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline fuels and bulk additives. <FOOTCITE>76</FOOTCITE>  On the other hand, MMT is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered ``new'' rather than ``registrable'' for unleaded gasoline,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because there are no currently registered manganese-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuels or bulk additives in the unleaded gasoline family with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which a mixture of MMT and unleaded gasoline could be grouped.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is true even though products containing MMT are currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered for bulk use in leaded gasoline and as aftermarket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additives grandfathered prior to the ban on such aftermarket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additives. <FOOTCITE>77</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 76 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The ability to join the unleaded gasoline baseline group assumes that the detergent additive does not exceed oxygen and sulfur limits applicable to the baseline unleaded gasoline category. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 77 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Until the 1990 CAA Amendments went into effect, the statutory language of section 211(f) was interpreted as applying only to unleaded gasoline fuels and related bulk additives. Thus, prior to November 15, 1990 (the effective date of the CAA Amendments), aftermarket additives intended for use in unleaded gasoline and containing elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur were allowed to be registered. Under the 1990 CAA Amendments, all types of motor vehicle fuels and fuel additives were placed under 211(f) jurisdiction. All aftermarket additives that were not ``substantially similar'' and were introduced on or after November 15, 1990, were banned. However, this ban does not apply to products first introduced into commerce prior to November 15, 1990 (CAA section 211(f)(1)(B)). Thus, ``non-sub-sim'' gasoline aftermarket additives which had been registered prior to that date were allowed to retain their registrations. These are so-called ``grandfathered'' aftermarket additives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

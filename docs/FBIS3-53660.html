			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 18 Jan (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR has  said that the Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva worries Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin: He has not responded to what the  U.S. President himself declared after he was convinced by the  Syrian president's stance. Rabin, as usual, tried to equivocate  and sidestep statements by inventing arguments and excuses.  This is especially evident in his statement that the Syrian  pledge to normalize relations with Israel is not specific and  that it needs to be explained and clarified.    The newspaper noted in a commentary that will be published  tomorrow, Wednesday, the opinion of political observers that the  Syrian-U.S. meeting affirmed to President Clinton the honesty of  his Syrian counterpart's intentions and his true desire to  participate in restoring real peace to the region.    The newspaper believes that Rabin's former stances throw  some  doubt on U.S. coordinator Dennis Ross' expectations that the  Geneva summit has provided a new opportunity for peace efforts  and that the talks will soon resume in a more flexible  atmosphere.</p>

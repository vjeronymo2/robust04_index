			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Tunnel builder raises HKDollars 5.2bn THE Western Harbour Tunnel Company, which is to build Hong Kong's third harbour tunnel, yesterday signed an agreement with 22 international banks to raise HKDollars 5.2bn (USDollars 673m) over 15 years for construction costs. The financing, which includes a 15-year term loan and revolving facility, was clinched despite what arrangers Wardley Capital described as tight pricing. Interest will be paid at 1-1.5 per cent above Hibor. In spite of political uncertainty over the colony's future, companies are increasingly managing to raise finance with pay-back terms straddling 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty. Mr Calum McKinlay, an executive of Wardley Capital, said: 'The project has been approved by both the Chinese representatives of the Joint Liaison Group and the Hong Kong Government, the Executive Council and the Legislative Council (LegCo).' The sum raised puts the Western Harbour Tunnel Company among the colony's biggest borrowers in the loans market. The dual three-lane tunnel is due to open in August 1997.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is seeking comment on whether enforceable agreements between EPA and industry that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrict the use of certain waste management practices could affect the Agency's plausible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mismanagement analysis and, in turn, affect the Agency's listing determination. Specifically, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency seeks comment on whether EPA should pursue such agreements with respect to either the dye and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pigment wastes that the Agency is proposing to list in this notice (or, additionally those it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes not to list). The Agency seeks comment on whether the Agency should decide not to list  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such wastes (or retain a no-list decision) if the agreements ensure that the wastes will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> managed in a manner that poses unacceptable risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A decision not to list based on such enforceable agreements could be based on the view that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management practices that are prohibited in an enforceable agreement are not ``plausible'' because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities within an industry covered by an enforceable agreement are unlikely to violate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , use a risky management practice, especially if the agreement were to contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monetary or other sanctions for a breach or violation. Waste management practices that are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plausible because they are prohibited by such an agreement arguably need not be considered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency in determining whether the waste poses ``a substantial present or potential hazard to human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> managed.'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> discussion of selection of waste management scenarios at I.B.1.) Thus, if a waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not pose an unacceptable risk if managed in accordance with an enforceable agreement, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency could determine that the waste should not be listed as hazardous. The Agency requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on the use of such an approach as part of the listing determination for wastes generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the production of dyes and pigments, including those proposed to be listed and/or proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not to be listed in today's notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For such an approach to be workable, the EPA believes that the following basic principles must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) All of the companies that generate the wastestream at issue must be party to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To ensure that the agreement will adequately deter prohibited waste management practices,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agreement should be enforceable in court and should contain provisions requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment of sufficient penalties or damages if the agreement is violated;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The agreement should eliminate management practices that pose an unacceptable risk;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The agreement should contain provisions that would account for new entrants; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The agreement should promote waste minimization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7003 of RCRA may provide EPA with authority under appropriate circumstances to enter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into such agreements on consent. Section 7003(a) of RCRA authorizes EPA to issue orders requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such action as may be necessary upon receipt of evidence that the past or present handling, storage,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid waste or hazardous waste may present an imminent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment. EPA also has the authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settle claims under RCRA section 7003 by entering into a consent decree or agreement. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency has inherent authority to enter into contracts that are not prohibited by law. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Kern-Limerick, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scurlock,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 347 U.S. 110 (1954). Such inherent authority also may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be available to enter into such agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that such an approach may be feasible for the wastes generated during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production of dyes and pigments because such wastes are generated by a relatively small number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, and the likelihood of expansion in this industry does not appear to be great. Such an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach may not be feasible in an industry with a greater number of facilities or in an industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is expanding. Additionally, it may not be a valid approach for an industrial sector in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wastes generated are so hazardous, move off-site in such a fashion, or require such detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls that EPA wants the full regulatory controls and civil and criminal authorities that follow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from full Subtitle C regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency requests comments on the feasibility of entering into and enforcing such agreements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with industry. The Agency also requests comment on how such agreements would account for entrance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the market of new facilities that generate the waste at issue ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , add new elements to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement, issue unilateral order under RCRA Section 7003). The Agency also requests comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative innovative approaches to listing determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

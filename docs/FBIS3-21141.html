Along with increasing the area of the electrolytic  cell to 6,000 square meters after this, economics research on  processing for a daily production scale of several hundred tons,  which would make it practical, will be carried out.    The hydrogen supply for oil refineries generally makes use  of  hydrogen production units or secondary hydrogen from contact  catalyst reformers (CCR). Besides the fact that demand for  hydrogen is growing yearly due to desulfurization in the process  of refining crude oil and conversion to purer fuels by means of  product upgrades, there has been a leap in uses such as deep  desulfurization of diesel fuel.    In addition, with the prospects for future introduction of  equipment for hydrogenation decomposition of heavy petroleum,  the quantities of hydrogen necessary can only be seen as  increasing. However, since there is also the problem of hydrogen  production facilities being costly to construct, hydrogenation  desulfurizers are used to produce hydrogen sulfide, and the  sulfur is recovered through thermal decomposition. Therefore,  there are expectations for recovery of hydrogen from sour gas  that includes hydrogen sulfide.    PEC combined wet absorption and an electrolytic reaction,  separated hydrogen sulfide from sour gas and furthermore  separated hydrogen and sulfur from the hydrogen sulfide, making  progress in technical developments that will help in efficient  use of hydrogen at oil refineries.    As a result, highly efficient recovery of hydrogen from the  hydrogen sulfide separated from sour gas with a with a 430  square meter single cell ion-exchange membrane test tank was  confirmed. The hydrogen recovered has a purity of 99% and  the  sulfur a purity of 99% or greater. Based on these  results, PEC  is now planning to increase the area of the electrolytic cell to  6,000 square meters to help in establishing recovery technology.    On the other hand, processing for a daily production of  several hundred tons is necessary for practical application, and  there are plans for conducting examinations of economic  practicality at the same time.</p>

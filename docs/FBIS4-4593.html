			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Humphrey McQueen: "Price to be Paid for US Free </F> Trade]    [Text] Is the world moving towards less government  regulation of trade or closer to an open trade war? In November  last year, President Clinton hosted a meeting of all but one of  the 15 heads of government from the Asia-Pacific Economic  Co-operation forum.    On December 15, the latest round of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade was signed. On New Year's Day 1994, the North  American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada  and Mexico came into being. Then, six weeks later trade  negotiations between Clinton and Japan's Prime Minister Hosokawa  failed to issue even a Zen resolution to try harder in future.    So, should the scoreboard be counted as three losses and one  win for retaining national controls? No. All four need to be  seen as part of a different game. Far from aiming at so-called  freer trade, the quartet of tussles shared the single goal of  re-establishing the dominance of US conglomerates across global  markets. That is the reality behind the misnomer "free trade".    The failure of the Clinton-Hosokawa talks highlighted the  substance and the limitations of APEC, GATT and NAFTA. To  achieve dominance for US corporations, Washington needs to  switch between seemingly contradictory approaches --  multilateralism through GATT, regionalism in NAFTA and  bilateralism with Japan. The rhetoric behind GATT is that only  multi-lateral trade deals are acceptable since regionalism and  bilateral arrangements limit access to markets. US negotiators  interpret that objective as applying only to regions and deals  in which US firms are not the principal player.    Yet even US politicians can suffer from a surfeit of  hypocrisy. Hence, instead of calling the body to replace GATT  the multi-lateral trade organisation, Washington insisted on it  being named the World Trade Organisation. That preference  signalled how US trade negotiators do not intend to be limited  to multilateralism.    Throughout these deals, deceits and disputes, the Australian  Government kept investing its rhetoric in APEC. Yet, if Japan  and the US can't agree between themselves, what chance is there  that they and 13 others will come up with a workable trading  community? Our interests would have been better served had  Keating joined Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir in a boycott  of APEC. The accusation of "recalcitrant" should have been  aimed at the US administration.    Mendacity about the virtues of multilateralism was only one  of the whoppers generated by those four commercial battles. The  other big lie was the quantified benefits that were supposed to  depend upon the successful conclusion of GATT and NAFTA.    When a writer on Britain's GUARDIAN newspaper looked back  over those estimates, he discovered that GATT's first success  had been a growth in its own promised benefits. A year before  the compromise agreement, the boost to world output from a  successful outcome had been put at $US100 billion ($140 billion).    Then, as GATT looked as if it would fail, the figure for  expected growth in world economic activity began to inflate. It  peaked at $US269 billion to be attained by the year 2002. What  caused this expansion? The answer was the urgency to stimulate  public pressure upon recalcitrant governments.    Similar propaganda needs accounted for the figures given out  about NAFTA. The chief economic adviser to the secretary  general of GATT said that the NAFTA numbers were being made up.    One creative economist admitted that his model depended on  guesswork about how much capital would flow into Mexico. Making  up the numbers runs counter to the assumption in "free-trade"  dogma that markets cannot be managed by governments because they  are unpredictable.    One critic of the NAFTA numbers racket observed that if  economists could predict labour market outcomes seven years in  advance, the centrally planned economies of the former Soviet  bloc need never have imploded.    Are there to be no losers from GATT? Yes, but the only one  listed was sub-Saharan Africa, marked to drop $US2.6 billion.  However, the fine print did contain a warning which applies to  the alleged winners as well. Estimates of increased growth took  no account of the social costs that must flow from global  corporations gaining greater power over national economies.    For example, Australia is supposed to make $US1 billion  extra  in export returns from improved access to world markets for our  agricultural products. This alleged gain had to be balanced  against the costs of unemployment after the closure of food  plants in our country towns because of increased processed  imports. Nor were environmental costs part of the GATT  guesstimates.    Hence, even if the numbers concocted for GATT and NAFTA  were,  by some fluke, to turn out to be accurate, they still would  offer no indication about the prices to be paid in achieving  that growth.</p>

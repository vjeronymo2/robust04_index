			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK business chiefs want single currency, CBI survey suggests A NEW row over Britain's position in Europe was brewing last night after an authoritative business survey suggested many of the country's top industrialists back sterling's participation in a single European currency. The survey, which is due to be unveiled this weekend by the Confederation of British Industry, showed that a large proportion of its senior members continued to think that Europe would be the focal point of British trade and investment in the future. The CBI last night refused to reveal precise details of the survey but its director-general, Mr Howard Davies, signalled that the results would be a key topic of debate at the organisation's conference next week by strongly attacking the attitude of the British government towards the EU. 'We are rather nervous about the way the debate in the Conservative party has moved, such that it is almost impossible to talk about it,' he said in an interview with The Guardian newspaper. 'What some of our big members are anxious about is the notion of a single currency on the other side of the Channel and Ukrainian coupons over here.' Mr Davies added that the issue of Europe could not be buried and it would be a dangerous mistake for the government to close off the option of moving to a single currency. 'It's all very well to say we've had a competitive devaluation, we are offshore, we are in the single market and we have incredibly cheap labour costs,' he said. 'But it doesn't seem like a credible long term strategy. We are not comfortable about being on the sidelines and ridiculing the whole notion. You only have to go across the Channel to see they take it rather seriously.' CBI officials said last night the survey results underlined that Britain's businesses were clearly at odds with the government on the future of Europe - and that the demise of the European exchange rate mechanism should not preclude attempts to move ahead towards European monetary union. They said the survey had taken the form of telephone interviews with 200 chief executives of leading British firms, and they would be treating its results as an important contribution to the debate on Europe. 'CBI members favour currency stability and that is why they are in favour of a single currency,' a CBI spokesman commented last night. 'They would not be happy for Britain to be an offshore island linked to the community, with other members participating in a single currency.' Clarke faces lobbying, Page 10</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A SUBDUED derivatives sector was reflected in poor turnover in both options and futures markets, although the recent upward momentum in the latter was maintained, writes Christopher Price. The 4,924 contracts traded by the close in the September FT-SE was well down on the recent busy sessions. Dealers said the weekend press reports of imminent interest rate cuts backed by a bullish equity market run, were an echo of the last two weeks' trading, and there were few investors left who wanted to be convinced of the recovery story. Trading in September during the morning session was marked by a dearth of buyers as the contract edged forward. The first trade was struck at 2,890 and glided gently forward, not finding fresh momentum until Wall Street opened strongly on the back of President Clinton's budget success. Gilts added to the positive mood and September eventually closed with a spur at 2,999, having touched 3,000. This was a 16-point premium to the fair value level of around 3. Traded options volume was also weak, with just 19,000 contracts being traded, around half the previous session's total. The FT-SE contract traded 4,266, with the Euro FT-SE at 1,541. Royal Insurance topped the list of stock options, reaching 1,732 by the close. This was followed by Hanson on 1,024</p>

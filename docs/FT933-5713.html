			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Japan moves on economic reform JAPAN'S new government has proposed 60 economic deregulation measures in the first step of a broad campaign to curb costly anti-competitive practices. The outline measures paved the way for deep reforms in Japan's economic structure, although the short-term impact would be unclear until the government published full details towards the end of the month, analysts said in Tokyo. The package could, in the long term, reduce market restrictions to foreign companies and bring a widespread fall in prices and increased consumer demand, they said. This will be an important test of promises by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the new prime minister, to shake up the Japanese system. It will be followed closely by the US, keen to see evidence of attempts to raise import demand. The plans include cuts in gas and electricity rates of most benefit to industrial users, easing of controls on the construction of big discount stores, fewer curbs on discount drinks retailers, the opening of satellite broadcasting to foreign competition and the deregulation of mobile telephone sales. The package proposes an end to the minimum production ceiling for brewers, which would eventually open the oligopoly of four Japanese brewers which has controlled the Japanese beer market for the past 30 years. The measures were agreed in principle at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday evening, for detailed publication before the end of this month. Half the measures would be implemented before the end of March 1994, but around 10 required legislation, said government officials. However, this is not the first time that such proposals have been made and they are strongly opposed by powerful industry groups. But the government is confident the plans will be realised. In this, it would be helped by the powerful Ministry of Finance in its eagerness to promote deregulation to deflect pressure for an income tax cut, said analysts. Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

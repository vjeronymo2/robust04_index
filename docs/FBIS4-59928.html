			<p>BFN     [Text] A resident of the settlement of Netzarim in the  Gaza Strip was moderately wounded this evening when shots were  fired at his car from a passing vehicle.    Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that Netzarim  residents reacted to the attack by blocking a traffic axis near  their settlement. They are demanding that the commander of the  Southern Command meet them and promise that the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] will prevent Palestinians from driving on the  road where the attack took place.    An Arab youth was seriously injured in the eye today by a  rubber bullet fired by soldiers at stonethrowers in the Nabulus  casbah. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the youth was  evacuated to a hospital in Jerusalem.</p>

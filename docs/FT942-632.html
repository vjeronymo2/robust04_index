			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Portugal puts telecoms on the line - Part of new utility will be sold off next year The restructuring of Portugal's telecommunications industry has started at a brisk rate. The process began on Thursday when three state-owned utilities were brought together in the country's biggest merger to create Portugal Telecom (PT), the largest Portuguese company by number of employees. Part of PT is to be sold next year in one of Portugal's biggest privatisations. It will become one of the largest companies quoted on the Lisbon stock exchange. Along the way, important services may be spun off through the most ambitious buy-out attempted by Portuguese managers. Critics say the process could also prove one of the centre-right government's biggest mistakes. 'Creating a company of this size will inevitably lead to enormous inefficiencies and a loss of control over costs,' says Mr Joao Oliveira Martins, a former telecommunications minister. 'Merging three companies with such different cultures will drastically reduce competitiveness.' Portugal's restructuring fits a pattern in Europe, where smaller countries are rationalising, liberalising and privatising state telecommunications operations. Objectives include cash for modernisation, market-oriented management and a place in one of the international alliances taking shape. PT will bring together Portugal's domestic and European telecommunications services, as well as television signal broadcasting, mobile communications, cable television and data transmission, under the management of a single state monopoly. Intercontinental services run by Radio Marconi will be brought into the group later this year, when the government buys or exchanges shares held by private investors who own 49 per cent. The government is considering a proposal for a management buy-out of Marconi's 40 overseas subsidiaries and non-core services. But Mr Eurico Cabral de Fonseca, president of Comunicacoes Nacionais, the holding company for state-owned telecommunications companies, says the loss of Marconi's international expertise would be a fatal blow to PT. The government defends the PT merger as an essential reshaping of an irrationally divided sector. Mr Cabral de Fonseca says Portugal could not hope to join an international alliance if it left telecommunications services divided between separate companies. Analysts say the merger will also help Portugal rebalance low local-call tariffs with high long-distance and international call prices. But critics fear the new utility runs the risk of becoming an inefficient colossus that could lose market share to foreign companies. It is widely accepted that market demand will force the liberalisation of voice services in Portugal before the 2003 deadline - five years after most other European Union countries - set by Brussels. Raising funds for investment through privatisation is a priority for Portugal. Although the country has made significant progress by increasing the number of telephone lines for every 100 inhabitants from 20 to 34 over the past decade, that is still the lowest level in the EU. The government has set a target of 45 for the year 2000. Expansion at that rate will cost an estimated Es130bn (Dollars 787m) a year. The government believes PT would be able to generate sufficient cash for the investment without an injection of fresh capital. But the company is burdened at the outset by a pension fund for its 20,000 employees that is undercapitalised by Es130bn. . Officials say the privatisation of 25 to 30 per cent of PT in the first half of 1995 will be primarily aimed at creating a sound base for growth. Initial estimates value PT at more than Es1,000bn. But privatisation will be too big for the Portuguese market to swallow alone. 'Even the biggest Portuguese corporate groups lack the financial capacity to acquire more than 5 per cent of PT,' says one analyst. Because of these limitations, the first sale of PT shares is due to be made simultaneously on several international stock exchanges. The government will limit the holding any single investor may acquire to 5 per cent of the total capital. The second stage of the process should involve an alliance with a international telecommunications partner. But it is unlikely that this politically sensitive issue will be resolved before Portugal's next general election in October 1995. Mr Cabral de Fonseca sees only three possible candidates: British Telecommunications; the alliance between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom; and Unisource, the Swedish, Swiss and Dutch national telecoms joint venture - each of which are forming alliances with important US and other operators.</p>

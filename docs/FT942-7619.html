			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / South Yemenis vow to resist Political leaders in south Yemen yesterday acknowledged that north Yemeni forces had made military gains, but vowed to resist further encroachments by the government of General Ali Abdullah Saleh. They said their forces were being consolidated in preparation for a counter offensive against Gen Saleh's regime. Mr Ali Salem al-Beidh, president of the newly announced Democratic Republic of Yemen, conceded on Monday that northern forces had captured the strategic town of Ataq, in Shabwa province 300km north east of Aden. But he said that irregular forces in the region could be expected to contain any further northern advances from the town. That view was supported by Mr Abdul Rahman Ali al-Jifri, vice-president of the new republic. Mr Jifri, who represents Shabwa in the five-man presidential council, said that guerrilla forces were being mobilised and would start a counter-offensive within days. Both leaders flatly rejected the idea that Gen Saleh's forces would be able to take Aden, stronghold of the south. Mr Beidh claimed on Monday that southern forces were still in control of al-Anad, a key defensive position 60km to the north of Aden. Al-Anad - the name means 'stubborn' - has seen intensive fighting for the past week, with both northern and southern leaders claiming victory. Southern officers said they had staged a tactical withdrawal from al-Anad on Sunday, luring northern forces from the nearby mountains and shelling them with heavy artillery as they entered the 500 sq km camp. Journalists who visited the battle scene yesterday confirmed that northern forces had still not secured al-Anad and that fighting continued around it. Other southern leaders said that mistrust of the Yemen Socialist party, which ruled the south for 23 years after independence from Britain, had prevented formation of a united front against the north. This however, had changed in the past week with reassurances from the socialists about power-sharing and formation of a coalition government.</p>

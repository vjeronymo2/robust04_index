			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEIRUT'S CHRISTIANS FACING GENOCIDE, MAHONY ASSERTS  </P> <P> Archbishop Roger M. Mahony told a solemn prayer vigil in Los Angeles on  Wednesday night that the "very survival" of Christians in war-torn Beirut is  threatened by a joint Syrian and Iran offensive. And he called for the nations  of the world to seek a cease-fire.  </P> <P> Echoing the words of Pope John Paul II, Mahony said that the combined attacks,  including the fierce bombardment of Christian enclaves in recent days,  constitutes genocide on the part of Syria.  </P> <P> "It is clear that whatever (the) political reason, the Syrians appear to  support the total annihilation of the Christian Lebanese people," said Mahony,  who headed a fact-finding trip to the Middle East earlier this year.  </P> <P> After 14 years of claiming that its presence in Lebanon was needed to guarantee  Syria's security, Mahony said that "finally and unfortunately, the truth of the  real motives" of the Syrian leaders is apparent.  </P> <P> "The entire international community, together with the United Nations, must  take immediate steps to seek a cease-fire and to pressure both Syria and Iran  to back away from their announced intentions," Mahony said.  </P> <P> The archbishop's remarks were greeted with enthusiastic applause and cheers by  an estimated 300 members of the Lebanese and Armenian communities who collected  on the steps of Immaculate Conception Catholic Church and spilled onto the  sidewalk and into the street on West 9th.  </P> <P> Scores of demonstrators had earlier paraded in front of the church, singing a  hymn and carrying signs reading "USA Save Lebanon," "Stop the Massacre of  Christians in Lebanon" and "Pray for Peace and Freedom in Lebanon."  </P> <P> Edward Salem, one of the organizers, said the purpose of the vigil was to offer  prayers for suffering and dying Lebanese caught in the Beirut bombardment.  </P> <P> "We come together to pray that the mighty nations of the world will take note  of this precious land and say to those who would oppress and murder that enough  is enough," Salem said.  </P> <P> Two local political leaders, State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) and Los  Angeles City Council President John Ferraro, spoke briefly, expressing their  support of calls for an end to the threat to Lebanese Christians.  </P> <P> "There is a genocide occurring now in the tiny country of Lebanon, and any  human being who cares about another must make it stop," Torres declared.  </P> <P> "God Bless, Lebanon," Ferraro said.  </P></p>

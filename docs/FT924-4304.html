			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / 'Usury' is denied by NatWest LORD ALEXANDER of Weedon, chairman of National Westminster Bank, told MPs yesterday that the bank charged 36.6 per cent interest on unauthorised overdrafts to small businesses, but rejected an accusation that this amounted to 'usury'. The charge was levelled by Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, at a hostile session with the cross-party Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee. Lord Alexander said: 'The rates reflect the lack of desirability where the customer borrows unilaterally. They are a deterrent. There is no other industry where the customer can help themselves.' He told the committee that the charges were widely publicised by businesses, and that unauthorised borrowing had reduced by 30 per cent since they were introduced in June last year. In answer to Mr Beith's remark that customers were charged arrangement fees when they exceeded their overdraft and negotiated to reduce it, Lord Alexander said: 'We have to have regard to the costs.' He emphasised that the bank needed to consider the risks when lending to businesses during recession. He also said that there was a 'strong case' for charging customers based on their demands for individual services, and said the bank was keeping its policies on the subject under review. In a lengthy submission to the committee NatWest said that many of the allegations of banks' treatment of small businesses were 'unsubstantiated and misplaced' and damaging to relationships with these companies. NatWest said it lent Pounds 11bn to 1m small-business accounts, representing 28 per cent of the sector in the UK. One quarter of its small-business accounts were continuously overdrawn and a quarter fluctuated between debit and credit, with the rest always in credit. It said customers with base-rate-linked borrowings received corresponding reductions in interest charges 'immediately and in full', while those with fixed rates were set against a longer view of what base rates would be. It said account charges had increased at or below the rate of inflation and lending-related charges were increased to reflect higher costs of monitoring customers' accounts.</p>

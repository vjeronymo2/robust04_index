			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: APV declines 17% to Pounds 12m APV, the food manufacturing equipment maker, blamed the lack of even a modest economic recovery for a 17 per cent fall in profits for the first half of 1992. The return on sales margin slipped from 5.1 to 3.8 per cent. The pre-tax decline to Pounds 12m (Pounds 14.5m) was struck on turnover up 8 per cent at Pounds 437m (Pounds 402.9m). A fall in other operating income to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 4.3m) contributed to the near-20 per cent slide to Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 20.5m) in operating profits. APV said that demand had fallen in its dry food side, with sales down 10 per cent at Pounds 127.8m and profits tumbling to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 5.6m). Mr Clive Strowger, who became chief executive in July after the early retirement of Mr Fred Smith at the end of 1991, said that the French bakery operations had suffered particularly from a lack of orders and a downturn in profit. Also the 'adverse' economic climate led to 'traditional customers deferring capital investment programmes'. With competition growing, net margins shrank from 3.9 to 1.1 per cent in the division. However, Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman, asserted: 'APV will undertake no meaningful work at less than cost.' By contrast, the liquid food division, fuelled by growth in continental Europe and Asia, lifted profits from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 11.3m on turnover up almost 20 per cent at Pounds 247.3m (Pounds 206.9m). Margins slipped from 5.1 to 4.6 per cent - the company said there was a 'shortfall in high margin orders'. In the 'hotch-potch' group of companies, of which Vent-Axia, the UK ventilation fan maker, is 'the largest and the best', according to Mr Strowger, profits eased to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 4.4m) on turnover ahead at Pounds 61.9m (Pounds 54m). Earnings per share emerged at 2.8p (3.3p) net and 3.5p (3.7p) on a nil distribution basis. The interim dividend is unchanged at 2p. COMMENT Leaderless for the first half, APV now has Mr Strowger at the helm, and it needs him to sort out the margins problem. Mr Smith tended to acquire companies and then let them get on with running themselves. It is to be hoped that the new chief executive will identify the over-complexity of the group as a fundamental problem - it has 40 companies with 130 operations. Stronger central controls are needed to take strategic planning, product development and marketing by the scruff of the neck and Mr Strowger has his work cut out. The dull results will remain so, though the 'disappointing' order intake since June is a worry for a company with high operational margins. Forecast full-year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 30m give a multiple between 12 and 13. There is no great pressure on the dividend, though things will drift until Mr Strowger has made his presence felt.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Royals hit by rights talk SUSTAINED weakness in Royal Insurance, the composite insurer, was accompanied by vague market suggestions that the group might be considering a rights issue. A cash call from Royals has been talked about for some time by a number of insurance specialists. Another suggestion is that analysts are preparing to downgrade their earnings and dividend forecasts for the company. Some dealers, however, attributed the sharp fall in the shares, which settled 18 lower at 447p, to the fact that they had held up well against the rest of the sector during the first quarter. There are suggestions that Royals' first-quarter results, due next month, could show a loss in excess of Pounds 60m. Analysts had been hoping that Royals might break even in the current year, but now some of them are looking for a full year loss of something in the order of Pounds 50m. Gestetner weakens Downgradings from competing broking houses put shares of Gestetner, the distributor of office equipment and photographic products, under pressure. Three analysts at least revised estimates of current year profits, the lowest of which until yesterday had been Smith New Court's Pounds 62m. James Capel was said to have reduced its figure to Pounds 58m but more savage cuts came from BZW, and from another house which preferred to remain anonymous. Citing extremely poor trading throughout February and March, which will obviously affect group first-half profits, BZW dropped its estimate to only Pounds 50m for the full year. An even lower figure of Pounds 47m was said to have been forecast by another house. BZW retained its longer term view of being overweight in the stock but sees short-term downside. Gestetner closed 20 weaker at 213p. Hammerson good The volatile property stock Hammerson was the best performer of the day among FT-SE 100 constituents in the wake of results announced last week. County NatWest issued a buy note on the stock yesterday. It highlighted the company's cautious management policy and exposure to the dollar as reasons to buy. 'The worst is certainly over, certainly in terms of sentiment.' said County. The company also made a presentation to its institutional shareholders at the offices of its broker BZW. More than 60 fund management staff attended. Hammerson was 20 better at one point and the shares eventually closed at 630p for a gain of 15 on the day. Volume was a typical 350,000. Ratners shines Ratners, the jewellery retail chain, shrugged off disappointing final results as investors looked forward to the prospect of a recovery in consumer spending by the year-end. The shares closed 8 higher at 178p on turnover of 3m. With nearly half of Ratners' UK profits made in the Christmas period, the market took heart from the confident statement by Mr Gerald Ratner, the chairman, who said he was hopeful for significantly better trading conditions during that important period. Full year profits fell 8 per cent to Pounds 112m, slightly below market estimates. As a result, analysts lowered their current forecasts to around Pounds 127m to Pounds 130m from Pounds 130m to Pounds 135m. It was the turn of cautious chemicals analysts to voice opinions on ICI and its first-quarter figures due on Thursday. The shares fell 21 to 1080p. Inchcape slipped 8 to 332p as the company reshuffled its board. Volume in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi climbed to 25m, but traders explained that more than 1 1/2 bn Saatchi shares are in issue now that the rights offer is complete. As a result, it is one of the most liquid stocks in the market and this kind of trading volume is to be expected. The share price ended unchanged at 19 3/4 p. Weekend reports that ADT might sell its stake in Christies International left the latter 8 off at 218p. Volatile Brent Walker slid 8 to 66p in the wake of press comment on the company. The wider market reaction combined with a downgrading by Lehman Brothers, the securities house, pushed Trafalgar House down 9 to 245p in heavier trading volume of 2.7m shares. Official confirmation of weekend reports that Guinness Mahon, the UK merchant bank, will announce a substantial interim loss later this week prompted a near 20 per cent drop in the shares. They closed a net 8 lower at 42p. Mr Geoffrey Bell, Guinness Mahon's chairman, said the results would include a provision of Pounds 30m for bad loans, giving the bank an after tax loss of Pounds 35m. There will be no dividend, Mr Bell added. Bank of Yokohama, Japan's leading regional bank, gained control of Guinness Mahon in 1989, paying 146p a share, and it holds a 65 per cent stake. Mr Robert Maxwell has a 9 per cent holding. Oil shares were resilient, closing little changed on balance in spite of the steep falls in equities on both sides of the Atlantic. They were bolstered, dealers said, by the latest rise in crude oil prices, currently around the Dollars 20 a barrel mark, and the strength of the dollar. 'With oil priced in dollars the majors are 100 per cent exposed to the currency,' said one specialist. There were hints that Elf's advisers had priced Elf's 25 per cent holding in Enterprise Oil prior to its imminent placing, but specialists said it was more likely that Elf would hold out for a price in the region of 600p before it would sell. Enterprise was easier at 555p. Cadbury Schweppes fell 11 to 395p on a revival of speculation about a possible rights issue. Asda was off 1 1/2 at 119 1/2 p as the market waited for the company's meeting with brokers, to be held later this week. The shares have been depressed on speculation that analysts' forecasts may be reduced. Budgens put on 2 to 47p after reports that some shareholders are seeking senior management changes. Relief that the annual profits shortfall over the previous year was not worse boosted issues of Polymark International, the laundry equipment distributor. The ordinary shares advanced 8 to 28p and the preferred 'A' 17 to 115p. Renewed speculative interest was held responsible for further strength in USM-listed ML Laboratories, which finished 18 higher at 455p. There were further setbacks in a water sector still suffering from last week's news that trading in the Water Package is to cease from July 12. Dealers maintained that this will result in sustained selling of the Package, with funds unwilling to be left with thinly traded components of each package unit. Much of the recent selling has come from overseas investors, it was said, with Japan-ese institutions conspicuous and heavy sellers. Also depressing sentiment has been some unease about the UK government's chances of winning the next general election. The opposition Labour party has recently reaffirmed its intention to renationalise the water companies if it wins the election. The Package was down over Pounds 100 at one point yesterday, but rallied to close a net Pounds 42 off at Pounds 2968. Anglian Water weakened 10 to 286p, while Southern dipped 8 to 270p and Severn Trent the same amount to 280p. North West drew sustained support, closing unchanged at 296p after 291p. Cronite returned from suspension with a reassuring directors' statement, and the shares closed at 24p, double the April 5 suspension price. Further speculation that the UK Ministry of Defence will shortly award its much-mooted replacement tank contract to Vickers failed to support the shares, which fell 7 to 218p. Vickers manufactures the Challenger tank, a new and more sophisticated version of its old Chieftain series. Downiebrae, the Glasgow-based steel profile and pipe flange manufacturer, found favour ahead of Friday's annual results and ended 7 higher at 36p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW HIGHS (198).

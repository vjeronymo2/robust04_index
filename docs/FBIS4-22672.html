			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview of Saeima Chairman Anatolijs Gorbunovs by Valdis </F> Bekeris: "We Issued the Laws Ourselves and We Must Put Them Into  Order Ourselves"]    [Text] The complaining about disorganized legislation  right now in Latvia is heard even more, perhaps, than the  complaining about the bad conditions in the years of communist  power. What hampered the Republic of Latvia's Supreme Council  and what hampers the Saeima in finally bringing to legislation?  Do we really have a deceiving Republic of Latvia and a deceiving  Saeima, as a few loud and angry people now conclude? Perhaps  Latvia really should be transformed from a parliamentary  republic to a presidential republic, as a larger, but more  moderate group of people think. Is a single and guaranteed  correct answer to such questions even possible? Leaving the  answers to them to each reader, RIGAS BALSS inquired of the  Saeima chairman, Anatolijs GORBUNOVS, about the process,  procedures and backstage events in the formation of laws.    [Bekeris] So, could a critical period arise that the Saeima  becomes unnecessary and "undefendable" from the inhabitants of  Latvia and even in the view of its own citizen's interests?    [Gorbunovs] I think that in the near future that will not  happen. Yes, ignoring the critical attitude toward the  parliament or toward the way in which the parliament operates,  or toward individual deputies or factions, I think that the  public does understand that the parliament is a mechanism for  realizing and regulating public interests with the help of laws,  so that conflicts can be resolved and compromises can be found.  If the parliament is regularly democratically renewed then it  will more or less reflect society itself. It is a mechanism in  which citizens can realize their goals or also select  representatives who express their interests and there must, of  course, be such a place where the interests of citizens can be  harmonized. International experience has not discovered anything  better than a parliament. Of course with different emphases,  different functions, but the basic idea is the same. In the  developed world this thought and form appeared around the year  1600, that is, in the 17th century.    [Bekeris] Do you directly, as the Saeima chairman, have the  right to initiate legislation? Does it seem to you that the  Saeima responds with sufficient sensitivity to all of our  conflicting life courses?    [Gorbunovs] I have the same right to initiate legislation as  any other deputy, but to do so four more deputies are needed,  for the constitution stipulates that a legislative initiative  must have five deputies. If five deputies submit a proposed law,  then the Saeima reviews it.    But regarding the response and recall of conflicting and  actual life processes, that is a very complicated question.  Legislators are criticized because we do not have laws  appropriate to one or another of life's fields and regarding  various economic or social processes, which would advance  reforms. And this criticism has some basis. Occasionally it does  indeed sound very simplistic, as if by adopting a few laws or  amendments all problems could be resolved.    In fact things in essence are that now all areas of life,  all  economic and social processes must be reformed and that must all  be reflected in laws. And here we must have whole legislative  blocs. Of course, to work out laws conceptually and then to  polish them juridically requires a large and vast job. We are,  unfortunately, missing a professional apparatus of clerks as  foreign parliaments have, who have worked for many years and  have an accepted procedure for their competitive placement.    In addition, the situation in Latvia is too complicated to  permit simply adopting all of Europe's best legislation. We,  first of all, must take into account everything that has gone on  until now, Latvia's legislation in the 1920's and 1930's, for  that was the basis for the development of the Latvian state.  Then nationalization. Also the system created in the Soviet  period: Soviet judicial and socialist economic relations. The  results of colonization and occupation. And the current task is  to renew everything at the same time and also to transform based  on the principle of a law-based and democratic state. In  addition there is the property question, relations between  former owners and the current users of property, taking into  account the mass deportations and emigration of the 1940's,  mainly among Latvians, largely reducing it to a national  question.    I sometimes think that if we, with our current legislative  experience only now began to take on reform then indeed.... On  the other hand, how would we have gotten this experience  otherwise?    [Bekeris] Do the mass media--the press, TV, radio--influence  the legislative process? Is such influence even desireable and,  if you acknowledge it, then how does it manifest itself?    [Gorbunovs] Of course the mass media have quite broad  opportunities to influence deputies and that must be done. Often  such influence is indirect, for radio and television do not  literally discuss various amendments or changes in editing laws.  Of course the press, TV and radio influence legislation  conceptually, for every law or amendment to a law is a political  fact, it is an instrument to realize a concrete policy. And in  analyzing specific policies or Saeima faction doctrines,  expressing the arguments "for" or "against," along with that the  press, TV and radio bring pressure on political parties, on  factions, and that is either support or a position of opposition  and, if this position truly is argued, analyzed, then it  definitely influences the legislative process positively.    [Bekeris] How does the "Saeima Mail" function, which  receives  complaints and suggestions from inhabitants? Do the appropriate  [Saeima] commissions have a mutual contact with these  correspondences?    [Gorbunovs] There is a suggestions bureau, a suggestions  commission. These suggestions are analyzed and categorized, and,  of course, the commissions also strive to answer concrete  letters. Suggestions of a general nature are copied and  distributed to all factions. But in our election system and  deputies' responsibilities, the link with voters also has its  problems, for voters vote for parties and it is clear that in a  proportional representation system, from which district each  deputy is elected, but this clarity does not reach beyond  Kurzeme, Vidzeme, Latgale and Zemgale. Deputies in other,  foreign parliaments have already told us that this proportional  system cannot long survive, that it is a transitional period  system and until now it still exists in Italy, but it is now  being fixed there too, for the ideal is that each deputy has an  electoral district. In return for a mixed system, both  majoritarian and proportional, where a deputy is responsible to  his party, he has also an electoral district, in which there is  a direct bond with the voters and responsibility to the voters.  That, of course, is more effective.    About letters. If a letter is written to me personally, then  I also strive to respond to all of those who have written me.  But sometimes these letters are addressed to the Saeima,  including only my surname or post--Saeima Chairman--then I  address them to all factions. Some letters, which are  particularly urgent, we copy and distribute to all deputies,  although they are not addressed to them. In their speeches  deputies often cite voter letters.    [Bekeris] Did the activity of the earlier Supreme Council  disturb the influence of the so-called lobbyists and is  something similar sensed right now?    [Gorbunovs] Lobbyists personally do not come to me, but that  does not mean that deputies do not sense lobbyists. Here we  should analyze what this lobbying is, for I conceive of lobbying  as political pressure, which is brought by one or another social  group in defending its interests, and that is completely  acceptable; without normal lobbying the parliament cannot even  function. But it is very important that deputies see beyond  these interests to the context of the interests of the whole  society, or else he, too, turns into a narrow lobbyist. Since we  have been working for only less than a year, it seems to me that  deputies have not yet become connected to narrow lobbying. It  does show up occasionally, but it has not been so awful. When  the Supreme Council completed its work this lobbying was more  pronounced.    [Bekeris] How does the work of the Supreme Council chairman  differ from your current work as Saeima chairman?    [Gorbunovs] My situation has changed significantly. Working  as the Supreme Council chairman I "smoothed out" many things  during sessions, right in the meeting hall. Now my task is not  to smooth out conflict, but rather to give deputies equal  opportunities so that they can always depend on the fact that  their wishes will be correctly and consistently observed. If  some deputy today is refused on some procedural question, then  he knows that his political oppenent will be just as correctly  refused next time, and that is one of the chief fundamental  rules for the normal functioning of the parliament. As soon as  deputies feel injustice, unfruitful discussions of procedure  begin. In terms of procedural issues the Saeima chairman adopts  very few rules by himself.    In return his rights as a deputy do not become limited. He  may participate in debates, vote, work as a member of a Saeima  commission, and also he may stand in for the President in the  absence of the President.    As a member of the team, feeling complete responsibility for  the work of "Latvia's Way," [LW] I actively work in the "LW"  faction and coalition, and also on the Economic Commission.  Leading plenary sessions requires me to be objective and  tolerant toward all viewpoints, but after surviving a few  faction and commission sessions I yielded to subjective emotions.    [Bekeris] Do you see a possibility that the governing  coalition will be able to draw in other Saeima factions and  deputies?    [Gorbunovs] First, people will want to evaluate the results  of what we are doing and how we are doing it in a longer time  frame. Another thing, that there must be a mutual connection  between the voters and responsibility. That must happen through  party members, but I think in any event that forced party  development in the near term will not happen, not within  "Latvia's Way," nor anywhere else.    Are we thinking about expanding the political union? It is  doubtful that that would happen in the near term. "Latvia's Way"  is open to political dialogue on this question. But two  conditions must be taken into account here. First, that other  parties would gladly find themselves in opposition for a while  and not connect themselves with the governing coalition, for  that would also mean accepting responsibility for mistakes and  for the fact that much has not yet been achieved. Second, the  minority government formed by "Latvia's Way" and the Agrarian  Union, not having achieved a majority in the parliament, causes  it to work very carefully and to keep together, accepting full  responsibility, and that, perhaps, is also a basis for a certain  stability. Whereas establishing a new union, expanding the  existing one, or establishing a new coalition on a platform in  which only individual program points are mutual, that would an  unstable thing and that should not be done.    Whether that is normal or a coincidence, "Latvia's Way" and  the Agrarian Union is developing a coalition whose place is in  the center and to the right of center. The opposition is found  on both the right and left wings. That is why it is practically  not possible to develop a coalition government. That is not  something for which blame should be assigned or which is to be  wondered about. That would more readily look like  irresponsibility or adventurism. That, it seems to me,  opposition factions also understand, and--my conclusion may be  in conflict with other conclusions expressed--that causes  opposition factions also to be constructive, both in introducing  legislation and various amendments and changes to laws, and in  actively participating in discussions of proposed laws submitted  by the government. That, in turn, sometimes causes indignation  within the governing coalition, as they try simultaneously to  maintain the capacity to do battle.    If there is no internal division within the faction, then,  it  seems to me, two scenarios are possible: Either "Latvia's Way"  and the Agrarian Union of Latvia will honestly work to the end,  together drinking the bitter herb, or there will be an early  election for the Saeima.</p>

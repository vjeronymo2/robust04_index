			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Uncertainty underpins dollar THE DOLLAR gradually moved higher against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday as dealers remained uncertain how the political crisis in Russia was playing itself out, writes James Blitz. When London trading opened, dealers remained calm about the situation and the dollar hovered around the DM1.6275 level. But there were reports at about lunchtime in London that telephones in the Russian Defence Ministry were not being answered. This caused a general air of panic in the market, and the dollar moved up to DM1.6375, benefiting, as usual, from its traditional status of a safe haven in times of trouble. In the afternoon, the dollar moved higher in two phases. First, the latest weekly US unemployment figures were issued, showing a rise of 11,000. These underlined fears about the state of the US economy. The final push up to the day's peak of DM1.6475 was not triggered by specific news. Instead, one dealer said hedge fund managers in New York had been surprised by the lack of news in Moscow towards the end of the day and, with uncertainties still remaining, they decided to play safe and go long of the US currency. The dollar failed to move any higher, partly because DM1.6475 is an important chart point and also established the high for the dollar in the immediate aftermath of news that President Yeltsin had imposed direct rule. It later eased back to close at DM1.6450, after a previous DM1.6285, and in New York it ended at DM1.6435. In the immediate future the dollar could remain well underpinned. Some dealers are expecting strong durable goods orders figures for August in the US today, with the consensus forecast looking for a monthly rise of 1 1/2 per cent. The absence of any resolution to the crisis in Moscow could underpin the dollar further out as well. Mr Yeltsin plans parliamentary elections later this year and presi-dential elections in June 1994. In the interim, the market is bound to be panicked by the ebb and flow of events. The D-Mark was weaker across the board, on a day which also saw a fall in German government bond prices. Again, the market's perception was that Germany was the country with most at risk in the Russian crisis, because of Bonn's close ties with the region. Against the French franc, the D-Mark closed at FFr3.481 from a previous FFr3.483. Sterling performed well against the D-Mark for most of the day, but lost some of its gain before the close. The pound finished at DM2.4775, up from a previous DM2.4750. Once again, the yen was sidelined by the Russian crisis, not least because the Japanese market was on holiday on Thursday. There was buying of yen for D-Marks in Europe and this helped the Japanese unit to appreciate against the dollar, closing at Y106.00 from a previous Y106.45.</p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Monday Interview: Love in the laboratory: Professor William Stewart, chief scientific adviser to the Cabinet Office, talks to Clive Cookson Scientists have changed their minds about the UK government more comprehensively than has any other group in British society since the general election. During the election campaign many senior scientists called for a new government that would end years of neglect and underfunding of research; not one spoke up for the Conservatives. Three months later, the loathing in the laboratories is turning into something approaching love. Pressure groups such as Save British Science have stopped moaning and are now singing a chorus of praise for the government. The man they credit with responsibility for this revival of scientific morale is Professor William Stewart, a 57-year-old Scottish botanist, whose official job title is chief scientific adviser, Cabinet Office. Prof Stewart came to London in 1988 to run the Agricultural and Food Research Council. Lady Thatcher (then Mrs Thatcher) appointed him to succeed Sir John Fairclough as the government's chief scientist shortly before she resigned as prime minister in 1990. But he made little impact until last April. Then, in the reshuffle after the election, Mr Major unexpectedly gave the laboratory lobbyists what they had been clamouring for, and Labour had promised: cabinet status for science for the first time since 1964. The Pounds 1.1bn-a-year budget for basic research was detached from the Department of Education and Science, and transferred to a new Office of Science and Technology (OST) under a senior cabinet minister, Mr William Waldegrave. He is also responsible for co-ordinating science and technology policy across other government departments, including defence and industry. Although Mr Waldegrave's remit as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster also includes the Citizen's Charter initiative for improving public services, he has made it clear that science will be a priority. Prof Stewart drew up the OST blueprint before the election, as an option for the incoming government whatever its political complexion. As a loyal civil servant, he declines to take the credit. But its creation leaves him, as head of OST, much better placed to fight for science and technology in government. He is potentially the most powerful chief scientist since Sir Solly Zuckerman (another biologist) teamed up with Mr Harold Wilson in 1964. The fundamental reason for the reorganisation, Prof Stewart says, 'is that the prime minister had a conviction that science and technology would be important to us if we were going to continue as a strong Group of Seven nation. Japan sees science and technology as the dynamo of the economy; the US sees a world economy transformed by developments in science and technology.' A subsidiary reason was to give the UK government someone with enough international status to negotiate effectively with such powerful research ministers as Germany's Mr Heinz Riesenhuber and France's Mr Hubert Curien. Junior ministers in the DES were no match for them, but Mr Waldegrave is - both through his close relations with Mr Major and through his formidable intellect. Mr Waldegrave may be a classicist by academic background, but Prof Stewart says he is already making his mark as chairman of the EC research council. On the chief scientist's advice, Mr Waldegrave is pushing the EC to devote more resources to 'generic technologies which have a broad range of applications across many industrial sectors' and less to 'the old policy of industrial R&amp;D subsidy'. In practice this might mean, for example, supporting the development of a 'clean engine', which would have application in an aircraft, a car or a lawnmower, rather than a 'clean car', which would amount to a disguised subsidy to European motor manufacturers. The creation of the OST instantly raised the profile of science in Parliament. The Commons set up a Science and Technology Committee for the first time, chaired by Sir Giles Shaw. And from next year the two houses will jointly fund a Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, to provide technical assessments for MPs and peers on issues ranging from global warming to disposing of nuclear weapons and patenting new forms of life. But the OST could be the first step in a more radical reorganisation of research in the UK. Prof Stewart is inviting scientists to put forward suggestions for a white paper on science and technology, which the government will issue early next year. It will cover every aspect of the way the UK organises, funds and exploits its science. Mr Waldegrave and Prof Stewart say they have open minds about what direction to take; they are willing to consider changes that would be - at least in UK terms - quite revolutionary. One possibility is to draw up for the first time a national plan for science, setting priorities and targets for funding in different areas. 'Do we need some broad objective-setting as the Japanese, US, Germans, French and others are doing, or do we leave it all to a bottom-up approach?' Prof Stewart asks. For most laboratory scientists, however, the biggest issue is not how research is organised but how much money is available for it. 'In general our funding levels compare reasonably well with our G7 competitors,' Prof Stewart claims. 'But before we get complacent, it is important to note that UK expenditure on R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP has been slipping significantly over the last decade in both civil and defence areas. Because the international trend on R&amp;D expenditure as a percentage of GDP has been generally upwards, the downward trend in the UK causes concern.' Last year Prof Stewart worked with the Treasury during the annual public expenditure survey to make sure science and technology spending in all departments was assessed as a whole - the first time the government's chief scientist had been involved in the process. The exercise produced real growth in civil R&amp;D this year and plans for further modest growth up to 1994-95. But that was in the run-up to an election. The real test of Prof Stewart's new clout in the Treasury will come during this year's public expenditure negotiations. 'The OST could not have been set up at a worse time as far as public expenditure is concerned,' he says. He will fight to protect the planned growth, both because research needs more money and because 'the system needs stability so that the science and technology community can look ahead without the episodic changes in funding which caused problems in bygone years'. Ironically, the non-graduate Mr Major is turning out to be far more sympathetic to science than Mrs Thatcher, who started began her career in chemistry research. Because he believes science is important - socially, culturally, economically and environmentally - but has no scientific background, he is in some ways an ideal prime minister from the point of view of an adviser. Prof Stewart keeps in touch with feelings at the laboratory bench by inviting a group of half a dozen researchers, including young scientists, to his room in the ancient Palace of Whitehall every fortnight or so. Sitting in the deep, red-leather armchairs, they talk 'really frankly' about the issues in their field. The office looks typical of a senior civil servant of the old school, apart from a computer beside the desk, but its occupant sounds quite different. Prof Stewart retains his childhood accent from the whisky isle of Islay, off the west coast of Scotland, where he grew up - pepped up with a dash of Glasgow (where he did both undergraduate and postgraduate studies) and Dundee (where he built up the biology department over a period of 20 years from virtually nothing into one of the strongest in the UK). Now he retreats when he can to somewhere even more remote from London: a croft inherited from his wife's family on the island of Barra in the Outer Hebrides. The last prominent person in government who portrayed himself as a Scottish crofter was Mr Harold Macmillan. The difference is that in Prof Stewart's case the claim is genuine. And whereas the Macmillan era 30 years ago can be seen in retrospect as the start of a decline in the international position of British science and technology, the Stewart years just might herald a revival.
